R v David Sellu 

 

5 November 2013  

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Nicol 

 
 

 
 

You may remain seated for the time being. 
 
David Sellu the jury have found you guilty of the manslaughter of Jim Hughes because of 
gross negligence while he was in your care and you were his consultant surgeon. 
 
Between the time that you first saw him, just after 9.0pm on the evening of 11th February 
2010 and the time that he came into the operating theatre just after 10.00pm the 
following day, there were numerous occasions when your care fell far below that which 
could reasonably be expected of a consultant colorectal surgeon. Like the jury, I have 
heard all the evidence, including your own testimony. The jury’s verdict means that, 
taken as a whole your conduct was grossly negligent. It would be open to me to 
distinguish between the different matters on which the Crown relied, as long as my 
overall conclusion was consistent with the verdict of the jury.  
 
I have reflected on one matter in particular: whether you did instruct the Resident 
Medical Officer to prescribe antibiotics for Mr Hughes. You and the RMO gave 
conflicting evidence on that matter. On the expert evidence I have heard, it would have 
been an obvious step to take. But as the prosecution have commented, it is not a step to 
which you referred in your first witness statement for the coroner, made by you about 3 
weeks after the death of Mr Hughes. To the internal investigation set up under Professor 
Empey a short time later, you said you had instructed the RMO to start antibiotics and 
then, when you said you spoke to him later that night, to continue with the antibiotics. 
That is different to the account which you gave to the jury. Although you did make a 
record of other elements of your care plan for Mr Hughes in your medical notes, there is 
no reference to antibiotics. Overall, for whatever reason, I am sure that you omitted to 
give instructions to the RMO at any stage to prescribe antibiotics for Mr Hughes. 
 
That was but one of a whole series of omissions in your care of Mr Hughes. On 11th 
February you did identify the possibility of free gas in Mr Hughes’ abdomen from the X 
rays. You are not a radiologist and your uncertainty on this matter was no fault. 
However, as Mr Kelly, the expert surgeon called by the Crown, put it whether there was 
free gas or not really mattered. The Clementine Churchill Hospital had a radiologist on 
call who could and would have given you a definitive answer. You did not take that step.
--------
I have said you did not instruct the RMO to start antibiotics on the Thursday night, but, 
even if you had, the failure to record this in the medical notes also really mattered. It 
meant that the nursing staff were not alerted to the need for Mr Hughes to have this 
important part of his treatment. 
 
You wanted a CT scan of Mr Hughes’ abdomen. That was not unreasonable, but you did 
not make use of the facility, which was also available at the hospital, to have a scan like 
this done that same night.  Instead you instructed it to be done the following morning 
with a predictable delay of about 12 hours. On the expert evidence called by the Crown 
which the jury must have accepted, that was simply far too laid back for someone with a 
suspected perforated bowel. 
 
The following day you said that you visited Mr Hughes. You made no record of that visit 
and, if it happened at all, you were, as you put it in evidence, in a rush because you had 
another patient who was undergoing a pre-booked procedure. You did not speak to any 
of the nurses, the RMO or anyone else who had been caring for Mr Hughes during the 
night. I am sure that there was not the careful assessment of your patient which you were 
required to give him. There was then further delay in chasing up the CT scan and 
arranging an operation once the scan confirmed that Mr Hughes’ illness was due to a 
perforated bowel.  
 
In summary, I am satisfied that the Crown has proved to the necessary standard, each of 
the aspects of gross negligence which they alleged. 
 
Even if you had acted more speedily, there was a chance that Mr Hughes would have 
died anyway. There is always such a risk with major abdominal surgery of the kind which 
he needed. But the chance would have been very, very much smaller if you had acted as a 
reasonable surgeon would have done on the Thursday night. The risks would have 
increased if the operation had not taken place until Friday morning and would have got 
progressively larger as the day went on, but at each stage the chances of his survival 
would still have been better than when he finally did get to the operating theatre late in 
the evening of Friday 12th February.  
 
All of this means that this was not a single isolated act of negligence. There were several. 
Nor were they committed in the pressured circumstances of an acute NHS hospital 
where the stress of dealing with very many patients in an emergency condition can be 
particularly challenging. You have observed, without seeking to cast blame elsewhere, 
that others caring for Mr Hughes that others in the hospital may have missed 
opportunities to help Mr Hughes or notice that he was deteriorating. But you were his 
consultant surgeon. It was you who was responsible for determining his treatment. It is 
your several failures in that regard which amounted to gross negligence. I am afraid that 
it means your culpability is high. 
 
And that negligence contributed significantly to the death of Mr Hughes. You have heard 
this afternoon the grief and anguish that has caused the members of his family. He was a 
kind, generous, hard-working and energetic man. His death has left a void for his 
immediate and extended family and others who knew him.
--------
You are 66 and a man without previous convictions or cautions and, of course, I take 
that into account. 
 
I have heard the evidence of Dr Whitehead who praised your ability and dedication as a 
surgeon. I have read the references from your many colleagues in the NHS and private 
practice who speak equally highly of your skill and care for patients. This case is 
completely at odds with that picture. There is no explanation as to why it should have 
been so.  
 
Your conviction will, no doubt, bring your career to a halt. It will have been a tragedy for 
you and your family. Surgeons sometimes have the opportunity to save lives. I have 
heard that you sometimes saved lives. But their decisions or defaults can also have the 
opposite effect. Sadly, that was the case with Mr Hughes. 
 
I have considered the cases and statutory provisions which the prosecution have drawn 
to my attention. I accept that in your case there was no alteration of medical records 
which would have been a significantly aggravating factor. However, in your witness 
statements for the coroner and your answers to Professor Empey’s investigation you 
made numerous errors. All of them put you in a better light. It is true, as your counsel 
has said that you were charged with no offence in relation to these matters and the jury 
has acquitted you of count 2 on the indictment. However, at the very least they show a 
lack of candour with those responsible for investigating Mr Hughes’ death. 
 
Your counsel realistically accepts that the only sentence I can pass is one of custody. He 
has asked that I suspend the sentence. He says, rightly that you will be no danger to the 
public or patients because you will not practice again. However, I am afraid that in all the 
circumstances I do not consider that would be right.  
 
The sentence will be the shortest which is appropriate. You will serve half. You will then 
be released on licence, but may be recalled if you offend again or otherwise breach the 
terms of your licence.

JUDGMENT: ABUSE OF PROCESS 
 

 

 

 

 

Introduction

For obvious reasons, I make an order under s.4(2) of the Contempt of Court 
 
Act 1981 prohibiting the reporting of this judgment until further order.1

The defendant, who is now aged 62 (and ordinarily resident in the Republic of 
 
Ireland) has pleaded not guilty to five charges – four of murder and one of 
 
doing an act with intent to cause an explosion.  The alleged offences arise out 
 
 
of the notorious bombing carried out by the Irish Republican Army (“IRA”) in 
 
 
Hyde Park, London on the morning of Tuesday 20 July 1982.  A Remote 
 
Control Improvised Explosive Device which contained about 20‐25 pounds of 
 
commercial high explosive with wire nails as shrapnel and was hidden in the 
 
boot of a blue Morris Marina car, registration LMD 657P, which was parked in 
 
 
South Carriage Drive, was detonated as the Guard (consisting of sixteen 
 
members of The Blues & Royals Regiment of the Household Cavalry and their 
 
 
horses, accompanied by two mounted police officers) was passing en route 
 
from Knightsbridge Barracks to Horse Guards for the Changing of the Guard. 
  
Four of the Guard were murdered – Lieutenant Anthony Daly, who was aged 
 
23, and Trooper Simon Tipper, who was aged 19, died at the scene (Counts 1 
 
& 2); Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, who was aged 19, died the following day 
 
(Count 3); and Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, who was aged 
 
 
36, died two days after that (Count 4). A total of 31 other people were 
 
injured (a number of them seriously) and 7 horses were destroyed.

--------
On the defendant’s behalf it is submitted that I should stay the prosecution 
 
 
as being an abuse of process.  The submission is advanced on four grounds, 
 
  
namely (in broad outline) that:

A fair trial is no longer possible given the passage of more than thirty 
 
years since the event, the fact that a number of significant witnesses 
 
are now dead, the fact that key exhibits are irretrievably lost, and the 
 
existence of further trial prejudice. 
 
It would be unfair for the defendant to be tried in the light of the 
 
expectation created by governmental statements that prosecutions 
 
would not be pursued in respect of those who would otherwise 
 
qualify for early release (as, it is common ground, the defendant did 
 
and does) under the scheme provided (in accordance with the Good 
 
Friday Agreement) by the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (“the 
 
1998 Act”). 
 
It would be unfair for the defendant to be tried because on 20 July 
 
 
2007 [25 years to the day after the bombing and under an 
 
administrative scheme in relation to so‐called “on the runs” (“OTRs”) 
 
which was intended to advance the peace process in Northern 
 
Ireland] he was given a clear written assurance on behalf of the 
 
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Attorney General  that 
 
there was no outstanding direction for prosecution in Northern 
 
Ireland in relation to him, that there were no warrants in existence, 
 
that he was not wanted in Northern Ireland for arrest, questioning 
 
and charge by the police, and that the Police Service of Northern 
 
Ireland (“PSNI”) were not aware of any interest in him by any other 
 
police force in the United Kingdom ‐ whereas in reality the PSNI were 
 
 
aware, at the time that the letter was given to him, that he was 
 
wanted by the Metropolitan Police in relation to the Hyde Park 
 
bombing (and had been almost continually since May 1983), and the 
 
PSNI had also appreciated, after the letter had been given to him, that 
 
it was misleading in that regard, but did nothing to correct the 
 
 
situation; and because thereafter, in reliance upon the letter and to 
 
his eventual detriment, the defendant (who is a proven strong 
 
supporter of the peace process) travelled on a number of occasions to 
 
Northern Ireland and the mainland ‐ including the final such occasion 
 
when, on 19 May 2013, he was arrested at Gatwick Airport en route 
 
to Greece and was thereafter charged with the instant offences. 
 
Even if the above‐mentioned grounds do not in themselves justify a 
 
 
stay, their cumulative effect (particularly given the enormous and 
 
unjustifiable delay and the existence of the sort of “sense of security 
 
from prosecution” which would act as a bar to extradition) requires 
 
 
that the prosecution be stayed.

--------
defendant from the Republic of Ireland in the past explains some of 
 
the delay, it does not impact on the ability of the defendant to receive 
 
a fair trial now. 
 
 
The political process and past governmental commitment not to 
 
pursue prosecutions, underlying the administrative OTR scheme 
 
under which the 20 July 2007 letter was transmitted to the defendant, 
 
should not impact upon an independent prosecutorial decision to 
 
 
prosecute. 
 
In any event, the 20 July 2007 letter was the product of error during 
 
the PSNI’s Operation Rapid as opposed to any act of bad faith; it did 
 
not constitute an unequivocal assurance that the defendant would 
 
not, or would never be, prosecuted on the mainland for any terrorist 
 
offences committed before the Good Friday Agreement; the terms of 
 
the letter do not, and were never intended to, amount to an amnesty 
 
for the recipient; and the defendant has not acted on any such 
 
assurance to his detriment. 
 
There is no basis in law for ruling that the delay coupled with the 
 
 
letter of 20 July 2007 has engendered a “false sense of security” in the 
 
 
 
defendant such that the court should hold it an abuse of process to 
 
allow the prosecution to proceed.

The abuse of process argument was initially due to begin on 14 January 2014 
 
but, at the request of the prosecution, was put back until 17 January 2014 in 
 
order to enable the Attorney General to consider and approve the 
 
prosecution’s Skeleton Argument before it was served. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It had been recognised from an early stage in the overall proceedings that in 
 
consequence of the provisions of s.29(1C) of the Criminal Procedure and 
 
Investigations Act 1996 a preparatory hearing had to be held. At the outset of 
 
 
the hearing on 17 January 2014 the parties indicated that they were agreed 
 
that no witnesses would be called by either side and that I should decide any 
 
disputed factual issues (of which there were relatively few) on the papers. 
  

 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

It became apparent at an early stage in the abuse hearings that there had 
 
been no investigation, as such, instituted by the prosecution into the precise 
 
circumstances in which the letter dated 20 July 2007 had come into being, 
 
and into why it had not been corrected thereafter.  Rather, in the period 
 
between September 2013 and November 2013, Mr Little had carried out a 
 
 
conventional disclosure exercise at the Crown Prosecution Service, the

Over the weekend of 18‐19 January 2014, at the court’s request, Mr Little re‐
reviewed the materials at the Attorney General’s Office and discovered that a 
 
 
 
relevant letter dated 27 June from the Deputy Director of the PPS to Mr 
 
McGinty at the Attorney General’s Office had been omitted in error from the 
 
files of disclosed documentation. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The hearings continued on 20, 22 and 24 January 2014 ‐ during the course of 
 
which the defendant was arraigned. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Initially, the prosecution sought to argue that whilst it was clear from PSNI 
 
documentation that in April/May 2007 the PSNI had been aware that the 
 
defendant was wanted by the Metropolitan Police in relation to the Hyde 
 
Park bombing, there must have been a failure by the PSNI, in the run up to 
 
the preparation of a vital letter dated 6 June 2007 from ACC Sheridan to the 
 
Director of Public Prosecutions (Northern Ireland) (“DPP(NI)”) (which was the 
 
 
trigger for the eventual letter from the NIO to the defendant dated 20 July 
 
2007) to check the PNC, or its own records, or (in the alternative) that if any 
 
such checks had been made they must have been conducted negligently such 
 
that the fact that the defendant was so wanted was missed. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

In the meanwhile, following comments by the court, Detective Inspector 
 
Corrigan of the PSNI had been tasked by the prosecution to investigate a 
 
chain of emails (primarily between two PSNI officers) in 2008 – which 
 
appeared to indicate that the PSNI had been aware of the fact that the 
 
defendant was wanted by the Metropolitan Police and of the fact that this 
 
 
had not been mentioned in ACC Sheridan’s letter to the DPP(NI) in June 2007, 
 
 
 
but which did not indicate whether any action had been taken in 
 
 
consequence. 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

In a witness statement dated 21 January 2014 DI Corrigan reported that he 
 
had spoken to a number of those involved at the time, that he had 
 
established a sequence of events in 2007, that he had reviewed the relevant 
 
Policy Decision Log Books which demonstrated that it was known by the 
 
PSNI, at the time that the relevant decisions were made in 2007, that the 
 
defendant was wanted by the Metropolitan Police in relation to the Hyde 
 
Park bombing, and that no additional action had been taken in 2008.  In a 
 
 
further witness statement dated 24 January 2014 DI Corrigan produced a 
 
 
copy of the relevant policy decision which had been recorded by Acting DCI 
 
 
Graham in a Policy Decision Log Book on 2 May 2007.  It was that decision 
 
that began the process that led to ACC Sheridan’s letter and the record 
 
referred in terms to the fact that the defendant was wanted by the 
 
Metropolitan Police (in connection with the Hyde Park bombing).

Belfast on 29 January 2014 and carried out a further disclosure exercise – the 
 
results of which are set out in his Further Note on Disclosure dated 30 
 
January 2014. In the result, further documents were disclosed including a 
 
signed copy of the Terms of Reference of Operation Rapid (albeit that other 
 
versions had already been disclosed), additional emails relating to events in 
 
June 2007, and a number of July 2008 emails which were found in the 
 
relevant Policy Decision Log Book of Acting DCI Graham adjacent to the page 
 
 
dealing with the defendant and the Hyde Park Bombing (albeit that they had 
 
 
already been disclosed as part of a longer chain of emails recovered 
 
elsewhere).

In consequence a further hearing was held on 31 January 2014 during the 
 
course of which Mr Little (to whom the court is grateful) gave a verbal report, 
 
and answered a number of questions asked by the court.  Final oral 
 
submissions were then completed – during which it was re‐confirmed that 
 
neither side intended to call any live evidence.  On 2 February 2014, following 
 
an earlier request, the parties provided the court with further submissions in 
 
relation to the alleged breach of promise arising from the letter dated 20 July 
 
2007. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Overview of the background 
 
 
18.	 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The Marina, registration LMD 657P, which was used to carry out the bombing 
 
had been bought a week before, on Tuesday 13 July 1982, at a car auction in 
 
 
Enfield. The purchaser was a man with an Irish accent who had given false 
 
personal details.

The prosecution case is that the involvement of the defendant in the 
 
bombing is proved, in particular, by the combination of:

His conviction (aged 22) in Dublin on 21 May 1974 for membership of 
 
the IRA on 28 February 1974. 
  
The fact that his appearance in 1982 is consistent with photofits 
 
 
and/or artist’s impressions prepared with the assistance of (or in one 
 
 
case recognised by) three witnesses as variously being one of two 
 
men apparently carrying out reconnaissance from a car parked in 
 
South Carriage Drive as the Guard was passing on 30 June and 1 July 
 
1982 (Mark Chrusciel); one of two people seated in the rear of an 
 
orange Ford Cortina to which two other men walked from a Marina 
 
registration “…..65..P” which was then parked in Hertford Road in 
 
North London on 14, or 15 or 16 July 1982 (Robert Day); the driver of 
 
blue car registration “LM…..P” which was seen (and the driver spoken 
 
to by the witness) in Edgware Road on the morning of Friday 16 July 
 
1982 (Phyllis McGowan). 
 
The finding of three of his fingerprints on the ticket that was 
 
dispensed when the Marina was driven into the NCP car park in 
 
Portman Square at 2.14pm on Saturday17 July 1982 and parked there,

and which was surrendered when the Marina was driven out of that 
 
car park at 6.14pm on Sunday 18 July 1982. 
 
The finding of two of his fingerprints on the ticket that was dispensed 
 
 
when the Marina was driven into the NCP car park at the Royal 
 
Garden Hotel in Kensington at 6.39pm on Sunday 18 July 1982 and 
 
 
parked there, and which was surrendered when the Marina was 
 
driven out of that car park at 6.51am on Tuesday 20 July 1982 (just 
 
under four hours before the bombing). 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

It appears that the defendant’s involvement was first suspected in 
 
consequence of a match that was made on 13 August 1982 between a 
 
fingerprint found on the Royal Garden Hotel NCP ticket and a set of the 
 
defendant’s fingerprints that had been taken by the Garda in the Republic of 
 
Ireland on 7 July 1980 and which had thereafter been informally supplied 
 
(under an operational arrangement) to the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the 
 
 
Metropolitan Police.  Likewise a Garda photograph of the defendant was 
 
obtained from a “delicate source” and was believed to match the witness 
 
Mark Chrusciel’s photofit / artist’s impression.  Given that any formal use of 
 
 
the photograph was believed to risk compromising the source who had 
 
provided it, an artist’s impression was made of the defendant on 28 August 
 
1982.

The circulation by the Metropolitan Police to the press, in September 
 
1982, of what was said to be an artist’s impression of a suspect seen 
 
by witnesses (but was, in fact, the artist’s impression of the defendant 
 
referred to immediately above). 
 
The identification by the witness Day (above) of that artist’s 
 
 
impression as being of the man that he had seen. 
 
The identification, by a Garda officer on a visit to New Scotland Yard 
 
 
on 30 January 1983, of the defendant as being the person depicted in 
 
 
the same artist’s impression. 
 
The provision of information to the press by the Metropolitan Police 
 
 
in May 1983 that the defendant was wanted for the bombing, and 
 
providing the press (again) with the artist’s impression (now on a 
 
wanted poster). 
 
The circulation on the Police National Computer (“PNC”) on 29 May 
 
 
 
1983 of the fact that the defendant was wanted by the Metropolitan 
 
 
Police for conspiracy to murder on 20 July 1982. 
 
The publication in the Sunday Times on 21 October 1984 of a 
 
photograph of the defendant and allegations including the fact that 
 
he was wanted for the bombing; that he was at the top of Scotland 
 
Yard’s Most‐Wanted list; that Scotland Yard believed that, after two 
 
years of investigation, it had amassed enough evidence to extradite 
 
him; that attempts to do so would soon begin; that he bore a close 
 
resemblance to one of the witness’s photofits; and that he had 
 
claimed never to have left the Irish Republic.

The publication of further articles in the Sunday Times in June 1985, 
 
March 1986 and October 1987 ‐ each of which asserted that the 
 
defendant was still wanted for the bombing. 
 
The consideration, by the authorities in this country, on a number of 
 
 
 
occasions, of the chances of a successful extradition request being 
 
made to the Republic of Ireland, or of a successful request being 
 
made to the Irish Legal Authorities for proceedings to be commenced 
 
against the defendant there under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 
 
1976. 
  
The resolution of concerns (caused by the absence of evidence from 
 
 
two NCP employees) as to the admissibility of the relevant NCP 
 
tickets, and concerns as to the admissibility of the fingerprint matches 
 
(caused by the absence of formal proof of the defendant’s 
 
fingerprints). 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  
 
 

 
On 21 November 1989 the then Attorney General (Sir Patrick Mayhew QC 
 
MP) held a meeting in relation to the defendant’s case.  The meeting was 
 
attended by (among others) the then Solicitor General, counsel, the CPS and 
 
 
the Metropolitan Police.  It was recognised that (under the then current 
 
legislation in relation to business records) the parking tickets were likely to be 
 
 
admissible; that the fingerprint evidence existed, but that to ask a jury to 
 
infer criminal involvement (rather than simply having moved the car two days 
 
 
before it was used as a car bomb) “might be… to take too great a leap of faith 
 
 
in the post Guildford and Woolwich climate”; and that the lapse of time (then 
 
over 7 years) need not be fatal to an application for the defendant’s return 
 
from the Republic of Ireland, but none the less was quite likely to be so. 
   
Ultimately the Attorney General concluded, and everyone else at the meeting 
 
agreed, that the case was not one in which it would be appropriate to seek 
 
extradition.  Given the limited inferences that it was believed could fairly be 
 
drawn from the fingerprint evidence, the Law Officers agreed that “a marker 
 
should be put down to ensure that the case was properly reviewed before 
 
 
any decision was taken to prosecute Downey if he should enter the 
 
 
jurisdiction voluntarily…”. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

In June 1991 the defendant’s case was reviewed by the Metropolitan Police, 
 
and the conclusion reached that a request for extradition “would not meet 
 
with approval at this particular time” and that the case would be “put away 
 
until further evidence is forthcoming and a more suitable political climate for 
 
extradition requests prevail”. In September 1993 it was recorded by the 
 
Metropolitan Police that “the subject is not extraditable but is obviously 
 
arrestable should he be detained within the UK jurisdiction…there are 
 
enormous difficulties with the NCP exhibits and continuity in this case and 
 
 
the identification evidence of the Garda officer must be questionable.  I 
    
strongly suspect that the CPS would be less than enthusiastic to pursue this 
 
 
to prosecution but I believe the circulation should remain”.

The fact that the defendant was wanted by the Metropolitan Police for 
 
conspiracy to murder on 20 July 1982 remained on the PNC until 29 August 
 
1994, when it was removed in error.  The error was, however, realised and 
 
on 31 October 1994 the defendant was re‐circulated on the PNC as being 
 
wanted by the Metropolitan Police for conspiracy to murder on 20 July 1982. 
  
It was that re‐circulation which was still on the PNC when the defendant 
 
arrived at Gatwick Airport on 19 May 2013, and which resulted in his arrest. 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  
 

In the meanwhile, however, momentous events had been taking place in 
 
Northern Ireland.  They resulted, on 10 April 1998, in the signing of the Good 
 
Friday Agreement – which involved a multi‐party agreement by the majority 
 
of Northern Ireland’s political parties and an international agreement 
 
between the British and Irish Governments.  That was followed by Referenda 
 
in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that approved the Good 
 
Friday Agreement; the coming into force on 28 July 1998 of the 1998 Act; and 
 
 
the coming into force of the Good Friday Agreement itself on 2 December

the brutal nature of terrorist crime), but provided a framework, in 
 
accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, for the early release of serving 
 
 
prisoners. It was designed to ensure (subject to certain safeguards for the 
 
 
 
protection of the public) that any qualifying prisoners who remained in 
 
 
custody two years after the commencement of the scheme would be 
 
released at that point.  In R v SSHD [1999] NIQB 68 Girvan J (as he then was) 
 
concluded that the 1998 Act applied to all proceedings and sentences 
 
imposed throughout the UK.  By the end of July 2000 (two years after the 
 
 
1998 Act came into force) no qualifying prisoners affiliated to the IRA, whose 
 
 
charges were the result of IRA actions prior to the Good Friday Agreement, 
 
remained in prison in Northern Ireland, England or the Republic of Ireland 
 
(where equivalent arrangements had been put in place). 
   

 
   
 
  
 

 
   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

The Good Friday Agreement did not, however, deal with those who were 
 
suspected of (but not charged with) relevant offences prior to the Good 
 
Friday Agreement, or who had been charged with such offences but had 
 
 
thereafter escaped, or who had been convicted of such offences and 
 
thereafter escaped. A number were the subject of extradition proceedings. 
  
They became known collectively as “on the runs” or (as indicated above) 
 
“OTRs”. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A second phase of negotiations began in July 1998. It was during those 
 
negotiations that the position of the OTRs was addressed. Sinn Fein argued, 
 
inter alia, that given the fact that many of the cases were very old, and given 
 
the introduction of the early release scheme by the 1998 Act, the position of 
 
the OTRs was anomalous.  The more so, it was said, as a number of the OTRs 
 
were strong supporters of the Good Friday Agreement, whose presence in 
 
Northern Ireland, free from the risk of arrest, would further the peace

process. Thus Sinn Fein wanted the Government to find a way to enable OTRs 
 
to return to, or to go to, Northern Ireland free from the risk of arrest / 
   
prosecution (including, where necessary, the dropping of outstanding 
 
extradition requests), and free from any adverse consequence flowing from 
 
arrest.  Sinn Fein made clear that it regarded a successful outcome in relation 
 
to OTRs as being of critical importance to the eventual success of the Good 
 
Friday Agreement.  Sinn Fein’s position was broadly supported by the Irish 
 
Government.

sympathetic to Sinn Fein’s arguments in relation to OTRs, it was recognised 
 
that there were considerable problems in achieving a solution.  Legislation 
 
(whether by way of amnesty or otherwise) was generally recognised to be 
 
the best way ahead, but also to involve significant political problems making 
 
enactment very difficult.  Other solutions, for example a review of each 
 
individual’s case to check whether he/she was (still) wanted, if so whether 
 
the evidential test for prosecution was met and, if so, whether the public 
 
interest test was also met, were also recognised to give rise to potentially 
 
difficult political, legal and logistical problems.

In April 1999, in the early stages of discussions about the issue, Sinn Fein 
 
raised the question with the Government of whether a particular individual 
 
who had successfully resisted extradition, but who held an important role 
 
within Sinn Fein and was active in pressing forward the peace process, could 
 
 
be allowed to return to Belfast.  This was referred to in a letter dated 5 
 
 
November 1999 from the Prime Minister, Tony Blair to the President of Sinn 
 
 
 
Fein, Gerry Adams.  The Prime Minister underlined that the question of 
 
 
whether to pursue prosecutions was a matter for the DPP(NI) and the 
 
Attorney General who, constitutionally, acted independently of government, 
 
but that the Attorney General (by then Lord Williams QC) had indicated that 
 
he wished to use the discretion that he had to review, without commitment, 
 
whether the public interest still required a prosecution in such cases. 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
  
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

In the period between February and May 2000 the Northern Ireland 
 
Assembly was suspended.  On 18 April 2000 and 2 May 2000, there were 
 
 
meetings among Government officials in relation to the OTR issue. At that 
 
stage the Royal Ulster Constabulary (“RUC”) believed that there were about 
 
200 OTRs. The Minutes of the second meeting recorded that: “The meeting 
 
agreed that the following way forward should be given further consideration. 
  
That there should be a public statement made, possibly by written PQ, that 
 
the Government was prepared to take a systematic and broadly sympathetic 
 
view approach to individuals who had cause, or felt they had cause, to fear 
 
 
arrest on return to Northern Ireland.  Where necessary, cases could be 
 
considered again by the Attorney General / DPP(NI) in the light of evidential 
 
sufficiency and, if necessary, on public interest grounds.  Such a process, even 
 
if not resulting in any great number of cases being dropped would have the 
 
 
benefit of allowing individuals to determine where they stood in relation to

the prosecuting authorities”.  The Minutes went on to record that it had to 
 
be clearly understood that this was a legal process and that cases could not 
 
simply be dropped as part of a wider political process. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Also on 2 May 2000 there were meetings at the Irish Embassy in London 
 
between officials from both governments and Sinn Fein.  The Minutes of 
 
 
those meetings record that Jonathan Powell (the Government’s Chief 
 
Negotiator) indicated that the Government was prepared to operate a similar 
 
 
 
system in relation to OTRs to the one then being operated by the Irish 
 
Government.  He indicated that if the Government was given a list of names, 
 
 
it would clarify with the police and the prosecuting authorities the position of 
 
 
those individuals and, where appropriate, would review whether it remained 
 
in the public interest to pursue a prosecution.  He further indicated that it 
 
was thought that the Government could deal with, say, 12 names in a month 
 
– but no guarantee could be given on the outcome of any review, because 
 
 
that was an independent decision for the prosecuting authorities under the 
 
Attorney General. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

It was against that background that on 5 May 2000, following negotiations at 
 
Hillsborough Castle which resulted in agreement as to a process for 
 
disarmament (and during which private assurances were again given to Sinn 
 
Fein that, one way or another, the OTR issue would be sorted out), and in the 
 
continuing absence of a legislative solution, the Prime Minister wrote to Mr 
 
Adams, as follows:  “I can confirm that, if you can provide details of a number 
 
 
of cases involving people ‘on the run’ we will arrange for them to be 
 
considered by the Attorney General, consulting the Director of Public 
 
Prosecutions and the Police, as appropriate with a view to giving a response 
 
within a month if at all possible. You have also questioned whether it would 
 
be in the public interest to mount any prosecutions after 28 July for offences 
 
alleged to have been committed before the Good Friday Agreement, since by 
 
then all remaining eligible prisoners will have been released, and have raised 
 
other related issues around the 28 July date.  I would be willing to have these 
 
matters considered rapidly, with the aim of deciding the way forward before 
 
28 July.  Prosecution decisions are, of course, a matter for the Director of 
 
Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General…..”. 
  

 
    

 
 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On 19 May 2000 Sinn Fein provided a “preliminary” list of OTRs, which 
 
contained 36 names, to Mr Powell, who passed the list on to the Attorney 
 
General. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On 24 May 2000 the Attorney General wrote to Mr Powell and indicated, 
 
amongst other things, that he had forwarded the list to the DPP(NI) and had 
 
 
asked him to try to locate files for each of the persons named, and that once 
 
files had been located the task of reviewing the evidence would begin 
 
(involving, in most cases, if not all, tracing witnesses and consulting the 
 
police).  The DPP for England & Wales would be forwarded any names of 
 
 
relevance to him. The Attorney General underlined that no decision as to the

sufficiency of the evidence could be reached unless a careful examination of 
 
the evidence was conducted, and continued that: “Insofar as it is compatible 
 
with the proprieties of my position I will do what I can to assist. But the 
 
integrity of the criminal justice system is a fragile thing and in reaching any 
 
 
decision as to prosecution, acting outside Government as I do, I must not act 
 
for reasons of political convenience – however desirable any immediate 
 
effect may be.  My decision has to be justifiable in terms of the test for 
 
prosecution that applies to every case, whatever its nature, considered for 
 
 
prosecution. Each decision that is reached in any case is susceptible to 
 
judicial review……so that I can only agree to a decision if I am satisfied that 
 
 
that decision can be justified before the courts.  If the expectation is that the 
 
 
thirty‐ six persons so far named (and that total may rise) should be free to 
 
return to the United Kingdom regardless of the individual circumstances of 
 
their case that can only be achieved by legislative amnesty.  It is not 
 
appropriate for me to consider the thirty‐six cases on public interest grounds 
 
 
at this stage……..I will consider the current evidential sufficiency of each of 
 
the cases and will do so in accordance with the Test for Prosecution.  I will 
 
    
ensure that the process is carried out promptly but I am sure you will 
 
understand that as Attorney General my first responsibility is to ensure the 
 
integrity of the criminal justice system and the propriety of decisions taken”.

On 2 June 2000 the Attorney General wrote to the then Secretary of State for 
 
Northern Ireland (“SSNI”), Peter Mandelson stating: “…..I am seriously 
 
concerned that the exercise that is being undertaken has the capacity of 
 
 
severely undermining confidence in the criminal justice system in Northern 
 
Ireland at this most sensitive of times.  Individual prosecution decisions have 
 
to be justifiable within the framework in which all prosecution decisions are 
 
 
reached and I am not persuaded that some unquantifiable benefit to the 
 
peace process can be a proper basis for a decision based on the public 
 
interest……” 
 

   
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
  

 
 
 

That was followed by further correspondence and meetings (whether 
 
between Ministers or officials) during the course of which the need to 
 
proceed “by the book” was accepted.  It was stressed that the DPP(NI) was 
 
 
the head of an independent prosecuting authority, subject to the 
 
superintendence of the Attorney General who, when considering prosecution 
 
 
matters, acted not as a minister but outside government and independent of 
 
it. 
  
 
In the end, the DPP(NI) decided, and the Attorney General agreed, that the 
 
evidential test was met in relation to the particular individual mentioned in 
 
 
paragraph 30 above, and that the public interest required that there be a 
 
 
prosecution of that individual.

On 15 June 2000 Mr Powell wrote to Mr Kelly enclosing letters signed by him 
 
 
representing decisions by the Attorney General and the Director of Public 
 
Prosecutions for England & Wales.  The letters were in the following terms: 
 
“Following a review of your case by the Director of Public Prosecutions for 
 
England and Wales, he has concluded that on the evidence before him there 
 
is insufficient to afford a realistic prospect of convicting you for any offence 
 
arising out of… You would not, therefore face prosecution for any such 
 
offence should you return to the United Kingdom. That decision is based on 
 
the evidence currently available. Should fresh evidence arise – and any 
 
statement made by you implicating yourself in… may amount to such 
 
evidence – the matter may have to be reconsidered. The Crown Prosecution 
 
Service is nto [sic] aware of any police interest in interviewing you in relation 
 
to any other offence nor of any interest from anotehr [sic] country seeking 
 
extradition. If there were to be other outstanding offences or requests for 
 
extradition these would have to be dealt with in the usual way. 
 
This decision would normally be conveyed to you by the Police or to your 
 
 
Solicitor but as this is not possible the Attorney General has asked that I write 
   
 
 
to you.” 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

In the meanwhile work continued by way of evidential reviews of the cases of 
 
the remainder on the “preliminary” list – plus a handful of others whose 
 
names had also come to light.  It was slow and difficult work.  Sinn Fein 
 
regularly complained about how long it was all taking – see e.g. a letter from 
 
 
Mr Adams dated 14 July 2000. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

  
 
 

A broader solution was however found in relation to those who had escaped 
 
from custody after sentence and who, in view of the provisions of the 1998 
 
Act, would be released within a short time after any return to Northern 
 
Ireland.  On 29 September 2000 the SSNI announced that, following the 
 
release on 28 July 2000 of all remaining qualifying prisoners who had served 
 
at least two years of their sentence, he had concluded that it was no longer 
 
proportionate or in the public interest to seek the extradition of those who, if 
 
 
successfully extradited, would be released immediately under the 1998 Act or 
 
 
would only have minimal periods left to serve in prison.  Such persons, if they 
 
 
returned to Northern Ireland were to be brought within the early release 
 
scheme. Arrangements were made with Sinn Fein to minimise the procedure 
 
involved – with the relevant individual being technically arrested at an hotel 
 
near the border, but not taken into custody (instead they would be issued 
 
with temporary release forms pending their release on licence under the 
 
1998 Act).  However, whether such persons would be prosecuted for any 
 
offence in relation to their escape, or for any other outstanding offence, 
 
remained the subject of individual review. Likewise, the SSNI made clear that 
 
 
any cases involving the extradition of individuals wanted for, or charged with 
 
 
(as opposed to convicted of) terrorist related offences would continue to be 
 
considered on a case by case basis.

By way of example, on 8 November 2000 the Attorney General wrote to the 
 
SSNI concerning decisions by the DPP(NI) in relation to four of those on the 
 
“preliminary” list, indicating in relation to all four that there was no 
 
outstanding direction for prosecution in Northern Ireland; that, apart from 
 
the unexpired portion of their sentences, they were not wanted in Northern 
 
Ireland for arrest, questioning or charge by the police in respect of any other 
 
 
matter; and that the RUC was not aware of any interest from any other police 
 
 
force in the United Kingdom in relation to them. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

In the meanwhile consideration was being given to other potential solutions. 
 
For example, in January 2001, following earlier work in November 2000, Sir 
 
Quentin Thomas produced a report for the Government setting out the 
 
available options in relation to the remaining OTRs, including ‐ continuing the 
 
normal processes of the law; deciding as a matter of policy in the public 
 
interest not to pursue extradition in respect of some or all of those 
 
suspected; providing an automatic amnesty in respect of all relevant 
 
offences; providing a selective amnesty whereby only “deserving” applicants 
 
would benefit; providing a conditional inhibition on prosecutions so that 
 
prosecution in respect of relevant offences would not be possible unless the 
 
 
offender was engaged in terrorism or was a supporter of a specified 
 
organisation; using the Royal Prerogative by way of pre‐conviction pardons; 
 
or legislating to refine the considerations which inform the assessment made 
 
by the prosecuting authorities of the public interest in mounting a 
 
prosecution (although this was not assessed to provide a viable option). Sir 
 
 
Quentin concluded that whilst a conditional prohibition on prosecutions 
 
offered the best combination of political defensibility, acceptability to 
 
Republicans and administrative convenience, an automatic amnesty would 
 
be more straightforward and would minimise the contamination of the 
 
system of justice. 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

However, given the difficulties involved in those solutions, only the review of 
 
 
individual cases by the DPP(NI) under the superintendence of the Attorney 
 
General, and with any necessary investigation being carried out by the RUC, 
 
 
provided a way to make some progress.  The process thus continued.  It 
 
became known as the administrative scheme or process for dealing with 
 
OTRs, and included regular overviews of progress.  Over time, the RUC 
 
became the PSNI and the Office of the DPP(NI) became the PPS. 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

On 19 January 2001 the Prime Minister gave Sinn Fein a written assurance 
 
that: “…The Government recognises the difficulty in respect of those people 
 
against whom there are outstanding prosecutions for offences committed 
 
before 10 April 1998. At present, they face the possibility of extradition or 
 
prosecution even though the offences if proven were committed before the 
 
 
key date for the early release scheme under the GFA.  The Government is 
 
committed to dealing with the difficulty as soon as possible, so that those 
 
who, if they were convicted would be eligible under the early release scheme 
 
are no longer pursued…”.

In a letter dated 23 January 2001 the Attorney General expressed concern 
 
about the making of any statement that implied that Government, rather 
 
than Parliament, would seek to influence or even prevent the prosecution of 
 
individuals ‐ pointing out that not only would that be constitutionally wrong, 
 
but that it would not be possible either – given that neither he nor the 
 
DPP(NI) could be influenced by any such statement of Government intent. He 
 
 
also expressed concern as to the possible use of any such statement in any 
 
abuse of process arguments that might arise at any trial of any individual 
 
covered by the statement. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

On 29 January 2001 the Attorney General wrote to the SSNI stating that 
 
information had come to his attention that one of the four individuals 
 
mentioned in his letter of 8 November 2000 (see para.41 above) was now 
 
 
liable to questioning by the police about involvement in a criminal offence, 
 
and had (it appears) been informed of the position.  The Attorney General 
 
underlined that the remarks in the letter of 8 November 2000 had followed a 
 
standard pattern and referred to the position of each individual as it was 
 
known at the time that the letter was written; that whilst the checks had 
 
been thorough they did not amount to an amnesty, and that if other offences 
 
were discovered, or new evidence was found that linked individuals with 
 
 
offences, or fresh offences were committed, then the individual concerned 
 
 
would face arrest or questioning in the usual way. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
  
 

On 8 March 2001, during crisis talks at Hillsborough Castle, it was publicly 
 
accepted for the first time by all parties, including the Prime Minister and the 
 
 
Taoiseach, that the position of the OTRs was an anomaly and that it would be 
 
 
addressed.  Both Governments accepted that: “In the context of the 
 
agreement of May 2000 being implemented, it would be a natural 
 
development of the [early release] scheme for such prosecutions not to be 
 
 
pursued and would intend as soon as possible thereafter to take such steps 
 
as are necessary in their jurisdictions to resolve this difficulty, so that those 
 
concerned are no longer pursued…..”.  The Attorney General made clear 
 
within Government that legislation was required. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

At a meeting on 12 March 2001 Mr Kelly, on behalf of Sinn Fein, produced a 
 
 
further list of 30 OTRs for consideration, pointed out that new names were 
 
continually emerging, and said that what was required was a system which 
 
would deal with such cases in a proactive manner and push them through to 
 
 
completion.  He pointed out that the Prime Minister had given a commitment 
 
to sort the issue out and that if legislation was necessary it needed to be got 
 
on with. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In mid‐March 2001 the Attorney General suggested to the NIO that a letter to 
 
a particular OTR should include the following paragraph: “On the basis of 
 
 
information currently available, there is no outstanding direction for 
 
prosecution in Northern Ireland, there are no warrants in existence, nor are

you wanted in Northern Ireland for arrest, questioning or charge by the 
 
police.  The RUC are not aware of any interest in you from any other police 
 
force in the United Kingdom.  If any other outstanding offence or offences 
 
came to light, or if any request for extradition were to be received, these 
 
would have to be dealt with in the usual way.”  The Attorney general stressed 
 
that it was essential that that the NIO checked the accuracy of the paragraph, 
 
and that it also seemed sensible for the RUC to be kept informed of any letter 
 
 
that was issued so that the opportunity for confusion to arise as to status was 
 
 
lessened.

In late March 2001 an internal paper set out the procedures involved in the 
 
conduct of the administrative scheme and the difficulties which by then were 
 
besetting the police, the DPP(NI) and the Crown Solicitors (who dealt with 
 
extradition requests) in relation to it.  The difficulties included being provided 
 
with only sketchy details of the individuals; the scale and complexity of the 
 
tasks involved in carrying out intelligence checks on each individual; the scale 
 
and complexity of the tasks involved in the police, the DPP(NI) and the Crown 
 
Solicitors identifying all files held by each in respect of each individual; in the 
 
police carrying out a full evidential review of each live file in relation to each 
 
 
individual – including establishing whether original documentation still 
 
existed (including documentation held by others), whether witnesses 
 
(including military witnesses who had since left the army and returned to live 
 
 
on the mainland) were still available and willing to give evidence; in the 
 
DPP(NI) carrying out an evidential review on foot of any files submitted by 
 
 
the police – with some individual OTRs having a large number of such files; 
 
and in carrying out checks as to whether individuals were wanted by any 
 
 
other police force in the UK, or by any other country – which involved 
 
research of the Police National Database and contact with Interpol. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

At a meeting with the SSNI in May 2001 Mr Adams expressed the view that, 
 
in terms of Republican confidence, it would be better if there was an invisible 
 
process for dealing with OTRs, but accepted that the Government had no 
 
alternative but to legislate on the issue – albeit that such legislation would be 
 
 
extremely difficult to take through Parliament. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

In mid‐2001 six days of further crisis talks were held at Weston Park, 
 
Staffordshire.  It was again acknowledged by all parties, including the Prime 
 
Minister and the Taoiseach, that the position of the OTRs constituted an 
 
anomaly that would be addressed.  Paragraph 20 of the resultant Weston 
 
Park Treaty provided that: 
  
“Both Governments also recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, 
 
with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of 
 
organisations now on cease fire against whom there are outstanding 
 
prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences 
 
committed before 10 April 1998.  Such people would, if convicted, stand to 
 
benefit from the early release scheme.  The Governments accept that it 
 
would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to

By October 2001, Lord Goldsmith QC had become Attorney General, and had 
 
made clear within the Government, among other things, that he would have 
 
very great difficulty in seeing that the public interest would be other than to 
 
 
proceed with prosecutions in cases where there was sufficient evidence of 
 
 
involvement in serious crime; that, in any event, he was only prepared to 
 
consider the public interest on an individual case by case basis, given that a 
 
 
blanket basis would be improper and that it was for Parliament to decide 
 
whether there should be an amnesty; and that (in terms of maintaining 
 
public confidence in the DPP(NI) and in the administration of justice in the 
 
 
longer term) it was of fundamental importance to maintain an impartial 
 
prosecution process which was not influenced by political considerations.  He 
 
doubted, however, that any court would seriously entertain an abuse of 
 
 
process argument based on an expectation said to arise from a statement 
 
 
made by the Prime Minister. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
   
 

By October 2001 a total of just over 100 names had been put forward by Sinn 
 
Fein under the administrative scheme, which continued.  In early November 
 
2001 a further 19 names were provided by Sinn Fein.  By the end of 
 
November 2001 the cases of 41 individuals had been resolved (one way or 
 
 
the other) with 8 more expected to be resolved shortly.  The Royal 
 
Prerogative was used in a small number of cases.  In meetings, Mr Adams and 
 
 
 
Mr Kelly (on behalf of Sinn Fein) expressed frustration as to the length of 
 
time that the administrative scheme was taking.  In the meanwhile, it was 
 
recognised within Government that it would be extremely difficult to ensure 
 
 
the passage of any legislation.

2002, a list of 55 names which included the name of the defendant.  I set out 
    
 
in detail below (starting at paragraph 83) what happened thereafter in 
 
 
relation to the defendant. The list was forwarded by the SSNI to the Attorney 
 
 
General.  In the accompanying letter the SSNI said: “….I would also be 
 
grateful if you could ask the necessary people to look urgently into these new 
 
cases to establish their status in terms of whether they are free to return to 
 
the UK jurisdiction without facing prosecution.”

DPP(NI) explained the difficulties, given the numbers now involved, in coping 
 
with the demands of the administrative scheme.  He indicated that he was 
 
going to take personal control of the process, and that he was going to carry 
 
out the Attorney General’s request that the names be checked to ascertain 
 
their status.  The Note of the meeting recorded that the DPP(NI) 
 
understandably felt that it was important that, before anyone was given the 
 
green light to return to Northern Ireland, he was personally satisfied that all

General.  It was, however, recognised within the NIO that there were 
 
considerable, possibly insuperable, difficulties with each idea and that the 
 
worst outcome would be to let people back who subsequently came to police 
 
attention, and were then arrested for old crimes for which the DPP decided 
 
that there was still sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution. The proposals 
 
included a summary of how the administrative scheme was then working, 
 
and an indication of the standard of research required, and what was 
 
expected of the reviewing PSNI officer.  In short, the names provided by Sinn 
 
 
 
Fein to the NIO were forwarded to the Attorney General, who forwarded 
 
them to the DPP(NI), who then passed on the names to a dedicated team in 
 
 
the PSNI.  That team then carried out checks on their computerised database 
 
(ICIS) and with collators and Special Branch – as well as consulting the PNC 
 
and Interpol to see if an OTR was wanted in the rest of the UK or 
 
internationally, and with the Crown Solicitors in relation to extradition issues. 
  
Where existing evidence included witnesses, they would be tracked down 
 
and their willingness to give evidence checked.  They would also check the 
 
continuing existence or otherwise of exhibits and forensic evidence (including 
 
deciding whether further tests were now available and required).  Where 
 
there was intelligence, a Superintendent would take the decision as to 
 
whether there remained a requirement to interview an individual, and would 
 
 
complete a pro forma accordingly. At the end of all that a full report would 
 
be put before the DPP(NI).  In many cases he would ask for further evidence 
 
to be obtained before making a final decision. The final decision would be 
 
provided to the Attorney General and (through him) to the NIO, who would 
 
then pass it on to Sinn Fein for onward delivery to the relevant individual. 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

  
 

 
 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

On 22 March 2002, in a briefing note to the Prime Minister in preparation for 
 
a meeting with Mr Adams, it was recorded that Sinn Fein had now provided a 
 
 
 
total of 161 names – 35 of them since the New Year.  Of these, 47 had so far 
 
been cleared (of whom 22 who had escaped whilst serving a sentence had 
 
been brought within the early release scheme).  In 12 cases the DPP(NI) had 
 
said that there remained a requirement to prosecute, and in a further 10 the 
 
police had sufficient evidence to warrant arrest for questioning.  The 
 
remaining 102 cases almost all involved people who had gone on the run 
 
 
before they could be prosecuted.  It was said that officials had been arguing

At the subsequent meeting, Mr Adams sought assurance that the 30 or so 
 
problem cases would be sorted out over a period of eighteen months or so. 
  
 
A possible legislative solution was also discussed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

As part of the ongoing consideration by Ministers and officials as to whether 
 
the administrative scheme could be speeded up, an official in the Legal 
 
Secretariat to the Law Officers wrote to the DPP(NI) at the end of March 
 
2002 canvassing the possibility (which had been raised by the NIO) of 
 
removing consideration of whether there was any outstanding requirement 
 
to prosecute the individual, and confining the administrative scheme to 
 
answering the questions whether an individual was wanted by the police in 
 
Northern Ireland and Great Britain, or was the subject of on‐going extradition 
 
proceedings – with Sinn Fein being informed correspondingly.  It was 
 
acknowledged that this would increase the danger of an individual being told 
 
that they could return and then have proceedings brought against them, and 
 
that it would be necessary to include in the NIO’s “comfort letter” a 
 
qualification as to the level of comfort given. A suggested draft was provided, 
 
 
by the NIO (which had decided that there should be no reference to the 
 
DPP(NI) as the resultant difficulty in drafting would make the letter so 
 
technical as to be unclear or so vague as to “undermine the reassurance such 
 
a letter is designed to provide”). The draft was in the following terms: 
 
  
“The Secretary of State has been informed by the Chief Constable of the PSNI 
 
that on the basis of the information currently available, there are no warrants 
 
in existence nor are you wanted in Northern Ireland for arrest, questioning or 
 
charge by the police. The PSNI are not aware of any interest in you from any 
 
other police force in the United Kingdom. If any other outstanding offence or 
 
 
offences came to light, or if any request for extradition were to be received 
 
these would have to be dealt with in the usual way”. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

On 4 April 2002 the DPP(NI) replied pointing out that not much less work 
 
would be required under the new proposal, and that it was difficult to see 
 
 
how changing the question would provide a reliable response.  It was, 
 
nevertheless open to the Chief Constable to provide answers on the basis of 
 
more limited and less reliable research.  The possibility of the proposed 
 
change was then raised with, and rejected by, the PSNI.  Thus the 
 
administrative scheme continued as before, and with any letter of comfort / 
   
reassurance continuing to be in the terms set out in paragraph 49 above. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

In June 2002 the Attorney General wrote to the SSNI pointing out that 
 
although the administrative process continued, it would not provide the 
 
means by which the Government’s commitment in relation to OTRs would be 
 
met. He underlined that the prosecution process could not provide an 
 
amnesty, and that he and the DPP(NI) had been careful to ensure that each 
 
 
case was considered on its own merits and was subjected to the same Test

An internal NIO briefing note dated 3 September 2002  set out the history in 
 
 
relation to OTRs, and noted that the grand total of names provided by Sinn 
 
Fein was now 162 (of whom 61 had been told they could return), with a 
 
 
further 10 raised by the Prison Service and a further 2 by the Irish 
 
Government.  The note recorded that it had been known all along that there 
 
 
would be a hardcore of unconvicted cases, likely to run to a few dozen, which 
 
could not be resolved within the present law. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In May 2003, following negotiations at Leeds Castle, the British and Irish 
 
Governments issued a Joint Declaration in which provision was made: “To 
 
discuss appropriate issues with the parties including through the 
 
implementation group….”. Proposals in relation to the OTRs were published 
 
in parallel. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

However, as later recorded by the Attorney General in a letter dated 27 
 
February 2006 to the SSNI, work on the administrative scheme came to a halt 
 
 
in 2004 – albeit, as will become clear, some work was done in relation to the 
 
defendant up to September 2004. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

On 28 July 2005 the leadership of the IRA announced that it had ordered an 
 
end to its armed campaign.  In response the then Secretary of State for 
 
 
Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, indicated that the Government would now 
 
 
implement the areas of the Joint Declaration of May 2003 that were 
 
 
dependent on the IRA’s decision. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

At the end of September 2005 the Independent International Commission on 
 
Decommissioning reported that the IRA had placed its arms completely and 
 
verifiably beyond use. On 13 October 2005 Mr Hain made a wide‐ranging 
 
statement to the House of Commons in response, during the course of which 
 
he reminded the House that the government had undertaken to legislate in 
 
 
relation to the OTRs, and that the proposals had been published alongside 
 
the Joint Declaration in May 2003.  He continued: “This is not an amnesty. 
  
Nevertheless the implementation of those proposals will be painful for many 
 
 
people.  I fully understand this.  But the Government believes that it is a 
 
 
necessary part of the process of closing the door on violence forever”. 
 

  
 

    

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

The Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill was introduced on 29 November 2005 
 
to: “Make special provision about certain offences committed, or alleged to 
 
 
have been committed, before 10 April 1998”.  It attempted to address the 
 
position of all persons who would be liable to prosecution, including 
 
members of the police and armed forces, and provided (amongst other 
 
things) for the granting of certificates of eligibility by a Commissioner, 
 
exemption from arrest for those holding such a certificate, trial by a Special 
 
Tribunal and entitlement to a licence enabling the relevant individual not to

However, the Bill was withdrawn on 11 January 2006 when, in a statement to

“Every Northern Ireland party vigorously opposed the Bill, bar Sinn Fein. Now 
 
Sinn Fein opposes it, because it refused to accept that the legislation should 
 
apply to members of the security forces charged with terrorism‐related 
 
offences. To exclude from provisions of the Bill any members of the security 
 
forces who might have been involved in such offences would have been not 
 
 
only illogical but indefensible, and we would not do it. Closure on the past 
 
 
cannot be one‐sided. That was, and is, non‐negotiable. 
 
The process would have made people accountable for their past actions 
 
 
through the special tribunal before being released on licence. Sinn Fein has 
 
 
now said that any republican potentially covered by the legislation should 
 
have nothing to do with it. But if no one went through the process, victims 
 
who would have suffered the pain of having to come to terms with the 
 
legislation would have done so for nothing. That is unacceptable, and I am 
 
   
 
therefore withdrawing the Bill.” 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It appears, see again the Attorney General’s letter dated 27 February 2006, 
 
that it was the introduction of, and/or the failure of, the legislation which 
 
 
prompted the restart of the administrative scheme.

On 28 December 2006, in a confidential letter, the Prime Minister assured 
 
Gerry Adams that the Government, having already announced that it would 
 
 
no longer pursue the extradition of individuals convicted of pre‐1998 
 
offences who had escaped from prison and who would, if they returned to 
 
Northern Ireland and successfully applied for the early release scheme, have 
 
little if any of their time left to serve, was now working with a renewed focus 
 
on putting in place mechanisms to resolve all other OTR cases – including 
 
“expediting the existing administrative procedures” and stating that “I have 
 
always believed that the position of these OTRs is an anomaly which needs to 
 
 
 
be addressed. Before I leave office I am committed to finding a scheme which 
 
   
will resolve all the remaining cases”. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

In February 2007 the PSNI commenced Operation Rapid, which was the 
 
operational name for a review of persons circulated as “wanted” by the PSNI 
 
 
in connection with terrorist related offences up to 10 April 1998.  The 
 
purpose of it was to examine what basis, if any, the PSNI had to seek the 
 
arrest of those individuals identified by Sinn Fein to the Government and 
 
passed to the Chief Constable.  The Terms of Reference recorded, among 
 
other things, that responsibility for the expeditious completion of the review

rested with the Head of Branch C2 of the PSNI (who would ensure that a

It is clear that Operation Rapid marked the beginning of direct engagement 
 
between Sinn Fein and the PSNI in order to try to expedite the remaining 
 
cases. The first Operation Rapid meeting took place on 7 February 2007. It 
 
 
was chaired by the Head of Branch C2, DCS Baxter and attended by among 
 
others ADCI Graham (who was appointed SIO). A note of the meeting was 
 
disclosed during the hearings. It recorded that: “The HoB provided a brief 
 
background as to why a review would be taking place into those persons 
 
termed as being ‘On the Run’. He stated that Mr McGrory, Solicitor, who acts 
 
 
on behalf of the OTR’s, had requested information about the current legal 
 
status of his clients. Under Article 3 of the ECHR and Human Rights Act all 
 
persons have a legal right upon request to be informed if police require them 
 
 
for questioning. He stated that police were therefore obliged to review all 
 
 
those cases and determine the current status of these persons… it was 
 
agreed that the terms of reference for the enquiry should be twofold. Firstly, 
 
 
to establish the legitimate basis why a person ‘On the Run’ was wanted. 
 
Secondly, to establish the status and the integrity of the evidence. Formal 
 
terms of reference would be drafted by ACC Crime Operations and forwarded 
 
to D/C/Insp Graham for guidance. Where it was established that no current 
 
legitimate basis existed to have a person arrested, this information would be 
 
passed to ACC Crime for onward transmission to their Solicitor. Alternatively, 
 
if reasonable grounds still existed to suspect a person of committing a 
 
 
specific terrorist offence when balanced against Human Rights 
 
considerations, a firm recommendation would be made to have these 
 
persons to remain circulated as wanted for interview and records updated 
 
appropriately. It was agreed that all OTR decisions should be based on purely 
 
 
policing considerations and that the enquiry should remain neutral, 
 
proportionate and ethical at all times. …Upon publicity reaching the press 
 
 
regarding the review of OTR cases, it was agreed that the following press 
 
statement would be released. ‘As a result of information made available to 
 
 
the Police Service of Northern Ireland, officers from Crime Operations

As to the witnesses who took part in the negotiations in relation to, and/or 
 
the implementation of, the administrative scheme, Mr Powell states, among 
 
other things, that: 
  
“As we were not able to find an across the board solution that worked we 
 
had to deal with the ‘On The Runs’ as individual cases through an 
 
administrative scheme that had begun as an interim measure requiring 
 
individual requests for consideration to be submitted to the Northern Ireland 
 
Office through Sinn Fein, and thereafter a series of reviews and decisions to 
 
 
be taken by all of the relevant ministries or agencies, including the Police 
 
Service of Northern Ireland (who in turn would obtain information from 
 
other forces or agencies or via Interpol), the Attorney General, the DPP in 
 
 
Northern Ireland and/or in England and the Secretary of State for Northern 
 
Ireland. The first letters containing assurances that the individuals concerned 
 
were not wanted for arrest, questioning or charge were sent from 10 
 
Downing Street to the President of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, to be given to the 
 
 
addressees. I was the signatory of the initial letters. Later signatories to 
 
similar letters were senior officials in the Northern Ireland Office. What each 
 
 
letter was intended to reflect, was that on the basis of information then 
 
available to the authorities and carefully considered in each case individually, 
 
an assurance was being given that the individual would not be subject to 
 
arrest and subsequent prosecution if he or she returned to the United 
 
Kingdom. Although this had not been the solution first envisaged by the 
 
 
British government in its wish to deal with this particular aspect of the past, 
 
nevertheless it was intended to provide a solution that worked in practice 
 
even if more slowly and in a more cumbersome and less universal way than 
 
had been wished by those negotiating on behalf of Sinn Fein. 
 
The issue of the OTRs was at no time a single, isolated issue, but was dealt 
 
 
with as part of the overall negotiation. All aspects were simultaneously in 
 
 
play; agreement to one issue by one party was critical to obtaining the 
 
agreement of another party to another issue. I set out my recollections of the 
 
 
decade long negotiations in a  book entitled, ‘Great Hatred, Little Room: 
 
Making Peace in Northern Ireland’ published in 2008 for which I was

permitted by the Cabinet Office to have access to the No 10 papers relating 
 
to my time in Downing Street. 
 
In the book I make clear my view that the most challenging part of the peace 
 
 
process in Northern Ireland, as in most other peace processes, is its 
 
implementation. Agreements are necessary precisely because the two sides 
 
do not trust each other and agreements by themselves do not establish trust. 
 
It is only when the two sides actually implement what they have promised to 
 
do that the trust begins to be created as part of a process of peace building. If 
 
 
either side reneges on its undertakings or fails to implement what it has 
 
 
promised to do, trust can be fatally undermined. 
 
The intention behind the British Government giving written assurances to 
 
 
individual OTRs was to try to resolve the issue given the failure to find a 
 
workable general approach and to provide individual letters that Sinn Fein 
 
could use to reassure the individuals concerned that they could return to the 
 
UK without fear of arrest.”  (My emphasis)

wanted) states, among other things, that: 
   
“Sinn Fein for whom I speak in this statement emphasises that it is impossible 
 
to overstate the importance of the assurances given to the 187 recipients, 
 
which included John Downey, being maintained. These were essential in the 
 
achievement of the series of agreements that began with the Good Friday 
 
Agreement in 1998, and were consolidated in… the commencement of the 
 
 
Northern Ireland Assembly in 2007. The Court will be aware from the 
 
presence of Sinn Fein MPs at the hearings to date in this case, as well as the 
 
 
presence of the Irish Government, of the importance that is attached to the 
 
 
firmness of each of the building blocks of the peace process in the North of 
 
 
Ireland and the reliance upon the assurances given, by all parties to those 
 
agreements, to those assurances being honoured by those who gave them. 
 
The peace process remains a process; there has to be constant vigilance and 
 
effort. The effect of John Downey’s arrest and prosecution has caused 
 
enormous concern both as to the obvious question marks now raised in 
 
 
relation to identical assurances given in identical circumstances to many 
 
others and as to the wider implications of a firm assurance on a key issue 
 
emanating from a lengthy process that is no longer being adhered to. 
 
There had been throughout the administrative process, a reliance that those 
 
 
responsible for preparing and presenting an assurance (or a refusal) were in a 
 
 
position to provide an unequivocal statement. It was on that basis that Sinn 
 
 
 
Fein felt able to advise those who had sought its help in asking for such 
 
 
assurances, that they meant what they said and on this basis, that the 
 
 
recipients thereafter believed they were able to organise their lives 
 
 
accordingly.”  (My emphasis)

abandonment. It was in this context that the already ongoing administrative 
 
scheme, although begun as a temporary measure, became the mechanism by 
 
 
which all of the “On the Run” applicants were enabled to have their position 
 
 
clarified. 
 
The scheme addressed the position of individuals who through Sinn Fein put 
 
their names forward. To qualify for consideration the offences for which each 
 
individual who believed he or she might be suspected, or “wanted” (in some 
 
cases already convicted and having escaped from prison), should have been 
 
committed before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and 
 
have been connected with the conflict in Northern Ireland. The group to 
 
which the individual concerned was affiliated (ie the IRA) must adhere to the 
 
 
commitment to cessation of armed conflict. Whilst the first cases pressed by 
 
Sinn Fein concerned those who lived and had family in the North of Ireland, 
 
the scheme extended to applicants in the Republic of Ireland who had no 
 
 
such relationships and to persons whose extradition had been actively sought 
 
 
from within other jurisdictions. The scheme was not limited to offences 
 
committed in the North of Ireland. 
 
As Secretary of State, I was conversant not just with the implications but with 
 
the running of the scheme, which was a scheme endorsed by every branch of 
 
 
the Government including those tasked with considering prosecutions. The 
 
procedure was in a number of ways wholly unprecedented. The individuals 
 
concerned were told, in terms and in writing, by the Northern Ireland Office in 
 
 
response to Sinn Fein in respect of each applicant, either that they were liable 
 
to arrest if they entered the jurisdiction or, via a personal letter whose key 
 
 
phraseology was in essence common to all, that on the basis of current 
 
information that they were not wanted and would not be arrested. I was 
 
involved in the extensive discussions that surrounded attempts to bring 
 
legislation and/or to consider alternative mechanisms. When these could not 
 
 
be achieved, it was the administrative scheme that persisted. 
 
There were a number of exceptional features to the scheme. The first, of 
 
 
course, involved Sinn Fein being formally put on notice; individuals who 
 
otherwise might not know with any certainty that they could be subject to 
 
 
arrest were alerted. The second was that the scheme progressed in a non 
 
 
public manner. Confidentiality was maintained for the individuals who 
 
submitted their names to the scheme; neither the names of the applicants 
 
nor the outcome of the applications were subjected to publicity. There was in 
 
consequence an enhanced reliance upon internal checks being correctly done 
 
and correctly notified as the recipient was dependent upon and trusting in the 
 
sole evidence of an assurance, namely the letter he/she (or on his/her behalf 
 
Sinn Fein) received from the Northern Ireland Office. I am informed that the 
 
Court has been provided with internal documents that show that at a 
 
number of junctures discussion took place with a view to reducing to burden 
 
 
of verification that rested upon the departments concerned, but this was 
 
 
rejected on the basis that corners could not be cut. It was intended that the 
 
 
assurance be just that, reliable assurances as to the position of the applicants 
 
and implicit in that, that the process by which the assurances had come to be

In his first witness statement Mr McGinty states, among other things, that: 
  
“… in the absence of any statutory scheme, Sinn Fein through the Northern 
 
Ireland Office, began to provide the prosecuting authorities with names of 
 
individuals who were outside the jurisdiction and had ground for believing 
 
they might be subject to arrest or prosecution if they returned to the 
 
jurisdiction.  I believe it was understood by all that at best this administrative 
 
scheme would identify those cases where individuals were not in fact wanted 
 
or where the evidential test could no longer ever be met. The prosecuting 
 
authorities accepted the administrative scheme with some reluctance. In part 
 
 
this was because the actual and perceived impartiality of the prosecution 
 
authority was of crucial importance to the maintenance of public confidence 
 
and the administrative scheme would only benefit one side of a divided 
 
community. The second reason was that it was not usual for an assessment 
 
of the evidence to be made in the absence of the individual concerned. The 
 
third reason was that where an individual was still wanted, to inform them 
 
that they would be arrested if they returned to the jurisdiction could amount 
 
to “tipping off”. This last concern was mitigated to some extent by the fact 
 
that given that an individual’s name had been put forward in itself suggested 
 
that that individual had cause to believe they were in fact wanted for arrest. 
 
These concerns had two consequences. The first was that in assessing the 
 
evidential sufficiency for prosecution, the usual test, namely whether there 
 
was sufficient evidence to afford a reasonable prospect for conviction, was 
 
 
amended slightly to a test of whether there was now, or could ever be, 
 
sufficient evidence to meet the test for prosecution. The reason for this was 
 
 
that if an individual returned and was arrested, the evidential position may 
 
change. There may be forensic tests that could be carried out, fingerprints 
 
would become available and admissions may be made in interview. 
 
The second consequence followed on from the first, and was reflected in the 
 
 
wording of the letters sent to those who were told they could return. The 
 
letters made clear that the assessment was based on the evidence then 
 
available. That position could change. It was to the forefront of the minds of 
 
the prosecutors that if an individual who had received such a letter returned 
 
to the jurisdiction and started commenting publicly through the authorship of 
 
 
books, articles or appearance on television that they had in fact been involved 
 
in terrorist activity (which was not as farfetched as it may seem) public 
 
confidence in the criminal justice system would require the authorities to be 
 
 
able to act. It followed that the letter sent could never amount to an amnesty 
 
of absolute and final promise not to prosecute. 
 
I believe the limitations of the scheme were understood by all. I believe it 
 
 
was understood by the Irish government because at one stage they asked the 
 
 
Attorney General to consider whether the promise made by government 
 
could be met by the use of pre conviction pardons. I believe it was also 
 
understood by Sinn Fein as it was patently obvious that the scheme only 
 
sought to identify those individuals who were able to return without fear of

the Central Criminal Court, and that he had been reported as such on 29 May 
 
 
1983. It included the words: “Conspiracy to murder IRA terrorist… do not

the file should be re‐submitted”. The PSNI were asked to confirm that no 
 
further evidence had come to light. 
 

 
   
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

On 7 November 2002 the PSNI wrote to the DPP (NI) to indicate that it 
 
appeared that no further evidence had come to light in relation to the 
 
Enniskillen bombing, but that the OTR team was reviewing the defendant’s 
 
suspected involvement in a number of crimes, including the Enniskillen 
 
bombing, and hoped to be in a position to advise the DPP (NI) shortly (p.663). 
 
Towards the end of that month (p. 668/9) it was recorded that enquiries 
 
were ongoing.

On 9 April 2003 it was recorded that the police were hoping to submit a 
 
report shortly, that the defendant was wanted, but that the Crown Solicitor 
 
had no interest (p. 676/7).

On 9 December 2003 there was no reference to a letter from the police (p. 
 
 
699/700). However it is clear that the PSNI investigated the defendant in 
 
relation to five incidents in Northern Ireland and that they also made some 
 
enquiries of the Metropolitan Police in relation to the Hyde Park Bombing. 
 
Each of the six incidents was the subject of a template. The Hyde Park 
 
Bombing was the subject of the sixth template. At some point an Assessment 
 
Form in relation to that template was completed (p. 681/2), and recorded 
 
that the defendant was circulated as being wanted for conspiracy to murder 
 
in relation to the Hyde Park explosion in London on 20 July 1982 and that 
 
there was fingerprint evidence in the case. The materials in relation to the 
 
 
sixth template also included a Special Branch report (p. 684) which also 
 
recorded that the defendant was required for questioning in relation to the 
 
 
 
Hyde Park Bombing by the Metropolitan Police. There was also an ICIS 
 
summary in relation to the defendant (p. 686/7) and his PNC record (already 
 
referred to above, p.688‐694). 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

On 22 July 2004 an internal PSNI document (p.701) recorded that the arrest 
 
and interview of the defendant had been approved in respect of a number of 
 
 
Northern Irish incidents, including the Enniskillen bombing. It was also 
 
recorded that the defendant had been identified on fingerprints in relation to 
 
 
the Hyde Park Explosion on 20 July 1982, and that the Anti‐Terrorist Branch 
 
had confirmed that no extradition had been attempted, but that it was their 
 
intention to arrest the defendant should he come within the jurisdiction. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

On 14 September 2004 the PSNI wrote (p.702) to the DPP (NI) pointing out 
 
that the defendant had never been interviewed in relation to the incident at 
 
 
Enniskillen, and that it may be that further evidence would come to light 
 
during such an interview. The letter also indicated that, in addition, the 
 
defendant was wanted by the PSNI for arrest and interview in relation to a 
 
 
number of serious terrorist offences.

whether it was now confirmed that the defendant was wanted (p.722‐724). 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 

On  31 January 2006 the PSNI wrote to the NIO underlining the importance of 
 
the NIO, PPS, PSNI and Attorney General’s office being in agreement as to 
 
what exactly the position in relation to all persons named on all Sinn Fein lists 
 
 
was, and suggesting a roundtable meeting of all the above‐mentioned parties 
 
(p.727‐732). 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On 27 February 2006 (see above) the Attorney General wrote to the SSNI (by 
 
then, Mr Hain) and informed him that the defendant was wanted for arrest 
 
 
and questioning in respect of serious terrorist offences. There was no 
 
 
mention, as such, of the Hyde Park Bombing (p. 733/4).

In March 2006 the NIO wrote to Mr Kelly stating that in relation to four 
 
individuals there was no outstanding direction to prosecute in Northern 
 
Ireland, that there were no warrants in existence, and nor were the 
 
individuals wanted in Northern Ireland for arrest, questioning or charge by 
 
the police. Letters to the four individuals were included – each in the terms 
 
set out in paragraph 49 above. However, the letter to Mr Kelly went on to 
 
indicate that three other individuals, one of whom was the defendant, would 
 
in the current circumstances of their cases face arrest and questioning if they 
 
returned to Northern Ireland (p. 735/6). 
  
In June 2006 (p. 741/2) the defendant appeared on a list of persons who 
 
were confirmed as being wanted by the NIO and wanted for questioning by 
 
 
the PSNI.

In January 2007 a PSNI schedule (p. 745) recorded that the defendant was 
 
currently wanted by the PSNI, and that enquiries confirmed that he was 
 
sought for arrest and interview in relation to a number of serious terrorist 
 
offences, and that the NIO had informed Sinn Fein accordingly in March 
 
2006. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

It will be recalled that it was around February 2007 that Operation Rapid 
 
commenced. I have already summarised its Terms of Reference in paragraph 
 
74 above. It will be recalled that it was a review of persons circulated as 
 
“wanted” by the PSNI in connection with terrorist related offences up to 10 
 
 
April 1998 and its purpose was to examine what basis, if any, the PSNI had to 
 
 
seek the arrest of those individuals identified by Sinn Fein to the Government 
 
 
and passed to the Chief Constable. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
102.	  On 13 April 2007 email messages within the PSNI show that, at the request of 
 

 
Operation Rapid, a check was made on the PNC to see whether the 
 
defendant was still wanted for the Hyde Park Bombing and that it was 
 
 
confirmed that he was (p.758).

(p.760), which included a cross reference to the Special Branch report (p. 684 
 
– see above), made reference to the sixth template in his case. It was 
 
 
recorded that that template related to the Hyde Park Bombing on 20 July 
 
 
1982; that no case papers were available in Northern Ireland but that: 
 
“Downey is alerted on PNC as wanted for murder if arrested inform SO13 
 
evidence is by way of fingerprints. The alert is current and was last 
 
updated/confirmed by this team on 13/4/07. There is no further information 
 
to add to this template. Should Downey be arrested in Northern Ireland for 
 
offences here we would be duty bound to inform SO13 New Scotland Yard”.

13 April 2007 update (p. 760/1) – both of which referred to the Hyde Park 
 
Bombing. The record of ADCI Graham’s review in relation to the Hyde Park 
 
Bombing (the sixth template) did not emerge until enquiries were 
 
commenced during the hearing  (see paragraphs 15‐16 above). ADCI Graham 
 
recorded his decision in a Policy Decision Log Book as being: “That subject is 
 
not wanted by PSNI, however there is information to suggest that he is 
 
wanted by Metropolitan Police, I will request an up to date report from 
 
Metropolitan Police on current status of their circulation.” The officer 
 
 
recorded his reasons as being: 
  
“1. Conspiracy to murder allegations relate to incidents that occurred in 
 
London 1982. It is not known where the conspiracy was carried out. 
  
2. There is no evidence on file that would give me grounds to consider 
 
circulation by or on behalf of PSNI for any offence within the jurisdiction. 
 
3. The evidence i.e. fingerprint does not specify that the fingerprint belongs 
 
to subject. He is however circulated on the PNC as being wanted by the 
 
Metropolitan Police. 
  
4. I consider that the present circulation by/on behalf of Met Police should 
 
 
 
remain subject to further clarification from the English authorities.” 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

In a report later that day to Detective Chief Superintendent Baxter, ADCI 
 
 
Graham indicated that he had completed a review in respect of the 
 
defendant, “with due consideration being given to the agreed Terms of 
 
Reference”; that all the templates in relation to the defendant were based on 
 
 
intelligence, including the template relating to the bomb at Hyde Park, and 
 
that he had reviewed the papers and could find no evidence that the 
 
defendant was wanted by the PSNI for that offence, but that the defendant 
 
was still wanted by the Metropolitan Police in relation to it – subject to any 
 
further evidence. He indicated that, in respect of the other templates, there 
 
was no evidence or material that could provide sufficient grounds to have the 
 
defendant circulated at that time. He therefore recommended that the 
 
 
defendant be listed as not wanted by the PSNI at that time, and that 
 
clarification should be sought from the Metropolitan Police as to the current 
 
 
position with their circulation of the defendant. To date, no record of any 
 
request for clarification has been found.

documentation) only have considered ADCI Graham’s report of 7 May, 
 
reported to Assistant Chief Constable Sheridan in relation to a number of 
 
 
individuals. As to the defendant, he said that: “The above person is a native 
 
of the Republic of Ireland and is a citizen of the Irish Republic. He has not 
 
resided in Northern Ireland and remains resident in his native district. He is 
 
 
not currently “on the run” from his home. I have reviewed his case and there 
 
 
is no basis in my professional opinion to seek his arrest currently for any 
 
offence prior to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. The above person 
 
should be informed that he is not currently wanted by the PSNI for offences 
 
prior to the Good Friday Agreement 1998, but it should be borne in mind that 
 
should new properly assessed and reliable intelligence, or new evidence

Thus it is clear that although DCS Baxter knew from ADCI Graham’s report 
 
about the fact that the defendant was wanted in relation to the Hyde Park 
 
Bombing, he made no reference to it or to the defendant being wanted in 
 
relation to it. When asked by DI Corrigan (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above) 
 
during the course of the hearings he said that he reported to ACC Sheridan 
 
via a strict application of the Operation Rapid criteria and agreed parameters. 
 
He said that the defendant was not wanted by the PSNI and was not 
 
considered to be on the run as he was not a resident of Northern Ireland, and 
 
that there was no statutory requirement to supply any further information as 
 
per agreed parameters.

ongoing review and stating in relation to the defendant that: “the above 
 
person is not a resident of Northern Ireland and is a citizen of the Republic of

and requested that checks be made against the files and information held by 
 
the DPP (NI) in accordance with previous instructions for the task (which do 
 
not appear to have been disclosed), and thereafter to prepare letters for the

Operation Rapid that all checks with outside forces had been carried out in

request were disclosed during the hearing. In particular, on 13 June 2007 ACC

appears to have been no formal means of recording, or apprising the Head of 
 
 
Branch of, the results of such enquiries (although in some of the older files 
 
there is a checklist which includes Gazette/PNC/Interpol). The current review 
 
team has examined whether individuals are wanted by the PSNI in 
 
connection with terrorist‐related offences up to 10 April 1998 (as per terms 
 
 
of reference). It has been practice, however, for the current team to examine 
 
 
ICIS for indications of PNC entries by examining the PNC ID field with the 
 
nominal’s “view person” screen. This is the screen that opens when an 
 
individual is “searched” for by means of an ICIS unique reference number 
 
(URN). PNC itself is only accessed during “searches” when the individual is 
 
sought by means of a name and date of birth or age. The vast majority of this 
 
 
team’s searches are done by means of an ICIS URN relying therefore on the 
 
accuracy of the PNC ID fields. Sample checks carried out today have revealed 
 
that ICIS cannot be relied upon in this respect. Ten people on our list of those 
 
recently reviewed have been scrutinised. None of the ten have entries in the 
 
PNC ID field but five are recorded when PNC itself is checked. Three of the 
 
individuals are alerted as wanted in Northern Ireland and two simply have 
 
PNC nominal entries. None of the ten were recorded as wanted by any other 
 
agency. (As discussed we did recently check one individual who was recorded 
 
on PNC as wanted in England and carried out further enquiries with the Met). 
 
It is now clear that we cannot rely on the ICIS “view person” screen and must 
 
carry out specific PNC checks on every individual. In response to the request 
 
below this office cannot state that “all checks with outside forces” have been 
 
carried out, as Interpol has not been consulted and earlier reliance on “PNC 
 
ID” fields is clearly flawed. The review team can now recheck PNC itself via 
 
 
ICIS in respect of those nominals already reviewed and can submit those 
 
names to Interpol liaison which has not been the practice of this team. It 
 
appears that requests to Interpol will require provision to them of significant 
 
information, including reason or justification for the check and details of any 
 
offences of which suspected. The original review template was amended to 
 
answer questions of continuity/intelligence origins etcetera and will now be 
 
amended to state that PNC/Interpol checks have been done. All individuals 
 
will be specifically searched on ICIS for PNC entries and Interpol liaison at 
 
 
PSNI Criminal Justice Department will be asked to conduct enquiries at 
 
Interpol. (Subject to your confirmation that this must be done). A copy of the 
 
 
 
SOCA form for use with Interpol is attached for your information”.

That was passed on to DCS Baxter who later on 14 June 2007 emailed ADCI 
 
Graham as follows: “The issue is probably resolved. As I understand it – if a 
 
 
person with a domicile address in Northern Ireland is wanted by police on 
 
mainland UK then the PSNI are formally notified and an entry is made against 
 
their nominal on ICIS. Similarly, if an individual is wanted outside the UK e.g. 
 
a European country then a current European Arrest Warrant is the formal 
 
 
and legal means of notifying the PSNI. Once again such an arrest warrant is

logged against the nominal of an individual on ICIS. If ICIS checks are not 
 
flagging an individual as wanted by a GB police force or under a European 
 
Arrest Warrant then it is correct to report that that individual is not wanted 
 
by the PSNI on behalf of either a GB force or a European country. It would be 
 
impossible to check 100 per cent as to whether or not an individual is 
 
suspected of offences which have not reached a level of evidence to formally 
 
 
seek arrest and to do so throughout Europe. I hope this guidance is helpful. 
 
What we need to establish is the following “Is X wanted for arrest by the 
 
Police Service of Northern Ireland for an offences (sic) pre the Good Friday 
 
Agreement or circulated as wanted for arrest by an external force and the 
 
 
existence of reasonable grounds (within the UK) or a European Arrest 
 
Warrant. This can be established by an ICIS check and I do not believe that 
 
 
investigations beyond this are necessary as the ten examined has shown”.

In his second witness statement Mr McGinty states, among other things, 
 
 
that: 
 
“… By the time the Downey letter was sent, the process was familiar and had 
 
been running for some years. I no longer informed the Attorney General of 
 
individual decisions and the letter to the Northern Ireland Office would be 
 
sent by me to an official there… I confirm that in respect of Mr Downey, his 
 
name was one of a number in a letter from the Deputy DPP identified as not 
 
 
being wanted. I did not see any other material in relation to him until his 
 
arrest. I did not recognise his name and did not connect him with the Hyde 
 
Park bombing. The consideration of his extradition happened before my 
 
arrival here and none of those who dealt with it at the time were in the 
 
Attorney General’s office when the Downey letter was sent… In summary, in 
 
relation to the vast majority of names considered, including that of Mr 
 
Downey, the role of this office was simply to forward information to the NIO 
 
that was being provided to us by the PPS. The name Downey meant nothing 
 
to me. I was not aware of any other information about him and the Law 
 
Officers and this office took no part in the consideration given to his position 
 
by the PSNI or the PPS”.

the NIO emailed the D/Staff Officer to ACC Sheridan (p. 770/1) seeking 
 
confirmation of an earlier conversation during which the Staff Officer had 
 
said that the PSNI had checked whether any of the individuals named in Mr 
 
McGinty’s letter of 11 July (who included Mr Downey) were wanted by an 
 
external force as far as the PSNI could ascertain, and had established that 
 
they were not. The email further recorded that during the earlier 
 
conversation it had been agreed that Mr Sweeney would email the D/Staff 
 
Officer and that she would check that Mr Sweeney’s understanding was 
 
correct or would put him right.

Sheridan dated 27 June confirms that prior to forwarding all details to the 
 
Director of Public Prosecutions our review team conduct all searches through 
 
our own computer system ICIS, the Police National Computer (PNC) and 
 
 
checks with An Garda Siochana. This is the process conducted for all 
 
individuals reviewed prior to any letters being sent from this office and this 
 
will continue to be the case. To confirm, these checks have been carried out

out above) in the following terms “The Secretary of State for Northern 
 
Ireland has been informed by the Attorney General that on the basis of the 
 
 
information currently available, there is no outstanding direction for 
 
prosecution in Northern Ireland, there are no warrants in existence nor are 
 
 
 
you wanted in Northern Ireland for arrest, questioning, or charge by the 
 
police. The Police Service of Northern Ireland are not aware of any interest 
 
in you from any other police force in the United Kingdom. If any other

Operation Rapid’s team in relation to the 7 June 2007 entry in PSNI records, 
 
seeking confirmation of their presumption that it meant when any other 
 
evidence became available. That was confirmed in a reply which stated that:

Operation Rapid review, a letter was issued stating that Downey was not 
 
considered to be On The Run by virtue of his not having lived in Northern 
 
Ireland. The letter added that he was not currently wanted by PSNI. There 
 
was no caveat to the effect that he could become liable to arrest if further 
 
evidence came to light. I have just spoken with HET in relation to this matter. 
 
HET expressed some concern that Downey was not considered as wanted. 
 
They informed me that they have located a crucial piece of evidence in 
 
relation to a double murder for which we submitted a review template. It is 
 
probable that they will have an SIO create a new wanted alert in respect of 
 
the murders concerned.

by the addition of a caveat in Op Rapid ICIS entries and the relevant letters. In 
 
this case however, presumably because Downey was not considered to be 
 
OTR, there was no caveat in the letter issued to the PPS. Given that Downey 
 
did not have a Northern Ireland address it is unlikely that he will now seek to 
 
live in this jurisdiction. It is of course possible that he might visit here and, if a 
 
 
new alert is created, be subject to arrest”.

background in relation to the investigation of the defendant in connection 
 
with the Enniskillen bombing and continued: “… It has always been the case 
 
 
that new evidence could potentially be uncovered by HET or others 
 
investigating cases previously reviewed (under specific criteria) by Op Rapid. 
 
 
It is my understanding that it has been made known to concerned parties 
 
 
that the assessment of a person as “not currently wanted” was always 
 
subject to the condition that new evidence could result in that person 
 
becoming liable to arrest if located in this jurisdiction. Although the letter 
 
relating to Downey did not specifically carry this caveat all interested parties 
 
are apparently aware that this condition applies. HET have indicated that 
 
they will now seek to have a new alert created in respect of John Anthony 
 
Downey. Consequently he is likely to be described as wanted for murder 
 
upon creation by the HET of an appropriate alert. This office has not 
 
examined the murder investigation conducted by HET and has no remit to do 
 
so. There could however be value in a Senior Investigating Officer appointed 
 
by D/C/Supt Baxter liaising with HET on this matter in order to clarify the 
 
 
grounds to overturn the decision of the Op Rapid review. Despite the 
 
understanding that new evidence would overturn an Op Rapid assessment

The series of emails dated 23‐29 July 2008 (excluding the one dealing with 
 
 
the Hyde Park Bombing) were printed out by ADCI Graham on 29 July 2008 
 
 
and were found by Mr Little during the disclosure exercise inside ADCI 
 
Graham’s relevant 2007 Police Decision Logbook in front of the page dealing 
 
with the sixth template (which related to the Hyde Park Bombing). There was 
 
 
no relevant entry in ADCI Graham’s 2008 Policy Decision Logbooks. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The PSNI did not alert the DPP (NI), or anyone else, to the fact that the 
 
defendant had been wanted by the Metropolitan Police in relation to the 
 
 
Hyde Park Bombing at the time of the critical correspondence in June/July 
 
 
2007, or to the fact that the defendant was still wanted by the Metropolitan 
 
 
Police in July 2008. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
134.	  ADCI Graham told DI Corrigan that he did not recall the 2008 emails, as did 
 
DCS Baxter (now retired). As I have already indicated, Mr Baxter also stated 
 
that there was no requirement to provide further information as per agreed 
 
parameters.

There was further email correspondence in relation to the Enniskillen 
 
bombing on 4 August 2008 (p. 792). 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
136.	  On 21 October 2009 an internal PSNI report (p.796) recorded that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant was one of a number of individuals whose name was checked 
 
against lists held by Operation Rapid with the result: “Status reviewed by Op 
 
 
Rapid and assessed as ‘not currently wanted’ by PSNI. He is, however, alerted 
 
 
on PNC as wanted for murder 20/07/82 (Hyde Park Bombing)”.  (My

137.	  Again, nothing was done to alert the DPP (NI), or anyone else, in relation to 
 
the defendant being wanted by the Metropolitan Police in connection with 
 
the Hyde Park Bombing.

thereafter, that he was still wanted by the Metropolitan Police, Mr McGinty 
 
says in his second statement: “As set out in my earlier statement, I worked 
 
closely with the PPS in respect of this scheme and other matters. I am 
 
confident that if any  information came to the attention of the PPS, NIO or 
 
this office that there was some specific doubt about Mr Downey or any other 
 
individual on the list, the matter would have been looked at again. There was 
 
no intention by officials to mislead any individual into believing it was safe to 
 
return to the jurisdiction and then arresting them when they did. The

--------
consequences of that happening would have been serious and cast doubt on 
 
the whole process. It would call into question the status of all others who had 
 
been notified they were safe to return. In preparing for disclosure in the 
 
current case, counsel was given full access to all relevant files held by AGO, 
 
NIO, PPS and PSNI and other departments. I have been asked to comment on 
 
 
whether there was any further communication between PSNI and AGO 
 
regarding Mr Downey after 2008. There was not. I am equally confident that 
 
had information been passed to the PPS or NIO I would have been told. This 
 
was a difficult, time consuming and, in some ways, controversial process. Had 
 
it come to our attention that Mr Downey, or any other individual had wrongly 
 
 
been told they could return to the jurisdiction without fear of arrest, we 
 
would have had a major problem. I would have immediately informed the 
 
Attorney General and DPP (NI) and, in the circumstances, the CPS. I cannot 
 
speculate on what we may have done after this. It would have been a major 
 
incident and would have been reflected as such on our files and those of the 
 
PPS and NIO…”.

McGinty’s statement, states: “I have been made aware that John Downey, an 
 
 
“On The Run” applicant in July 2007 received a letter in the same terms as 
 
other persons at the same time. I have seen the letter, which in phraseology 
 
repeated in letters to many applicants previously, provides an assurance that 
 
he was not liable to arrest if he entered the jurisdiction. On its face it 
 
informed him that he was not wanted in the north of Ireland. Nor was there 
 
any interest from any other police force in the United Kingdom (on the basis 
 
of information from the PSNI). I confirm that was the assurance that was 
 
intended by the Government to be understood by the recipient of such 
 
letters… I note the internal communications in which requests for additional 
 
confirmation are made by officials at the Northern Ireland Office as to the 
 
exact position in relation to ten applicants of whom Mr Downey was one. In 
 
 
response the Northern Ireland Office is informed by the PSNI that all the 
 
names have been checked through the ICIS, the PNC and the An Garda 
 
Siochana computer systems. I note that the successive requests to ensure 
 
accuracy made by the Northern Ireland Office received confirmation of its 
 
understanding of Mr Sheridan’s letter, provided by a Detective Sergeant, a 
 
 
Staff Officer to the Assistant Chief Constable. The care with which the NIO 
 
sought to confirm its understanding is consistent with my experience of the 
 
way in which the scheme was and was required to be conducted and upon 
 
which the Government in its dealings with Sinn Fein on this issue depended. 
 
These were important assurances to be processed responsibly and carefully, 
 
issued in the name of the Government, intended by the Government to be 
 
reliable and anticipated as being relied upon… I have been asked to comment 
 
from the viewpoint of the Secretary of State had it been brought to my 
 
attention at any stage that a letter had been sent out by the Northern Ireland 
 
 
Office to Sinn Fein and to an individual which contained so serious an error. I 
   
am entirely sure that it would have been considered right and appropriate 
 
immediately to inform Sinn Fein that a letter had been provided that was

provided in error. I do not speculate as to what steps the prosecuting 
 
authorities would have taken, but as Mr McGinty rightly says, and as I can 
 
   
confirm, the British government did not intend individuals to be misled into 
 
 
believing they were safe to return to the jurisdiction and then be arrested. The 
 
 
opposite was the case; it was intended at all times that they should know 
 
with accuracy their position; hence the exceptional step taken from that time 
 
 
of the Weston Park talks and thereafter, of positively notifying Sinn Fein that 
 
 
particular individuals who had put their names forward were liable to arrest, 
 
an indication that no doubt allowed each to decide whether or not they might 
 
enter the jurisdiction in full knowledge of the risks if they did so. If despite 
 
what had been said in a letter to the contrary, Sinn Fein was thereafter 
 
informed that the individual concerned was still “wanted” he or she would 
 
have no doubt immediately been told; a transparent precautionary step 
 
would have in these exceptional circumstances been appropriately taken that 
 
would have allowed for the individual as well as the well being of the process 
 
as a whole to be protected from unintended risk, consistently with both the 
 
letter and spirit in which this unique scheme had been constructed. No 
 
mistake of such importance could or should have been permitted to have 
 
gone uncorrected. I am aware of how critically important it was throughout 
 
that most difficult of periods that promises made by and in the name of 
 
Government must be able to be taken at face value and adhered to. The 
 
underlying difficulty all had to overcome was the fear that any parties to the 
 
process, including the governments concerned, might make false promises or 
 
might not be true to their word. The entire record of the more than ten years 
 
of extraordinary and often almost impossible obstacles to progress reflects 
 
precisely this. The peace process is not one that was fixed at any moment of 
 
 
time, whatever the major milestones achieved. It was and is one that has 
 
required constant adherence on all sides to their undertakings. I continue to 
 
 
maintain a close interest in the progression of the political process in 
 
Northern Ireland and maintain close contact with many of those currently 
 
involved in Government. I am aware of the level of serious concern and 
 
uncertainty that this situation has engendered; I provide this statement in 
 
 
the hope that the Court might be assisted by my assessment of what each 
 
letter was intended by the Government to provide”.

In the summer of 2008, before travelling to Canada with his wife to 
 
visit his son and grandchild, the defendant (guided by the experience 
 
of his friend Danny Morrison) contacted the Canadian authorities to 
 
seek a temporary residence permit stating: “The reason for the above 
 
 
application is that I served a term of imprisonment in Portlaoise 
 
prison in the Irish Republic in 1974. [Please see enclosed police cert] I 
   
 
was named in some British newspapers as being responsible for the 
 
 
Hyde Park & Regents Park bombings in 1982, which I strenuously 
 
deny. No warrant was ever issued by the British authorities to have 
 
me extradited and I understand from contacts which have taken place

between the British and Sinn Fein that they, the British, have no 
 
further interest in me. I have strongly supported the peace process 
 
from the very beginning of the talks and I believe that the only way 
 
forward for all people on the island of Ireland north and south is in 
 
peaceful co‐operation and mutual respect and understanding for each 
 
 
other…” The application was granted and the defendant duly 
 
travelled to Canada. 
  
As part of playing a “central and significant role” in the development 
 
 
of greater understanding between Republican Ex prisoners and 
 
Loyalist ex prisoners he visited Londonderry on 4 April 2009 and 
 
Belfast on 7 November 2009. 
 
He travelled to and stayed on the mainland of the United Kingdom in 
 
 
February, March and April 2010, April 2011, November 2011, July 
 
2012 and January 2013 – all without incident. 
  
In 2012 he attended the National Commemoration of the Hunger 
 
Strikes which took place in Northern Ireland. 
 
As a continuation of being an active persuader for a peace strategy he 
 
 
led a Republican Group to two residential workshops with members 
 
of the Irish Border Security Personnel at the Corrymeela Peace Centre 
 
 
in Northern Ireland in November 2012 and March 2013.

2014, in a report from his GP and in the medical records which have been 
 
placed before the court. The conditions include, in particular, very high blood

Even where delay is unjustifiable, a permanent stay should be the 
 
exception rather than the rule; 
  
where there is no fault on the part of the complainant or the 
 
 
 
prosecution, it will be very rare for a stay to be granted; 
  
no stay should be granted in the absence of serious prejudice to the 
 
defence so that no fair trial can be held; 
 
when assessing possible serious prejudice, the judge should bear in 
 
mind his or her power to regulate the admissibility of evidence and 
 
that the trial process itself should ensure that all relevant factual 
 
issues arising from delay will be placed before the jury for their 
 
consideration in accordance with appropriate direction from the 
 
judge; 
 
if, having considered all these factors, a judge’s assessment is that a 
 
fair trial will be possible, a stay should not be granted.”

CF [2013] 1 WLR 2171 provides a helpful summary of the general principles to 
 
 
be applied, as follows: 
 
“91. In the present case it is common ground that we are concerned only 
 
with the second category of abuse. That limb is not related in any way to 
 
 
resulting unfairness in the ensuing proceedings. (See Warren per Lord Dyson 
 
 
at paragraph 35.) Its purpose is the more general one of protecting the 
 
integrity of the legal system and thereby maintaining the rule of law. 
  
 
92. The threshold for the second category of abuse is very high. The question 
 
 
for the court will be whether the court's sense of justice and propriety or 
 
public confidence in the justice system would be offended if the 
 
proceedings were not stayed. I do not understand Lord Dyson in Warren 
 
 
to qualify this very high threshold in any way. On the contrary his speech 
 
reaffirms it. 
  

 
 
 
 
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

93. To establish an abuse of process under the second category involves 
 

 
more than the satisfying of a threshold condition. It requires an 
 
evaluation of what has occurred in the light of competing public 
 
interests. In Latif Lord Steyn explained as follows:

--------
""The law is settled. Weighing countervailing considerations of policy and 
 
justice, it is for the judge in the exercise of his discretion to decide 
 
whether there has been an abuse of process, which amounts to an 
 
affront to the public conscience and requires the criminal proceedings to 
 
be stayed; R v Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court, ex parte Bennett 
 
[1994] 1 AC 42. Ex p Bennett was a case where a stay was appropriate 
 
because a defendant had been forcibly abducted and brought to this 
 
country to face trial in disregard of extradition laws. The speeches in Ex p 
 
 
 
Bennett conclusively established that proceedings may be stayed in the 
 
exercise of the judge's discretion not only where a fair trial is impossible 
 
but also where it would be contrary to the public interest in the integrity 
 
of the criminal justice system that a trial should take place. An infinite 
 
variety of cases could arise. The general guidance as to how the 
 
discretion should be exercised in particular circumstances would not be 
 
useful. But it is possible to say that in a case such as the present the 
 
judge must weigh in the balance the public interest in ensuring that 
 
 
those that are charged with grave crime should be tried and the 
 
competing public interest in not conveying the impression that the court 
 
 
 
will adopt the approach that the end justifies any means"". 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

94. The abuse jurisdiction is not of a disciplinary character. Thus in Bennett 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Lord Lowry observed (at p.47 H): 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

""Discretion to stay is not a disciplinary jurisdiction and ought not to be 
 
exercised in order to express the court's disapproval of official conduct. 
 
Accordingly, if the prosecuting authorities have been guilty of culpable 
 
delay but the prospect of a fair trial has not been prejudiced, the court 
 
ought not to stay the proceedings merely ""pour encourager les autres"". 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The same theme is taken up by Lord Dyson in his speech in Maxwell at 
 
paragraph 24 where he refers to Lord Lowry's speech in Bennett. 
 
Similarly in Warren the Board implicitly endorsed the observation of Lord 
 
 
Lowry in Bennett while adding, with reference to the decision of the 
 
Court of Appeal in R v Grant [2006] QB 60 to refuse to order a retrial, a 
 
 
decision which it considered incorrect: 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

""[I]t may not always be easy to distinguish between (impermissibly) 
 
granting a stay in order to express the court's disapproval of official 
 
conduct ""pour encourager les autres"" and (permissibly) granting a stay 
 
 
because it offends the court's sense of justice and propriety. But it is 
 
 
difficult to avoid the conclusion that in Grant the proceedings were 
 
 
stayed in order to express the court's disapproval of the police 
 
misconduct and to discipline the police"". (at para. 37). 
 
   
 
courts in performing this balancing exercise. However, Lord Steyn's 
 
words of caution against general guidance as to how the discretion 
 
should be exercised remain of critical importance. As Lord Dyson 
 
observed in Warren (at paragraph 36), the exercise of the discretion 
 

 
 
 

95. It is possible to identify factors which are often taken into account by the

--------
depends on the particular circumstances of each case and rigid 
 
classifications are undesirable. In the context of criminal proceedings the 
 
 
balance must always be struck between the public interest in ensuring 
 
that those that are accused of serious crime should be tried and the 
 
competing public interest in ensuring that executive conduct does not 
 
undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system and bring it 
 
 
into disrepute. With those warnings firmly in mind, it is appropriate to 
 
 
consider what factors have been considered in the authorities to be 
 
indications of abuse of process. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

96. The connection between the abuse of executive power and the 
 
 
 

 
proceedings which are said to be an abuse of process is likely to be a 
 
highly relevant consideration. Thus it will often be the case that but for 
 
 
the wrongful conduct the defendant would not be before the court at all. 
 
 
 
However, the existence of such a causative link is neither a pre‐condition 
 
nor a conclusive demonstration of abuse. It is simply a relevant 
 
consideration. Thus in Maxwell the majority considered that the fact that 
 
the confessions on which a retrial would be based would not have been 
 
made but for the misconduct was not determinative of whether there 
 
should be a retrial. Similarly in Warren Lord Dyson observed: 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

""The Board does not consider that the ""but for"" test will always or even 
 
in most cases necessarily determine whether a stay should be granted on 
 
 
 
the grounds of abuse of process. The facts of the present case 
 
demonstrate the dangers of attempting a classification of cases in this 
 
area of the law and disregarding the salutary words of Lord Steyn. For 
 
reasons which will appear, it is the Board's view that the Commissioner 
 
reached the right conclusion in this case, or at least a conclusion that he 
 
 
was entitled to reach. And yet it was accepted at all times by the 
 
prosecution that but for the unlawful and misleading misconduct of the 
 
 
Jersey Police in relation to the installation and use of the audio device, 
 
the prosecution in this case could not have succeeded and there would 
 
be no trial unless the police were able to obtain the necessary evidence 
 
by other (lawful) means."" (at paragraph 30). 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

97. Clearly the gravity of the misconduct and the degree of culpability on the 
 

 
 
part of the wrongdoers will be highly relevant in determining whether 
 
the threshold test has been satisfied and in which direction the balancing 
 
exercise should be resolved. In this regard the Secretary of State submits 
 
that as a matter of principle and authority actual knowledge of illegality 
 
is necessary. It is submitted that misconduct cannot be so grave as to 
 
amount to an affront to the public conscience unless it is deliberate. 
 
Furthermore it is submitted that the reported cases have been 
 
concerned not with conduct that was merely negligent or even reckless 
 
 
but rather with instances of deliberate and flagrant disregard of legal 
 
requirements. In addition it is submitted that there is no case in which 
 
the required level of misconduct has been established after arguments as 
 
 
to the precise nature and effect of foreign local law and attempts to

suggest that more enquiries should have been made by the authorities to 
 
establish its precise nature and effect. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

98. I accept that actual knowledge has often been a key element in 
 

   
establishing an abuse of process. For example, in R v Mullen [2000] QB 
 
520 the Court of Appeal recorded with approval the defendant's 
 
concession that proof of actual knowledge of illegality was required. 
  

 
   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

""Mr Mackay accepted that the burden of proving abuse of process is on 
 
the defendant and that knowledge on the part of the English authorities 
 
that local or international law was broken must be shown"" (at p. 529D). 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Similarly in Bennett Lord Griffiths stated the principle as follows: 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

""In my view your Lordships should now declare that where process of 
 
law is available to return an accused to this country through extradition 
 
procedures our courts will refuse to try him if he has been forcibly 
 
brought within our jurisdiction in disregard of these procedures by a 
 
 
 
process to which our own police, prosecuting or other executive 
 
authorities have been a knowing party"". (at p. 62G.) 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

99. However, it does seem to me that Mr O'Connor's approach in this regard 
 

 
is over‐prescriptive. A case involving actual knowledge of illegality will 
 
necessarily be regarded as a particularly serious matter. However, the 
 
objective of maintaining the integrity of the legal system can be achieved 
 
only by a consideration of the entirety of the conduct in question and 
 
untrammelled by any rigid rules. Moreover, as Mr O'Connor himself 
 
submits, there are many gradations of states of mind including actual 
 
knowledge, wilful blindness, constructive knowledge and recklessness. 
 
The court should be free to reflect these matters in its examination of 
 
 
each case in the round. There may be situations in which reckless or 
 
 
possibly even negligent conduct could justify a stay on grounds of abuse 
 
 
of process. Everything will depend on an analysis of the particular 
 
features of each case in its entirety. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

100.	  On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr O'Connor further submits that 
 

 
in a case of an alleged ""disguised extradition"" the party seeking to 
 
establish the abuse is required to prove not only a flagrant and knowing 
 
disregard of the law but also that the authorities colluded in or procured 
 
the deportation for some ulterior or wrongful purpose. I accept that it 
 
 
will usually be necessary to show that the UK authorities acted so as to 
 
 
procure the individual's removal to the United Kingdom. (R v Staines 
 
Magistrates' Court ex parte Westfallen [1998] 1 WLR 652.) However, I 
   
consider that here once again Mr O'Connor's suggested approach is 
 
unduly prescriptive. Clearly, the existence of a wrongful ulterior motive 
 
will be a highly relevant consideration. However the court must be free 
 
 
to consider the conduct in its entirety.

101.	 
In Warren the Board recognised that in abduction and entrapment 
 
cases the court will generally conclude that the balance favours a stay. 
 
However, it was at precisely this point in his speech (paragraph 26) that 
 
Lord Dyson warned against the undesirability of rigid classifications and 
 
emphasised the need to balance competing interests. Clearly it is 
 
insufficient to label a case as falling within a particular category. A 
 
 
challenge on grounds of abuse of process calls for a more refined analysis 
 
 
of the facts and the balancing of the competing interests. It is, however, 
 
instructive to observe the approach of the courts to abduction cases 
 
given the Respondents' contention that it is in substance what has 
 
happened to them in this case.”

It was common ground that although coming under the umbrella of the

Piu‐Wing v The Queen [1984] HKLR 411, R v Croydon justices, ex parte Dean

In Abu Hamza Lord Phillips CJ reviewed the authorities to date, and at para 54 
 
 
of the judgment said: “These authorities suggest that it is not likely to 
 
constitute an abuse of process to proceed with the prosecution unless (i) 
 
there has been an unequivocal representation by those with the conduct of 
 
 
the investigation or prosecution of a case that the defendant will not be 
 
prosecuted and (ii) that the defendant has acted on that representation to his 
 
 
detriment. Even then, if facts come to light which were not known when the 
 
representation was made, these may justify proceeding with the prosecution 
 
despite the representation”. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

It must however be noted that in Gripton, at para 27 of the judgement, the 
 
court observed: “Thirdly, so far as the approaches propounded in Bloomfield 
 
and Abu Hamza are concerned, we note that neither was intended by the 
 
court adopting it to be a comprehensive binding rule. In Bloomfield Staughton 
 
LJ expressly stated that the court was not seeking to establish any precedent 
 
or any general principle in regard to abuse of process. Similarly in Abu Hamza 
 
Lord Phillips CJ emphasised the difficulties of propounding a test of abuse of 
 
process, and the formulation adopted in that case is expressed in terms that 
 
conduct would be unlikely to constitute an abuse of process unless certain 
 
criteria were satisfied. He was certainly not laying down requirements which 
 
would be indispensable in any case. The reason for this is clear: the courts are 
 
here concerned with considerations of fairness and they must be free to 
 
respond to the circumstances of each case”.

is not possible for the defendant to receive a fair trial. He relied, amongst 
 
other things, on the following: 
 
(1) That the alleged offences took place more than thirty years ago. 
 
(2) That a significant part of that delay was caused by the decision not to seek 
 
extradition. 
 
(3) No identification parades or other form of independent testing of the 
 
identification evidence were undertaken at the material time (despite having 
 
been discussed with the Garda as early as 1983); the witness Mark Chrusciel 
 
is now dead; DC Kemp (the officer who obtained the artist’s impression of the 
 
 
defendant) can no longer remember the precise circumstances of doing so; 
 
 
the artist Worsley (who created that impression) is now dead; the 
 
“identification picture” referred to by the witness Phyllis McGowan cannot be 
 
 
found; the artist Waller who created an artist’s impression with McGowan 
 
(upon which there is a description that bears little relationship to McGowan’s 
 
statement) is also now dead; and there are various troubling aspects of the 
 
original police investigation (for example deliberate leaks to the press naming 
 
the defendant and another man called Sean O’Callaghan, who was in fact a 
 
police informant being given cover by the disclosure), that cannot be properly 
 
 
explored absent the lead investigator Detective Superintendent Lamper who 
 
 
is now also dead.

defendant’s Article 6 ECHR rights would not lead inexorably to a termination 
 
of the proceedings, Mr Blaxland argued on foot of Attorney General’s 
 
Reference (No.2 of 2001) (above) that the defendant was “substantially 
 
affected” within the meaning of Article 6 when he was deliberately blown to 
 
the press in the 1980’s, at which point he was “officially alerted” to the 
 
 
likelihood of criminal proceedings against him.

be fairly dealt with within the trial process – whether by way of the exclusion 
 
of evidence, or by appropriate directions to the jury, or by sitting hours which 
 
accommodated the defendant’s health problems.

that it is possible to give the defendant a fair trial. The trial process will 
 
ensure it. Although not critical, and for what it is worth, I also incline to the 
 
 
view that the defendant was not “officially alerted” in the 1980’s. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Second ground ‐ Submissions 
 
 
156.	  The essence of Mr Blaxland’s submission in relation to this ground was that, 
 
even if the defendant had received no written assurance in 2007 he (and the 
 
other cases not solvable by the administrative scheme) were subject to an 
 
ongoing commitment made by the UK Government since 2001 to take steps 
 
 
not to pursue prosecutions in cases to which the provisions of the early 
 
release scheme applied, such that it amounted to an affront to justice to 
 
 
prosecute the defendant for qualifying offences.

In this regard Mr Blaxland invited attention, amongst other things, to; 
 
 
(1) The Government’s sympathetic attitude towards OTRs throughout the 
 
 
 
post Good Friday Agreement negotiations. 
  
(2) The private commitments given – see e.g. May 2000 (paras 32 and 33 
 
above), January 2001 (para 45 above), and December 2006 (para 74 above).

prosecutions would not be pursued in respect of those whom (like the

towards OTRs and the general commitments and assurances given both 
 
privately and publicly came nowhere near making this prosecution an affront

I agree with Mr Altman’s submissions. Whilst I infer that the defendant was 
   
 
told about the private commitments, neither they nor the public assurances 
 
amounted to any sort of indication such as, in themselves, to make this 
 
prosecution one which, upon that limited ground, offends the court’s sense 
 
of justice. The balancing exercise in relation to this submission comes down 
 
in favour of the continuation of the prosecution. That is not, however, to say 
 
that the commitments and assurances are not relevant in relation to the third 
 
submission – they plainly are.

2225426,R v Daniel Crompton,"R v Daniel Crompton 

In the Crown Court at Manchester 

18 March 2014 

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Turner 

 

Daniel Crompton you have been found guilty of the murder of Frank Worsley: an innocent 

and defenceless 87 year old man. 

 

After an afternoon and evening of drinking and drug taking you ran out of money to fund 

further purchases of cocaine. You had already committed one despicable offence of burglary 

at the house of people known to you and whom you knew to be out. You used the proceeds 

from that burglary to buy cocaine.  

 

After midnight, you decided that you would offend again. 

 

Having had the opportunity to hear the evidence, I am satisfied that you formed the specific 

intention to carry out a second burglary to make more money to buy yet more drugs. I find 

that you chose Mr Worsley’s house because the bathroom window was open. I reject your 

story that you were intending to break into you mother-in-law’s house, which you believed 

to  be  unoccupied,  and  did  not  realise  that  you  were  in  the  wrong  house  until  you  first 

encountered Mr Worsley. You neither knew nor cared if the house were occupied, so great 

was  your  craving  for  further  cocaine.  The  open  window  provided  the  opportunity.  Your 

craving for drugs provided the motive. 

  

The fact that you were already under the heavy influence of alcohol and cocaine dulled your 

senses to the likely consequences which, in this case, could hardly have turned out to have 

been more serious. 

 

 

1
--------
Your state of mind is amply evidenced by your reaction when Mr Worsley, still in his own 

bed and wakened by your intrusion into his bedroom in the middle of the night, told you to 

leave. You demanded to know where he kept his money. 

 

Moreover,  I  am  satisfied  from  the  evidence  that  you  proceeded  to  hit  him  in  the  face  on 

more than one occasion when he refused to tell you in an effort to beat the information out 

of him. You used your fist wrapped in your top. I am in no doubt that the use of the top was 

solely to protect your hand and not to mitigate the harm to Mr Worsley. 

 

This assault caused diffuse axonal brain damage and a sub-dural haematoma. The force of 

the  blows  was  at  a  level  to  be  expected  to  be  consistent  with  such  as  would  be  likely  to 

cause  concussion.    Regrettably,  the  treatment  for  the  haematoma  in  hospital  involved 

increasing  the  risk  of  the  formation  of  blood  clots  by  reversing  the  effects  of  the  blood 

thinning  drugs  which  Mr  Worsley  was  taking  for  his  heart  condition.  Clots  formed  and 

lodged in his brain causing two major strokes leading on to deterioration and death. 

 

You on the other hand, while Mr Worsley was on his way to hospital, were busily spending 

the money you had taken from him on yet more cocaine. 

 

But for your carelessness in leaving a handprint at Mr Worsley’s address, you might have got 

away with it. 

 

After  your  arrest,  you  showed  no  initial  remorse  and  did  not  co-operate  with  the  police 

choosing instead to offer no comment interviews. 

 

Your attack on Mr Worsley was as brutal as it was cowardly. The jury has found that when 

you attacked Mr Worsley you intended to cause really serious injury. This attack caused Mr 

Worley’s death and so you are guilty of murder. 

 

There is only one sentence for murder. It is life imprisonment. 

 

But the law requires me to fix the period which must pass before you are eligible for release 

on licence, or to decide that you should never be released. 

 

 

2
--------
The minimum term which I will impose should not be confused with a determinate sentence 

of the same length. Because a determinate prisoner is released at the half way point in his 

sentence, a life sentence with a minimum term is the equivalent of a determinate sentence 

of  double  that  length.  So  for  instance,  a  25  year  minimum  term  is  the  equivalent  of  a 

determinate sentence of 50 years.  

 

And there are two further important differences. A determinate prisoner knows that he will 

be released at the half way point. Someone sentenced to life imprisonment, as you will be, 

will  have  no  guarantee  of  release  once  the  minimum  term  has  passed.  It  will  be  for  the 

Parole  Board  at  that  stage  to  say  if  it  will  be  safe  for  you  to  be  set  free.  And,  even  then, 

freedom will be relative. You will remain on licence for the rest of your life. If you commit 

another offence or otherwise breach your licence, you may be re‐detained. 

 

Under paragraph 5(1) of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 Act where the court 

considers that the seriousness of the offence is particularly high and the offender is over the 

age of 18 then the appropriate starting point is 30 years. Under Paragraph 5(2), cases which 

would  normally  fall  within  this  category  include  a murder  done  for  gain  such  as a  murder 

done in the course or furtherance of robbery or burglary. 

 

It is important to recognise that use of the word “normally” means that not every murder 

done  in  the  course  or  furtherance  of  robbery  or  burglary  automatically  attracts  a  starting 

point of 30 years. 

 

As the Lord Chief Justice observed in R v Cole [2008] EWCA Crim 1060: 

 

“We are concerned that at the sentencing hearing there appears to have been a somewhat 

mechanistic or arithmetical approach in this case, an approach perhaps encouraged by the 

terms  of  Schedule  21.  Schedule  21  is  intended  to  provide  general  guidance  to  the 

assessment  of  the  seriousness  of  an  offence.  The  factors  set  out  in  paragraph  5(2)  are 

factors  which  will  normally  lead  the  court  to  conclude  that  the  offence  was  one  of 

particularly  high  seriousness.  If  it  does,  then  the  section  lays  down  a  starting  point  for 

arriving at the minimum term of 30 years. But whether the court starts at 15 or 30 years, the 

sentencing exercise requires an assessment of the seriousness, having regard to the facts of 

 

3
--------
the particular case; and that can result, quite properly, in a sentence that is some distance 

from the starting point that has been taken.” 

 

Further,  the  case  of  Bouhaddaou  [2006]  EWCA  Crim  3190  emphasises  the  seriousness  of 

murders committed in the furtherance of burglary. 

 

In this case I am of the view that the element of gain in this case was not one which goes to 

the  heart  of  the  your  culpability  and  bearing  in  mind  the  lack  of  premeditation  and  the 

relatively low sums involved I am not satisfied that paragraph 5(1) is engaged. 

 

I take, therefore, the starting point to be that of 15 years but having done so must go on to 

weigh the aggravating and mitigating features. 

 

Particular aggravating features: 

 

 

1.  The advanced age of your victim. 
2.  The fact that the attack took place in his home at night. 
3.  The fact that your selfish motive was gain. (Although the significance of this element 
does not serve to put the case in the 30 year category it still falls to be taken into 

account as a serious aggravating factor at the lower starting point). 

4.  Your previous convictions. 

Particular mitigating features: 

 

 

1.  Lack of premeditation. 
2.  Lack of intent to kill. 
3.  Your relative youth. 
4.  The evidence of albeit late-flowering remorse when in custody awaiting trial.  

The case of Cole, which I remind myself is not a guideline case and provides no more than a 

pointer,  also  involved  a  fatal  attack  perpetrated  by  a  drug  addict  upon  a  pensioner  living 

alone. The Court of Appeal raised the minimum term of 18 years imposed by the trial judge 

to one of 22 years. 

 

 

4
--------
The circumstances of that case were different to this in this case in a number of respects: 

 

1. 

It involved a far more sustained and physically violent attack. There were 24 injuries 

to head and neck alone 

2.  The perpetrator disconnected his victim’s telephone after the attack. 
3.  The  murder  had  been  preceded  by  a  protracted  and  pitiless  fraud  perpetrated  by 

the defendant upon his victim in the period up to the attack. 

4.  The defendant was older than you are. 
 

Taking  a  starting  point  of  15  years,  I  find  that  the  aggravating  features  outweigh  the 

mitigating  features  in  your  case  to  the  extent  that  the  minimum  tern  should  be  adjusted 

upwards  to  one  of  18  years.  On  counts  two  and  three  the  sentence  is  one  of  eighteen 

months imprisonment on each allowing for credit of one third for the guilty pleas. These run 

concurrently to each other and to the sentence for murder.  

 

You will be given credit for such time as you have already spent in custody and will pay the 

victim surcharge. 

 

You may take him down.

R. v. Michael David Souter. 
 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Sentencing remarks of HHJ Mark Lucraft QC, 31st October 2013. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 

1.  On Thursday 17th October 2013 the jury convicted you on all but two of the 28 

counts you faced on the indictment in this case. 

 
2.  Counts 1 to 19 covered abuse by you on seven separate people – each at the 
time a young boy aged between 11 and 16.   These counts spanned periods of 
time from 1979 to 1981, 1988 to 1994 and 1998 to 1999. 

3.  Counts 20 to 28 concerned a number of indecent images found on your 

computers following your arrest in 2011 and further arrest in 2012.   You were 
convicted of being in possession of five images and the making of two others.  
The images were at levels, 1, 3 and 5 of the levels of seriousness adopted by 
the Courts – 5 images at level 1, 1 image at level 3 and 1 image at level 5.  
You were acquitted of one count of possession of an indecent image and I 
discharged the jury from returning a verdict on another count of possession of 
an indent image. 

4.  Count 1 was an indecent assault by you on A.  He had come to your home to 
wash your car.  Aged 14 to 15 he had a Saturday job with Radio Norfolk and 
had met you through that job.  After washing your car when he was aged 15 or 

1
--------
16 you gave him alcohol to drink.  He then felt the effects of alcohol and had 
to lie down.  Whilst he was lying down you assaulted him by touching his 
penis and beginning to masturbate him.   

5.  Count 2 concerned B - a boy then aged 16 who was a member of the Venture 

Scouts in Norwich.   You went with him on a cycling trip and indecently 
assaulted him whilst the two of you were spending the night at a Scout camp.   
Again there was some alcohol on this trip and the assault involved you 
touching his genitals and masturbating them.  Those two incidents took place 
in the period between March 1979 and December 1981. 

6.  Counts 3 and 4 are specimen counts covering your actions in getting another 

young boy then aged between 11 and 15 – C - to masturbate you until you 
ejaculated.   Those events took place between 1988 and 1993.  C was someone 
who met you through his parents who had connections with you through 
scouting.  He was someone you took on trips to various sites including football 
matches and then to your caravan.   Whilst he was staying with you in the 
caravan you began to abuse him – the abuse starting with tickling or touching 
and leading to him masturbating you.    

7.  You were someone that his parents looked up to and trusted.   They had no 

reason to doubt your motives in caring for their son.  He spoke about 
continuing events between you and him after he was 16.  After he was 16 he 
had begun to perform oral sex on you.   It had become expected of him that he 
would perform such acts on you. 

8.  Counts 5 to 10 cover the abuse by you of a person called D.  Between the ages 
of 11 and 16 you sexually abused him.   You acted as an adult mentor to him.  
He was someone who had no father figure in his life until you came along.   
His account is like so many of the others in this case.   You were someone 
who was kind to him initially, someone who was able to show him things and 
take him to events that he had not seen as part of normal growing up.   You 
used your status as a man involved in local radio and as someone who was 

2
--------
looked upon in society as a role, to get him – as with the others – to trust you, 
and someone who the parents of these boys trusted. 

9.  What you did to D was to abuse him from an early age – you started by 

touching him and then to masturbating him, then getting him to masturbate 
you and then between the ages of 12 and 14 you committed buggery on him.   
The counts that concern abuse on him are all specimen counts.  Whenever he 
was staying at your home you would assault him and commit buggery on him.   
The abuse covered in counts 5 to 10 spanned the period from June 1989 to 
June 1991.  He could not give a precise number to the occasions when you 
committed buggery on him – in evidence he said 10 to 12 times. 

10. Counts 11 to 17 concern E.  In 1991 you applied to adopt E and he lived with 
you as your adopted son for about 2 years.   In September 1993 he complained 
to the Social Services and to the police that he had been sexually assaulted by 
you.   He claimed the abuse took the form of touching, masturbation, oral sex 
and buggery.  There was an investigation by the police.   You were arrested 
and interviewed. You denied any abuse of E.  On 30th September 1993 the 
Crown Prosecution Service made the decision not to proceed with any 
criminal charges.   The Local Authority made an application for a Care Order.  
The grounds for the application were two fold: the allegations of sexual abuse, 
and the lack of co-operation from you in planning for E’s future.   In due 
course a Care Order was made by the County Court.   There was no fact 
finding exercise conducted by the County Court into of the allegations of 
abuse made by E.     

11. There was a further investigation in 2002.  That second investigation 

proceeded no further than the taking of some statements.  You were not 
arrested nor interviewed at that time.   It was believed that you were living 
abroad at the time – a fact that you disputed in the course of this trial.   

12. In 2010 E made a further statement to the police.   The police returned to 

speak to him following the complaint made by D.  Thankfully on this occasion 
more extensive enquiries were made what led – in due course to this trial. 

3
--------
13. The account that E gave was of abuse starting just before he went to bed, and 
abuse that started with ticking, touching of the penis, then masturbation, you 
performing oral sex on him and then getting him to do the same to you.   You 
then committed buggery on him.   This was so frequent an occurrence he 
could not say how many times it happened.   You also caused him to bugger 
you. 

14. The abuse took place in a number of locations.   As with the other boys you 

abused, you would taken them on trips away – both within the UK and abroad.  
The counts that concern E spanned the period from December 1990 – so prior 
to the formal adoption by you of him – through to late 1992 or early 1993.  His 
initial complaint was in September 1993 and he said then that things had 
ceased some months before that. 

15. Count 18 deals with an indecent assault by you on F.  He was 14 when you 

abused him.   He stayed at your home and – as with so many of the others – at 
bedtime you called him through to your room and touched his penis and then 
masturbated him after he had masturbated you.   This incident occurred after 
he – and his mother – had made statements in support of you as part of the 
Care proceedings conducted following the revelations made by E in 1993. 

16. Count 19 deals with indecent assault on G.  He is one of the younger brothers 
of D.  While you were looking after his brother he would tag along.  After you 
stopped having contact with D, G continued to see you and in that period you 
took him to a caravan at Kelling Heath when he was aged 14 and suggested he 
should get into bed with you.  You rubbed yourself against him and thrust 
yourself towards him.   Compared to many of the other assaults in this case, 
this was a less serious assault.   However, it has many similar hallmarks to the 
other instances of abuse in this case. 

17. You denied each one of these allegations.   You accepted having sexual 
contact with just one of these boys – C, but only after he was 16.   Your 
evidence of contact with him was bizarre.   You described your position as 

4
--------
having been a surrogate father to him and yet developing a sexual relationship 
with him.   His account – which is one that I accept – was of sexual contact 
happening between the ages of 11 and 15 and continuing after he was 16 – it 
was something that became expected of him.   In evidence he said it was never 
forced – he was persuaded or cajoled into doing it.    

18. In relation to the allegations made by E – the boy you adopted - you sought to 
put the blame on to him – alleging that he made sexual advances towards you.   

19. These 19 counts cover a most appalling catalogue of abuse.  These were 

breaches of trust of the grossest kind.   The already damaged childhood of 
many of your victims was destroyed, and their lives blighted.  Your conduct 
was persistent and prolonged.   You are someone who enjoyed a position of 
some power and authority.    

20. It is clear to me having listened to each of the witnesses give evidence that you 

exploited your position to groom each of them – to cajole them – to achieve 
your own sexual gratification with them.    Your role as a ‘Link-Up’ carer to 
one of these victims, as an adopting father to another and a Scout leader to 
others – displays a breach of trust that is almost impossible to fathom.  As was 
clear from the evidence of E, the abuse of him had started before the formal 
adoption was approved. 

21. There were others – not covered within these counts - who were also abused 
by you.   You took hundreds of photographs of boys in shorts with their legs 
spread.   You were the only person in this court who could not see those 
photographs for what they are.   It is clear that you have a troubling interest in 
young boys.   The parents of many of the boys you photographed would be 
deeply troubled by the images.   It is clear that the parents were totally 
unaware of your deviant interest. 

22. You used your status working for the BBC, working for the local football club 

and with the Scouting organisation to meet, groom and then to abuse these 
boys. Many of your victims spoke about your status as a local celebrity – 

5
--------
introducing them to footballers and to well known people – taking them out to 
places they had never been to before.   Many of them spoke about how freely 
available alcohol was in your home. 

23. Your defence has involved alleging that each of those you abused has 

concocted an account, that each has worked with the others to bring you down 
and to make money out of you.   It takes enormous courage to be prepared to 
disclose abuse of this kind – and even greater courage to give evidence of 
these matters in a court.   For many it took many years to summon up the 
courage to do so – but they did so, and gave compelling accounts. 

24. The evidence against you on these counts was overwhelming and the jury 

rightly rejected your pathetic attempts to blame the victims and others. 

25. I have seen a number of Victim Impact Statements.  The 5 statements I have 

seen are from your victims and also from the mother of a victim.   Each 
statement sets out the impact the abuse and the process of the trial has had on 
them.   One of them speaks about the impact on them of your use of the media 
to declare your innocence and also of your stance in the trial.   “However, 
seeing him on camera trying to manipulate the media when first in court “I’m 
going to prove my innocence” and throughout the trial accusing us of lying, 
the police of planting evidence and even the barristers and the judge colluding 
against him, brought a real fear throughout that somehow he would walk free 
and all the guilt would land back on me.   From his manner displayed in court 
you might be able to imagine how a boy could be controlled by him and 
unable to speak out against him”    At the end of the same statement he says:  
“I had hoped that a guilty verdict would have finally allowed me to bring 
closure to this and release the burden I’ve carried for so long.  But it hasn’t 
really.   I have been able to talk about it with a few people since the verdict 
and been overwhelmed by the kindness and understanding I’ve received (and 
also their shock/surprise that I was a victim).   I even talked to my mum about 
it for the first time the day after I was in court – a few tears were shed.   
Souter’s insistence that he is innocent and this is all lies and conspiracy has 
not allowed full release and closure sadly.”  

6
--------
26. Many speak of the guilt they feel in others being abused by you.   A number 
speak about needing counselling help and assistance.   One puts it concerns 
this way:  “Problems with trust, intimacy and sexual difficulties began to 
slowly decline 12 years after the abuse had stopped, yet failure to form long-
term meaningful relationships continues to be problematic and is another 
reason for seeking therapy.”   

27. The images found on your computers when they were searched, show that you 

continue to have an obsession with young boys.   The dates on the counts 
cover 2010 to 2012.   For example, the image the subject of count 21 – a level 
5 image was found on the hard drive of a computer seized on 6th March 2012.  
The file containing the image was created on 1st January 2012 using data 
backup software called ‘Genie Timeline’.    The images the subject of counts 
22 and 23 were sent attached to an e-mail addressed to you using the e-mail 
address [redacted] and was dated 5th May 2011.  Those images were found on 
a computer seized on 8th June 2011 and the accompanying e-mail referred to 
10 pictures for you and to scouts.  All of the images were of boys or young 
men with their erect penises exposed.    

28. All of the files where the images concerned in the counts in the indictment 

were found were all active files that had not been deleted.    

29. The jury had before them numerous e-mails and other documents from your 
computers that you sought to explain away as adult fantasies.   In evidence 
you suggested that someone was sending you this material for malicious 
reasons.   The e-mail traffic produced in the course of your evidence showed 
that these images were coming to your active e-mail addresses and in many 
instances you were responding to the items sent to you.  

30. Documents and chat logs in your possession as well as the e-mails show this 

continuing deviant interest in young boys.  In your evidence you sought to 
portray all of this material as ‘normal’ adult chat.   These so called fantasies 
displayed a worrying interest in meeting young boys, and of wanting to do the 

7
--------
most appalling things to them.   I do not accept that all of this material is you 
speaking to other adults with the most worrying of obsessions, but you seeking 
thrills from people foolish enough to converse with you on e-mail, and of an 
on-going sexual interest in young boys. 

31. Following your conviction I adjourned sentence to consider sentence and to 
have the benefit of a pre-sentence report to assist in the consideration of the 
question of whether you pose a significant risk of serious harm from the 
commission of future specified offences by you.   

32. I have before me the decision of the Court of Appeal in R. v. H [2011] EWCA 

Crim 2753 and also the decision of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Stannard & 
Others [2008] EWCA Crim 2789.  Mr Hill has also brought to my attention 
the case of R. v. N from the court of Appeal on 13th November 2012.  

33. Counts 1 to 19 represent conduct between 1979 and 1999.   Counts 21 to 26 

and 28 conduct between August 2010 and January 2012.  The conduct 
comprised by counts 1 to 19 is different in nature to that in counts 21 to 26 and 
28.   There is no allegation of any assault on anyone since 1999 – now some 
14 years ago and the last incident of buggery took place in 1992 – now some 
20 years ago. 

34. Indecent assault on a male person contrary to section 15 of the Sexual 
Offences Act 1956, Indecency with a Child contrary to section 1 of the 
Indecency with Children Act 1960, the Possession of Indecent Photographs of 
a Child contrary to section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the 
Making of Indecent Photographs of a Child contrary to section 1(1)(a) of the 
Protection of Children Act 1978 are all listed in Schedule 15 of the Criminal 
Justice Act 2003 as specified offences – offences of buggery contrary to 
section 12 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 – for some reason are not in that 
schedule.  Some of the offences are not classified as serious offences by virtue 
of the maximum terms. 

8
--------
35. As the authorities I have referred to make clear, I need to consider the question 

of dangerousness – is there a significant risk of serious harm from future 
specified offences committed by you?  Serious harm means death or serious 
personal injury whether physical or psychological.  In making that assessment 
I can – and should consider all of the matters before the court – the entirety of 
the conduct. 

36. I also have before me the definitive guideline of the Sentencing Guidelines 

Council which covers offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.   

37. The conduct in the counts of buggery would be categorised as rape within the 

current guidelines.   In the language of the guidelines these six counts of 
buggery – each a specimen count – come with the top level of repeated rape of 
the same victim over a course of time or rape involving multiple victims.  
Here there are two victims aged between 12 and 13 and 13 and 14.   The 
starting point for sentence provided in the current guidelines is one of 15 
years’ imprisonment and the range 13 to 19 years’ imprisonment.   The current 
guidelines on rape list additional aggravating factors.  Some apply here.  For 
example, offender ejaculated or caused victim to ejaculate, a background of 
coercion, the use of alcohol or treats. 

38. Of the eleven counts of indecent assault ten involve conduct that is categorised 
in the current guidelines as contact between the naked genitalia of the offender 
and another part of the victim’s body or contact with genitalia of the victim by 
you - the offender – using part of your body other than the genitalia, or an 
object.  Some of the victims were aged under 13 and some between 13 and 16 
at the date of these offences.  The current guidelines give a start point of 2 
years’ custody if the victim is under 13 and a sentencing range of between 1 
and 4 years custody, and a start point of 12 months custody when the victim is 
aged 13 or over and a range of sentencing of between 26 weeks and 2 years 
custody when the victim is aged over 13.   It has to be noted that the maximum 
sentence for sexual assault is 14 years, whereas the maximum sentence that 
applies to each of the eleven counts of indecent assault in this indictment is 10 
years. 

9
--------
39. In relation to counts 3 and 4, the conduct in those two counts is also to be 
considered within the current guidelines as sexual assault.   C who is the 
subject of those two counts was aged between 11 and 15 at the time – and 
again these are specimen counts.   

40. The current guidelines on sexual assault list additional aggravating factors.  

Some apply here.  For example, offender ejaculated or caused victim to 
ejaculate, and the use of alcohol to facilitate the offence. 

41. In relation to the images, the current guidelines set out a starting point of 26 

weeks custody for possession of a small number of images at level 4 or 5. 

42. I have already stated that the maximum sentence for indecent assault on a 

male person at the time when the offences were committed (11 of the counts 
on this indictment) was one of 10 years imprisonment.   For buggery (6 of the 
counts) it was life.  For indecency with a child (2 counts) the maximum 
sentence was one of 2 years imprisonment.    

43. The pre-sentence report makes clear that you maintain your innocence to these 

charges and has within it the results of analysis on the likelihood of re-
offending. 

44. In mitigation Mr Hill urges that a determinate sentence is the most appropriate 

way of dealing with you.  He refers to your age and makes reference to the 
charitable and other good works you have done in your time.   Whatever the 
sentence he makes the point that you will spend the bulk of your final years in 
prison.   

45. I have considered the question of dangerousness, and the application of the 

test.  The test is this:  Is the court of the opinion that there is a significant risk 
of serious harm from future specified offences committed by the offender?  In 
my view there is a clear risk of the commission by you of further specified 
offences, and that is a risk which in the light of the material from 2010 

10
--------
onwards as well as all of the earlier conduct is properly to be assessed as a 
high one.   In terms of serious harm, that includes serious psychological injury.  
The key question is whether that part of the test – serious harm is met? 

46. In considering the applicability of the issue of dangerousness I take into 
account that the more recent conduct is different in nature to the earlier 
conduct, and that there the last count of indecent assault was 14 years ago and 
the last count of buggery 20 years ago.  The e-mails and other material from 
your computer display an on-going sexual obsession in young boys.  The 
images covered in the counts on the indictment are mostly of level one, and 
other images that were found but not included as counts on the indictment 
were also mostly level one.   As was clear from the jury decision on count 27 
and what they had indicated about count 20, some of the images are of those 
on the boundary between 17 and 18.   I take the view that you are someone 
who if not incarcerated would poses a high risk of the commission of specified 
offences, but have come to the view that the test about significant risk and 
serious harm is not met. 

47. I have also considered the question of the imposition of a sentence of life 
imprisonment for the offences of buggery.   The offences of buggery carry 
with them a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.   I have given lengthy 
consideration as to whether those offences in themselves are so serious and 
grave as to warrant the imposition of life imprisonment.   Again on this issue I 
have to take into account that the offences of buggery took place between 
1989 and 1992 – now some 20 years or so ago, as well as the fact that the most 
recent of the assault matters was in 1998 or 1999 – now some 14 or 15 years 
ago.   

48. There has to be a concern for public protection from someone such as you.  It 

seems to me that the appropriate way to address that concern here is in the 
length of the overall determinate sentence I should pass. 

49. There are a number of complainants and their complaints could be dealt with 

by imposing consecutive sentences.  If I was to do so I would have to have 

11
--------
regard to the overall length of the sentence appropriate in your case.   
Alternatively, I can consider the overall conduct reflected on the counts – 
particularly having regard to the offences of buggery - and pass concurrent 
sentences on the other matters.    

50. On each of counts 1 [this was victim A and I have taken his age as 16 when the 

incident happened] and 2 [victim B aged 16] there will be a sentence of 18 
months’ imprisonment.   On each of counts 3 and 4 [specimen counts when 
victim C aged 11 to 15] there will be a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment.   

51. On counts 5 and 6 [specimen counts when D aged 12] there will be sentences 

of 3 years’ imprisonment on each count.  On count 10 [a specimen count D 
aged 13] there will be a sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment.   On counts 7, 8 
and 9 [the first occasion when buggery took place and two specimen counts of 
buggery - each D aged 12 and 13] there will be sentences of 22 years’ 
imprisonment on each count.    

52. On counts 11, 15 and 16 [the specimen counts of buggery - each of them E 
when aged 13 and 14] there will be sentences of 22 years’ imprisonment on 
each count.  On counts 12, 13 [specimen counts of assaults on E aged 13 in 
each count] there will be sentences of 2 years imprisonment on each count and 
on counts 14 and 17 [specimen counts of assaults E aged 14 and 15 
respectively] a sentence of 18 months on each count.    

53. On count 18 [F aged 15] there will be a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment 

and on count 19 [G aged 14] a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment.   

54. On counts 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 28 there will be a sentence of 6 months 

imprisonment on each count.    

55. All of these sentences are to be concurrent to each other making the total 

sentence one of 22 years’ imprisonment.   

12
--------
56. Unless released earlier under supervision you will serve one half of that 

sentence in custody.  You will then be released on licence for the remainder of 
your sentence.   While you are on licence you must comply with all its 
conditions.  At any time it may be withdrawn and your return to custody 
ordered.    

57. There will be an order disqualifying you from working with children – that 

order will be for an indefinite period. 

58. The prosecution costs. The prosecution seek an order for costs.   The amount 
sought covers the expense of the preparation and presentation of the trial.  The 
amount sought is £18,694.08.   In the course of the trial it was clear that you 
own a number of properties in the UK and abroad and it seems to me that you 
are someone who has the means to pay the costs.     That is to be paid within 8 
months of today.

The circumstances of the murder of Bijan Ebrahimi (and the subsequent burning of his body) 
 
are deeply shocking. 
 
 
Ben Ebrahimi (as he was known locally) was a single man of Iranian origin, who lived alone, 
 
and kept to himself. It was partly because of this that some his neighbours came to view him 
 
with suspicion. He had moved to this country in 2001; and had lived in a ground floor flat at 
 
88 Capgrave Crescent for about 6 years. Among his neighbours were the two of you. You 
 
(Lee James) lived at No.82 with your partner and 3 children; and you (Stephen Norley) lived 
 
at  No.84.  Each  of  the  flats  had  doors  at  ground  level,  and  looked  out  onto  a  piece  of 
 
communal open ground. 
  
 
Witnesses speak of disputes between Mr Ebrahimi and some of his neighbours. One of the 
 
complaints against him was that he took photographs or video films of people in the open 
 
area outside the flats. 
 
 
There were accusations that he was filming children. He explained that he was gathering 
 
evidence about the anti‐social behaviour of some of these neighbours. 
  
 
On Thursday 11 July (three days before he was murdered) You (James) were complaining 
 
that he was spending too long watering the plants outside his flat, and using this as an 
 
excuse to look at children. You entered his flat and threatened him. He called the police; 
 
and you (in turn) spoke to a Police Community Support Officer, who happened to be in the 
 
vicinity. You raised your complaints about him looking at your children, saying words to the 
 
effect that, if the Police wouldn’t deal with it, you would; and that you were not scared of 
 
being arrested or sent to prison. You were warned not to take matters into your own hands 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
Two police officers arrived and made enquiries. They left to make some investigations back 
 
at the police station and then returned to Capgrave Crescent. When they saw you, you were 
 
highly aggressive. You told them that there was no point since they would not do anything 
 
about it; and that you would protect your kids by making sure that he could not anything 
 
 
like this again. 
 
 
Two  witnesses  heard  you  threatening  to  kill  him.  You  (Norley)  were  seen  trying  to  calm 
 
things down. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eventually the officers decided to arrest Mr Ebrahimi rather than you. It was said to be for 
 
 
his own safety. 
  
 
Some of the neighbours cheered when they saw him being led from his home in handcuffs. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

In fact it is now clear that Mr Ebrahimi’s filming was directed at you (James) and not your 
 
children.  He told  the  officers  that he  was filming  you  because  you  were  drinking cans  of 
 
lager all the time and making a mess. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

The fixed and removable memory recovered from his camera shows that, although children 
 
were in shot, they were not the object of any special interest. The footage also shows you 
 
(James) entering his flat and threatening him, until you were pulled away by your partner. 
 
 
By  the  next  morning,  Friday  12  July,  the  police  were  satisfied  that  Mr  Ebrahimi  had  not 
 
committed any offence. He was released and went home, having been given advice about 
 
how his filming might be perceived. During the course of that evening he made several calls 
 
 
to the police reporting the continuing hostility of his neighbours and seeking assistance. 
 
 
I make it clear that the quality of decisions of the police (either in relation to the arrest of 
 
 
Mr Ebrahimi, his release or the response for his requests for help) is not a matter for this 
 
 
Court. I am concerned with your acts and your culpability for what occurred. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

In the early hours of Saturday 13 July, Mr Ebrahimi emailed the beat manager to say that he 
 
 
was being called nasty things and that he did not feel safe staying in his home. 
 
 
During the course of that afternoon, a number of people (which included the two of you) 
 
assembled in the communal area outside the flats. By the late afternoon this group (fuelled 
 
by  the  consumption  of  alcohol)  had  become  noisy,  and  were  making  aggressive  remarks 
 
towards  Mr  Ebrahimi,  who  remained  in  his  flat  throughout  the  day.  These  remarks 
 
(intended to be heard by him) were similar to what had been said before: that he was a 
 
paedophile.

--------
They were as baseless then as they always had been. 
 
 
At  some  stage  it  is  clear  you  (James)  decided  to  take  the  matter  further.  You  told  your 
 
 
partner to go into the flat and you locked the front door. 
 
 
It is still unclear how your victim came to be killed. 
 
 
The  hanging  basket and the  tubs  outside  his  flat  were  later  found  to have  been recently 
 
watered; and it seems he may have come out of his flat to water them when he thought it 
 
was safe to do it. 
 
 
The account that you gave to the police in a subsequent interview was that you were about 
 
to go back into your flat when you saw him come out and walked over to him. You said you 
 
told  him  to  stop  staring  at  your  children;  and  he  played  dumb,  and  then  said  something 
 
about one of his daughter’s dresses. According to your account, you pushed him, and he 
 
 
then made a remark about nappies, at which point you pushed, punched and kicked him. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

I consider it extremely unlikely that he in fact said or did anything which might have roused 
 
 
you  to  violence.  He  would  have  heard  you  and  others  shouting  abuse,  which  included 
 
accusations that he was a paedophile, together with threats that he did not deserve to live. 
 
What is very much more likely is that, affected as you were by alcohol, you misinterpreted 
 
whatever he said; however, it is unnecessary to form a view about this, because it does not 
 
affect the sentence. 
 
 
You described to the police how when he went to the ground you continued to punch him 
 
and to kick him. 
 
 
At some point what was happening was noticed by his neighbours 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One of them heard a voice shouting angrily, twice: ‘I am going to kill you. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Another  witness  saw  you  outside  in  the  communal  area,  repeatedly  stamping  on  your 
 
victim’s head. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You (Norley) were standing nearby. I accept that there is independent evidence that at one 
 
point you intervened to stop James from delivering more punches to the head; and there is 
 
no evidence that you were involved in the fatal assault.

--------
However it is clear that you both set about burning the body. You (Norley) got hold of some 
 
White Spirit; and the pair of you dragged his body out of the Communal area, onto a grassed 
 
 
piece of ground on the edge of Whitmore Avenue. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There you set fire to the body, before running back to the flats, and taking steps to get rid of 
 
 
the clothes you had been wearing, and the incriminating material which was on them. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Paramedics arrived at 0136 on the morning of Sunday 14 July, the body of your victim was 
 
 
still burning, and the fire had to be put out with a fire extinguisher. 
  
 
The post mortem examination revealed multiple heavy blows to the face and head, which 
 
 
may have led directly to his death, or may have caused him to die of asphyxia from inhaled 
 
 
blood. It appears that his body was set alight after death. 
 
 
When you returned to your flat, you (James) told your partner that you had taken care of 
 
things. You were arrested soon after, charged with the murder of Mr Bijan Ebrahimi, and 
 
pleaded guilty to the murder, effectively at the first opportunity. 
 
 
You (Norley) did not answer questions during your police interview; but you too pleaded 
 
guilty to assisting an offender at what I treat as the first opportunity. 
 
 
You (James) are 24; with a record for minor offences. 
  
 
You (Norley) are 25 with no previous convictions. You have been in regular employment, 
 
and have been described as a devoted and attentive family man. 
 
 
I  have  read  and  taken  into  account  the  statement  of  Bijan  Ebrahimi’s  sister  (Manizhah 
 
 
Moores) made on behalf of his family and friends. It sets out some of the difficulties in his 
 
life;  and  describes  the  deep  sense  of  loss  that  his  family  and  friends  have  endured  (and 
 
 
continue to endure), as a result of his murder and the desecration of his body. 
 
 
I have also listened and taken into account what has said on behalf of each of you behalf. 
 
 
You will each pay the statutory charge. 
  
 
Lee James 
 
 
The  sentence  for  murder  is prescribed by  law:  I therefore  sentence  you  to a  term of  life 
 
 
imprisonment. 
 
 
I  must  also  fix  the  minimum  term  which  you  must  serve  before  you  are  considered  for 
 
 
 
release, by reference to schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
Before considering the aggravating and mitigating factors I take the starting point to be a 
 
term of 15 years. 
 
 
There are two aggravating factors (I do not regard your previous record as relevant to this 
 
 
sentence). 
 
 
First,  you  had  been  threatening  to  use  violence  in  the  days  before  you  murdered  Mr 
 
Ebrahimi. Your persistent animosity and threats to kill him were noted by witnesses. I am 
 
satisfied that this was a vigilante crime, with the element of bullying and victimisation that 
 
this implies. You had decided (wrongly) that Mr Ebrahimi was paedophile and that this put 
 
him  outside  the  law.  You  thought  that  you  were  entitled  to  take  the  law  into  your  own 
 
hands (as the misleading expression has it). What you did had nothing to do with the law or 
 
justice. The law provides that guilt is decided in a court with the protections of a fair trial; 
 
 
and the law protects life. Yours was an act of murderous injustice. 
 

 
   
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Secondly, (and this a statutory aggravating factor), there was the destruction of the body. 
 
You told the police that you panicked and were not thinking straight. But the burning of the 
 
 
body, so that the police officer who had seen him only 2 days before no longer recognised 
 
 
him, was a gratuitously abusive act, and has (not surprisingly) added to the great distress of 
 
 
 
his family. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So far as mitigation is concerned there is one factor, but it is the most important factor: your 
 
plea of guilty to the offence of murder, and the expression of your remorse. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For this you are entitled to the maximum credit to which you are entitled: a reduction of 
 
one sixth. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 
 

Taking all these matters into account I have decided that the minimum term that you must 
 
serve before you are considered for release, is a term of 18 years, less the time you have 
 
spent on remand. This does not mean that you will be released after this time. You will only 
 
be released when the Parole Board conclude that it is safe to release you. If they decide to 
 
 
release you, you will remain on licence for the rest of your life

You  have  pleaded  guilty  to  an  offence  under  s.4(1)  of  the  Criminal  Law  Act,  assisting  an 
 
 
offender. 
 
 
You helped James drag the body away from the site of his murder; and you were involved in 
 
 
setting fire to it. It was you fetched the White Spirit. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
The  aggravating  factor  is  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  which  you  knew  Lee  James  had 
 
committed. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  mitigating  factors  are  your  previous  excellent  character,  and  most  importantly,  your 
 
plea of guilty. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Among the many references I have seen, is one from your employer. He has spoken of his 
 
sense of sadness and shame that these crimes have brought on this City; but also describes 
 
you as the most grounded, stable and honest person he has every employed. 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How you came to commit this crime seems to be a mystery to everyone who knows you, 
 
and (it seems) to you. 
 
 
The maximum sentence for this offence is a term of 10 years (since the maximum sentence 
 
 
for the person you assisted is fixed by law) 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

In Att‐Gen’s Ref No 16 of 2009 (2009) EWCA Crim 2439 the Court of Appeal indicated that 
 
there are 3 material matters for the sentencing court to consider: (1) the nature and the 
 
extent of the criminality of the offender assisted; (2) the nature and extent of the assistance 
 
provided, and (3) the extent that the interests of justice were damaged. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So far as the last of these matters is concerned, the interests of justice were not significantly 
 
 
damaged. The attempts to conceal the crime were futile; and I accept that this was a short‐
 
lived role and relatively unsophisticated assistance. 
 

 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However the burning of the body of a man, whom you knew had been murdered, makes 
 
 
this a serious instance of this offence. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  my  view the  appropriate  starting  point  for  this  offence  is  a  term  in  excess  of  6  years. 
 
Taking into account the credit for the plea and other mitigation, the sentence will be a term 
 
of 4 years. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

You will serve half that time in prison, less any time on remand; and when you are released 
 
you  will  remain  on  licence  for  the  remaining  period  of  the  sentence.  If  you  commit  any 
 
 
further offence during that time you may be recalled to prison.

After a trial lasting almost two weeks you, Darren Steven Jarvis, were convicted by a 
 
jury of two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. On the afternoon of 30 
 
August 2012 you drove your Nissan Skyline motor car in a way which fell far below 
 
what would be expected of a competent and careful driver.  The jury rejected your 
 
defence based on the hypothesis that you had an epileptic fit and that this was the 
 
reason why your vehicle lost control.  I accept that, as a result of this accident, you 
 
immediately had a seizure.  I also accept that you have no recollection of your driving 
 
prior to the accident, or of the accident itself.  You were driving a high performance 
 
sports  car  along  A4059  Aberdare  bypass  from  Aberdare  town  centre  between 
 
Tinney’s roundabout and the Asda roundabout.  Witnesses following you described 
 
how, having been driving at a normal and proper speed in the region of 45 miles per 
 
hour in the 60 mile per hour limit, you suddenly accelerated.  Mr Davies said that it 
 
was like an American hotrod starting off.  He could hear the roar of your engine.  Mrs 
 
Davies’ statement said that your car made a noise like a jet; the back wheels spun, 
 
kicked up a lot of dust and zoomed off.  Kayleigh Smith and her mother Wendy Jones 
 
described  how  they  heard  a  Vroom  noise.  The  witnesses  used  words  such  as 
 
“dramatic” “pointless” and “wholly unusual”.  It was totally unexpected and a shock. 
  
You car accelerated to a huge degree. 
   

  
 
 

   
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Although there was some evidence suggesting that it took place at an earlier stage, I 
   
am  sentencing  you  on  the  basis  of  the  balance  of  the  evidence,  namely  that  this 
 
sudden acceleration took place near to the road bridge on the by pass.  You then 
 
almost  immediately  lost  control  at  or  near  to  the  left‐hand  bend.  The  nearside 
 
wheel  of  your  car  rode  up  the  chamfered  face  of  the  kerb  to  its  near‐side.  The 
 
agreed  expert  evidence  is  that  this  would  have  caused  no  speed  loss.  Your  tyre 
 
rolled  across  the  near‐side  grass  verge  along  a  continuous  right‐hand  arc  as  your 
 
vehicle travelled along the grass, before returning to the carriageway.  It then yawed 
 
clockwise across the carriageway before crashing into Mr Stawski’s Citroen motor car 
 
which  had  been  travelling  in  the  opposite  direction.  The  agreed  engineering 
 
evidence is that the probable range of impact speed of your car was between 47 to 
 
54 miles per hour.  Witnesses described you as struggling with the steering wheel in 
 
a vain attempt to control the car. 
 
   

 
 
   

 
   
 

   
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

I have to take into account that the engineers agree that the probable speed of your 
 
 
car at the start of the tyre marks was between 65 and 71 miles per hour and, as I 
   
have said, your vehicle would not have lost speed when it went onto the grass verge. 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

From the point of the tyre scuff mark, which is the first physical sign of your loss of 
 
control, to the point of impact with Mr Stawski’s motor car was a distance of some 
 
 
62 metres. 
   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Another  important  feature  of  the  agreed  engineering  evidence  is  that  your  car 
 
suddenly accelerated at some unknown point prior to impact, the engine achieving 
 
very  high  recorded  revolutions  per  minute  which  were  maintained  throughout. 
  
Indeed Mr Rees suggested to the jury that this was indicative of you suffering at that 
 
stage from a seizure in which you uncontrollably had your foot pressed hard against

the accelerator.  You clearly did have your foot pressed hard against the accelerator, 
 
 
but this was a deliberate act. 
   

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
    
 

Nobody should underestimate, especially you Darren Steven Jarvis, the suffering you 
 
have caused to others by what you did on that day.  I have read carefully, and we 
 
have heard today, the victim personal statements from Sian Williams, the widow of 
 
Lee Williams and Joanna Osinska, the partner of Jacek Stawski.  Their lives and those 
 
of their children, family and friends have been irreparably and gravely damaged.  A 
 
particularly harrowing detail was that as a result of the legal consequences following 
 
upon  the  deaths,  they  had  to  wait  nearly  three  weeks  and  six  weeks  respectively 
 
before they could obtain the body of their loved ones back for burial.  In addition 
 
Paula  Evans  and  Richard  Thorne  have  also  suffered  from  witnessing  the  tragic 
 
 
consequences of your dangerous driving. 
   

 
  
 

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

A prison sentence must be the inevitable consequence of your action.  The question 
 
is for how long.  As Ms Osinska said prison will not bring back the deceased to their 
 
families.  Nor can prison in any way reflect the loss suffered by them.  The sentence 
 
It  is 
is  not  meant  to  be,  indeed  cannot  be,  a  question  of  what  a  life  is  worth. 
 
   
intended to be a punishment and a deterrent. 
   

  
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have to take account of guidelines set down by the Sentencing Guidelines Council 
 
 
for this type of offence and take account of the aggravating and mitigating factors in 
 
your case. 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  
 

 
 
 

 
    

The  principal  harm  done  by  an  offence  of  causing  death  by  dangerous  driving, 
 
namely the deaths caused, is in itself an element of the offence.  I have to recognise 
 
 
that. 
In  terms  of  the  level  of  seriousness  the  driving,  albeit  serious,  was  not  the 
   
 
worst standard of driving.  It was not prolonged and persistent; nor was there any 
 
 
suggestion of consumption of alcohol or drugs, for example.  I have to take account 
 
of all the factors in the driving as I have described.  You were in a very powerful car 
 
and you accelerated extremely fast on or near to a bend.  It was not a severe bend 
 
 
but the manner of your driving was such that you completely lost control.  Mr Rees 
 
 
 
has  submitted  that  this  driving  was  Level  3. 
I  accept  this  is  correct  given  the 
 
 
   
maximum speed and given that the dangerous driving took place over a short period. 
  
 
It could not be described on the hard evidence as greatly excessive speed, racing or 
 
competitive driving against another driver which would be necessary to make this a 
 
Level  2  case.  Level  3  is  driving  that  creates  a  significant  risk  of  danger.  The 
 
sentencing range for Level 3 is 2 to 5 years imprisonment.  The starting point is 3 
 
 
years imprisonment. 
   

 
   
 

    
 

 
  
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

It is an important aggravating factor in your case that there were two deaths. Whilst 
 
 
it is an important aggravating factor, it does not meet the criteria in paragraph 21 of 
 
 
the Guidelines so as to justify a higher level. Inevitably the degree of harm caused by 
 
two deaths  is greater.  I will  impose  concurrent  sentences of  imprisonment,  since 
 
this  was  one  episode  of  dangerous  driving,  but  each  individual  sentence  must  be 
 
higher because your offence was aggravated by the fact that more than one death 
 
was caused.  Indeed this factor, in my judgment, substantially raises the suggested 
 
starting point from 3 years to near the top of the permissible bracket.

However, I must then take account of the mitigation.  A mitigating factor is that you 
 
yourself  were  seriously  injured  in  the  accident. 
I  am  required  to  take  this  into 
 
   
 
account.  You suffered a seizure as a result of the accident and the medical evidence 
 
 
from Dr Quirke shows that your brain injury has caused cognitive and psychological 
 
difficulties.  You have poor attention, reduced memory function, poor organisational 
 
skills, poor logical and abstract reasoning and changes to your language skills.  You 
 
have  low  mood  anxiety  and  obsessive  rumination  over  the  accident  and  suicidal 
 
ideation.  There is the prospect of some further recovery but Dr Quirke’s opinion is 
 
that it is very unlikely that you will recover to your previous level of functioning and 
 
that  you  will  continue  to  experience  cognitive  and  psychological  consequences  of 
 
your brain injury in the long term.  Dr Quirke’s opinion is that a custodial sentence 
 
will  have  a  significant  and  detrimental  affect  on  your  cognitive  and  psychological 
 
wellbeing.  He considers that you will be at risk of being retaliated against by other 
 
prisoners since you have difficulties controlling your speech, meaning that you are 
 
over talkative, repetitive and unable to monitor a conversation or pick up on social 
 
cues.  This is likely to be poorly tolerated by people without understanding of your 
 
brain injury.  In addition to this you are at risk of getting into verbal and physical 
 
confrontation with others since you have poor reasoning skills, are impulsive in your 
 
behaviour  and  have  shown  aggressive  tendencies  towards  others  following  your 
 
brain injury.  Dr Quirke says that you require close monitoring and support from the 
 
forensic psychologist/psychiatrist within a prison setting. 
   

 
   
 

 
 
 
 

 
  

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Pre‐sentence report also makes the following points in your favour namely: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
  

1.	  The author said that you expressed genuine remorse for the tragic consequences 
 
of the incident.  You also described Mr Williams as a close friend and, in respect 
 
of both Mr Williams and Mr Stawski, you voluntarily drew attention to the fact 
 
that both men were husbands and fathers.  You described your self to the author 
 
as feeling “devastated” for the families involved and, at one point stated “I wish 
 
I’d died in the crash”. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

2.	  You have worked hard in life and have developed a relatively successful business 
 
dealing with land and house purchases.  You are concerned as to the effects of 
 
the custodial sentence upon your business, although your partner is to become a 
 
director  of  the  company  to  try  to  ensure  some  oversight  and  a  friend  and 
 
acquaintance will take on many of the day to day tasks. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.	  Your risk of reconviction is low.  You have never served a custodial sentence. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
   
 

4.	  The final paragraph says “Mr Jarvis seems to understand the probable sentencing 
 
outcome  in  the  case  and  accepts  it  will  involve  an  immediate  sentence  of 
 
imprisonment.”  He  indicated  to  me  that  “I  know  I  have  to  go  to  jail”  and  “I 
 
understand the seriousness”.  Mr Jarvis also stated he needs to go to prison “out 
 
of  respect  to  my  friend  and  the  other  guy”.  Mr  Jarvis  says  “he  recognises  he 
 
needs to be punished although the Court will be acutely aware that not even the 
 
necessary custodial sentence can ever make amends, in cases of this kind, for the 
 
loss of life or undo the inestimable damage to the lives of others caused by Mr 
 
 
Jarvis.”
--------
You  cannot  be  considered  as  a  person  of  completely  good  character  but  your 
 
previous record is so long ago as to not affect the sentence I impose.  In addition, I 
   
take account in your favour of the numerous character references both as to your 
 
driving  and  your  character  generally.  Also  the  fact  that  you  have  no  convictions 
 
   
relating to the manner of your driving. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Having regard to all the circumstances of this case you will go to prison for 4 years on 
 
each Count, to run concurrently. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

You will be disqualified from driving for 4 years and your licence will be endorsed. 
  
 
You will remain disqualified until you have passed an appropriate extended driving 
 
 
test. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  this  offence  was  committed  before  the  1  October  2012  there  is  no 
 
surcharge order. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I order you to pay Prosecution costs of £4200.

SENTENCING REMARKS 

.............................
--------
R v Delroy Catwell 

On the 8th February of this year, Lylah Aaron was left in your care.  She was aged 3 
years  4  months,  an  engaging,  outgoing,  chatty  child.    On  the  previous  day  she  had 
 
attended nursery, CCTV footage showed her running into nursery, seemingly without 
a care in the world. 
 
Lylah was in your care because her mother, Precious, was pursuing her chosen career 
 
as  a  nurse.    Precious  was  studying  at  university  and  working  at  a  placement  in  a 
hospital in order to build a life for herself and her daughter.  It was her trust in you 
which permitted Precious to leave her much loved and only daughter in your care.  It 
is difficult to conceive of a greater abuse of trust than that which you perpetrated in 
killing this vulnerable and defenceless young girl. 
 
It was at 5.30 on the morning of the 8th February that Precious left home in order to go 
to work.  She checked Lylah before she left, Lylah was asleep.  Lylah was to go to 
nursery, it was “pyjama day” and Precious left out pyjamas for Lylah to wear.  At 
2.30  that  afternoon  you  telephoned  Precious  to  tell  her  that  Lylah  was  unwell,  she 
seemed tired and did not want to go to nursery, she wanted to sleep.  As a result you 
had not taken her to nursery.  Precious told you to let Lylah sleep.  Unbeknown to 
Precious,  at  around  midday  you  inflicted  the  injuries  upon  Lylah  which  were 
 
causative of her death. 
 
When Precious returned home at about 4/4.30 she went to see Lylah who appeared to 
be  asleep.  Evidence  has  been  given  that  an  unconscious  child  would  give  the 
 
appearance  of  a  sleeping  child.    Precious  subsequently  checked  up  on  Lylah  and 
shortly before 6pm attempted to wake Lylah only to find her to be unresponsive. 
 
Within  30  minutes,  Lylah  was  at  hospital  where  the  full  nature  and  extent  of  her 
injuries was discovered.  Some 6 hours later, she was pronounced dead, her presenting 
injuries being deemed unsurvivable.  A subdural bleed was found, bleeding between 
the skull and the brain of such magnitude that it compressed and displaced the brain. 
 
A lack of blood and oxygen to the brain resulted in swelling.  Bleeding was present in 
the  retinas  of  both  eyes  and  around  the  optic  nerves.    Bruising  was  present  over 
Lylah’s  head,  in  her  ears,  on  her  forehead  and  chin.    Bruising  was  present  on  the 
underside of the skull.  Multiple areas of impact were seen on Lylah’s scalp indicating 
 
multiple blows to the head, either from fists, feet, a blunt object or by the propelling 
 
of Lylah’s head against such an object or a combination of both.  It was these impacts 
 
to Lylah’s head which caused the fatal haemorrhage and brain swelling.  Bruising was 
 
also  found  on  her  body  in  particular,  to  the  bowel,  this  being  caused  by  a  heavy 
impact  to  her  tummy.    Four  recent  fractures  of  three  ribs  were  present,  these  were 
considered to have been caused by squeezing. 
 
 
Investigation  by  the  doctors  also  revealed  evidence  of  an  earlier  subdural  bleed, 
 
retinal bleeding and a fractured rib.  The injuries, which it is accepted were inflicted 
 
on  the  same  occasion,  occurred  some  3  to  5  weeks  before  Lylah’s  death.    It  is 
undisputed that you must have been the person responsible for these earlier injuries.   
 
The  injuries  sustained  by  Lylah  on  the  8th  February  to  her  head,  ribs  and  abdomen 
would have required considerable force.  This slight child would have been wholly 
defenceless in the face of such a sustained assault.  Compounding your actions, you

R v Delroy Catwell 

 

allowed Lylah, who would have drifted into an unconscious state, to remain at home. 
 
You made no attempt to call for medical aid.  For a matter of hours you knew that 
within the house was a badly injured young girl for whom you were responsible.  You 
took  no  steps  to  alert  any  person  to  the  need  for  help.  On  the  contrary,  the  story 
which you gave Precious at 2.30 was intended to, and did, provide her with a false 
account of what had occurred such as to allay any concerns on her part. 
 
From the outset you have denied assaulting Lylah.  You told the police and the court 
of the good relationship which you had with her.  Not once but twice, brutally and 
callously, you abused that relationship. 
 
Implicit in your denial is the inescapable fact that the only other person who could 
have caused these injuries is Precious, Lylah’s mother.  The cross-examination of this 
witness  was  skilful  and  sensitive.    However,  the  point  had  to,  and  was  made,  to  a 
woman visibly grappling with her own guilt in entrusting her daughter to your care. 
 
On  your  behalf,  it  is  said  that  the  prosecution  could  not  prove  beyond  reasonable 
 
doubt an intention to kill.  There is merit in that point.  Thus, I approach this sentence 
 
upon  the  basis  that  it  was  a  loss  of  temper  which  led  to  this  assault.    That  loss  of 
temper has to be viewed in the context of a similar loss of temper some weeks earlier 
when you assaulted Lylah and caused injury which went undetected at the time.  As a 
result  of  that  earlier  assault,  you  knew  what  you  were  capable  of  doing. 
 
Notwithstanding that knowledge, you allowed Precious to continue to leave Lylah in 
your sole care. 
 
As to your previous history, you have a conviction in 2005 for sexual activity with a 
 
female child under 13.  The Court has been informed that this involved inviting a girl 
aged near to 13 to your home when you sucked her toe.  I accept the submission made 
 
on  your  behalf  that  the  gravity  of  the  offence  is  less  serious  than  many  which  is 
 
reflected  in  the  non-custodial  sentence  passed  by  the  Court.  Given  the  nature  and 
facts of that offence, I do not regard it as an aggravating factor in sentencing you upon 
this offence. 
 
The offence of which you have been found guilty by the unanimous verdict of a jury 
is that of murder.  The sentence of the Court is one of life imprisonment.  Pursuant to 
Paragraph 6, Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the appropriate starting 
point in determining the minimum term of imprisonment which you will serve is 15 
years.  Within the statutory aggravating factors are two; the victim was particularly 
vulnerable because of her age and your abuse of a position of trust.  In addition are the 
following which I regard as aggravating the offence: 
 

The  previous  assault  upon  Lylah  as  evidenced  by  the  injuries  which 
occurred 2 to 5 weeks before her death together with the knowledge 
which  thereafter  you  possessed  of  the  risk  that  you  could  lose  your 
temper, and as a result, assault Lylah; 
  
In  my  view,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  safely  link  any  other 
 
injury or damage found upon Lylah or in the home to you; 
Your failure to obtain medical assistance for a number of hours on 8 
February,  together  with  your  call  to  Lylah’s  mother  during  the

R v Delroy Catwell 

 
iii.	 

afternoon  in  which  you  lied  to  her  as  to  the  true  nature  of  her 
daughter’s condition; 
 
The  nature  of  your  defence  which  has,  by  implication,  identified 
Precious  Chibanda  as  the  only  other  person  who  could  have  been 
responsible for Lylah’s injuries. 

 
As to mitigating factors; I have accepted that there is merit in the point that the Crown 
could not prove beyond reasonable doubt an intention to kill.  However, so violent 
was the assault upon Lylah that any distinction between an intention to kill and an 
intention to cause really serious injury can be of only limited effect.  I also accept that 
there is no evidence to demonstrate that this offence was premeditated.   
 
I have taken account of the aggravating and mitigating factors.  The minimum term of 
imprisonment which you must serve is one of 20 years.  Credit will be given for 270 
If  the  number  of  days  spent  on  remand  is  incorrect,  it  can  be 
days  in  custody. 
 
corrected administratively. 
 
It  is  important  to  emphasise  that  20  years  imprisonment,  less  the  days  spent  on 
remand, is not the actual term you will serve in custody; it is the minimum term you 
must serve before you can be considered for release by the Parole Board. The time 
 
you actually serve, may be longer.   The Parole Board will only direct your release on 
licence  if  it  is  satisfied  that  you  are  no  longer  a  danger  to  members  of  the  public. 
 
When you are released you will remain on licence for the rest of your life and will be 
liable to be recalled by the Secretary of State.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE THOMAS QC 

You Amanda Hutton are 43 years old. You are the mother of Tariq Khan who stands 
in the dock with you today. 
 
You Tariq Khan are 24 years old and the eldest of Amanda Hutton’s 8 children who 
were all born from the same long running relationship that she had with your father 
  
Aftab Khan. 
 
Neither of you have anything previously recorded against you for the purposes of this 
sentencing exercise and that lack of previous adverse findings is a mitigating factor in 
each of your cases. 
 
You Amanda Hutton are to be sentenced for several offences, all arising from your 
terrible failures to fulfil the most basic responsibilities that you, as their mother, 
should have fulfilled. Those offences are as follows: 
 
Count 1. Manslaughter. That is the Unlawful Killing of your then 4.5 year old son 
Hamzah by reason of your gross negligence in failing to provide him with anything 
like adequate nourishment over a long period of time. In short you starved him to 
death. 
 
Count 2. Preventing the proper burial of Hamzah over a period of almost 2 years 
following him being starved to death by you and you being afraid to report his death 
because of your fear of being found out as his killer. 
 
Counts 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7. Five offences of cruelty in relation to your other five young 
children who lived with you between the beginning of 2009 and 21st September 2011. 
A period therefore not far short of 3 years when on an ever declining scale you failed 
your young children, causing them to live in quite appalling conditions of squalor 
which understandably shocked even the most seasoned of Police Officers who
--------
attended your home in September 2011. That was of course when finally what had 
been happening behind your largely closed door was unearthed through the 
commendable diligence and persistence of that young Community Support Officer 
Jodie Dunsmore 
 
You Tariq Khan, being aged almost 21 years old at the date of Hamzah’s death in 
December 2009 joined in with your mother in the concealment of Hamzah’s death 
and over a very long period of time you played a culpable part in preventing his 
proper and lawful burial. You therefore are also to be sentenced on Count 2 of the 
indictment. 
 
In terms of these proceedings you both pleaded Guilty to all of these offences save for 
your persistent and very unrealistic denial Amanda Hutton of Count 1. That denial of 
course led to a trial before a jury over the course of the last three weeks where the 
disturbing facts of this dreadful case were so vividly rehearsed. Although therefore 
there is no credit to extend to you for any admission of guilt in relation to Count 1 
there is some limited credit to extend to you from an application of the Sentencing 
Guideline Council’s Definitive Guideline re ‘Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea’ 
in relation to Count 2 & Counts 3 to 7. However, that credit is diminished because 
you falsely sought to limit your pleas to Counts 3 to 7 to a false basis that allowed you 
some latitude to persist with your denial of the unlawful killing of Hamzah. (I will say 
more about this in due course.) Further, it is correct to note that you had very little 
option but to admit Count 2 and Counts 3 to 7 because of what you must have realised 
was impossibly overwhelming evidence of your guilt on those Counts. Despite that 
overwhelming evidence you did not in fact enter your Guilty pleas until after the Plea 
& Case Management Hearing. All these factors mean that the credit that can be 
attached to your pleas of Guilty is limited. 
 
Similarly your plea of Guilty Tariq Khan was entered at the same hearing as when 
your mother pleaded Guilty and also in the light of the overwhelming evidence 
against you. The credit to attach therefore to your Guilty plea to Count 2 is also 
therefore diminished for these reasons.  
 
Before coming to some of the detail of this case I will make some further preliminary 
observations about this sentencing exercise and the framework for it.  
 
Firstly, the offence of manslaughter triggers in law a consideration of the provisions 
of Part 12, Chapter 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (as amended by later 
legislation). Although you Amanda Hutton must be regarded as a real danger to any 
child with whom you may live, or in any way have care of in the future, the 
possibility of you ever in fact being in the situation of caring for a child is so remote 
as to mean that the legislative provisions to which I’ve just referred are not engaged. 
 
In sentencing you Amanda Hutton for a total of 7 offences I obviously have to 
consider the Total Sentence to which you are to be subject whilst also properly 
passing appropriate sentences to reflect the various separate parts of your offending. I 
will say now that with these considerations in mind I intend to pass consecutive 
sentences for Count 1 (your unlawful killing of Hamzah) and Counts 3 to 7 (the 
cruelty to your other children over a period that not only predated Hamzah’s death but 
also for the protracted period following his death). The sentence to be passed on
--------
Count 2 (the prevention of Hamzah’s burial) will be concurrent to all the other 
sentences. 
 
Further, in relation to the sentencing framework within which I have to work, I need 
to apply the Definitive Guideline issued by the Sentencing Guideline Council on the 
subject of Cruelty to Children to Counts 3 to 7. In doing so your offending falls 
towards the top bracket of cases identified at page 17 of that Guideline although there 
is some scope to describe your case as being ‘protracted’ within the meaning 
described in the second bracket at page 17. In any event the sentence to pass on those 
counts needs to reflect the limited credit for the pleas of Guilty to which I’ve already 
referred. 
 
Finally by way of general comments I make it clear that this sentencing exercise is not 
an exercise in seeking to identify or explain how various Agencies failed to identify 
and act upon the very long term and severe neglect that you visited upon your 
children and which went as far as you literally starving Hamzah to death. 
Undoubtedly others will be enquiring into such matters and that is something beyond 
the reach of this Court. However, your deviousness and entirely purposeful conduct in 
keeping various Agencies away from you and your children, so that what you were 
doing was not discovered, must be a feature of this case that I should take account of 
in sentencing you today. 
 
Although I could now trawl through the lengthy history of your conduct and 
culpability I will not do so in minute detail. It is not necessary to do so, especially 
when the details of your wicked actions have been displayed in such awful detail over 
the past three weeks in the trial that concluded yesterday. However, I will highlight 
some of the most telling points that inform this sentencing exercise today. 
 
Firstly, the indictment upon which you have to be sentenced demonstrates a most 
fundamental and serious breach of any duty that an individual in decent society can 
owe to others. Namely the duty that a parent owes to her or his young children to take 
proper care of them. That duty involves various obligations from providing not just 
simple human love and affection but to all the practical matters that young children 
need from their parents. This indictment demonstrates your longstanding and 
wretched breaches of these most simple and fundamental requirements.  
 
The squalor in which your surviving children were found in September 2011 was 
breathtakingly awful. An experienced consultant paediatrician who then visited your 
house following your arrest said “This home visit has revealed the most extreme 
example of neglect that I have encountered in my career.” Similarly, experienced and 
 
seasoned Police Officers were similarly shaken by what they then saw. Although that 
state of affairs may represent the pinnacle of the dreadful conditions in which you and 
your children lived I am entirely convinced from the evidence that I have heard that 
the very unsatisfactory conditions in which you caused your children to live took root 
from the early stages of the indictment period in 2009. They did not only come about 
in 2011 or so as you falsely contended in your trial in an attempt to run the defence 
you ran in relation to Hamzah’s death. This is the basis upon which I approach the 
sentencing exercise in relation to Counts 3 to 7.
--------
Indeed, and turning to Counts 1 & 2 on the indictment (the unlawful killing of 
Hamzah and the prevention of his burial), it is apparent from the evidence that your 
unsatisfactory behaviour as a parent, towards Hamzah in particular, went back at least 
to his birth in 2005. It is clear by then that you had become addicted to alcohol. Your 
use of alcohol over the years gives a real insight into you as a parent. Namely, as was 
put to you in cross examination during the trial, that you placed your own selfish 
addiction to drink well before your responsibilities to your many children. Your 
partner and father of your children knew about your drinking and your lack of care of 
the children. He in fact seems to have done little in all reality to address your conduct 
so as to improve the welfare of his children. In fact it seems clear that he subjected 
you to some violence during the course of your relationship with him. Certain it is 
though he recognised your very extreme lack of care of Hamzah, including your 
failure to feed him, when you separated from him in December 2008 and when 
Hamzah was 3.5 years old. You of course recognised in your own evidence at trial 
that whatever the difficulties in your relationship with him that that was only 
background information in this case and gave no explanation or excuse for your care, 
or lack of care, of Hamzah and the other children. 
 
It seems that for whatever irrational reason you took against Hamzah from an early 
age. Perhaps in fact from the very day of his birth. You have described his birth as 
difficult and traumatic and yet it is very clear from the evidence both Dr Ward and the 
obstetrician who delivered Hamzah that his birth, albeit a breech delivery, was 
straightforward and uncomplicated. Thereafter although you accepted some medical 
care from a midwife for the couple of weeks immediately following the birth you 
thereafter for the rest of his life (& indeed for almost two years after his death) kept 
Hamzah way from the outside world. That includes not only various professionals but 
also for instance your neighbours who were taken aback in September 2011 when the 
door to your house was finally opened and they learned after almost 2.5 years of you 
living next door to them that there were young children living there who they had 
never see before.  From all the evidence that I have heard I have no doubt that the 
reason for you purposefully keeping Hamzah away from everybody was because you 
were failing to nourish him and provide him with even the most basic food. It is 
entirely clear from the medical evidence that your failure to feed Hamzah was a 
longstanding feature of his short and unhappy life and lasted for years, beginning well 
before you moved away from Aftab Khan in late 2008. That failure must then have 
persisted during the whole of 2009 when you had sole care of him and leading up to 
his death in December of that year. The most telling and awful fact in this case that 
speaks volumes about how you starved Hamzah is that when his mummified remains 
were found he was comfortably clothed in a ‘babygro’ which was designed for a 6 to 
9 month old child. Moreover, he was found in a cot wearing, at the age of 4.5 years, a 
nappy. 
 
There is other telling evidence that shows your cruel attitude to Hamzah. In your 
interviews with the Police you spoke of him as being a difficult child and attributed 
behaviour to him that seems to have made you act cruelly to him. The evidence about 
you calling him a ‘bastard’ and punishing him for being naughty shows this feature of 
the case. For instance shutting him in a dark room and on one occasion piling some 
 
blankets upon the drawer into which you’d put him. Further, and importantly in the 
context of Count 1, purposefully feeding him even less than all the other children 
(who in fact received less than adequate food themselves).
--------
So it is then that your case Amanda Hutton has to be regarded as a bad a case of 
unlawful killing of a child by a parent as it is possible to imagine. The Prosecution 
posed the question at the outset of the case, ‘how is it possible in 21st century Britain 
for a 4.5 year old child to be starved to death?’ Dr Ward in her evidence said that 
there were very few cases indeed in the medical literature of such a thing happening. 
Although it beggars belief that such a thing can happen it has of course happened 
here. It has done so through your purposeful, persistent and gross conduct in failing in 
 
that most basic and fundamental requirement that is upon every parent to feed her 
child adequately. 
 
The sentence that will therefore be imposed on you is a total sentence of 15 years 
imprisonment. That will be made up of a sentence of 12 years on Count 1, a 
concurrent sentence of 2.5 years on Count 2 and sentences of 3 years imprisonment 
on Counts 3 to 7 which will be concurrent between themselves but consecutive to the 
12 year sentence on Count 1. 
 
I turn now to you Tariq Khan and the sentence to be imposed on Count 2. The 
indictment period in your case covers 2 years 9 months. That is the period of time that 
you, together with your mother, deliberately concealed Hamzah’s death. You were 
almost 21 years old at the start of this period of time and 22.5 years old by September 
2011 when Hamzah’s body was discovered. You must bear some real responsibility 
for the concealment of Hamzah’s body which in itself was a terrible & inhumane act 
but which also involved the true & obvious situation surrounding Hamzah’s awful 
death being clearly revealed as it would have been with the Police and doctors making 
a contemporaneous inspection. However, I accept that you were in something of an 
awkward situation. You were the adult male figure in the household and the evidence 
seems to suggest that you were under the influence of your mother and that you were 
to some extent doing your bit to do what you could for your much younger siblings 
who were clearly getting inadequate care from her. The evidence suggests that 
perhaps without the limited care you gave in the household conditions would have 
been even the worse. You say, and this is the approach I take to sentencing you, that 
you supported your mother out of some misguided loyalty to her and because of the 
emotional blackmail from her to you that any reporting of Hamzah’s death would split 
up the family and may even provoke her to cause damage to the other siblings. 
Further in your case it seems that your life has moved on positively during the last 
two years since Hamzah’s body was found. You are in work and have a seemingly 
strong & stable relationship. Moreover, your siblings still have some contact with you 
and wish to continue that contact. Sending you to prison now therefore would in a 
sense inflict some loss and punishment on them. Therefore, although quite clearly a 
sentence of imprisonment must follow it can, given the current sentencing provisions, 
be properly suspended. The sentence of 2 years imprisonment that I pass on Count 2 
in your case will be suspended for the next 2 years. Understand clearly that if you 
therefore commit any other criminal offence that carries the possibility of 
imprisonment within the next two years this sentence of 2 years will come into effect 
in addition to whatever sentence that is passed for that next offence.

Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)

30 September 2013

Munir Ahmed Farooqi, Matthew Newton and Israr Hussain Malikv R
SUMMARY TO ASSIST THE MEDIA
The Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Lord Justice Treacy and Mrs Justice Sharp) has today
dismissed appeals by Munir Ahmed Farooqi, Matthew Newton and Israr Hussain Malik against their
convictions for terrorism offences. The Court also refused to grant permission to Munir Ahmed
Farooqi and Israr Hussain Malik to appeal their sentences.
In its judgment the Court discusses at length the duty owed by advocates to the Court.
Introduction
Lord Judge, in his last Court of Appeal judgment before he retires as Lord Chief Justice, said:
""We have all contributed to the writing of this judgment of the Court, which arises in melancholy
circumstances as a result of flagrant misconduct and alleged professional incompetence by one of
the advocates at trial, Mr Lawrence McNulty, leading counsel for Munir Farooqi (Farooqi).” (para 1)
Details of the convictions are set out in paras 2 — 8.
The Appeals
Farooqi, Newton and Malik seek leave to appeal against their convictions.
Farooqi and Malik also seek leave to appeal against sentence.
Lord Judge said: ""... In the circumstances we granted each appellant leave to appeal against
convictions on the single issue of the consequences of Mr McNulty‘s misconduct and his alleged
incompetence."" (para 9)
The Grounds of Appeal and the Crown’s response
These are set out in paragraphs 16 — 99.
Fairness of the trial
The Court discusses this ground of appeal in paragraphs 100 — 120.
1
--------
Lord Judge, giving the judgment of the Court, said:
”We must begin by emphasising that the conduct of the trial by thejudge was impeccable. He
remained patient under considerable provocation, and in the public interest he sought to salvage an
important lengthy trial from shipwreck. In his directions to the jury, in fairness both to the
prosecution and to ensure thatjustice would be done according to the law the danger that thejury
would be misled had to be avoided. We cannot detect any basis for criticising the judge for lack of
fairness or balance in his approach to his responsibilities. The essential criticism is that
notwithstanding the fairness with which the judge sought to discharge them, the misconduct of
counsel and his deliberate and repeated challenges to the judge's authority could not be addressed
and dealt with without compromising the fairness of the trial. The only answer to the problem
created by Mr McNulty was the discharge of the jury, and the only answer to the resulting unfairness
of the continuing of the trial is to quash the convictions."" (para 101)
Lord Judge went on to say:
""Something of a myth about the meaning of the client’s ""instructions” has developed. As we have
said, the client does not conduct the case. The advocate is not the client’s mouthpiece, obliged to
conduct the case in accordance with whatever the client, or when the advocate is a barrister, the
solicitor ""instructs"" him. In short, the advocate is bound to advance the defendant’s case on the
basis that what his client tells him is the truth, but save for well-established principles, like the
personal responsibility of the defendant to enter his own plea, and to make his own decision
whether to give evidence, and perhaps whether a witness who appears to be able to give relevant
admissible evidence favourable to the defendant should or should not be called, the advocate, and
the advocate alone remains responsible for the forensic decisions and strategy. That is the
foundation for the right to appear as an advocate, with the privileges and responsibilities of
advocates and as an advocate, burdened with twin responsibilities, both to the client and to the
court.
”In the trial process the advocate is subject to some elementary rules. They apply whether the
advocate in question is a barrister or solicitor, and to the extent that the rules of professional
conduct of either profession are not consistent, they should be made so. In the forensic process the
decision and judgment of this court bind the professions, and if there is a difference, the rules must
conform with the decisions of the court. By way of emphasis, in the course of any trial, like everyone
else, the advocate is ultimately bound to abide by the rulings of the court. If a remedy is needed, the
rulings are open to criticism in this court, and if they are wrong, their impact on the trial and the
safety of any conviction can be fully examined. Although the judge is ultimately responsible for the
conduct of the proceedings, the judge personally, and the administration of justice as a whole, are
advantaged by the presence, assistance and professionalism of high quality advocates on both sides.
Neither the judge nor the administration ofjustice is advantaged if the advocates are pusillanimous.
Professional integrity, if nothing else, sometimes requires submissions to be made to the judge that
he is mistaken, or even, as sometimes occurs, that he is departing from contemporary standards of
fairness. When difficult submissions of this kind have to be made, the advocate is simultaneously
performing his responsibilities to his client and to the administration ofjustice. The judge, too, must
respect the reality that a very wide discretion is Vested in the judgment of the advocate about how
best to conduct the trial, recognising that different advocates will conduct their cases in different
ways, and that the advocate will be party to confidential instructions from his client from which the
judge must be excluded. In general terms, the administration of criminal justice is best served when
the relationship between thejudge and the advocates on all sides is marked by mutual respect, each
of them fully attuned to their respective responsibilities. This indeed is at the heart of our forensic
processes.” (para 108 — 109)

Page 2 of 4
--------
The Court went on to ”highlight some of the further rules which appear to have been significantly
infringed."" (para 110 — 115)
Lord Judge, giving the judgment of the Court, concluded:
""In our judgment the issues were fully and fairly explained to the jury and left for their decision,
and the necessary process of correction was handled so as to ensure that the normal processes by
which the jury addressed the evidence and reached their eventual conclusion were not
undermined. Notwithstanding many unfortunate features of this trial the convictions of three of
the defendants, and the acquittal of the fourth defendant, followed a fair trial."" (para 119)
Faroogi’s failure to give evidence
The Court considers this ground of appeal in paragraphs 121 — 148.
Lord Judge, on behalf of the Court, concluded:
""[As], again, we have noted, Farooqi is an intelligent man with a good command of English who had
enjoyed a lengthy working relationship with his legal team over many months. He was in court on
22""d August and would have heard and understood the discussions. Had he wished to confer with his
legal team, he needed only to ask them to come and see him. Had he wished to complain that he had
in some way not made a free and informed decision as to whether to give evidence, there was ample
opportunity for him to have done so. The complaint based on Farooqi's failure to give evidence is not
sustained."" (para 148)
The Watson direction
The Court considers this ground of appeal in paragraphs 149 — 158.
The Court observed:
“Most surprisingly there is no witness statement of any sort provided by Farooqi himself. When an
appellant wishes to assert that he has not been given appropriate advice in a particular respect, or
has not been able to make an informed decision about a matter of materiality in the trial, he must
provide the court with a statement setting out the relevant history. There is no such material from
Farooqi.” (para 126)
Lord Judge, on behalf of the Court, concluded:
""In the circumstances we are wholly unpersuaded that the judge was wrong to give a Watson
direction. To have ignored his concern that the jury had been invited to take an inappropriate
approach to their deliberation would have been a dereliction of his duties. The advice given in the
Watson direction was precisely apt to cover the situation. In the unusual circumstances of this case,
the Watson direction was an appropriate way of ensuring that the jury approached their
responsibilities on a correct basis."" (para 152)

Page 3 of 4
--------
The Court went on to conclude:
""Moreover, there was, as the judge ruled, a clear difference between Count 8 and Counts 9 and 10,
and separate consideration was required in relation to each count. There is no reason at all why the
jury should not have considered and reached verdicts on Count 8 before moving onto the later
counts. The order in which the jury considers counts is a matter for it to determine. We can perceive
no properly arguable basis for complaint in relation to this second limb of the Watson argument.”
(para 157)
Lord Judge, giving the judgment of the Court, dismissed the appeals against conviction saying:
""There is no merit in these arguments and we reject them."" (para 158)
Applications regarding sentence
The Court considers the applications of Farooqi and Malik in paragraphs 159 — 170 and refuses
both applications to appeal sentence (para 171).

the reasons for the decision. The full judgment of the Court is the only authoritative document.

PAVLO LAPSHYN 


_______________________________  

 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR. JUSTICE SWEENEY 

_______________________________  

 
Pavlo Lapshyn you are 25 years old and from Ukraine.  You have no previous convictions.  You 

have pleaded guilty to murder (Count 1), to causing an explosion with intent to endanger life 

 
(Count 3), and to engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts (Count 4).  All those crimes 

took place in the West Midlands. The murder was carried out within 5 days of your arrival in this 

 
country as a highly qualified engineer on a 12 month work placement. Thereafter and within a 

 
period of less than two months you planted and detonated three improvised explosive devices in 

the  vicinity  of  three  mosques  in  Walsall,  Wolverhampton  and  Tipton  respectively.  You  were 

clearly planning to plant and detonate yet more such devices until you were arrested as a result of 

excellent  police  work  and  the  help  of  the  public.  You  clearly  hold  extreme  right  wing  white 

 
supremacist views, and you were motivated to commit the offences by religious and racial hatred 

 
in the hope that you would ignite racial conflict and cause Muslims to leave the area where you 

 
were living.  Such views, hatreds and motivation are abhorrent to all right thinking people, and 

have no place whatsoever in our multi-faith and multi-cultural society.
--------
In  September  2012  whilst  studying  for  a  PhD  at  a  University  in  the  Ukraine  you  were 

interviewed with a view to receiving a placement on a work programme operated by a Midlands 
 

based  UK  company.  You  were  eventually  successful.    However  it  is  clear  that,  even  before 

coming to this country on 24 April this year, you had already been manufacturing and detonating 

improvised explosive devices in the countryside in Ukraine, as well as researching on the internet 

places in Birmingham where you could purchase materials and component parts of improvised 
 

explosive devices once you were here. 

Once here you were put up at the company’s premises in Small Heath.  The very next day you 
 

researched  on  the  internet  a  right  wing  supremacist  site,  and  those  affiliated  to  it  who  were 

serving prison sentences in Russia for racist crimes including murder. You placed that material 
 

on  a  Russian  social  networking  site  to  which  you  were  a  subscriber.  You  also  created  a  file 

bearing  Neo  Nazi  insignia  of  the  type  sometimes  adopted  by  right  wing  extremist  and  white 

supremacist groups. 

On the 26th April you researched sites on the internet for the component parts and ingredients of 

Improvised Explosive Devices, as well as subsequently buying, and taking a picture of yourself 
 

holding, the large hunting knife that you were to use to commit the murder 3 days later.  

In the early afternoon of Monday 29th April, you used your work computer to conduct internet 

 

research in relation to the supply of ingredients for the manufacture of Improvised Explosive 

Devices, and in the late evening you left the company’s premises and made your way by bus to 

the  Green  Lane  area  of  Small  Heath.  You  were  armed  with  the  hunting  knife  and  intent  on 
 

finding a Muslim to murder. 

 

2
--------
You  found  Mohammed  Saleem  Chaudhry  who  was  82  years  of  age,  and  had  been  retired  for 

over  20  years.  He  had  been  married  for  over  50  years  with  seven  children  and  twenty  three 

grandchildren. He was a highly respected member of the community. He lived with his wife in 

Little Green Lane and was regular attendee at prayers at the Mosque on Green Lane – albeit not 

in the best of health and walking with a stick.  That night he left the Mosque after final evening 
 

prayers  concluded  at  a  little  after  10.15pm.  He  started  to  walk  home  alone.  He  was  wearing 

traditional  Islamic  dress.  As  he  walked  down  Little Green Lane  approaching  his  home  you 
 

followed him. You produced your hunting knife and stabbed him three times causing three deep 
 

penetrating  wounds  to  his  left  shoulder  and  back  ranging  in  depth  from  12.5  to  18cms.  The 

wound that was highest up on Mr Saleem’s back passed all the way through his body from back 
 

to  front.  Another  went  through  the  lung  and  transected  the  left  pulmonary  artery  branch 
 

resulting in massive blood loss.. There was damage to bone in keeping with the use of severe 

force. Mr Saleem was seen staggering in the road and then fell to the ground mortally wounded a 
 

short distance away from where you had stabbed him  

You  made  good  your  escape  from  the  scene,  but  fortunately  an  image  of  you  doing  so  was 
 

captured by a CCTV camera.  You returned to the company’s premises.  

The  victim  impact  statement  made  by  Mr  Saleem’s  daughter  Shazia  on  behalf  of  his  family 
 

makes, unsurprisingly, harrowing reading. 

Amongst other things she says that……..(Extracts read)  

Equally  unsurprisingly  your  conduct  has  had  an  adverse  effect  on  the  company  which,  in  all 

innocence, employed you, and greatly distressed those with whom you worked. 

The day after the murder you researched reports of the murder on the internet.  On the 3rd May 

you  created  various  files  on  your  computer  containing  Neo  Nazi  and  other  right  wing  white 

 

3
--------
supremacist  material,  including  an  audio  file:  “You  must  murder”  and  several  images  of  the 

aftermath of the Boston bombing in the U.S. 

On  the  17th  May  you  created  a  file  which  contained  a  picture  of  a  knife  with  the  caption 
 

 
“Mohammed Saleem  was  stabbed  by”  and  below  the  knife  “£10,000  reward  -  small  price.  May  be 

£1,000,000?” and a picture of a “Smiley” face with the slogan “WHITE POWER”. 

On  18  May  you  created  a  file  on  your  laptop  that  related  to  a  Russian  individual  who 

 
characterised  his  asserted  murder  of  people  of  Arab,  Asian  and  Chinese  extraction  as  being 

enemies of “the race” and the killings as an agency of a Racial Holy War. In that same vein a video 

game was later found on your computer entitled “Ethnic Cleansing” whose central thesis was the 

killing of Africans, Latin Americans and Jews - together with other racist material in a media file 

entitled “White World” and other anti-semitic, homophobic and racist material. 

 
During the same period you also continued to accumulate materials and equipment with which 

to manufacture Improvised Explosive Devices. 

By the 19th June you were researching travel from Birmingham to Walsall, together with satellite 

 
images of the area, including the area of the Aisha Mosque in Rutter Street. That afternoon you 

 
performed a reconnaissance of the area surrounding the Mosque. In the afternoon of Friday 21st 

June you researched Google Maps for the “Aisha Mosque Walsall”. Less than an hour later you 
 

went to Asda in Small Heath where you purchased a green wine bottle bag. That evening you set 

off to Walsall carrying the bag inside which you had placed a small improvised explosive device 

that you had made.  It consisted of a 400 ml drinks bottle, 10 grams of home made HMTD as 

the  primary  charge,  an  intended  main  charge  and  an  adapted  mobile  telephone  and  a  lantern 

battery.  However, fortunately, you had mistakenly used the wrong variant of the chemical that 
 

you used in the main charge and thus it was inert.   Not long after 10pm you planted the device 

 

in  front  of  some  metal  pedestrian  gates  in  Rutter  Street  next  to  the  Mosque  and  adjacent  to 
 

 

4
--------
nearby residential property and a pavement. The mobile phone you used as part of the device 

had been set to activate at 10:58 p.m., with four further settings in case of malfunction (each of 
 

which were at busy times of the day). The detonator duly exploded with a loud bang not long 
 

before  the  start  of  prayers,  but  not  the  inert  main  charge.  Fortunately,  although  10  grams  of 

HMTD  alone  has  the  potential  to  cause  really  serious  injury  or  death,  no  one  was  hurt.  The 

remains of the device were later recovered. 

On  23rd  June  you  commenced  research 

into  bus  routes  between  Birmingham  and 
 

Wolverhampton.  You also used the search term “Wolverhampton Mosque” which produced links 
 

to the Wolverhampton Central Mosque. The Mosque is situated within a complex including a 

school and college and is next to a large roundabout. 

In the evening of Thursday 27th June you travelled to Wolverhampton by bus. You were carrying 

a bag containing another improvised explosive device.  This one consisted of 40 grams of home 

made HMTD as the primary explosive, with 600 grams of main charge and a timing device with 
 

two 9volt batteries. However you had made another error in relation to the composition of the 

main charge, which was again inert. You planted the device in shrubbery in the central area of 

 

the  roundabout  about  20  yards  from  the  Mosque.  It  was  timed  to  detonate  at  9:00  a.m.  the 

following morning Friday 28 June and did so. Thus it exploded at a time when many people were 

in the area – including children being delivered to school by their parents. Again, fortunately, and 
 

although you had used four times as much HMTD, the main charge did not go off and no one 

was injured. 

On 1st July you created a file on your computer which contained a picture of a “Buffalo River” 

hunting knife (like the one you had used to commit the murder) containing its dimensions and 

the entry “Mohammed Saleem Chaudhry killed by”.  That same day you created a further four files. 

The content included a Google satellite map of the Wolverhampton Central Mosque with a circle 

superimposed and an arrow pointing to it with the word “Bomb” and the title “There is a bomb near 
 

 

5
--------
Wolverhampton Mosque. Maybe there are other bombs near this mosque. We need news about this event” “Please 

check”  and  a  “Smiley”  face.  At  the  bottom  were  the  words  “White  power”.  The  document  was 
 

directed  to  the  Police  (though  not  sent)  and  arose  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  the  Police  had 
 

arrested someone in respect of the Walsall offence who was not involved in the incident, and 
 

you wished to make that plain. 

In the evening of 8th July you carried out reconnaissance in the area of the Central Jamia Mosque 

in Tipton. 10th July was the start of Ramadan in the U.K. You spent part of that day researching 

the Mosque on the internet, but did not realise that prayer time had been moved forward by one 

hour because of Ramadan. 

In  the  late  evening  of  Thursday  11th  July  you  travelled  to  Tipton  by  bus  carrying  a  third 

improvised explosive device, this time in a laptop bag.  This device consisted of 40 grams of 

homemade HMTD as the primary charge, 600 grams of main charge in one metal container and 

600 grams of nails as shrapnel in another container and a mobile phone and battery. However 
 

you had made another error in relation to the main charge, which was again inert. You placed the 

device on spare ground close to the car park of the Mosque. It was timed to go off at 1.03 pm 

the following day (Friday 12 July) which you believed was about 10 minutes before prayer time. 
  

Fortunately, because it was Ramadan, you were wrong.  So when the detonator duly exploded 
 

(but again not the main charge) no one was hurt – albeit that the shrapnel was propelled to, and 
 

embedded in, objects as far as 75yards away.  In the opinion of experts the device was extremely 

dangerous posing a significant risk to people and property with the potential to cause serious 
 

injury and death to those in proximity to the explosion at the time of detonation and on public 
 

transport as the device was being transported to its intended destination.  

Excellent police work, in particular the meticulous examination of many hours of CCTV footage, 

led eventually to images being found of you buying the bag in Asda in which you carried the first 

device to Walsall.  That was circulated in the media.  You yourself researched it on the West 

 

6
--------
Midlands Police website. Help from the public led to your arrest at the company’s premises in 

Small Heath on the 18th July.  After a short struggle you were detained.  Thereafter you were 

entirely cooperative. You informed officers that there were chemicals and various ingredients for 
 

a device in your bedroom but that none of it was modified and/or ready for use. The building 

was evacuated. A search revealed chemicals for the manufacture of another device - including 1 

litre  of  hydrogen  peroxide  35%,  aluminium  powder  and  ammonium.  In  your  bedroom  were 

found three partially adapted mobile phones and bomb making equipment.  

You  made  various  admissions  including  saying  that  you  had  planted  the  device  near  the 

Wolverhampton Mosque in order to demonstrate that the police had arrested the wrong man in 

relation  to  the  Walsall  device.  A  thumb  drive  was  also  recovered  which  contained  30 

photographs,  and  8  videos  including  footage  of  you  making  and  detonating  three  devices 
 

together  with  details  of  chemical  formulae  used  to  construct  devices,  poisons  and  the  use  of 

weapons. 

When your mobile phone was examined it was found to have been used to conduct searches in 

respect of the Mosques that you had attacked, and also in respect of two other mosques in other 

 

parts of the country.. 

In  interview  you  admitted  sourcing  the  materials,  constructing  the  devices,  researching  the 

targets and engaging in reconnaissance and deploying anti-surveillance tactics such as switching 

your mobile phone off so as to avoid cell siting. When asked the reason for the bombings, you 

stated  “racism”;  “so  I  would  like  to  increase  racial  conflict”.  You  stated  that  you  had  acted  on  the 

grounds of religion and colour as you believed a series of explosions “might achieve more” and “the 

Muslims will have to leave our area”. 

The Tipton device, you accepted, had been significantly more powerful and contained shrapnel 
 

in  the  form  of  nails  and  a  more  sophisticated  clock  device  that  avoided  the  prospect  of  the 

 

7
--------
device  being  activated  by  a  random  SMS  message.  Your  purpose  in  setting  the  device  was  to 
 

commit  a  terrorist  act  and  you  intended  that  mosque  goers  would  be  hurt.  You  said  that  the 

location was ideal as “there was little risk of white people suffering”. You said that the 21st June device 

(Walsall) was symbolic as the date of the Summer Equinox. You said that you had timed the 

Tipton device to explode on the 12th July as it was a Friday and was a day of “major prayer” in the 

Muslim faith. 
  

On the 20th July you were arrested on suspicion of the murder of Mr Saleem. You admitted the 

offence stating that you had travelled by bus to an area that you believed had a predominantly 

Muslim population whilst armed with a knife and that you were “looking for a suitable opportunity”. 

You  admitted  that  the  murder  was  committed  out  of  racial  hatred,  and  that  you  wandered 
 

around looking for a victim, and saw Mr Saleem who was alone and wearing traditional Muslim 
 

dress. You followed him and stabbed him to death. You described changing the position of your 
 

feet in order to achieve greater thrust when using the knife and wanted to stab him in the heart, 

stating “I have racial motivation and racial hatred”. 

You admitted that you had purchased the knife on your second or third day in Birmingham and 
 

described how you carried the knife on the evening of the murder and concealed it so “the enemy 
 

cannot see the position of the blade”. You stated that you had disposed of the knife as you ran away, 

thrusting it to the hilt into the ground by some shrubbery. You also admitted composing the 

entries  on  your  laptop  and  posing  with  the  knife  -  saying  that  the  image  was  a  “spontaneous 

decision” 

On Count 1 the sentence is mandatory - it must be one of life imprisonment. 

But I must also identify the minimum term that you must serve. 

 

8
--------
The prosecution argue that my starting point should be a whole life term upon the basis that the 

murder of Mr Saleem was done as part of a series of terrorist acts for the purpose of advancing a 
 

political,  religious  racial  or  ideological  cause  and  that  thus  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  is 
 

extremely high. 

On  your  behalf  it  is  accepted  that  the  murder  of  Mr  Saleem  was  both  racially  and  religiously 

aggravated and that thus, on any view, the starting point must be one of at least 30 years, but it is 

submitted that this is not a case in which I can be sure, on the facts, that a whole life term is 
 

required. 

Having considered the matter with great care, and set out the facts at some length, I am not sure 

 

that you murdered Mr Saleem to further a cause as such.  Rather it seems by me that you were 

acting alone and motivated by your own extreme and appalling prejudices – albeit that there are 

other  wholly  misguided  organisations  and  individuals  who  share  your  views.  Nor  do  any 

additional features of the case, whether taken individually or in combination, make me sure that 
 

this is a case for a whole life tariff. 

I  take  then  a  starting  point  of  30  years  to  reflect  the  racial  and  religious  aggravation  of  the 

murder.  I must also bear in mind the need to deter others. 

Starting from that point, there are a number of additional aggravating features -  the offence was 
 

committed  in  the  course  of  a  series  of  acts  of  terrorism;  there  was  a  significant  degree  of 

 

planning and premeditation; the murder involved the use of a knife taken to the scene for the 

purpose; Mr Saleem was particularly vulnerable through age and infirmity; and the murder took 
 

place in a public street with attendant public concern. 

The only mitigating features other than your plea are your age, your lack of previous convictions 

and you candour. 

 

9
--------
In  my  view  the  aggravating  features  massively  outweigh  the  mitigating  features,  taking  the 

minimum term up to 45 years, from which I deduct the maximum of 5 years to reflect your plea. 

Thus the minimum term will be one of 40 years before you can even be considered for release. 
  

There will be concurrent terms on the other Counts 

Stand up please. 

Pavlo Lapshyn, the sentence on Count 1 is life imprisonment with a minimum term of 40 years 

less the 93 days that you have spent on remand (subject to administrative correction).  On Count 

3  there  will  be  a  sentence  of  12  years  imprisonment  concurrent,  and  on  Count  4  likewise  a 

sentence of 12 years imprisonment concurrent. 

I make an order under s.23 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for the forfeiture and destruction of all 

the explosive ingredients and paraphernalia on the Schedule, and for the forfeiture of £2,000 of 

the  cash  which  money  is  to  be  used  for  the  benefit  of  the  West  Midlands  Police  and  for  the 

community they serve. 

There will be a Notification Order for the maximum of 30 years. 

Count 2 will lie on the file, subject to the usual order.

jUDICIARY OF
ENGLAND AND WALES
Preston Crown Court
R v Dyson Allen
Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Males
27 September 2013
Dyson Allen, you have been convicted by thejury of the manslaughter ofthree young
children, the twins Holly and Ella Smith aged four, and Jordan Smith aged two, and of their
elder half brother Reece Smith aged 19, who died attempting to rescue them. They died on 7
January 2012, when you deliberately set fire to clothing hanging in a wardrobe in the
bedroom where you knew that the three young children were asleep. You have been found
not guilty of murder.
You were 18 years and three months old at the time of the fire, and for the previous few
weeks had been staying at 122 Lytham Road in Freckleton where the fire took place. That
was the home of Michelle Smith and five of her nine children. You were a friend of Andrew
Smith, one of those children, and she had allowed you to stay there when you had nowhere
else to go as a result of a falling out with your step grandmother with whom you usually
lived, a falling out due to your heavy use of cannabis.
As often happened, on the night of 7 January there was a gathering of young people at the
house. Many ofthe young people, as well as Michelle Smith herself, were very drunk. You
were one of those who had been drinking vodka during the day and into the evening. In
addition, you and your friends’ idea of a good time was to huddle in the outside toilet at the
house smoking cannabis through a bong. You were allowed to do this. A large quantity of
cannabis had been smoked in this way on 7 January by several of the young people,
including you. You were both drunk and stoned.
Byjust after 11 pm you were one of six people remaining in the house, not counting the
young children. You were upstairs alone. You went into the bedroom where the young
children were asleep and set fire to the clothing hanging in the wardrobe upstairs. You left
the room and waited while the fire took hold. After several minutes the heat within the
bedroom was so intense that it melted the aluminium light fitting and caused the electricity
in the house to fail. It was only then that you came down the stairs raising the alarm. By that
time the fire in the wardrobe was raging, the bedroom was filled with smoke and it was so
hot that not only the light fitting but also the carpet in front of the wardrobe had melted.
In response to your shouts of ""fire"", Reece Smith rushed upstairs in a brave but doomed
attempt to rescue the young children. He managed to enter their bedroom but, in the
darkness, the heat and the smoke forced him to retreat into the other upstairs bedroom
--------
where he collapsed. The fire had awoken the three young children. They were heard calling
for their mother. One ofthe twins, Ella, stood on the molten carpet and suffered what must
have been agonising burns to herfeet. But in the dark and the heat and the smoke the
frightened children were unable to find their own way out of the bedroom and all attempts
to rescue them, in which you participated belatedly, were beaten back due to the smoke. By
the time the fire brigade arrived, Reece was dead. Later that night the three young children
were also pronounced dead. All four died as a result of smoke inhalation.
You had no motive to harm the children or anyone in the Smith family. Andrew was your
friend and so was Reece. You got on well with Michelle Smith who had given you shelter
when you needed it. You got on well too with the young children.
So why did you do it? In one sense, what prompted you to do this terrible thing, not only
starting a fire in a room where defenceless young children were asleep but waiting for
several minutes before raising the alarm, is a mystery. But in another sense, why you did it
seems clear enough. It was because you were out of your head due to the lethal
combination of alcohol and cannabis which you had taken that day at 122 Lytham Road, and
because of yourfascination with fire, particularly when you are affected by drink or drugs. If
you had not been drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis, four young people would still be
alive and several other lives would not have been blighted. But although you were
intoxicated, you were not so intoxicated that you did not know what you were doing. While
you did not intend to cause serious harm to the children, you knew what you were doing in
starting the fire and you had ample experience of the danger of fire.
You have a history of playing with fire going back for several years -- lighting bonfires using
petrol and aerosol cans to add to the excitement and danger; making molotov cocktails; and
using your cigarette lighter with an aerosol can to make a kind of flame thrower. You might
have been expected to grow out of such habits, as it seems that some of your former friends
have done, but you have not done so. Three incidents in particular stand out. Two of them
occurred at a party in March 2011, only some nine months before the fatal fire in Freckleton,
when under the influence of drink and drugs you thought it was funny to terrorise teenage
girls using your cigarette lighter and deodorant as a flame thrower. Despite your denials, and
despite the unsatisfactory nature of some of their evidence, I am satisfied that these
incidents occurred as the girls described. The third was only about a week before 7 January
2012, when you and Andrew Smith were spraying aerosol deodorant and lighting the spray
at 122 Lytham Road. Your evidence about this, that it was not a serious thing, just a trick and
something that a lot of people do, was a revealing indication that you have failed to mature
or to appreciate the danger of your conduct.
You have continued to deny your responsibility for the deaths of Reece, Holly, Ella and
Jordan and have lied repeatedly, not only to the police but in your evidence in this court. You
knew perfectly well that it was you who started this fire and before you were charged you
effectively admitted as much in Skype conversations which you never expected to see the
light of day. But your lies have gone further than prolonging the agony for the Smith family,
forcing them to relive the horrors of that night through seven weeks of this trial. In addition,
faced with the overwhelming expert evidence that the fire at 122 Lytham Road was started
deliberately, you not only maintained your denial of responsibility, but sought to shift the
Page 2 of5
--------
blame onto another visitor to the house that night, a young girl with a troubled background
who, despite the drunken state she was in and the unfortunate way she behaved, had
nothing to do with the deaths of Reece and the three young children.
It is not surprising that many tears were shed in the course of this trial, by witnesses and by
the family watching in the public gallery. The children's mother Michelle Smith and
grandmother Christine Smith have spoken movingly of what all four children meant to them,
and of how their loss has left a hole that can never be filled. Reece’s father has spoken too of
how Reece was not only his son but also his best friend, and of the impact which his death
has had.
You yourself were tearful when you came to give evidence in the witness box and I accept
that you regret the deaths of these young people and that you did so at the time. Indeed the
evidence was that you were extremely upset. But remorse is to be judged by your conduct as
a whole, including the many lies you told in an attempt to save your own skin with no
apparent sense ofshame. This is a factor to which I can give very limited weight.
These are the circumstances in which I must now pass sentence.
I am required to consider first whether you are a ”dangerous offender"" within the meaning
of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. That depends on whether there would be
a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm caused by the commission by you
of what are known as ""further specified offences"" if you were at large. ""Serious harm” in this
context means death or serious personal injury, and the risk must be significant as distinct
from a mere possibility or even some risk. The question is not whether you would be
dangerous in this sense in some years time, after serving whatever sentence I impose, but
whether you would be dangerous if released now. In a way, therefore, the question is
hypothetical, since you will not be released now. But that is the question which the law
requires me to consider.
In myjudgment, having listened to the evidence and observed you over the course ofthis
trial, having read what is written about you in the pre-sentence and psychiatric reports
prepared for this sentencing hearing, and applying the test which I have mentioned, you are
someone who does pose a significant risk of such serious harm. The circumstances in which
you started the fire at 122 Lytham Road and failed to raise the alarm until it was too late
speak for themselves. Your propensity to play with fire, and on some occasions to spice up
the excitement by using aerosols or petrol, is demonstrated by a long list of prior incidents.
Although many of these were some years ago, the list includes some which were both recent
and extremely dangerous. You act in this way when you are affected by drink and drugs. You
often are so affected and have for some years been a heavy user of cannabis. But you have
failed completely to recognise the dangerous nature ofsuch conduct which, when you are
drunk or drugged, you regard as funny or as a kind of party trick. I do not accept that there is
now little or no risk because you have learned your lesson. If you were going to learn a
lesson, it might have been expected that you would do so long ago when on one occasion
you injured yourself as a result of your games with fire, but you did not learn then and your
games continued.

Page 3 of5
--------
I must next consider whether the seriousness of the four offences of which you have been
convicted is such that a life sentence ought to be imposed. Such sentences are reserved for
offences of the utmost gravity, where it is necessary to reflect public abhorrence of what has
been done. They have been described as a last resort. While I accept that, there are
nevertheless cases in which they will be necessary. I consider that this is such a case and that
such a sentence is necessary having regard to the grave nature of your offences, which have
devastated a family and a whole community, as well as the need to protect the public. Even
an extended sentence of considerable length would not be sufficient to mark what you did
or to ensure proper public protection. I have already mentioned the features of the case
which lead to this conclusion -- the deliberate nature of what you did, not only lighting a fire
in a bedroom where three very young and vulnerable children were asleep, but waiting to
raise the alarm until the fire had taken hold; the fact that four young people have lost their
lives; and (though less significantly) the abuse ofthe hospitality which had been extended to
you and your attempt to pin the blame for these deaths on to a young and troubled girl.
Having reached this conclusion, I must set a minimum term which you must serve before you
can be considered for release on licence. If you had been convicted of murder, I would have
been required by law to take a starting point of 30 years, although that of course would be
no more than a starting point and would be subject to substantial adjustment to take
account of all the circumstances, and in particular your young age. As it is, the harm which
you have caused is no different from what it would have been if you had been convicted of
murder, but the absence of intention to kill or to cause really serious harm means that your
culpability is much less. In addition, you are young, a few days away from your 20th birthday
now, and just over 18 at the time of the fire, and you have not had the benefit of a stable
family upbringing. Despite the previous incidents with fire to which I have referred, you have
almost no previous convictions and none of any comparable gravity. I accept also that there
was no element of pre-meditation in the commission of these offences. These are important
mitigating factors and I take them into account.
Balancing the various considerations, if I were not passing a life sentence I would instead
have passed an extended sentence with a custodial period of 15 years, of which you would
have been required to serve at least ten years. That would suggest that the appropriate
minimum term would be ten years. However, I must also take account ofthe fact that you
have already been in custody forjust over nine months. Accordingly, I determine that the
minimum term which you must serve is nine years and three months. You must understand
that this is a minimum term. It does not mean that you will be released after that time.
Whether or when you will be released will be for the Parole Board to determine. You will
only be released if the Board is satisfied that you can be released without risk to public
safety and, in any event, once you are released you will remain on licence for the rest of
your life and liable to recall if you offend again or breach the terms of your licence.
Dyson Allen, for the reasons I have given the sentence which I pass on you for each count is
a life sentence with a minimum term of nine years and three months.
| direct that a copy of these sentencing remarks, together with the psychiatric and pre-
sentence reports, should be kept with your prison file so that they are available to those who
have to consider your case in future.

You may go down.
Finally, I wish to commend the meticulous and highly professional work of the Lancashire
Fire & Rescue Service, the police, and the experts associated with them in their investigation
of the cause of this fire. A case such as this, in which many of the witnesses present in the
house on the night in question were either drunk or stoned, presented obvious challenges.
However, the detailed and painstaking work done in excavating the fire debris and analysing
the origin and development of the fire produced the remarkable outcome, not only that
there was no room for any doubt as to where or how the fire had started, but also that there
was no real room for doubt that it had been started deliberately. Without that work, which
required great skill and expertise, it is doubtful whether it would have been possible to bring
this defendant to justice.

Lord Judge, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales : 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

We have all contributed to the writing of this judgment of the Court, which arises in 
 
melancholy circumstances as a result of flagrant misconduct and alleged professional 
incompetence by one of the advocates at trial, Mr Lawrence McNulty, leading counsel 
for Munir Farooqi (Farooqi).  

Between  16th  May  2011  and  9th  September  2011  Farooqi,  Matthew  Newton,  Israr 
Malik and Harris Farooqi (Farooqi’s son) were tried before Henriques J and a jury at 
the Crown Court sitting in Manchester.  The indictment contained 10 counts.  

Farooqi,  Newton  and  Malik  were  convicted  of  all  the  counts  that  they  faced,  and 
Harris Farooqi was acquitted of involvement in the single count which affected him, 
Count 1. 

Farooqi  was  convicted  on  five  counts:  one  count  of  engaging  in  conduct  in 
preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006 
(the Act) (Count 1), three counts of soliciting to murder contrary to section 4 of the 
Offences  Against  the  Persons  Act  1861  (Counts  3,  6  and  7)  and  one  count  of 
 
dissemination of terrorist publications contrary to section 2(1) (a) and (2) (b) of the 
 
Act (Count 4). He was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a specified minimum 
term  of  nine  years  on  Count  1,  to  imprisonment  for  life  with a  specified  minimum 
term of seven years on Counts 3. 6 and 7 and to a term of four years’ imprisonment on 
Count 4. The sentences were concurrent. 

Newton was convicted of one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of 
terrorism  contrary  to  section  5(1)  of  the  Act  (Count  1)  and  of  two  counts  of 
dissemination of terrorist publications contrary to section 2(1) (a) and (2) (b) of the 
 
Act (Counts 2 and 5). He was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment on Count 1, three 
years’  imprisonment  on  Count  2  and  four  years’  imprisonment  on  Count  5.  The 
sentences were concurrent. 

Malik was convicted of one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of 
terrorism contrary to section 5 (1) of the Act (Count 8) and two counts of soliciting to 
murder contrary to section 4 of the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861 (Counts 9 
and  10).  He  was  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  public  protection  (IPP)  with  a 
minimum  specified  term  of  five  years  on  Counts  9  and  10,  concurrent,  with  no 
separate penalty on Count 8. 

Farooqi, Newton and Malik were given appropriate credit for time spent on remand in 
custody. They were also made subject to the notification requirements of the Counter 
Terrorism  Act  2008  (Farooqi  for  a  period  of  thirty  years,  Newton  for  a  period  of

fifteen years and Malik for a period of thirty years). Various other forfeiture orders 
were made.    

 
8.	 

Harris  Farooqi  was  alleged  to  have  assisted  his  father  in  the  recruitment  and 
radicalisation process. As we have said he was acquitted. In this judgment we shall 
refer to him by his full name to distinguish him from his father, and shall only do so 
when this is a required feature of the narrative.  

The Appeals 

 
9.	 

Farooqi,  Newton  and  Malik  seek  leave  to  appeal  against  their  convictions.  Farooqi 
and  Malik  also  seek  leave  to  appeal  against  sentence.  Malik’s  and  Newton’s 
applications  have  been  referred  to  the  full  court  by  the  single  judge.    Farooqi’s 
applications, which are some 8 months out of time, have been referred to the full court 
by  the  Registrar.  In  the  circumstances  we  granted  each  appellant  leave  to  appeal 
against  convictions  on  the  single  issue  of  the  consequences  of  Mr  McNulty’s 
misconduct and his alleged incompetence.  

Representation 

The  representation  at  trial  was  as  follows.  Andrew  Edis  QC  and  Stuart  Baker 
appeared for the Crown. Farooqi was represented by Mr McNulty and Hossein Zahir 
instructed by Tuckers. The solicitor at Tuckers with the day to day conduct of the case 
 
was Vajahat Sharif. Matthew Newton was represented by Maura McGowan QC and 
Ian McMeekin. Malik was represented by Joel Bennathan QC and Peter Wilcock also 
instructed  by  Tuckers.  Harris  Farooqi  was  represented  by  Charles  Bott  QC  and 
Christopher Henley, instructed by Stephen Lickrish and Associates.   

The representation before this court is the same as that at trial, with one exception. 
Farooqi is now represented by those who represented Harris Farooqi at trial – that is, 
by Mr Bott and Mr Henley instructed by Stephen Lickrish and Associates.   

In view of the criticisms made of his trial counsel in Farooqi’s Grounds of Appeal, 
Farooqi  was  invited  to  and  did  waive  privilege.  Letters  of  response  to  Farooqi’s 
Grounds  of  Appeal  were  received  from Mr  Zahir  on  17th  July  2012,  from  Mr  Jim 
Meyer of Tuckers on 18th July 2012 and from Mr McNulty on 31st July 2012.  

 

On  22nd  November  2012  directions  were  made  by  a  different  constitution  of  this

should  consider  making  a  request  for  a  witness  statement  directly  to  counsel  who 
appeared for Farooqi at trial.

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
14.	 

 

On 24th June 2013, despite the waiver of privilege, Mr McNulty declined a request 
from the Crown Prosecution Service to provide a witness statement in respect of the 
instructions by and advice given to Farooqi.  Mr McNulty also declined to provide 
 
any further assistance in relation to the issue of the advice given to Farooqi not to give 
evidence, which he had been asked to give in the light of the Crown’s submissions in 
its skeleton argument for Farooqi’s appeal. Beyond stating that his lack of comment 
 
on the skeleton did not imply either approval or disagreement with it, he offered no 
response to the opportunity to provide a witness statement to counter or address the 
direct  personal  criticisms  contained  in  it.  Mr  Zahir  however  provided  further 
responses in relation to the matters with which he was asked to deal for the purposes 
 
of these applications, including in a statement dated 8th May 2013 to which we refer 
below. Later in the judgment we shall return to emphasise that we were not given, and 
were  not  asked  by  Farooqi  to  seek  assistance  from  the  potential  witnesses  to  these 
 
issues. 

15.	  Mr John Ryder QC appears for the Bar Council at the invitation of the Registrar, to 

 

assist the court on matters of professional conduct raised by these applications.  

Grounds of appeal against conviction 

 
16.	 

In  the  unusual  circumstances  of  these  appeals,  we  shall  begin  by  describing  the 
grounds  of  appeal  and,  having  so  to  speak,  explained  the  context,  we  shall  then 
address the factual issues in lengthy, but unfortunately necessary detail.  

Farooqi 

 

17.	  Mr Bott submits Farooqi’s conviction is unsafe for a number of related reasons. He 
says Farooqi was not competently represented at trial with the result that his defence 
 
was not presented to the jury coherently or at all.  Instead, Mr McNulty relied upon a 
series  of  legal  arguments  and  submissions  that  were  misconceived  in  law  and 
untenable.  He also consistently defied rulings of the court and behaved in a manner 
that  was  unprofessional  and  provocative.  These  (cumulative)  failings  were  so 
fundamental that in the exceptional circumstances of this case, Farooqi was denied a 
 
fair trial. The jury’s perception of his case must have been influenced by the judge’s 
repeated  attempts  to  correct  or  control  his  counsel’s  behaviour  and  the  extensive 
 
directions in the summing up that were required as a result.  These suggested that the 
conduct  of  Farooqi’s  case  had  been  misguided  and  improper,  that  the  jury  should 
disregard arguments raised by Mr McNulty in his closing speech and treat lengthy and 
 
aggressive  cross-examination  conducted  on  Farooqi’s  behalf  as  irrelevant.  Mr 
McNulty’s  strategies  were  both  inept  and  provocative:  they  took  no  account  of  the 
law or the basic rules of criminal procedure. They required a strong judicial response. 
What  distinguishes  this  case  from  the  norm  is  that  Mr  McNulty  persisted  in  his 
 
approach despite that response. He was defiant throughout both in his attitude to the 
court,  and  in  his  disobedience  to  the  judge’s  rulings.  The  jury  saw  the  persistent 
conflict between the judge and counsel and then heard a summing up which set out

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

Mr McNulty’s failings at length. This was bound to influence their view of Farooqi’s 
case and perhaps, that of the other appellants. 

 

18.	  Mr  Bott  further  contends  that  the  issue  of  the  fairness  of  Farooqi’s  trial  does  not 
depend  on  a  consideration  of  the  quality  of  Farooqi’s  defence,  which  was  that  he 
lacked the requisite intent to commit any of the offences of which he was convicted. 
His instructions were wholly obscured by the way in which his case was conducted; 
and so, it is said, he certainly did not give any meaningful or informed consent to the 
 
conduct of his case so as to be responsible for it. Mr Bott makes no criticism of Mr 
 
Meyer, who he says, played no active part in the conduct of the case or of Mr Zahir, 
who he says was hardly consulted by Mr McNulty at all. 

Newton 

In relation to Mr McNulty’s conduct and its consequences, Ms McGowan for Newton 
 
adopts  the  arguments  advanced  for  Farooqi.  She  says  the  history  of  this  case  is 
complex  and  unusual.  Farooqi  and  Newton  were  closely  linked  in  fact  and  on  the 
 
Crown’s case. As a consequence of the way Farooqi’s case was conducted the judge 
had little or no option but to take on the role of prosecutor to redress it. The summing 
up was flawed in consequence, as it contained a series of observations on the facts 
which favoured the Crown. To consider the case against Newton the jury was required 
to give fair and objective interpretation to his explanation given in evidence for words 
said or acts done. But in circumstances where the judge had to “redress the balance” 
 
the effect was to prejudice the case of Newton.  The directions that the jury should 
ignore any views which the judge expressed or appeared to express about the facts 
were inevitably compromised by the need to correct Mr McNulty’s submissions. As a 
 
result, Newton did not receive a fair trial.  The jury in his case alone should have been 
discharged.  The  combination  of  the  conduct  of  the  trial  and  the  content  of  the 
 
summing up must, as the judge feared, have had such an impact on Newton’s case as 
 
to create a real risk of unfairness. If his case had been conducted in the manner in 
which Farooqi’s case was, he would, subject to consent or collusion, have an arguable 
ground of appeal. The position is that much stronger when he had no control over the 
conduct of which complaint is now made. 

 Mr Bennathan QC for Malik puts his grounds of appeal somewhat differently to those 
advanced for Farooqi and Newton. 

He  submits,  first,  that  the  unusual  circumstances  surrounding  the  conduct  of  the 
defence  of  Farooqi  at  trial  were  such  that  Farooqi’s  defence  was  not  properly  or 
 
adequately put before the jury. Given the powerful links between Farooqi and Malik, 
that is sufficient to cast doubt on the safety of Malik’s conviction. A central plank of 
Malik’s defence (that his lack of criminal intent was shown by the fact that he never 
initiated any conversations about jihad with the undercover officers) was “swamped” 
 
by the judge’s repeated and powerful directions that such initiation was irrelevant to

the  jury’s  deliberations  insofar  as  it  went  to  entrapment.  The  judge  effectively 
withdrew the issue whether the police had acted unlawfully or unfairly from the jury; 
this was intended as a direction to exclude entrapment from the jury’s consideration, 
 
but in a case where there were allegations and counter allegations of lying between a 
 
police  officer  and  Malik,  it  rendered  his  conviction  unsafe.  The  summing  up  was 
flawed because it contained a variety of observations on the facts of the case which 
favoured the Crown, aggravated by the fact that the judge compromised the warning 
about putting aside his own views by correcting comments made by Mr McNulty. In 
the peculiar circumstances of the trial, what is described as the Watson direction (see 
R  v  Watson  [1998]  QB  690)  combined  with  the  chronology  of  the  verdicts,  raises 
 
concerns about the way in which the jury approached their deliberations and returned 
their verdicts. 

The Crown’s response 

 

22.	  Mr Edis accepts that the conduct of Farooqi’s defence was deserving of substantial 
criticism. However although the court may wish to take the opportunity to indicate its 
views of the proper bounds of defence conduct, the question for decision is not one of 
professional discipline, but whether the trial was marred by any unfairness to one or 
more of the appellants which renders any of the convictions unsafe.  

 
23.	 

 
24.	 

The case against Farooqi was overwhelming and the issue extremely simple. The case 
 
against the defendant was what he said to undercover police officers. There was no 
dispute about what he had said. Did he mean what he said?  The simple issue was 
properly before the jury, who could hardly have failed to grasp it.  

As to the circumstances in which Farooqi elected not to give evidence, according to 
Mr Edis, he would have had an impossible time in the witness box. That explains his 
decision. Although there is no evidence that Farooqi was informed of the approach 
which  Mr  McNulty  intended  to  take  in  his  closing  speech,  neither  is  there  any 
evidential basis for the conclusion that Farooqi’s decision not to give evidence was 
not  an  informed  decision  and  this  is  underlined  by  his  striking  silence  before  this 
court, and the absence of any witness statement on this topic from him. 
 

 

25.	  Mr Edis further submitted that the evidence given by Newton and Malik presented an 
 
additional burden to both of them and to Farooqi. Their appeals are predicated on the 
basis that if Farooqi was not guilty then neither were they. But the reverse is also true: 
if they were guilty, so was he. If any defendant was convicted, it is highly likely that 
the  other  defendants  would  also  be  convicted,  not  least  because  of  the  striking 
similarity  in  the  things  which  they  said  to  the  investigating  police  officers.
  The 
inference that they were working together was obvious.  By contrast Harris Farooqi 
said nothing to the undercover officers at any stage. Mr Edis reminded us that in view 
of the nexus between the defendants and because of their concerns about the approach 
of  Mr  McNulty,  counsel  for  the  three  appellants  (including  Mr  Bott  for  Harris 
Farooqi) were permitted to make submissions to the jury which argued for Farooqi’s 
 
acquittal. This provides a clear indication of the way in which the cases were linked.

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 

26.	  Mr Edis emphasises that it is not submitted by the appellants that any of the judge’s 
 
rulings  on  the  legal  submissions  made  by  Mr  McNulty  or  his  corrections  of  Mr 
McNulty’s  conduct  are  open  to  any  criticism.  Therefore,  however  unfortunate  the 
circumstances which required them to be made they have no relevance to the eventual 
outcome. The basis for examining the safety of the convictions should be confined to 
what happened before the jury. 

 
27.	 

 
28.	 

This  has  two  aspects:  first,  the  cross-examination  of  the  undercover  officers  by  Mr 
McNulty  and,  second,  the  contents  of  the  summing  up.  As  to  the  first,  the  judge 
showed great restraint during the cross-examination. There was a legitimate point to 
 
the cross-examination of the undercover officers by Mr McNulty, which was designed 
to  demonstrate  that  they,  rather  than  Farooqi,  were  responsible  for  the  initiation  of 
discussion about jihad, potentially a relevant consideration to the issue of Farooqi’s 
 
intent.  That question was ventilated at enormous length, and was at the forefront of 
the  evidence  before  the  jury.  The  other  purposes  of  cross-examination  (with 
suggestions  that  the  officers  were  “professional  liars”  and  “tricksters”),  although 
remote from the issues in the trial, provoked little judicial intervention.      

Provided that the decision not to give evidence was freely taken by Farooqi, as clearly 
it  was,  the  summing  up  must  be  studied  as  a  whole.  Examined  in  this  way,  the 
necessary  corrections  did  not  assume  undue  prominence,  and  would  not  have  been 
misunderstood by the jury. The corrections section was a relatively small part of an 
otherwise conventional and helpful summing up which made the issues clear to the 
jury. There is no substance in the criticisms in the summing up advanced on Malik’s 
behalf. 

 

29.	  Mr Edis submits that the judge, having spent considerable time on the crafting of the 
 
summing  up,  performed  an  extremely  difficult  task  in  an  exemplary  fashion,  thus 
remedying the problems caused to the trial, the Crown, the remaining defendants and 
Farooqi  by  Mr  McNulty  without  compromising  the  essential  fairness  of  the  trial. 
Accordingly the convictions are safe. 

 

 
30.	 

These  are  the  issues  which  arise  in  these  appeals  and  to  which  our  analysis  of  the 
evidence is directed. 

The Crown’s case at trial 

The  case  for  the  Crown  was  that  each  the  four  defendants  engaged  in  conduct 
designed  to  radicalise  individuals  to  commit  violent  jihad  in  Afghanistan  and 
Pakistan. 

Farooqi  was  the  eldest  of  the  defendants,  a  highly  intelligent  man  with  good 
knowledge of English. It was the Crown’s case that he was the charismatic leader of a 
small  group  of  Islamic  extremists  intent  on  identifying,  converting  and  radicalising 
vulnerable  young  men  for  the  cause  of  Jihad.  Farooqi  ran  a  Da’wah  stall  in

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

Manchester  promoting  Islamic  material.    He  was  the  principal  target  of  a  covert 
surveillance operation conducted between November 2008 and November 2009. Two 
undercover police officers, “Ray” and “Simon” were given an identity as vulnerable 
and isolated individuals. They were deployed with instructions to approach Farooqi’s 
Da’wah  stall  and  express  an  interest  in  Islam.  The  expectation  was  that,  in 
consequence, Farooqi would befriend them, enabling evidence to be gathered as the 
relationship  developed.  Ray  and  Simon  were  permitted  to  show  the  necessary 
enthusiasm for their task and to raise a series of topics of conversation to assist their 
investigation into the radicalisation process.  

 

The many conversations and meetings which took place during the ensuing 11 months 
 
were  covertly  recorded  and  the  transcripts  of  these  recordings  became  the  central 
 
evidence in the case against the appellants.  

Very  briefly,  the  process  employed  by  the  undercover  officers,  who  worked 
separately, was that after completing each deployment with any of the defendants, and 
 
as  soon  as  possible  thereafter,  they  wrote  up  their  recollections  in  their  evidence 
books.  Subsequently  the  recordings  were  downloaded  and  much  later  they  were 
transcribed and the transcript prepared by others was checked and corrected. When 
writing  their  recollections  the  undercover  officers  did  not  know  what  had  been 
successfully  recorded  and  what  had  failed  to  be  recorded  by  the  equipment.  Their 
evidence books were checked against the transcripts for the purpose of disclosure and 
then  for  the  evidence  to  be  given  at  trial.  It  is  said  by  Mr  Edis,  and  has  not  been 
disputed, that there was a very high level of accuracy, that these methods worked and 
that  the  jury  therefore  knew  that  the  undercover  officers  had  been  meticulous  and 
accurate across the whole investigation. With the exception of one phrase arising in 
relation to Malik, the accuracy of precisely what each appellant had actually said was 
effectively undisputed. 

A key part of the Crown’s case related to the position of Malik. The Crown alleged 
that  there  was  compelling  evidence  that  he  was  a  young  man  radicalised  to  a 
 
dangerous  extent  by  Farooqi,  and  this  gave  the  lie  to  any  suggestion  that  Ray  and 
Simon had manipulated Farooqi to create an artificial relationship. The Crown relied 
on  Farooqi’s  possession  of  “under  the  counter  DVDs”  which  were  played,  for 
example, to Malik and his relationship with Shaykh Farooqi (no relation) to whom he 
 
directed Ray to discuss his desire to fight jihad. The Crown argued that the “circle of 
trust” i.e. those with whom Ray and Simon were told they could talk openly about 
 
jihad, including Newton and Malik - and the use of codewords – “getting married” for 
 
martyred, going on “holiday” for jihad and “the weather” for local conditions in the 
Swat valley – indicated that this was a real rather than a fantasy conspiracy.  

This evidence revealed a deliberate process of grooming Ray and Simon for violent 
 
jihad  abroad,  directed  by  Farooqi  assisted  by  co-defendants.  The  initial  phase  was 
 
alleged  to  be  conversion  to  Islam,  followed  by  a  programme  of  increasing 
radicalisation as the converts were prepared mentally to engage in violent jihad. The 
 
Crown  relied  on  the  topics  discussed  and  views  expressed  by  Farooqi  during  the 
course of Ray and Simon’s deployment. On many occasions he talked to them about

his  time  in  Afghanistan  in  2001  when  he  had  travelled  to  fight  with  the  Taliban 
shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Farooqi played extremist DVDs to the officers, watched 
footage on YouTube with them, and supplied them with various lectures by Anwar 
Al-Awlaki. When Ray and Simon said that their ultimate purpose was to participate in 
violent  jihad,  they  were  clearly  and  unequivocally  encouraged  in  their  declared 
endeavours. 

 

 
37.	 

 
38.	 

In  circumstances  to  which  we  shall  come  in  detail  later,  and  as  we  have  already 
indicated,  Farooqi  did  not  give  evidence.  There  was  however  no  challenge  to  the 
accuracy of the transcripts. As Mr Edis submitted, and Mr Bott did not dispute, on the 
basis of what he said the case against him was a strong one. In accordance with the 
 
defence  case  statement  served  on  21st  March  2011  Farooqi’s  defence  was  “that  he 
lacked the requisite intent to commit any of the offences of which he was convicted 
and had allowed himself to respond to a suggestive agenda in a way that was at odds 
with  anything  he  could  possibly  achieve.”    His  defence,  Mr  Bott  says,  depended 
almost entirely upon the meaning of the words spoken by him and the reliability of 
any  conclusions  which  could  be  reached  by  the  jury  about  his  intention  when 
speaking those words. Mr Edis encapsulated the issue for the jury in submissions to 
the judge in this way: “if the jury are sure that the words were uttered, what did they 
mean and with what intent were they spoken?”   

Newton,  a  convert  to  Islam,  gave  evidence  at  trial.  He  worked  on  Farooqi’s  stall 
 
having been recruited by him. He was alleged to be Farooqi’s trusted accomplice who 
supplied  offensive  “terrorist”  material  to  Ray  and  Simon,  and  encouraged  them  in 
their pursuit of violent jihad. Newton served a detailed defence case statement and his 
evidence  accorded  with  it.  Again,  there  was  no  dispute  about  what  he  said,  as 
recorded in the transcripts, or what he did. 1  The issue at trial concerned his intent in 
saying what he did or in doing what he was said to have done. It was the Crown’s 
 
case that the view to be taken of Newton and his motives was to be judged against his 
relationship with Farooqi. Newton said he genuinely wanted to promote the religious 
aspects  of  his  faith,  but  had  no  intention  of  encouraging  violence  or  terrorism.  He 
accepted that his conduct was open to sinister interpretation, and he also accepted that 
he had handed over material which was capable of amounting to terrorist publications 
 
to the officers, but he denied any involvement in terrorism or any intention to become 
so involved. 

 

39.	  Malik was alleged to have been recruited and radicalised by Farooqi before he went to 
prison  (for  an  unrelated  matter)  in  January  2009.  Whilst  in  prison,  he  radicalised 
others with the assistance of materials provided to him by Farooqi. He emerged from 
prison  on  15th  June  2009  as  a  fully  committed  jihadi.    Thereafter  he  engaged  in 
radicalising  and  encouraging  Simon  to  engage  in  violent  jihad  overseas.  On  24th 
September 2009 and again on 29th October 2009 he solicited or encouraged Simon to 
murder another person or persons unknown. The Crown also relied on the similarity 

                                                 
1  For  example  he  accepted  giving  Simon  various  electronic  books  (“Battle  of  The  Hearts  &  Minds”, 
 
“Milestones” and “The Dust Will Never Settle Down”) and audio recordings (“The Battle of The Hearts and 
 
Minds, “Allah is Preparing us for Victory I”, Allah is Preparing us for Victory 2”, “The Dust Will Never Settle 
Down”, “The Constants of Jihad Part 1”,   “The Constants of Jihad Part 2”,   “The Constants of Jihad Part 3”, 
 
“The Constants of Jihad Part 4”, “The Constants of Jihad Part 5” and  “The Constants of Jihad Part 6”).

in language between that used by Farooqi when radicalising a recruit for jihad and the 
language used by Malik.  It was said, in short, that he had learned it all from Farooqi. 
Albeit the context of the particular conversations was important (in particular as the 
jury  were  to  find,  that  Farooqi,  a  very  influential  man  in  Malik’s  life,  was  indeed 
recruiting Simon for terrorism) reliance was placed, as for the other appellants, on the 
 
transcripts and, on a limited number of occasions where recordings were incomplete, 
 
on the statements made by the undercover officers in their evidence books about the 
relevant conversations. In the written grounds of appeal the accuracy of three words in 
the transcripts by Malik at trial (“I wanna die” 2) was disputed, but the overwhelming 
bulk of what he was recorded as having said was not in dispute.  

 

 

40.	  Malik gave evidence. His position was wholly supportive of Farooqi.  His defence, as 
presented  at  trial,  was  that  there  was  no  “grand  conspiracy”  between  the  four 
defendants,  as  alleged.  The  conversations  relied  on  by  the  prosecution  did  not 
demonstrate  the  necessary  intent  either  for  solicitation  to  murder  or  to  engage  in 
conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism. His lack of criminal intent was shown by 
the  fact  that  he  never  initiated  any  conversations  about  jihad  with  the  undercover 
officers. He never intended Simon to go and fight abroad unless and until the second 
coming. This meant he was not guilty on all the counts affecting him, and (in relation 
to  counts  9  and  10),  he  did  nothing  beyond  showing  friendship  to  Simon  and 
supporting him in his declared intention to become a good Muslim.   

The contentious parts of the trial and the issues raised in the appeals 

 
41.	 

As we have said, it is submitted that the trial was unfair to the appellants for various 
reasons, arising principally from Mr McNulty’s conduct of Farooqi’s defence, and the 
consequences  which  flowed  from  that.  These  submissions  have  focused  largely  but 
not exclusively on Mr McNulty’s cross-examination of Ray and Simon, on a number 
of  legal  submissions  he  made  during  the  trial  and  his  closing  address  to  the  jury, 
Farooqi’s decision not to give evidence, and the way in which the judge dealt with all 
 
these matters in his summing up. We turn therefore to these parts of the trial in the 
order in which they arose, and the criticisms made by the appellants.      

The cross-examination of Ray and Simon 

Although  the  accuracy  of  the  transcripts  was  agreed,  Mr  McNulty  cross-examined 
Ray and Simon over a period of 14 days. Mr Bott says that the cross-examination was 
prolix, extensive and irrelevant, and, on occasions, offensive, and that for some time 
its underlying purpose was not clear. At a later stage in the trial the judge said that he 
allowed  the  cross-examination  to  continue  because  he  thought  it  would  be  counter 
 
productive for him to interrupt it, and because he could not foresee that in the end it 
would be largely irrelevant. At one level Mr Bott submits, Mr McNulty was laying the 
foundation for the suggestion that the undercover officers “controlled the agenda” and 
 
Farooqi’s contributions to the conversations had to be judged in that light. However 
this  could  have  been  done  in  a  fraction  of  the  time  and  with  proper  focus.    It  was 

                                                 
2 Words spoken by Malik to Farooqi on 31st July 2009.

moreover hard to foresee that this represented an attempt to set up a submission to 
stay the indictment or exclude the evidence ex post facto because there was no proper 
legal or procedural foundation for such an approach. However he says with hindsight, 
the cross-examination foreshadowed this strategy.  

 
43.	 

By  way  of  example,  Mr  Bott  draws  attention  to  the  following  passages  from  Mr 
 
McNulty’s cross-examination of Ray, (a) near the beginning, (b) the middle (c) the 
 
end of the process and (d) to similar passages from the cross-examination of Simon, 
with the particular parts of what was said that are relied on highlighted in bold :  

 

 

 

(a) “Q. Well, what I suggest to you is this: that from at least mid January 2009, that that 
 
was your style?  That you were trying to take advantage of Munir Farooqi's good nature, 
so  that  you  could  do  him  harm  by  attempting  to  trick  him  into  committing  an 
offence.  Is that right? 
 
A.  No, sir, it's completely incorrect.  I was playing the part of a role that I had been 
 
asked to do so, that had been authorised by a senior officer, and one of my objectives 
 
was to play the part of a vulnerable person with low social ties, and I did that throughout 
the course of the operation. 
 
Q.  And I suggest that in pursuit of conviction, while you have been in that witness box, 
it  has  been  your  purpose  to  deceive  the  jury  by  painting  a  false  picture  of  your 
relationship with Mr. Farooqi.  You have lied in short, is that correct? 
A.  It's certainly not the case.  I have sworn an oath.  I am a professional undercover law 
enforcement operative, and in doing so, I have answered every question which I believe 
 
to be correct, which I have signed a statement to that effect. 
Q.  You are a professional law enforcement undercover officer? 
 
A.  I am a police officer.  I am a professional police officer, yes. 
Q.  Yes, you are a professional liar, putting it bluntly? 
A.  I use tactics as such as an undercover law enforcement operative to carry out my 
 
role.  Yes, I do lie in the role of an undercover law enforcement operative, but on this 
 
occasion I have sworn the oath and I have answered every question which I believe to be 
 
correct. 
 
Q.  So you deny both propositions I have been putting to you, that you have been 
 
attempting to trick him and that you have been lying on oath, so therefore I had 
better prove those propositions” 
 
(b)  “Q.  And  over  the  next  eight  months  you  were  going  to  encourage  him  at  every

A.  No, sir, and I didn't. 
 
Q.  And you and Simon were going to play word games with a man who was ignorant of 
 
the fact that he was in peril, in order to trick him to giving you some encouragement 
 
by way of document, advice or assistance? 
 
A. 
enforcement operative, but in answer to your question, that's no. 
 
Q.  And the purpose of that was to enable you to arrest him?”

(c) “Q:  Now earlier on in my cross-examination of you, I drew your attention to the fact 
that some people feign difficulties, so that they can assault, rob or rape people who come 
 
to their assistance.  What I am suggesting to you is you feigned inadequacy, in order 
 
that you could steal from Mr. Farooqi, in order that you could steal his liberty.  Is 
 
that not right? 
 
 
A.  No, it isn't, sir”   
 
 
(d) “Q.  And what I am suggesting to you is whether or not he was sending people or 
engineering for people to go abroad to participate in violent conflict, was a matter of no 
 
interest to you in late January of 2009.  In late January of 2009 you were hell bent on 
tricking this man into committing an offence?.. 
  

 

 

 

 

  

Q.  What, and we can trust you, can we? 
A.  Er, yes, fully. 
Q.  A professional liar? 
 
A.  Erm, I am not a professional liar.   

Q.  Right.    Now  I  think  we  agree  that  you  do  tell  lies  professionally  when  you  are 
 
engaged as an undercover officer?  

Q.  You were cynically exploiting the death of that man, in order to excite either hostile 
feelings or hostile words against the police, were you not? 
A.  No. 
Q.  So that it might be deployed later in evidence? 
 
A.  No. 
Q.  And it is as an example of many examples of how poisonous and devious you can be, 
seeking out your aims? 

The  judge  intervened  during  the  cross  examination  on  a  number  of  occasions.  Mr 
 
Bott  refers  to  one  example,  during  the  cross  examination  of  Simon  on  the  13  July 
2011, which we set out in its context: 

“Q:  Well, you say to respect people's human rights, but you never had any right to enter 
 
his premises, did you? 
 
A.  Er, yes, I did. 
Q.  How so? 
 
A.  He invited me in. 
Q.  He never invited you in? 
A.  I think you will find the first time I ever met Munir on the 4th of January, he invited 
 
me to come to his house for something to eat.  He wrote his address down, he give me 
his telephone number. 
 
Q.  No, no, no, no, he never invited you? 
A.  He did. 
 
Q.  He invited the person you were pretending to be? 
A.  Which is me.

Q.  He invited the person that was interested in Islam in.

 J:  Mr. McNulty. 

LM:  My Lord.  He never invited you in? 

A.  Erm, I was portraying to be a normal member of the public.  If it wasn't me that 
 
Munir had invited in and radicalised and encouraged to go and fight Jihad, it would have 
 
been  another  vulnerable  member  of  the  public  from  Manchester,  so  in  respect  of  me 
attending  his  address,  I  feel  that  my  main  hope  is  that  I  have  stopped  a  vulnerable 
 
individual from Manchester being radicalised by Munir and others. 
Q.  But you never believed for one second that if he knew who you really were you 
would be invited to his premises, did you?

J:  Yes. 
AE QC:  Because what he is implying from his position as Counsel in his question is that 
the  fact  that  the  officer  was  going  under  an  assumed  alias,  means  that  the  invitation 
which was extended to him did not create a right to enter, and that is, I am afraid, not the 
law. 
J:  Of course.  It ---

AE QC:  I am sorry about that, but it is just not. 

J:  Mr. McNulty, more than one member of the jury was actually shaking his or her head
 
 
whilst you took this point. 

LM:  Well, let us see. 

J:  Mr. McNulty, I am not going to permit it.  It is a complete waste of time.  It is ill 

conceived in law, and please move on.  He was perfectly entitled to enter those premises.  

Any suggestion that he was not is wrong in law.

different way.  He was entitled to enter those premises, and that is the end of the matter.  

 
 

 

 

Legal  Submissions:  (i)  The  application  to  exclude  the  evidence  of  the  undercover  officers 
 
and/or for a stay 
 

On  the  evening  of  28th  July  2011,  just  before  the  close  of  the  Crown’s  case,  the 
Crown was served with a skeleton argument which bore the names of Mr McNulty 
and  Mr  Zahir.  It  was  headed  “Skeleton  argument  on  behalf  of  Munir  Farooqi  in 
support of application to exclude evidence of UCO’s [sic] [undercover officers] under 
section  78  and  to  stay  the  indictment.”  This  was  the  first  intimation  that  any  such 
submission  might  be  made.  A  skeleton  argument  also  making  submissions  about 
entrapment had been served on behalf of Malik earlier that day.  

 
45.

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
46.	 

The  first  paragraph  of  the  Farooqi  skeleton  argument  was  entitled”  Statement  of 
Purpose”. It read: 

""In light of the fact that the Defendant denies he has committed any criminal offence 
this  is  an  application  under  section  78  of  the  Police  and  Criminal  Evidence  Act  to 
exclude the evidence of the undercover officers and to stay the indictment in respect 
 
 
of counts 1, 3, 9 and 10  on the grounds of entrapment or attempted entrapment…” 

 

 
47.	 

The second paragraph was headed “Issue”. It said: 

“Have UCO’s Ray and Simon lured or attempted to lure its (sic) Munir Farooqi into 
committing acts forbidden by the law?” 

The  skeleton  went  on  to  suggest  that  the  conduct  of  the  undercover  officers  went 
beyond offering the appellant an unexceptionable opportunity to commit an offence. 
A section headed: “The Law”  said: 

“The law as to the applicable principles relating to entrapment can be distilled from 
the speeches in R v Loosely (2001) UKHL 53.” 
 

It was then argued that this case was a prolonged and suggestive undercover operation 
in which the undercover officers persistently set the tone of the conversations so as to 
 
lure the appellant in doing or saying things he would not otherwise have done. Thus 
the skeleton said: 

 

 

“It is submitted that if the Crown seek to assert that it was consistent with the ordinary 
process of terrorist radicalisation it is incumbent upon them to place before the court 
evidence of the terrorist radicalisation of vulnerable men, such as to demonstrate there 
exists a common pattern… 
 
“Further  there  is  no  evidence  that  persons  approached  for  radicalisation  either  all 
 
 
succumb or those who do not are unwilling to come forward to the police… 
 
“…it was the clear intention of the UCO’s to lure Munir Farooqi into committing a 
crime and as such their evidence ought to be excluded and Crowns stayed on all but 
count 4…” 

 
The application evoked a strong response from the Crown. Amongst other things Mr 
Edis complained:  

 
i)	  The arrests in the case took place in November 2009, and dismissal applications 
were made to Henriques J and rejected in December 2010. The case was managed 
 
by the court before trial. No such submission had been intimated by either Malik 
or Farooqi before then.

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 

ii)  The evidence in the case was agreed.  There was no dispute about what Ray and 
Simon had said to Malik or Farooqi, and none about what Malik or Farooqi had 
said  to  them.  Further,  the  trial  date  had  been  postponed  so  that  both  men  (who 
were  in  custody)  could  listen  to  every  word  of  the  recordings  before  trial  with 
their lawyers.  

 

iii) If the submissions were well-founded and the proceedings an abuse then hundreds 
of thousands of pounds would have been wasted, the resources of the court and the 
jury would have been needlessly expended, and two men who ought never to have 
been prosecuted would have spent two years needlessly in custody. 

 

iv)  The timing of the applications was a matter of grave concern not merely because 
of  the  breach  of  the  practice  direction  relating  to  abuse  applications  and  the 
 
Criminal Procedure Rules, (1.2, 3.2 and 3.3) but because each defendant was in 
 
serious breach of section 6A(1)(d) of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations 
 
Act 1996, a matter of counsel’s professional duty: see R v Rochford [2011] 1 Cr 
 
App R 11. 

 

v)  The Crown had to respond to the legal submissions with less than 24 hours notice. 
Ordinarily such a matter would be considered at length and the disclosure process 
would  be  fully  reviewed.  Entrapment  is  not  a  defence,  but  in  the  context  of  an 
application to stay the Crown would have to consider what evidence, inadmissible 
before  the  jury,  might  be  required  to  address  the  applications.  The  timing  was 
particularly  unsatisfactory  because  the  judge  had  already  made  clear  during  the 
cross-examination of the undercover officers that they had behaved lawfully and 
no submission to the contrary had been made. The court had received the evidence 
 
without  objection,  and  without  being  informed  properly  about  the  real  issues 
relating to it now about to arise. On an abuse application the Crown may choose to 
call different evidence from that which is relevant to the issue which the jury have 
 
to decide once the evidence is admitted. It was inappropriate to make applications 
of this kind at this time because the Crown had limited itself to evidence probative 
 
of  guilt  rather  than  evidence  which  refuted  allegations  of  abuse  of  process  or 
 
unfairness.  The  Crown  had  been  deprived  of  the  opportunity  to  deal  with  the 
matter evidentially and that was unfair.    

These points, which were accepted in due course by the judge, are reiterated before us 
 
by Mr Bott, who says that the exchanges which took place between the judge and Mr 
 
McNulty  at  this  stage  marked  the  beginning  of  a  serious  deterioration  in  the 
relationship between them which characterised and dominated the rest of the trial.  

It  is  clear  from  those  exchanges  that  the  judge  was,  as  he  said,  gravely  concerned 
about the timing of the submission and about what now appeared to have been the 
purpose  of  Mr  McNulty’s  cross-examination  of  the  undercover  officers.  The  judge 
said: “It was in this mistaken belief that I restricted my interventions, which would 
have been continuous and indeed would have brought the whole process to a halt had 
I known what was afoot.” He ruled that entrapment was not a defence.

53.	 

At one point during these exchanges Mr McNulty said: “it was never my intention to 
address  the  jury  on  entrapment  without  permission.”  The  judge  warned  him  in 
unequivocal  terms  if  he  argued  entrapment  before  the  jury  it  would  treated  as  a 
contempt of court. 

 

54.	  Mr McNulty then submitted the indictment should be stayed on the grounds that the 
 
conduct of the officers was so improper as to bring the administration of justice into 
disrepute, saying that the grounds for making the submission have arisen only because 
of the course of cross-examination and the answers given by the officers. The judge 
did not accept that argument. He said:  

 

“J: Did that thought occur to you when you first read the papers in the case? 
 
LM: My Lord, no. No, it did not 
J: Did it occur to you at the committal proceedings? 

LM: My Lord, no. It did not. 

J: At the dismissal hearing?
 
 
LM: My Lord , no.. 

J: No 

LM:  My  Lord,  much  of  this  has  been,  much  of  this  is  evidence  related..  

 
 
“J:..there should have been an application in advance of the trial. 

LM: My Lord, the evidence to establish that emerged during the trial as a by product.. 

J: No, I am not having that at all….You have transcripts of every word the officer 
spoke to your client.. Nothing was conceded or admitted by them which was in any 
 
way improper.” 

 

 

 

55.	  Mr  McNulty  did  not  then  argue  before  the  judge,  as  he  did  a  few  days  later,  that 
Loosely was no longer good law and that entrapment could be run as a defence to the 
jury. 

Legal submissions: (ii) The submission of no case to answer/self defence 

 

Later  that  day,  after  a  submission  of  no  case  had  been  made  on  behalf  of  Harris 
Farooqi, Mr McNulty advanced a brief and separate argument.  This was that there 
was  no  case  for  Farooqi  to  answer  because  the  Crown  had  failed  to  negative  self 
defence.  This  argument,  advanced  on  the  basis  that    Farooqi  had  advocated  only 
“defensive jihad” – that is, that Muslims should only use violence for the purposes of 
 
self  defence, and the jury could not therefore conclude that he was encouraging Ray 
or Simon to act unlawfully or other than in necessary self defence, was not referred to 
 
in Farooqi’s defence case statement. Indeed it had not been mentioned at all (as Mr 
Edis was later to observe) until the evening of the 27th July 2011.

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
57.	 

 
58.	 

 

 
59.	 

On  1st  August  2011,  the  judge  gave  a  detailed  ruling,  in  which  he  dismissed  the 
applications made on behalf of Farooqi and Malik. (He also dismissed the submission 
of no case made on behalf of Harris Farooqi).  

The application made on behalf of Farooqi of no case to answer/self defence was dealt 
with  briefly.  In  respect  of  the  stay  applications,  the  judge  said  this  amongst  other 
things: 

“Both applications saw the light of day on 28th July 2011…Nothing whatsoever has 
occurred during the currency of this trial to trigger the applications …The matter is 
 
further aggravated in Munir Farooqi’s case by prolonged cross examination of both 
undercover  officers  in  which  unfairness  was  persistently  being  canvassed  in  the 
 
presence  of  the  jury  when  it  is  clear  from  the  authorities  that  the  only  remedy  for 
entrapment is an application for a stay for abuse of process or a section 78 application, 
both of which must be determined by judge alone…The Crown has been deprived of 
the opportunity to deal with the matter evidentially…there has been a flagrant breach 
of the Practice Direction…It is my responsibility to ensure a trial which is fair to the 
Crown  and  defence  and  I  have  no  hesitation  in  concluding  that  the  conduct  of  the 
defence  thus  far  has  precluded  that  obligation  as  far  as  the  Crown  entitlement  is 
concerned….much of the cross examination involved criticising indeed on occasions 
abusing the officers for doing exactly what Parliament permits…I have no hesitation 
in dismissing Munir Farooqi’s applications. They are a long way short of the mark...I 
 
will  not  permit  in  the  presence  of  the  jury  any  assertion  that  the  conduct  of  the 
undercover officers was unlawful…” 
 

After  the  judge  had  given  his  ruling,  Mr  McNulty  asked  whether  the  issue  of  self 
defence would be left to the jury. The judge said he was not minded to close out self 
defence altogether but would decide at the conclusion of the evidence whether there 
was any evidence of self defence. 

Farooqi’s failure to give evidence 

 

60.	  When the Crown had finished adducing evidence against Farooqi, the judge asked Mr 
McNulty if his client would be giving evidence.  The response was “My Lord I am as 
sure as I can be that he will not be giving evidence”, but he indicated that he would 
need “a little time” during the lunch break to speak to his client.  The records show 
 
that there was a very brief visit to Farooqi over the lunch break on that day in which 
counsel  were  accompanied  by  Mr  Sharif,  the  solicitor  who  had  been  in  daily 
attendance at the trial.  

 

 
61.	 

After that visit, the necessary formalities under section 35 of the Criminal Justice and 
Public Order Act 1994 were transacted in open court in the presence of the jury, and it
--------

was  confirmed  that  Farooqi  would  not  be  giving  evidence.   
further evidence was called on his behalf.  

 
Thereafter,  some  short 

Legal submission (iii):  The submission that entrapment is a defence 
 

 
62.	 

 
63.	 

On 3rd August 2011, Mr McNulty submitted a document to the court, which bore his 
 
name and that of Mr Zahir. 

It  was  entitled  “Note  on  the  Defence  of  Entrapment”.  It  asserted  that  “there  is  a 
defence  of  entrapment  available  at  English  law  and  the  jury  ought  to  be  directed 
 
accordingly.”  It continued 

 

“..insofar  as  Loosely  states  that  there  is  no  defence  of  entrapment,  it  no  longer 
 
represents good law since the case of Mushtaq (2005) UKHL 25.” 

 

64.	  Mr  Bott  describes  this  further  submission  as  “quite  untenable”  and  Mr  McNulty’s 
approach as wholly suspect. He says that an argument to the effect that, in spite of 
Loosely, entrapment could be regarded as a jury issue was so bold that a responsible 
advocate would have raised it at the beginning of the case, not after 14 days of cross-
examination.  

 

65.	  We  mention  at  this  stage  that  in  a  letter  sent  by  him  to  the  Bar  Standards  Board  in 
 
relation to disciplinary proceedings against him arising from his conduct during the trial 
 
(see paragraph 98 below), Mr McNulty has said this argument was suggested to him by 
Mr Zahir. Mr Zahir, who points out that in Mushtaq Mr McNulty appeared for the 
appellant,  says  that  this  was  not  the  case.  We  are  not  in  a  position  to  resolve  this 
conflict on the papers. However even if Mr Zahir had suggested the argument, it was 
 
Mr  McNulty  who  was  the  leading  counsel  acting  on  the  behalf  of  Farooqi,  and  he 
 
chose to advance it before the judge. 

 

The judge’s ruling on legal submission (iii) 
 

 
66.	 

The judge rejected the submission in emphatic terms.  In his ruling (given on the 11th 
August 2011) the judge said: 

 
“(Mr McNulty’s argument)..has thus far evaded the attention of the learned editors of 
Archbold, Blackstone and Smith & Hogan. It is to be noted in Mushtaq that neither 
 
the case of Loosely nor the defence of entrapment were mentioned…Lord Hoffman in 
Loosely  specifically  stated  that  the  exercise  of  the  power  to  stay  proceedings  was 
sufficient  to  satisfy  the  right  to  a  fair  trial  under  Article  6  of  the  Convention. 
Distinguished counsel had submitted that the principles on which the power to order a 
stay was exercised in England did not satisfy the Convention. This argument failed…I 
can  only  assume  that  this  very  belated  submission  has  been  made,  with  a  view  to 
raising the point elsewhere, or to justify the quite exceptional conduct of the defence
--------

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
case in allowing the jury to hear all the evidence before submitting that it could be 
excluded, and/or that the proceedings be stayed.. Had there been any merit in either 
contention, two and half months of court time would have been needlessly wasted. 
This  was  a  submission  that  could  have  been  made  on  the  papers  pre-trial  as  every 
relevant word in Munir Farooqi’s case was recorded.”  
 

 Legal submission (iv):  Self defence and combatant immunity  

 
67.	 

 
68.	 

On 11th August 2011 there was further discussion of issues of law, before speeches 
 
and summing up.  During the course of these discussions, the Crown suggested that 
they might comment on Mr McNulty’s failure to mention self defence in his defence 
statement, which they did not know was going to run “until 21.43 on the 27th of July” 
  

Later that day, the Court gave further consideration to the issue of self defence. The 
 
Crown had proposed a direction to the effect that Farooqi was entitled to be acquitted 
if  the  jury  concluded  that  he  had  encouraged  the  use  of  force  “exclusively”  for 
defensive  purposes.  Mr  McNulty  objected  to  the  use  of  the  word  exclusively.  It 
appears  from  his  submissions  that  he  considered  it  to  be  a  complete  answer  to  the 
indictment to say that any force Farooqi may have encouraged the undercover officers 
 
to use was intended to oust an unjust invader (the Americans/allies) and was therefore 
no more than the use of force in lawful self defence.  

The judge’s ruling on legal submission (iv) 
 

 
69.	 

On Friday 12th August 2011, the judge gave a further ruling.  He said: 

“ I have deemed it necessary to make a permanent record of the unsatisfactory state of 
affairs that now prevails in this trial in relation to the defence of Munir Farooqi, and 
his  case  alone.  There  is  no  mention  of  any  defence  of  self-defence  in  the  defence 
statement. In a skeleton argument in support of a submission of no case to answer, 
undated but submitted prior to 25th of July, there was no mention of the defence. In an 
amended  skeleton  submitted  on  the  27th  of  July  2011,  for  the  first  time  Counsel 
indicated that he intended to rely upon the defence. Neither the court nor the Crown 
had any earlier intimation.” 
 

 
70.	 

He went on to say: 

 
“I  repudiate  in  advance  any  assertion  that  failure  to  give  evidence  was  in  reliance 
 
upon my indication that I would leave self defence to the jury. It was obvious to me 
that  a  decision  not  to  give  evidence  had  been  taken  some  time  in  advance  and 
irrespective of any indication by me as to what defences I would leave. The Crown 
are now about to address the jury. There can be no doubt that as they now contend 
 
they  have  been  ambushed…  For  the  second  time  in  this  trial,  the  Crown  and 
 
accordingly the Court have been ambushed.  As  presently  informed  I  am  minded  to 
direct  the  jury  that  in  limited  circumstances,  self  defence  may  arise.  I  have  the 
advantage  of  very  recent  overnight  researches  into  the  law  [by  Mr  Edis].  The
--------

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

complexity of the law in this field is instantly to be observed from the speech of Lord 
Bingham of Cornhill in Jones and Others…It is to be noted that over 130 cases were 
cited in argument in that case. I am confronted by a fait accompli, a situation which 
must never be repeated.  I have given urgent thought as to whether it is necessary to 
discharge this jury so the Crown could call evidence which they would have wished to 
call as to the state of affairs as it prevailed in Pakistan at the time. That is simply not 
possible. There is no application to discharge the jury. I do not propose to do so. I am 
confident Crown Counsel can overcome the predicament in which he has been placed. 
It is, however, to be noticed that overnight, when he would wish to have been refining 
his address to the jury, he was necessarily researching the law on treason and self-
defence. I am minded that the safest available course is to leave self-defence…” 

 

Thereafter  Mr  Edis  addressed  the  jury.  On  15th  August  2011,  before  Mr  Edis 
concluded his address, Mr McNulty complained that its effect was to invite him to say 
how he would argue self defence to the jury. The judge then invited him to say how 
and on what basis he intended to submit to the jury that self defence could run, so 
Crown counsel could have an opportunity to deal with the submission. Mr McNulty 
said he expected the judge to explain to the jury the circumstances in which Farooqi 
 
would be acting lawfully. He said: “Nothing is what I propose to say about the law on 
self defence… If I do not appear to be co-operative it is because it appears to me that 
 
what is being done here is an improper attempt to have sight of the closing speech…”   

 

 
71.	 

Mr McNulty’s  closing speech 

 

 

 

72.	  Mr McNulty made his closing speech to the jury over the course of three days, the 
 
16th, 18th and 19th August 2011.  Mr Bott describes it as a defiant and provocative 
speech  which  went  well  beyond  anything  that  was  professionally  acceptable.  A 
number of specific matters illustrate the submission.  

 

 
73.	 

The speech began with what is described as a “thinly veiled” suggestion that the judge 
 
was  biased  in  which  Mr  McNulty  encouraged  the  jury  to  regard  the  judge  as  a 
salesman of worthless goods: 

“After all when you meet with a salesman , he does not start off his sales patter by 
insulting you but…that does not mean what he is selling you is worth anything.” 
 

Secondly, from the outset Mr McNulty attacked the motives of the Crown and others 
concerned  with  the  case  and  encouraged  the  view  that  the  Crown  was  a  politically 
 
motivated  witch  hunt.  The  judge  and  the  Crown  were  depicted  as  the  agents  of  a 
repressive state: the purpose of the Crown was to stifle Farooqi’s right to free speech. 
 
Other parties who did not agree with his approach, and their counsel were accused of 
sucking up to the Crown and the court.

Thirdly,  Mr  McNulty  misrepresented  the  evidence  on  a  number  of  occasions.  He 
repeatedly gave evidence himself on behalf of Farooqi, which was later summarised 
by the trial judge, and to which we refer later in this judgment. He made significant 
allegations that should have been but were not put to witnesses in cross-examination, 
in particular that the evidence against Malik had been contrived because the police 
 
had no evidence that Farooqi had influenced anyone except the undercover officers. 
This led to a number of interventions from the judge on the first afternoon, (at the end 
of which Mr Edis raised the propriety of Mr McNulty’s suggestion of judicial bias) 
 
and then again on 18th August when the judge said; “You are giving evidence that 
could have been given by your client and it must stop”. “This cannot continue.” 

 

76.	  Mr  McNulty  said  he  was  addressing  the  issue  of  Farooqi’s  intention,  to  which  the 

judge said: “The way he tells us what his intention is by going into the witness box.” 

 
77.	 

At  the  end  of  Mr  McNulty’s  speech,  Crown  counsel  gave  notice  that  they  were 
considering making an application to discharge the jury. The judge responded that he 
was not surprised, and that he had been considering the possibility of doing so of his 
 
own motion. The court then adjourned whilst the Crown considered its position.  

Whether the jury should be discharged 

 
78.	 

On 22nd August 2011, the judge heard submissions about whether, in the light of Mr 
 
McNulty’s closing speech, it was now possible for the case to continue or whether the 
jury  should  be  discharged  and  a  retrial  ordered.    The  question  was  whether  the 
problems which already existed, aggravated by Mr McNulty’s closing speech, were so 
acute that the continuation of the trial would no longer be viable; and which he also 
said, highlighting the point for the consideration of the co-defendants,  “in setting out 
these problems in clear terms it is hoped that MF [Farooqi] and other defendants will 
themselves  understand  fully  the  present  situation  and  give  informed  instructions  to 
their counsel as to how they wish to proceed. This particularly affects MF since the 
trial process can only proceed on the basis that he has given informed instructions for 
 
all  that  has  been  done  in  his  name,  and  that  he  decided  not  to  give  evidence  after 
 
receiving proper advice.  The Crown has no confidence in any assertion made as these 
matters  made  by  LM,  but  takes  comfort  from  the  fact  that  MF  is  represented  by 
competent and experienced junior counsel and solicitors who continue to act.”   

 
79.	 

The judge had earlier observed in the course of exchanges with Mr Edis:  

“Now  what  can  I  do?  I  order  a  retrial,  a  retrial  to  start  in  front  of  another  Judge  at 
 
Woolwich next January.  What can I do to prevent exactly the same thing happening 
again?  They do not give us red cards…” 

The Crown did not apply to the judge for the discharge of the jury, provided the judge 
 
was  content  that  a  summing  up  could  be  delivered  that  was  fair  to  all  parties  and 
which  was  not  undermined  by  the  thinly  veiled  allegation  of  judicial  bias,  the  trial 
could continue.

81.	  Ms  McGowan  however  applied  to  discharge  the  jury  and  for  Newton’s  case  to  be 
severed.  She  adopted  Mr  Edis’s  criticisms  of  Mr  McNulty’s  speech.  She  said  in 
summary,  that  the  errors  in  the  speech  could  not  be  adequately    corrected  by  the 
summing  up  without  adversely  affecting  the  fairness  of  Newton’s  trial,  in 
circumstances where the allegation was one of joint enterprise, and if Farooqi were to 
be  convicted  the  chances  of  Newton  being  convicted  necessarily  would  be 
 
considerably greater. Mr Bott (who at that stage will be remembered was acting for 
Farooqi’s son), expressed serious concerns about the trial continuing. He referred to 
submissions by Mr McNulty in his closing speech which suggested that other defence 
counsel had, for their own reasons, associated themselves with a conspiracy by the 
Crown and the court. He referred to another passage from Mr McNulty’s speech as a 
travesty of the evidence, and a submission that no responsible counsel ought to have 
made.  He  said  the  risk  of  injustice  was  considerable,  but  he  had  no  instructions  to 
make  an  application  to  discharge.    On  behalf  of  Malik,  Mr  Wilcock  said  he  had 
discussed  the  position  with  Mr  Bennathan  and  he  did  not  make  an  application  to 
discharge. He said the court was entitled to take the view that it had a conscientious 
jury who would listen attentively to the firm directions the judge may feel it necessary 
to give. 

 
82.	 

The judge ruled that the trial would continue. He said : 

“At  the  conclusion  of  Mr.  McNulty's  closing  speech  last  week  on  behalf  of  Munir 
 
Farooqi, Crown Counsel indicated that they may wish to apply to discharge this jury, on 
the  grounds  that  Mr.  McNulty's  speech  contained  so  many  falsehoods  that  could  not 
 
adequately be corrected in a summing up, or if fully corrected, the summing up would 
appear  unbalanced.  They  have  since  taken  instructions  at  a  high  level,  and  they 
 
essentially remain neutral, appreciating that this must, whatever submission the Crown 
may make, this must remain a matter for me.” 
 

 
83.	 

He went on to say: 

“I am not at all surprised by any of the indications that have been made last week, nor the 
submission made today.  Indeed, for the greater part of the speech, lasting for some nine 
hours,  I  was  considering  whether  I  should  myself  take  the  responsibility  for  such  a 
course, extreme as it may be, indeed wholly exceptional and a course of last resort.” 

 

 

The  judge  described  Mr  McNulty’s  submissions  as  “hopeless”.  He  had  no 
understanding of the law, the rules of procedure or his own professional obligations, 
and that he had defied the court’s order not to canvass entrapment before the jury: 

“I regret  to say that having  forbidden  Mr.  McNulty  from  canvassing  the  non-existent 
 
defence, in my judgment he did just that, referring to secret police, a conspiracy between 
two  undercover  officers  to  entrap  Israr  Malik  and  Munir  Farooqi,  and  an  element  of 
improper  conduct  which  was  never  previously  canvassed,  namely  that  senior  officers 
 
had been out to get Israr Malik, and that they needed to have a radicalised man and to 
 
make him a defendant.”

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
85.	 

The  judge  said  that  Mr  McNulty  had  given  evidence  for  Farooqi  on  at  least  four 
important subjects. He had tried to neutralise the summing up by describing the judge 
as  biased.  In  these  remarks  Mr  McNulty  was,  submits  Mr  Bott,  depicted  as  a 
thoroughly unscrupulous advocate prepared to use every trick and device to mislead 
the court. 

 
86.	 

In conclusion the judge said: 

“As Mr. Edis has so recently said, the court has been placed in a very difficult position.  I 
have  the  task  of  attempting  to  craft  a  summing  up  which  will  correct  these  several 
matters, and yet disadvantage no defendant, nor the Crown.  I propose to do my best to 
do  so.  Should  I  shirk  that  responsibility,  literally  millions  of  pounds  will  have  been 
expended to no good purpose.  If at the conclusion of my summing up I conclude that I 
 
have not been able to achieve what I set out so to do, then of course I will have no option 
 
other than to discharge the jury.  If I think I have succeeded and have in fact failed, then 
 
it may well be that the Court of Appeal can put matters right. 
 
No Judge should ever be put in this position, and I trust that it will never reoccur.  I 
propose to deal with the wider implications of what has transpired at the end of the 
case.” 
 

The summing up 
 

Unsurprisingly  in  light  of  the  unexpected  way  in  which  the  course  of  the  trial  had 
 
unfolded, the judge said that he would take a few days to craft, or in reality to re-craft, 
his  summing  up.    This  began  on  Tuesday  30th  August  2011.    It  concluded  on  the 
following  Monday  afternoon,  the  5th  September  2011,  when  the  jury  retired  to 
consider their verdicts.   

The  judge  began  his  summing  up  by  providing  the  jury  with  a  written  Route  to 
Verdict about which no complaint is made. It included the list of the topics which the 
 
summing  up  was  going  to  cover,  including  one  entitled  “corrections”.  Specific 
 
importance  was  focused  on  the  issue  of  intent  as  it  applied  to  each  count  and  the 
 
 
defence of each defendant to that count.  

 

Confining ourselves to the issues raised in the appeal, the judge directed the jury that 
 
he and they were together engaged in a process of trying each defendant fairly. He 
 
directed  them  that  the  facts  were  for  them  in  conventional  terms  and  tailored  his 
 
directions to the facts. He said amongst other things: “The major issue, the overriding 
issue,  is  whether  the  purpose  [of  the  Da'wah  stall]  was  solely  and  exclusively  to 
attract individuals to the faith of Islam, or whether there was, in addition, a criminal 
purpose, namely to attract individuals, vulnerable individuals, offer them friendship, 
radicalise them, and then recruit them to fight in Afghanistan or Pakistan, when the 
time was right and when the call came…Every defendant says “I have not committed 
any crime. I did not try to persuade anybody to fight in Pakistan or Afghanistan. I did 
not knowingly and intentionally disseminate terrorist publications, and I did not incite

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 

anybody  to  murder.”  He  focused  on  the  relevance  to  the  verdict  of  the  level  of 
 
intention required before the relevant defendant could be convicted. Each defendant 
denied  the  intention  attributed  to  them  by  the  prosecution.  When  dealing  with  self 
  
defence  the  judge  said:  “The  defence  is  simple.  No  recruitment  was  taking  place.” 
The judge said of counts three, six and seven: “The defence say here he was not at all 
inciting Ray in the first count and Simon in the second to commit murder. Nor indeed 
 
was he inciting him to go and fight abroad.”       

 
90.	 

After lunch the judge gave the “corrections” section of his summing up, in which he 
dealt with Mr McNulty’s closing speech. This part of the summing up lasted 1 hour 
and  10  minutes.  It  was  wholly  self-contained,  separated  both  by  time,  and  by  the 
judge’s remarks, from the legal directions which preceded it and the exposition of the 
evidence which then went on to occupy the remainder of the summing up.     

 
91.	 

The judge introduced the corrections section by saying: 

“I now come to part of my summing up which I would rather not have to deliver. I 
must correct a number of matters that Mr McNulty dealt with in his closing speech… 
 
In a criminal trial, I have a number of tasks. As you know, informing you as to the 
law is one of them, and that includes that you are not misled as to the law or the facts 
by  anyone.  A  further  task,  and  it  is  a  task  that  we  both  share,  the  ten  of  you  and 
myself, is that all four defendants and the Crown have a fair trial… 
There are a number of matters I must deal with. It is important that you have in mind 
that there is absolutely no evidence nor reason to believe or even suspect that Munir 
Farooqi himself was the author of anything said by Mr McNulty which I must correct, 
or  that  he  authorised  it,  and  you  must  certainly  not  use  any  of  these  matters  as 
evidence of any criminality on his part. At the same time, you must have regard and 
full  regard  to  what  I  tell  you  when  you  come  to  your  deliberations,  and  you  must 
 
allow me to correct the several errors that have occurred.” 

 
92.	 

The judge went on to deal with the matters in Mr McNulty’s closing speech which 
required correction. These included allegations of judicial bias, the giving of evidence 
in the closing speech, allegations made and not put to witnesses, the canvassing of the 
non-existent  defence  of  entrapment  by  reference  amongst  other  matters  to  secret 
police and conspiracies, and the allegedly improper motivation for the Crown.   

 
93.	 

In view of their importance to the appellants’ case, we set out some examples of the 
corrections made by the judge, using his language for this purpose:  

 

a)	  “The first matter I have to correct is the warning that Mr. McNulty issued as to the 
 
possibility of undue influence or judicial bias.  As to the latter, he said this: ""There 
is a tendency to assume that just because a Judge does not represent the Crown or 
 
the defence, that he is not biased in one way or the other ....  I am sure that is the 
position and I am sure that will be the position here, but, Members of the Jury, 
history  has  taught  us  that  that  is  not  always  the  case,  and  no  jury  should  ever 
assume it is so.

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 

b)	  Now if Mr. McNulty is sure that there will be no bias in this case, there can be no 
purpose in making this observation.  If he thinks I am biased, then he can apply to 
me to disqualify myself, and if I refuse and he had any evidence of bias, he could 
go to the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal could order a retrial between 
another Judge and another jury, but he has already told you that he is sure I will 
 
not be biased, and so why raise the issue?  He should not have done so…. 

  

 

 

 

c)  My role or the role of the judiciary in general, I know not which, was likened to 
that  of  a  salesman,  who  may  be  friendly,  ""But  that  does  not  mean"",  said  Mr. 
McNulty, 
selling 
it?"" 
Now that is a form of courtroom anarchy… 

is  worth  anything,  does 

""that  what  he 

is 

 

 

d)  Mr. McNulty in due course said that the only thing between Munir Farooqi and an 
improper  conviction  ""is  me  and  a  fair  minded  jury.""    Well,  this  could  be  said, 
taken literally, to be an invitation to you to find the defendant not guilty, because a 
 
conviction would be improper.  It plainly misleads you as to my role. One of my 
functions  is  to  protect  defendants  from  improper  verdicts,  an  important  judicial 
 
role.  It is also the Crown’s role to protect defendants from improper verdicts. A 
flawed verdict which will be set aside is no good to the Crown. We have a Court 
of  Appeal  to  protect  defendants  from  improper  verdicts,  and  beyond  that  a 
Criminal  Cases  Review  Commission.  Your  function  is  to  decide  the  case 
according to the evidence, and so please ignore any exhortation which misstates 
our respective roles… 

 

 

 

e)	  It was submitted in his speech to you by Mr. McNulty, that there was a conspiracy 
 
to  entrap  both  Israr  Malik  and  Munir  Farooqi,  and  it  was  contended  by  Mr. 
McNulty  that  by  reference  to  the  date  of  arrest,  that  Israr  Malik  has  been 
manufactured as a victim/perpetrator to shore up a false case.  They have put him 
in the dock alongside Munir Farooqi.  The operation was not complete until they 
put Israr Malik in the dock. 

 

 
f)	  Now  that  is  a  considerable  accusation  to  make,  and  one  which  if  it  was  to  be 
made, should have been put to Detective Chief Inspector Richardson, the senior 
investigating officer when he was in the witness box, so that he could deal with it. 
 
He  has  had  no  opportunity  of  dealing  with  what  is  a  very  grave  allegation… 
 
Counsel simply cannot wait until his closing speech to make such an allegation 
 
because the Crown have no way of answering it or dealing with it.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 

 
g)  What I can tell you is this: that there is simply no evidence of any such improper 
motive, and as I have told you, you must assume that this was a lawful operation. 
As I have told you, there is no defence of entrapment…the defence here is not that 
the defendant was entrapped. It is that he committed no criminal act…  

 

 

h)  Mr. McNulty went on to submit that this case was all about freedom of speech, the 
implication being that the Crown were motivated by malice and a desire to stop 
free speech.  If the defence had wished to assert that this operation was undertaken 
to  prevent  Islam  being  preached  or  advanced  from  Da’wah  stalls  in  the  city  of 
Manchester,  then  it  was  Counsel's  duty  to  give  the  officers  responsible  for  the 
Crown  an  opportunity  to  answer  the  allegation  when  Detective  Chief  Inspector 
Richardson was in the witness box…   

 

 

 
i)	  Mr. McNulty went on to assert that there was an unpleasant smell of racism about 
the Crown, and that the Crown had alleged that Munir Farooqi was motivated by 
racism.    The  only  possible  assertion  touching  upon  race  was  the  allegation  that 
white persons were being targeted as potential reverts, and thus potential recruits.   

 

 
j)	  I  regret  to  say  that  by  raising  judicial  bias,  undue  influence,  a  false  racist 
allegation, a desire to prevent freedom of speech, secret police and a conspiracy 
 
involving  senior  officers,  a  series  of  false  allegations  have  been  made  which 
should not have been made, and they are compounded by an exhortation made to 
 
you as to the way you reach a verdict…   

 

 

 

k)  It is legitimate in a closing speech for Counsel, even when his client has not given 
evidence,  to  make  submissions  about  what  inferences  may  be  drawn  from  the 
evidence as to his client's motives and intentions.  What is not legitimate is for 
Counsel to make positive assertions on his client's behalf which could have been 
made in the witness box.... 

 

 
l)	  The  next  matter  about  which  a  positive  assertion  was  made  by  Counsel  and  in 
respect of which no evidence was given by Munir Farooqi, namely counts six and 
seven, is where Mr McNulty made this positive assertion which was a repeated 
assertion, “We are now going to turn to the last two counts, which relate to the 
15th and 16th October. These conversations are very different, and as I have said to 
you  previously,  in  effect  they  are  part  of  a  single  ongoing  conversation  which 
begins on the 13th October, when Munir Farooqi is clearly talking about jihad and 
the end of the world…
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 

 

 

m) Now of course I sounded partial in that passage, because I had to correct what had 
taken place.  Had this assertion been made during the evidence, or had Mr. Munir 
Farooqi gone into the witness box and said ""I was talking about the end of the 
world on the 15th and 16th of October"", everything I have just said to you would, 
I have no doubt, been said to you by Mr. Edis.  I do not appreciate being put in 
this position of having to make all these corrections, because it makes me sound 
partial, but if these points are not made to you, then a jury paying less attention 
 
than you might say “Oh well, maybe he was talking about the end of the world.… 

 

 

n)  The  only  person  who  could  say  the  three  brothers  were  a  fiction  was  Munir 
Farooqi from the witness box saying he lied about them.  Again you may think 
this was an attempt to write out those three men from the script, and to cause you 
to question whether or not they existed, and when there is plain evidence that they 
 
did  exist,  uncontradicted  from  any  source,  you  are  entitled  to  assume  that  they 
did... 

 

 

o)  The  only  person  who  could  evidence  that  these  stories  were  designed  to  deter 
jihad rather than encourage jihad was Munir Farooqi because that was what was in 
his  mind,  if  it  was…Munir  Farooqi  would  have  been  asked  to  his  face  was  he 
encouraging or was he discouraging jihad. That is why these matters have to be 
raised by defendants and not by their Counsel, so they can be asked about them…  

 

 

p)  Towards  the  end  of  his  speech,  Mr.  McNulty  devoted  a  substantial  passage  to 
asserting that passages of [what] Munir Farooqi [said] were abstract and part were 
concrete.  Again, the only person who could say whether he was speaking in the 
abstract or the concrete was Munir Farooqi.  

 

 

q)  It is very simple.  You must decide his case on the evidence that you have heard. 
 
Nothing that Mr. McNulty said in his closing speech was evidence.  Whilst he can 
 
invite you to give the natural ordinary meaning to everything in the transcripts, 
Counsel cannot give an explanation which requires evidence to take you outside 
or beyond the ordinary natural meaning of the words in the transcripts.  Without 
any evidence from Munir Farooqi, you decide the case on the Crown evidence, 
together with the evidence of the witnesses that he has called.” 

 
94.	 

These  corrections  were  interspersed  with  a  number  of  passages  in  which  the  judge 
emphasised that the jury were the sole judges of fact and that his corrections should 
not impinge upon the case of any of the defendants:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 

a)  “In dealing with the law as I am doing now, you must accept what I say about our 
respective  functions  and  disregard  what  Mr.  McNulty  has  said.    The  position 
could not be simpler.  You must follow my legal directions absolutely and without 
qualification, but so far as the facts are concerned, you are the sole judges of fact. 
I am not here to decide the facts for you, nor am I here to influence you, merely to 
assist you so that you can judge the facts, but I am not here in a purely passive 
role.  The  law  is  this:  a  Judge  may  comment  on  the  facts,  and  may  do  so  in 
confident  terms.    A  Judge  has  experience  of  marshalling  facts  and  identifying 
issues, and it is therefore right that you should have a Judge's assistance on the 
facts and you will have mine, but the ultimate decision on the facts must be yours. 
If I express a view of the facts, only adopt it if it accords with your own... 

 

 

 

 

 

b)  Ensure, please, that the matters I have thus far dealt with do not impinge upon any 
one  of  the  defendants.  None  of  them  have  advanced  these  matters  before  you. 
Nor allow it to impinge upon the Crown.  They are entitled to a fair trial; not to 
have to counter matters such as this…. 

 

 

 

c)	  It  remains,  however,  your  task  to  decide  firstly  whether  terrorists  were  being 
recruited,  and  then  to  consider  the  case  of  each  defendant  separately,  deciding 
whether  he  knew  what  was  going  on,  if  you  decide  it  was,  and  whether  he 
participated  with  the  necessary  intent.    As  a  matter  of  law,  it  is  most  certainly 
open  to  you  to  conclude  that  one  or  more  persons  were  engaged  in  recruiting 
terrorists  and  one  or  more  were  not.    You  may  also  conclude  that  all  were 
involved or that none were.  That is because the facts are entirely for you… 

 

 

d)  Now  it  was  said  by  Mr.  McNulty  that  the  13th  October  involved  a  significant 
conversation about the end of the world.  Now because the facts are for you, you 
will want to consider whether indeed there was a significant conversation about 
the  end  of  the  world  or  whether  there  was  just  about  a  page  and  a  half  before 
 
many other matters were dealt with, and so tab 38 will need your very close and 
careful attention.  If you disagree with the way I present the facts to you, then you 
are perfectly entitled to do so, but you then have to go on and say whether or not 
there  is  a  basis  at  all  for  concluding  that  the  15th  and  16th  are  some  sort  of 
continuation.  You will wish to consider whether page five and pages 20 and 21 
can  be  considered  a  significant  conversation  about  the  end  of  the  world,  and 
 
whether at tab 39 on the 15th of October, and tab 40, the 16th of October, it can 
properly be said that those were a continuation of the 13th of October.” 

Coming to the end of the corrections section, the judge concluded:

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 

e)	  “Now  I  am  conscious  that  was  a  lengthy  session,  lasting  for  one  hour  and  ten 
minutes of corrections.  It is vital that you do not hold it against Munir Farooqi 
himself.    It  is  equally  vital  that  no  other  defendant  finds  himself  adversely 
damaged.  Nor indeed must the Crown by thoughts having been planted in your 
mind, that could only have been there had they come from the witness box, and 
most  important  too,  that  you  do  not  think  that  the  Judge  is  completely  biased 
because  of  what  I  have  had  to  deal  with.  I  do  hope  you  understand.  I  am  as 
 
committed as you are to seeing that the four defendants and the Crown receive a 
fair trial.  That is why I have had to correct all these several matters. Tomorrow 
we are going to move on to the case against Munir Farooqi, and so far as these 
matters are concerned, it is just a question of putting away and outside as really 
 
not  having  existed,  because  these  were  matters  that  should  not  have  been 
 
canvassed before you.  I hope you do understand.” 

 

 
95.	 

In the remainder of his summing up, lasting for a further four days, the judge gave 
 
 
what  Mr  Edis  describes  as  a  meticulous  and  comprehensive  exposition  of  the 
evidence.  Further  he  set  out  in  detail,  separately  for  each  defendant,  the  respective 
Crown and defence cases, which included the evidence given by Newton and Malik. 
 
The judge had invited each counsel to prepare a summary in “nutshell” form of the 
 
case for each defendant, and in relation to Newton and Malik, the summing up then 
included a “nutshell” of the case for the defendant closely based on these summaries. 
The judge concluded with these words: 

“And that concludes my review of what is said against each defendant and what is said 
 
by way of response, and I remind you that you are the sole judges of fact.  I trust my 
 
summing up has been of assistance.  You must accept that what I told you about the law 
is  correct,  and  where  I  am  in  conflict  with  Mr.  McNulty,  my  legal  directions  must 
 
prevail.  You must not assume that Mr. McNulty spoke as he did at the behest of or with 
the approval of Munir Farooqi.  Defence Counsel may not and need not tell their lay 
clients what they propose to say.  You must decide his case on the…evidence, …The 
several corrections I have made must not adversely affect the fairness of this trial, either 
 
in relation to the trial of any defendant, nor the Crown.” 
 

 

 

 

96.	  We must return to an earlier stage in the summing up when, during the “corrections” 
section the judge gave the jury a “Watson direction”, quoting Lord Lane CJ’s exact 
words. This is a source of complaint by Mr Bennathan. The passage occurred during 
the course of the summing up directed to the judge’s expression of regret at reference 
to judicial bias, undue influence, a false racist allegation, a desire to prevent freedom 
of  speech,  secret  police  and  a  conspiracy  involving  senior  officers,  when  the  judge 
added: 

 

“I regret to say that, by reference to these matters (Mr McNulty telling you that the 
jury system is not about compromise, resisting any temptation to make compromises 
and not going with the flow or with who shouts the loudest, but there was no mention 
of your collective responsibility in the concept of give and take) you may think that 
 
what you were told was a blueprint for a disagreement, and what I tell you now is a

direction formulated by a former Lord Chief Justice.  It is the law, and Mr McNulty’s 
exhortation is not, and I quote the former Lord Chief Justice in terms.”  

The judge then said: 

“Each of you has taken an oath to return a true verdict according to the evidence. No 
one  must  be  forced  to  that  oath  but  you  have  a  duty  not  only  as  individuals  but 
collectively.  That is the strength of the jury system.  Each of you takes into the jury 
box  with  you  your  individual  experience  and  wisdom.    Your  task  is  to  pool  that 
experience and wisdom. You do that by giving your views and listening to the views 
of  the  others.  There  must  necessarily  be  discussion,  argument  and  give  and  take 
within  the  scope  of  your  oath.  That  is  the  way  in  which  agreement  is  reached.    If 
 
unhappily you cannot reach agreement you must say so.”  

On  8th  September  2011  the  jury  returned  unanimous  guilty  verdicts  on  all  counts 
against Farooqi and Newton and returned their verdict of not guilty on the one count 
 
faced  by  Harris  Farooqi.  The  following  morning,  the  9th  September  2011,  after 
retiring for an hour, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty against Malik on 
Count 8. The judge then gave the jury the majority direction, and one hour later the 
jury returned unanimous verdicts of guilty against Malik on the remaining counts he 
faced, that is Counts 9 and 10. The judge passed sentence on the appellants later that 
same day.      

By way of footnote we should add that, following the trial, the Attorney General to 
whom the matter had been referred by the judge (after initial complaints to the Bar 
Standards Board by the Crown Prosecution Service) concluded there was sufficient 
evidence  to  bring  proceedings  for  contempt  against  Mr  McNulty  in  relation  to  his 
conduct at the trial, but that the public interest was best served by the Bar Standards 
Board formally investigating the allegations of professional misconduct against him. 
 
On  31st  January  2012,  the  Attorney  General  made  a  formal  complaint  to  the  Bar 
Standards Board of professional misconduct against Mr McNulty. We understand this 
complaint awaits resolution.   

 
97.	 

 
98.	 

99.	  We are now in a position to address the grounds of appeal. 

 

The fairness of the trial 

 
100.	 

In this jurisdiction it is axiomatic that every defendant has an absolute entitlement to 
 
a fair trial. 

 

101.	  We  must  begin  by  emphasising  that  the  conduct  of  the  trial  by  the  judge  was 
impeccable.  He  remained  patient  under  considerable  provocation,  and  in  the  public 
 
interest  he  sought  to  salvage  an  important  lengthy  trial  from  shipwreck.  In  his 
directions  to  the  jury,  in  fairness  both  to  the  prosecution  and  to  ensure  that  justice
--------

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
would be done according to the law the danger that the jury would be misled had to be 
 
avoided. We cannot detect any basis for criticising the judge for lack of fairness or 
balance  in  his  approach  to  his  responsibilities.  The  essential  criticism  is  that 
notwithstanding  the  fairness  with  which  the  judge  sought  to  discharge  them,  the 
misconduct  of  counsel  and  his  deliberate  and  repeated  challenges  to  the  judge’s 
authority could not be addressed and dealt with without compromising the fairness of 
the trial. The only answer to the problem created by Mr McNulty was the discharge of 
 
the jury, and the only answer to the resulting unfairness of the continuing of the trial 
 
is to quash the convictions. 

 

 

102.	  We are not here contemplating with the wisdom of hindsight the possible alternative 
 
ways  in  which,  following  conviction,  the  defence  might  have  been  differently 
conducted. A variety of different formulations can be found in the authorities, and the 
catalogue  of  discouraging  adjectives  which  may  apply  in  the  formulation  of  any 
relevant test for such cases is probably not yet closed. For present purposes we have 
 
asked  the  question  in  relation  to  each  defendant  whether  the  misconduct  and  the 
alleged  incompetence  of  Mr  McNulty  could  sensibly  be  addressed  by  judicial 
directions in the summing up, and if they could, were they in fact addressed in such a 
 
way that the integrity of the trial process was maintained.   

 

103.	  When issues like this arise, the starting point however, and this requires emphasis, is 
that  the  overwhelming  likelihood  is  that  the  appropriate  response  is  for  the  trial  to 
continue  to  its  conclusion.  The  derailment  of  a  trial,  whether  on  the  basis  of 
deliberate  or  inadvertent  misconduct  by  counsel,  must  remain  the  exception.    The 
 
judge  is  vested  not  only  with  authority  over  the  conduct  of  the  trial,  but  with  the 
means,  through  careful  and  unequivocal  directions  to  ensure  that  the  jury,  with  its 
own  interest  in  the  fairness  of  the  trial process,  understands  the  criticisms  properly 
made by the judge for which counsel is responsible, and does not, unless directed to 
do so, visit them on either his client, or any of the remaining defendants.  

 
104.	 

It is a matter of regret that there are ample grounds for criticising the conduct of Mr 
McNulty at the trial. These have been fully addressed by Mr Bott at the hearing of the 
appeal,  and,  as  we  have  narrated,  he,  in  accordance  with  the  rules  which  require 
 
counsel  to  act  fearlessly  on  behalf  of  his  client,  has  not  minced  the  language  of 
criticism. 
  

 

105.	  We must therefore return to the basic question. The starting point is that the record of 
 
what Farooqi said in conversations with the undercover police officers was not and 
could not be disputed. The jury knew exactly what was said to and by him.  What he 
said formed the basis for a very powerful case that he was guilty of the offences with 
which  he  was  charged.  He  defence  was  that  whatever  he  may  have  said,  the 
 
necessary intention to prove guilt was absent. 

 

106.	  The difficulty which faced Farooqi’s legal advisors is obvious. Although some fairly 
peripheral points of possible relevance to intent could be made on the basis of isolated 
passages  from  the  recorded  conversations,  the  defence  was  fixed  with  what  was
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
revealed  by  the  conversations  as  a  whole.    It  appears  to  us  that  faced  with  this 
problem, and without any justified basis for doing so, Mr McNulty embarked on the 
forensic  strategy  of  an  all-out  attack  on  every  aspect  of  the  prosecution  case, 
 
sometimes at a very late stage in the process, in circumstances which can be described 
as “ambush” and of confrontation with and disobedience to the judge. The objective 
of this strategy would have been to seek to distract the attention of the jury from the 
simple  question  which  they  were  required  to  address:  what  conclusions  should 
properly  be  drawn  from  the  incontrovertible  evidence  of  these  conversations?  The 
 
only person who could give evidence about his intentions was Farooqi himself, but if 
he  did  so  and  disclaimed  the  apparent  intention  revealed  by  the  conversations,  the 
potential for devastating cross-examination was obvious. 

 

107.	  The  question  was  raised  whether  Mr  McNulty  discussed  his  proposed  forensic 
strategy with his client.  However, whether he did or not, and even assuming that his 
client agreed or encouraged it, the client’s “instructions” were irrelevant. The client 
does not conduct the case: that is the responsibility of the trial advocate. The client’s 
 
instructions which bind the advocate and which form the basis for the defence case at 
trial, are his account of the relevant facts: in short, the instructions are what the client 
says happened and what he asserts the truth to be. These bind the advocate: he does 
not  invent  or  suggest  a  different  account  of  the  facts  which  may  provide  the  client 
with a better defence. 

 

108.	  Something of a myth about the meaning of the client’s “instructions” has developed. 
As we have said, the client does not conduct the case. The advocate is not the client’s 
mouthpiece, obliged to conduct the case in accordance with whatever the client, or 
 
when the advocate is a barrister, the solicitor “instructs” him. In short, the advocate is 
bound to advance the defendant’s case on the basis that what his client tells him is the 
 
truth, but save for well-established principles, like the personal responsibility of the 
defendant  to  enter  his  own  plea,  and  to  make  his  own  decision  whether  to  give 
evidence,  and  perhaps  whether  a  witness  who  appears  to  be  able  to  give  relevant 
admissible evidence favourable to the defendant should or should not be called, the 
advocate, and the advocate alone remains responsible for the forensic decisions and 
strategy.  That  is  the  foundation  for  the  right  to  appear  as  an  advocate,  with  the 
privileges and responsibilities of advocates and as an advocate, burdened with twin 
responsibilities, both to the client and to the court. 

In  the  trial  process  the  advocate  is  subject  to  some  elementary  rules.  They  apply 
whether the advocate in question is a barrister or solicitor, and to the extent that the 
rules of professional conduct of either profession are not consistent, they should be 
 
made  so.  In  the  forensic  process  the  decision  and  judgment  of  this  court  bind  the 
professions, and if there is a difference, the rules must conform with the decisions of 
the  court.  By  way  of  emphasis,  in  the  course  of  any  trial,  like  everyone  else,  the 
advocate  is  ultimately  bound  to  abide  by  the  rulings  of  the  court.  If  a  remedy  is 
needed,  the  rulings  are  open  to  criticism  in  this  court,  and  if  they  are  wrong,  their 
impact on the trial and the safety of any conviction can be fully examined. Although 
the  judge  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  conduct  of  the  proceedings,  the  judge 
personally,  and  the  administration  of  justice  as  a  whole,  are  advantaged  by  the 
presence,  assistance  and  professionalism  of  high  quality  advocates  on  both  sides. 

 
109.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
Neither the judge nor the administration of justice is advantaged if the advocates are 
pusillanimous. Professional integrity, if nothing else, sometimes requires submissions 
to be made to the judge that he is mistaken, or even, as sometimes occurs, that he is 
departing from contemporary standards of fairness. When difficult submissions of this 
kind have to be made, the advocate is simultaneously performing his responsibilities 
to  his  client  and  to  the  administration  of  justice.  The  judge,  too,  must  respect  the 
reality that a very wide discretion is vested in the judgment of the advocate about how 
best to conduct the trial, recognising that different advocates will conduct their cases 
in different ways, and that the advocate will be party to confidential instructions from 
his  client  from  which  the  judge  must  be  excluded. 
In  general  terms,  the 
administration  of  criminal  justice  is  best  served  when  the  relationship  between  the 
judge and the advocates on all sides is marked by mutual respect, each of them fully 
attuned to their respective responsibilities. This indeed is at the heart of our forensic 
processes. 

110.	  For the purposes of these appeals we shall highlight some of the further rules which 

 

appear to have been significantly infringed. 

 

111.	  The advocate cannot give evidence or, in the guise of a submission to the jury, make 
assertions about facts which had not been adduced in evidence.  That is inconsistent 
with  the  proper  function  of  an  advocate.  The  importance  of  the  rule  is  particularly 
 
stark whenever the defendant elects not to give evidence in his own defence. Farooqi 
failed  to  do  so,  and  we  shall  shortly  address  the  complaint  against  Mr  McNulty’s 
competence  arising  from  this  decision.  Whatever  the  circumstances,  the  advocate 
cannot supply the evidence that the defendant has chosen to withhold from the jury. 
Self-evidently  his  function  is  entirely  distinct  from  that  of  a  witness.  When  the 
advocate confines himself to commenting on or inviting the jury to draw inferences 
from aspects of the evidence which has been given, this principle is not infringed. But 
as we have demonstrated in the narrative of the facts, Mr McNulty went much further.  

 

 

112.	  Mr McNulty’s critical comments about prosecution witnesses were advanced without 
 
the witness (or the prosecution) having been given a fair opportunity to address and 
answer the criticism. The fairness principle operates both ways. The defendant must 
have  a  fair  trial.  It  is  however  equally  unfair  to  an  individual  witness  to  postpone 
criticism  of  his  conduct  until  closing  submissions  are  made  to  the  jury,  not  least 
because if given the opportunity, the witness whose behaviour is impugned may have 
a complete or partial answer to the criticism. All this is elementary.  

 

113.	  We do not suggest that the principle of fairness to the witness requires the somewhat 
 
dated formulaic use of the word “put” as integral to the process. Assuming that there 
is material to justify the allegation, “Were you driving at 120 mph?”  is more effective 
than, “I put it you, that you were driving at 120 mph?”  What ought to be avoided is 
the increasing modern habit of assertion, (often in tendentious terms or incorporating 
comment), which is not true cross-examination. This is unfair to the witness and blurs 
the line from a jury’s perspective between evidence from the witness and inadmissible 
comment from the advocate. We withhold criticism of Mr McNulty on this particular 
aspect  of  his  cross-examination  because  he  was  following  a  developing  habit  of
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
practice which even the most experienced judges are beginning to tolerate, perhaps 
 
because to interfere might create difficulties for the advocate who has been nurtured 
 
in this way of cross-examination. Nevertheless we deprecate the increasing habit of 
comment or assertion whether in examination in chief, but more particularly in cross-
examination. The place for comment or assertion, provided a proper foundation has 
been laid or fairly arises from the evidence, is during closing submissions to the jury.  

 

114.	  One  further  aspect  of  the  principle  that  the  trial  process  is  not  a  game  is  that  the 
advocate must abide and ensure that his professional and lay clients understand that 
 
he  must  abide  by  procedural  requirements  and  practice  directions  and  court  orders. 
The objective is to reduce delay and inefficiency and enhance the prospect that justice 
will be done. Ambush defence or arguments are prohibited. 

In  his  closing  submissions  to  the  jury  Mr  McNulty  made  a  personal  attack  on  the 
judge,  and  the  prosecution,  and  indeed  some  of  his  colleagues  acting  for  other 
defendants  which  was  quite  astonishing,  and  far  beyond  the  experience  of  any 
member of this court. The comparison drawn between the judge and a dishonest seller 
of worthless goods was intolerable. The suggestion that some of the counsel for the 
co-defendants whose approach to the trial was different to his own should be regarded 
as “sucking-up” to the judge was reprehensible. It is quite clear from a study of the 
 
transcripts  available  to  us  that  each  of  the  other  counsel  was  acting  within  and  in 
 
accordance with the rules of professional conduct which govern the exercise by each 
advocate of his or her professional responsibilities.  For completeness, we simply add 
that  the  attack  on  the  prosecution  was  equally  unjustified.  This  was  not  fearless 
advocacy, with the advocate necessarily standing firm in the interests of his client in 
the best traditions of the Bar. Advocacy of the kind employed by Mr McNulty would 
rapidly destroy a system for the administration of justice which depends on a sensible, 
as  we  have  emphasised,  respectful  working  relationship  between  the  judge  and 
independent  minded  advocates  responsibly  fulfilling  their  complex  professional 
 
obligations. It is difficult to avoid reflecting that this  behaviour, particularly during 
the later stages of the trial, had as its ultimate purpose the derailment of the trial by 
the  creation  of  pressure  on  the  judge  to  discharge  the  jury  before  they  retired  to 
consider their verdicts or to procure favourable verdicts by illegitimate means. 

It  gives  us  no  satisfaction  to  provide  this  brief  indication  of  the  areas  of  serious 
concern  about  the  professional  conduct  of Mr  McNulty.  We  therefore  return  to  the 
 
question:  how  was  the  judge  to  address  the  consequent  problems?  As  the  judge 
 
recognised it was open to him to discharge the jury and order a new trial, a decision 
involving huge inconvenience to everyone else involved in the case, and substantial 
public expense, and in which it is worth noting, as the judge did, it would have been 
open to Farooqi to require that Mr McNulty should continue to act for him.  It was 
also open to the judge to discharge the jury from giving verdicts on one or more of the 
defendants, but in practical terms, quite apart from wasted time and expenditure, these 
allegations,  and  the  evidence  to  sustain  them  postulated  a  joint  trial  of  all  the 
defendants.  The  better  alternative,  notwithstanding  the  problems  created  by  Mr 
 
McNulty was to continue the trial. Provided the judge was satisfied that the issues and 
evidence could be summed up to the jury in a way which would correct the errors for 
which Mr McNulty was responsible, while simultaneously ensuring that the trial of 

 
115.	 

 
116.
--------

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

the defendants would not be prejudiced, the trial could sensibly continue to its normal 
conclusion. That is what the judge decided, leaving open the further safeguard that if, 
at the end of his newly refashioned summing up he was not satisfied of the wisdom of 
 
his decision to continue the trial, it remained open to him to discharge the jury.  

 

117.	  This judgment was made towards the very end of a length trial by one of our most 
 
respected judges, an acknowledged master of the criminal justice process. Far from 
criticising it, we have no doubt that his judgment was right. Even if (deliberately or 
otherwise) the trial had been exposed to the risk of derailment, its integrity was far 
from  irremediably  tarnished.  As  a  matter  of  what  is  sometimes  described  as  his 
 
discretion, but in reality is his judgment, the judge was entitled to conclude that the 
remedy for what had gone wrong could be provided by the summing up.  

 

118.	  We have, of course, closely studied the summing up. As we indicated earlier, after 
providing the written Route to Verdict, the judge directed the jury accurately about 
the relevant legal principles and explained with utmost clarity the basis of defence of 
each defendant to each count he faced. The jury can have been in no doubt about the 
nature  of  the  defence  and  the  requirement,  that  before  any  convictions  could  be 
returned, the Crown should satisfy the jury so that they were sure that the necessary 
intent  was  proved.  There  then  came  a  natural  break.  After  lunch  he  addressed  the 
necessary  corrections.  He  expressly  exonerated  Farooqi  from  his  criticisms  of  the 
 
conduct of his counsel, and repeated that neither the criticisms nor the need for them 
 
had  any  bearing  on  the  trial  of  any  of  the  other  defendants,  and  that  they  were 
 
irrelevant to the verdicts in each of their individual cases. The “corrections” section of 
the summing up was detailed, but proportionate to the length of the summing up as a 
whole and the level of corrections required. It was also carefully ring-fenced. It was 
limited  in  its  ambit  and  scope  to  the  issues  improperly  created  by  Mr  McNulty’s 
conduct.  The  judge  directed  the  jury  about  legal  principles  in  accordance  with  his 
duty.  He  made  clear  that  his  observations  had  no  bearing  on  the  factual  decisions 
 
which were for the jury. Having concluded the “corrections” section of his judgment, 
 
he turned to the factual issues which were then addressed in meticulous detail over the 
next four days without the risk of distortion of the essential issues.  

 
119.	 

In our judgment the issues were fully and fairly explained to the jury and left for their 
decision, and the necessary process of correction was handled so as to ensure that the 
normal processes by which the jury addressed the evidence and reached their eventual 
conclusion were not undermined. Notwithstanding many unfortunate features of this 
trial  the  convictions  of  three  of  the  defendants,  and  the  acquittal  of  the  fourth 
defendant, followed a fair trial. 

 

120.	  This is a convenient point at which to address Mr Bennathan’s submission that the 
 
summing  up  was  flawed.  He  suggests  that  the  effect  of  the  corrections,  even  if 
appropriate,  was  to  “swamp”  his  client’s  defence  and,  although  again,  the  judge 
rightly  addressed  the  “entrapment”  defence,  the  impact  so  far  as  his  client  was 
concerned was to bolster the credibility of the police and to undermine the relevance 
to the contention that his client had never “initiated” any conversations about violent 
 
“jihad”. We have studied Mr Bennathan’s very detailed written submissions advanced
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

in  support  of  these  proposed  grounds  of  appeal,  together  with  the  equally  detailed 
response  from  the  Crown.  Reading  the  summing  up  as  a  whole  Mr  Bennathan’s 
contentions are unsustained. We would have refused leave to appeal on this ground. 
On detailed analysis, although it may be that different parts of the summing of the 
 
facts  could  have  been  expressed  more  attractively  from  Mr  Bennathan’s  point  of 
view, in our judgment Malik’s case was fairly put before the jury. Similarly, on the 
 
basis that Mr Bennathan submits that Farooqi’s defence was not properly left to the 
jury and this had a consequent damaging effect on his client’s position, because the 
two  cases  were  inextricably  mixed  up,  we  are  satisfied  that  Farooqi’s  defence, 
notwithstanding  the  misconduct  of  his  leading  counsel,  was  fairly  before,  but 
unsurprisingly rejected by the jury. 

Farooqi’s Failure to Give Evidence 

 

121.	  We turn to Mr Bott’s submission that the appellant’s convictions are unsafe on the 
basis that the failure of the appellant to give evidence was itself consequent on Mr 
 
McNulty’s incompetence. 

 
122.	 

In essence he submits that Mr McNulty had his own individual views about the way 
the  case  should  be  conducted,  and  that  he  did  not  enable  his  client  to  make  an 
informed  decision  about  whether  or  not  to  give  evidence.  We  have  been  shown  a 
 
schedule of visits by Farooqi’s legal advisers to him whilst in custody. It cannot be 
said that his legal team visited him with any great regularity during the trial.  

 

123.	  Farooqi  signed  a  document  on  1st  August  2011,  witnessed  by  Mr  Sharif  and  Mr 
McNulty.  It  recorded  the  fact  that  his  counsel  did  not  think  that  it  was  in  his  best 
interests  to  give  evidence.  It  acknowledged  that  the  judge  might  give  an  adverse 
inference  direction  to  the  jury,  and  that  by  not  giving  evidence,  there  was  no 
guarantee of being found not guilty or avoiding a prison sentence if convicted. The 
document concludes: 

“Finally I understand that the decision whether I give evidence 
 
or not is entirely mine and should I wish to reject my counsel’s 
advice, Mr McNulty is happy to call me and to permit me to 
 
give evidence on my own behalf. Having considered all of the 
above I have decided of my own free will that I did not wish to 
give evidence.” 

 

124.	  Mr Bott submits that given the nature of the case against Farooqi, he should have been 
told that he needed to go into the witness box. He also points out that Mr Zahir, junior 
counsel, was not present on 1st August, although the document refers to advice given 
by him as well as Mr McNulty.  

 

125.	  On the morning of 1st August Mr McNulty was able to give an immediate answer to 
the judge’s enquiry about whether his client would be giving evidence. This clearly 
suggests that the matter had been discussed before then and a decision made, subject
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

to  final  confirmation.  The  document  dated  1st  August  signed  in  the  very  short 
consultation over the lunch break of 1st August, appears to us to represent no more 
than the final confirmation witnessed in writing of an issue which had already been 
 
discussed  and  was  the  subject  of  advice  given  on  previous  occasions.  Farooqi  has 
waived his legal professional privilege in this case, thus enabling some consideration 
to be given to what advice he was given. However, we have received scant materials 
 
in support of the assertion now put before the court.  

 

126.	  Most  surprisingly  there  is  no  witness  statement  of  any  sort  provided  by  Farooqi 
 
himself. When an appellant wishes to assert that he has not been given appropriate 
advice in a particular respect, or has not been able to make an informed decision about 
a matter of materiality in the trial, he must provide the court with a statement setting 
out the relevant history. There is no such material from Farooqi.  

 

127.	  Next we turn to Mr Zahir.. We would describe the material provided by him as sparse 
 
in content and quality. He has also provided notes which he took of consultations on 
6th and 19th July 2011, the latter of which is an occasion when the question of giving 
evidence was under consideration. He says he was not present on 1st August and has 
no other detailed recollection. 

 

128.	  Farooqi’s  case  was  extensively  prepared  by  Mr  Sharif,  a  solicitor,  who,  like  Mr 
 
McNulty and Mr Zahir, has considerable experience of representing defendants over a 
number of years in terrorist cases. Despite a request to do so, and notwithstanding the 
fact that he was involved at the heart of Farooqi’s defence from the outset and during 
the  trial,  he  failed  to  provide  any  material  whatsoever  on  issues  germane  to  this 
appeal, including the decision not to give evidence.  

129.	  Farooqi has not sought to rely on any material from Mr McNulty, Mr Zahir or Mr 

 

Sharif, nor has he sought an order requiring the attendance of any of them.  

 

130.	  The dearth of material from the primary actors in the decision as to whether or not to 
give  evidence  represents  a  very  unpromising  basis  for  a  submission  that  the  court 
should  conclude  that  Farooqi  did  not  make  an  informed  decision,  or  was 
 
inappropriately advised, about whether he should give evidence or not, or indeed the 
circumstances in which he decided that he would not do so. 

 

131.	  Some  documentary  material  sheds  light  on  these  matters.  In  the  spring  of  2011  a 
 
defence statement was submitted on Farooqi’s behalf. As we have already indicated, 
 
the line was to the effect that he acknowledged that the words recorded on the probe 
evidence  were  in  fact  spoken  by  him  but  that  they  did  not  accurately  reflect  his 
 
intention.  It  also  makes  the  point  that  the  undercover  officers  had  steered  the 
 
conversation  with  Farooqi  towards  discussion  of  Jihad.  Consequently,  Farooqi’s 
recorded observations were said to be no more than an explanation of the principles of 
Jihad  and  a  reaction  to  the  conversational  promptings  of  the  undercover  officers. 
What he said was not, and was incapable of being, an invitation or solicitation to any 
form of criminal conduct. Moreover, he did not intend anyone to travel to Pakistan or
--------

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

Afghanistan in order to participate in terrorism and he did nothing with the intention 
of soliciting murder. 

 

132.	  The  probe  evidence  covered  a  period  of  a  year  and  involved  a  huge  number  of 
conversations, totalling a vast amount of time. Farooqi, who is an intelligent man, had 
insisted on personally reviewing the DVDs of those probes. After a great deal of time 
 
had  been  expended  by  him  reviewing  the  probe  evidence,  he  admitted  that  the 
transcriptions  of  the  probes  were  indeed  accurate.  This  too  was  confirmed  in  his 
defence statement. This meant that the defence would turn on an interpretation of that 
 
agreed material. As we have already commented, the defence put forward by Farooqi 
was consistent with that being advanced by the co-accused.   

 

 

133.	  The record of visits in custody shows that quite apart from many visits by Mr Sharif 
prior  to  the  creation  of  the  defence  statement,  there  had  also  been  visits  by  Mr 
McNulty. 

134.	  Thus, by the spring of 2011 when the defence statement was produced, Mr Farooqi 

 

had given his lawyers his instructions about the charges that he faced. 

 

135.	  As we have seen, Mr McNulty’s strategy in cross-examination was to emphasise the 
reactive role of his client to approaches by the undercover officers and the context in 
which he had provided his responses to them.  

 
136.	 

In those circumstances the need for very regular contact with the client during the trial 
was diminished. This appears to us to be the most likely explanation for the relatively 
limited degree of contact between Farooqi and his legal advisers during the trial.  

 

137.	  Two further pieces of material are important. Firstly, there is the note Mr Zahir made 
of the consultation on 19th July 2011. On that day the records show that Farooqi was 
 
seen  by  Mr  Sharif  and  Mr  Zahir  for  nearly  two  hours  in  the  morning,  with  Mr 
 
McNulty being present for about twenty-five minutes of that time. Mr Zahir’s note 
records discussion in the presence of both counsel and the solicitor to the effect that 
the  need  was  to  keep  the  focus  of  the  case  on  the  police  rather  than  to  allow  it  to 
move,  as  the  prosecution  would  wish,  to  focussing  on  whether  Farooqi  was 
radicalising others including members of his family. At that stage, of course, his son, 
Harris Farooqi, was a co-defendant. 

 

138.	  Mr McNulty is recorded as saying “I am still of the view it is not in your interest to 
give evidence.” That clearly indicates that he had expressed that view before. Farooqi 
is recorded as confirming that Mr Zahir had explained the material and commented 
“you say everything I can say is on transcript and I can’t think of much else to add.” It 
is then recorded that Farooqi said that he took the view that there was no real purpose 
to giving evidence and that the account in the transcripts was clear. This was followed 
by  Mr  McNulty  advising  that  it  would  be  difficult  to  give  evidence  and  that  there 
were disadvantages, but that the decision was his. By leaving things as they were they
--------

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
could focus on the police; but if he wanted to, Farooqi could give evidence. The basis 
underlying  this  discussion  was  that  the  case  would  go  to  the  jury,  and  indeed 
reference was made to the jury’s likely attitude if they thought the judge was biased. 
There was also discussion of the wisdom of calling Farooqi’s daughter and son-in-law 
as  defence  witnesses,  each  of  whom  could  be  the  subject  of  hostile  and  possibly 
productive cross-examination for the Crown.  

 

 

139.	  Prior  to  1st  August  2011  when  Mr  McNulty  announced  that  Farooqi  would  not  be 
giving evidence, there is logged a two hour conference on 28th July with Mr Sharif, 
the solicitor, during the morning and a forty minute conference involving him and Mr 
 
McNulty in the afternoon. A weekend intervened between that date and 1st August, 
but  it  seems  to  us  that  given  the  timetable,  the  fair  inference  to  be  drawn,  as  the 
Crown’s  case  was  drawing  to  its  close,  was  that  the  further  discussion  must  have 
 
addressed the merits of giving evidence and it was this which enabled Mr McNulty to 
 
give his prompt answer to the judge’s question on Monday 1st August 2011. 

 

140.	  We therefore stand back to assess the position. There is an absence of evidence from 
the quarter from which we would most expect to find some assistance if this appellant 
were able to amount a credible attack on the advice tendered to him, namely Farooqi 
himself.  There  has  been  a  lamentable  failure  by  Mr  Sharif  to  provide  any  sort  of 
assistance.  Mr  Zahir’s  position  appears  to  be  one  of  limiting  his  involvement  in 
matters, although he has provided his record of the consultation of 19th July. There is 
no other contemporaneous record of any sort provided by Mr McNulty, Mr Sharif or 
Mr Zahir. 

 

141.	  By contrast such material as there is in the form of visit logs, the defence statement 
and the documents of 19th July and 1st August leads us to the firm conclusion that the 
lines  of  Farooqi’s  defence  were  clear;  and  that  prior  to  19th  July  Mr  McNulty  had 
indicated that he did not advise his client to give evidence. On 19th July the topic was 
revisited and clearly considered in some depth, and the view of the legal advisers was 
 
maintained.  It  is  also  clear  that  Farooqi  himself  understood  the  position  and  its 
potential consequences. He acknowledged that the decision was entirely his own, and 
he personally  decided not to give evidence. The log for 28th July, coupled with the 
 
events  of  1st  August,  suggest  a  further  conversation  on  that  topic  enabling  a  swift 
signing of the formal document on 1st August. 

 

 
142.	  There is no credible material to support the proposition that Farooqi did not make an 
informed decision or that he was improperly advised. The submission that he should 
 
have been told in terms that he needed to go into the witness box has the disadvantage 
of  being  made  in  hindsight  and  from  a  different  tactical  viewpoint.  It  also  fails  to 
acknowledge the devastating nature of the cross-examination to which Farooqi would 
have  been  exposed,  and  its  possible  damaging  impact  on  the  remaining  defendants 
including Farooqi’s son. It is clear to us that there was significant discussion of the 
 
pros and cons of giving and/or calling evidence; it is clear that Farooqi was aware that 
 
he  had  a  free  hand  in  the  matter;  and  the  overwhelming  inference  is  that  he 
understood  the  general  approach  of  the  defence,  which  was  not  to  challenge  the
--------

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
primary evidence given, but to seek to set it in a context favourable to him. There is 
nothing in this point. 

 

143.	  There  is  therefore  no  material  to  suggest  that  the  fairness  of  Farooqi’s  trial  was 
undermined by the circumstances in which he came to decide that he would not give 
evidence,  and  on  this  issue  we  are  not  satisfied  that  Mr  McNulty’s  conduct  of  the 
 
defence fell below the appropriate level of professional competence.  

 

144.	  We  have  received  a  letter  from  Mr  Meyer,  who  was  the  solicitor  with  overall 
responsibility for the conduct of Farooqi’s case. It is clear that he fulfilled some form 
 
of  overarching  supervisory  role  involving  managing  the  VHCC  contract  with  the 
Legal  Services  Commission  and  ensuring  that  others  prepared  Farooqi’s  case 
 
properly. We recognise that he has never met Mr Farooqi and that he does not have a 
detailed  knowledge  of  the  evidence  in  the  case.  He  describes  how  a  team  of  four 
 
within his firm headed by Mr Sharif, all of whom had prior experience in working in a 
number of terrorism cases, carried out the necessary groundwork. The content of his 
letter indicates that he has made some enquires of his team in the light of the grounds 
of appeal prepared by Mr Bott. 

 

145.	  What  Mr  Meyer  appears  to  have  gleaned  from  members  of  his  team  is  that  the 
decision not to give evidence was uncontroversial, and that Farooqi understood the 
 
implications of not going into the witness box. The reality was that Farooqi did not 
want to give evidence and had made it clear that he was not prepared to give names 
 
and details of individuals referred to in the transcripts or in a diary recovered. He was 
 
acutely aware that in one important respect his explanation would conflict with that of 
his son. He had not coped well with testing questions put to him in conference, and 
there  were  concerns  that  the  jury  would  find  him  evasive  or  unable  to  give  an 
innocent account. These were reasons underlying the view of the legal advisers as to 
why  Farooqi  would  not  benefit  from  giving  evidence,  and  this  advice  was 
communicated to him. According to Mr Meyer, Farooqi agreed with the advice.  

 

 
146.	 

It is unsatisfactory that we should receive this information from someone who had not 
been at the trial and did not have day to day involvement in the necessary decisions. 
However, Mr Meyer must have received his information from some source within his 
firm closely connected with the trial, and it is, if anything, unfavourable to the case 
now advanced by Farooqi; it certainly cannot advance his case in any way and serves 
to confirm the view we have taken.  

 

147.	  By way of footnote we record that Mr Bott was critical of the fact that the visits log 
shows that on and after 22nd August when the judge had to consider whether it was 
 
feasible to continue with the trial, there were no visits to Farooqi by any members of 
 
his legal team until 31st August. Whatever this may suggest about a failure to observe 
 
reasonable  standards  of  client  care,  this  cannot  impact  on  the  decision  not  to  give 
evidence which, as we find, had been taken before the end of July and was ratified on 
1st August. As we have observed, that decision was taken in the expectation that the 
case  would  go  to  the  jury.  Accordingly,  the  developments  in  mid-August  after  Mr
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

McNulty’s  speech  do  not  affect  that  position.  The  events  of  22nd  August  onwards 
represent  the  judge  stripping  out  the  offending  aspects  of  Mr  McNulty’s  closing 
speech  so  that  they  were  no  longer  before  the  jury,  and  leaving  those  aspects  of 
Farooqi’s case which were properly for consideration to the jury.  

 

148.	  Moreover,  as,  again,  we  have  noted,  Farooqi  is  an  intelligent  man  with  a  good 
command of English who had enjoyed a lengthy working relationship with his legal 
team over many months. He was in court on 22nd August and would have heard and 
understood the discussions. Had he wished to confer with his legal team, he needed 
only to ask them to come and see him. Had he wished to complain that he had in some 
 
way not made a free and informed decision as to whether to give evidence, there was 
ample opportunity for him to have done so. The complaint based on Farooqi’s failure 
to give evidence is not sustained. 

The Watson Direction 

 

149.	  On behalf of Malik, Mr Bennathan, criticises the use of the Watson direction. He does 
so on two bases. The first submission is that the Watson direction should never have 
 
been given at all. The second is, that it adversely affects the way in which the jury 
returned their verdicts.  

 

150.	  As  to  the  first  point,  Mr  Bennathan  did  not  accept  that  there  was  anything 
objectionable in what Mr McNulty said about the approach that jurors should take. He 
reinforces this by pointing out that the Crown did not raise objection to this passage 
 
during  the  trial,  although  they  had  raised  objections  to  other  passages  in  Mr 
McNulty’s  speech.  For  the  reasons  we  have  given,  we  disagree.  The  judge  was 
entitled  to  take  the  view  that  Mr  McNulty’s  speech  created  a  danger  that  the  jury 
would not fully comprehend their responsibility, if possible in accordance with their 
 
consciences, to achieve a collective decision. We give much weight to the judge’s feel 
of the case and his concerns that Mr McNulty’s address was calculated wrongly to 
divert the jury. 

 

 

151.	  Care must be taken in relation with a Watson direction. There are particular dangers in 
departing from the wording approved by Lord Lane CJ, and difficulties arise if the 
 
direction is given in circumstances which appear to put pressure on a jury to agree 
when they may genuinely be unable to do so in accordance with their oaths. The cases 
illustrate that problems may arise if the direction is given prior to majority direction, 
but after the jury has indicated some difficulty in reaching a verdict (see R v Atlan 
 
[2004]  EWCA  Crim  1798).  It  is  also  well  understood  that  the  direction  should  not 
normally by given at the same time as a majority direction (see R v Buono [1992] 95 
Cr App R 338). In this case the judge did not deviate from the approved wording, nor, 
since it was given on the first day of a summing-up which ran over five days, could it 
be  thought  that  his  direction  was  associated  with  some  difficulty  the  jury  were 
expressing in reaching unanimous verdicts.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
152.	 

 
 
In the circumstances we are wholly unpersuaded that the judge was wrong to give a 
Watson direction. To have ignored his concern that the jury had been invited to take 
an inappropriate approach to their deliberation would have been a dereliction of his 
 
duties.  The  advice  given  in  the  Watson  direction  was  precisely  apt  to  cover  the 
situation.  In  the  unusual  circumstances  of  this  case,  the  Watson  direction  was  an 
appropriate way of ensuring that the jury approached their responsibilities on a correct 
 
basis. 

 

153.	  The  second  limb  of  Mr  Bennathan’s  submissions  is  that  the  use  of  the  Watson 
 
direction adversely affected Malik’s case in relation to the reception of verdicts. Mr 
 
Bennathan  had  submitted  to  the  judge  prior  to  summing-up  that  Count  8  added 
nothing  to  Counts  9  and  10.  The  judge  rejected  that  submission  on  the  basis  that 
Count 8 could be committed by someone who did not solicit murder. The two types of 
offence  have  different  ingredients,  and  guilt  of  Count  8  might  encompass  activity 
 
falling short of that required for Counts 9 and 10. We agree with the judge’s analysis 
 
and the way he left the matter to the jury. Counts 9 and 10 alleged soliciting to murder 
by  encouraging  the  undercover  officer  to  murder  another  person  whilst  engaged  in 
Jihad abroad. 

 

154.	  The  Watson  direction  was  given  on  30th  August  2011.  The  jury  retired  on  the 
afternoon of 5th September. We have already outlined the sequence of events after the 
jury’s retirement at paragraph 97 above, but we repeat it here. On the afternoon of 8th 
 
September the jury indicated that they had reached some verdicts. They convicted the 
appellants Farooqi and Newton, and acquitted Harris Farooqi. They had not reached 
unanimous  verdicts  in  Malik’s  case.  The  judge  sent  the  jury  home  for  the  day  and 
indicated  to  counsel  that  he  would  give  a  majority  verdict  direction  the  following 
morning. 

 

155.	  On 9th September, after an hour’s deliberation, the jury was brought into court with a 
view  to  being  given  a  majority  direction.  At  that  time  they  returned  a  unanimous 
verdict against Malik on Count 8. They were given a majority direction on Counts 9 
and  10.  An  hour  later  they  returned  and  convicted  Malik  on  Counts  9  and  10 
unanimously.  

 

156.	  Mr Bennathan sought to argue that the Watson direction may have infected the jury’s 
 
approach,  since  at  the  time  of  returning  a  unanimous  verdict  on  Count  8  the  jury 
clearly  had  not  been  unanimous  in  relation  to  Counts  9  and  10.  We  reject  this 
argument.  First,  there  was  a  very  substantial  time  gap  between  the  giving  of  the 
Watson direction on the first day of the summing-up and the returning of verdicts on 
Counts  9  and  10,  some  nine  days  later.  The  notion  that  a  necessary  corrective 
 
direction  at  the  outset  of  the  summing-up  as  to  the  general  approach  a  jury  should 
adopt in its deliberations could have improperly affected the result many days later is 
unsustainable. 

 

157.  Moreover,  there  was,  as  the  judge  ruled,  a  clear  difference  between  Count  8  and 
Counts 9 and 10, and separate consideration was required in relation to each count.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

 
There is no reason at all why the jury should not have considered and reached verdicts 
 
on Count 8 before moving onto the later counts. The order in which the jury considers 
 
counts is a matter for it to determine. We can perceive no properly arguable basis for 
complaint in relation to this second limb of the Watson argument.  

158.	  There is no merit in these arguments and we reject them. 

 

Applications regarding sentence 
 

 

 
159.	  These  applications  are  made  by  Farooqi,  who  was  sentenced  to  a  term  of  life 
imprisonment with a minimum term of nine years, and by Malik, who was sentenced 
to imprisonment for public protection with a minimum term of five years.  

 

160.	  Farooqi  seeks  to  argue  that  a  life  sentence  was  wrong  in  principle  and  that  the 
minimum term was manifestly excessive in that the judge should have attached more 
 
weight to the fact that there was no evidence that any person radicalised by Farooqi 
had travelled abroad to fight Jihad. It was also urged that there was no certainty that 
Farooqi had the means to send anyone abroad to fight.  

 

161.	  Any offence committed in a terrorist context requires a careful consideration of the 
danger posed by the offender. Farooqi was an unrepentant offender whom the judge 
 
had  had  an  ample  opportunity  to  assess  over  the  course  of  a  lengthy  trial.  He 
concluded that Farooqi was a very dangerous extremist who believed that murder of 
allied troops was an obligation, which he wholeheartedly incited.  

 

162.	  He had attended terrorist training camps in the past and was familiar with weapons 
such as rocket launchers and Kalashnikovs. He had travelled to Afghanistan to fight 
alongside the Taliban in 2001. He was a dedicated recruiter of others, doing all he 
could to recruit men to fight the Taliban and kill allied troops at a time when he owed 
allegiance to this country. He had numerous contacts in the terrorist world. He was 
 
determined and sophisticated in what he did, and devoted his whole energies to the 
task of recruiting. 

 

163.	  These were findings with which we agree and to which the judge was fully entitled to 
come.  A  sentence  of  life  imprisonment  is  appropriate  where  the  culpability  of  an 
offender is particularly high, or where the offences are particularly grave, and by their 
very nature arouse public abhorrence. See R v Kehoe [2009] 1 Cr App R (S) 9 and 
Attorney General’s Reference No (43 of 2009) [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 100. 

 

 
164.	  We  are  satisfied  that  Farooqi’s  offending  qualifies  for  a  sentence  of  life 
imprisonment.  Given the nature of his activities, their aims, and the dedication with 
which  they  were  pursued  we  consider  that  the  minimum  term  was  appropriate. 
Although the judge recognised that Farooqi could claim some mitigatory effect on the 
basis that nobody had actually gone abroad to fight as a result of his activities and also
--------

R v Farooqi & Others 
 

 

that  he  had  no  relevant  previous  convictions,  those  factors  were  clearly  taken  into 
account by the judge and do not result in any impeachable sentence.  

 

165.	  Farooqi is substantially out of time in making this application. In view of the lack of 
merit in it we refuse an extension of time, but in any event this application fails on its 
 
merits and is dismissed.  

 

166.	  Malik complains about the imposition of an IPP and the minimum term of five years 
imposed. It is argued that that sentence was manifestly excessive given Malik’s age 
 
(20 at the time of relevant events) and the fact that he was a victim of Count 1 in the 
sense that he had been radicalised by Farooqi. Moreover, insofar as he had solicited 
others to murder, that had been carried out under the guidance of Farooqi, who was an 
 
older and highly influential person. 

 

167.	  The judge accepted that Malik had been the victim of Farooqi’s radicalisation and that 
as a result his life had been changed for the worse. The judge noted that whilst serving 
 
a  period  in  custody  during  the  currency  of  the  conspiracy,  Malik  had  tried  to 
radicalise others using materials provided by Farooqi. It was clear that after release 
 
from that term he was prepared to go and fight abroad in pursuit of Jihad, to die if 
 
necessary in so doing, and to encourage others to do so. 

 

168.	  The effect of radicalisation was that Malik had become a dangerous offender within 
the meaning of the 2003 Act and was at significant risk of further such offending and 
causing  serious  harm  to  others.  The  judge  was  thus  obliged  to  consider  steps  for 
public protection. The fact that Malik had become dangerous as a result of Farooqi’s 
activities did not change that stark reality. By the time of sentence it was clear that 
Malik was still in thrall to Farooqi. The judge correctly considered in the light of R v 
C [2009] 1 WLR 2158 whether some less draconian measure than an IPP could be 
 
adopted,  but  in  the  circumstances  felt  that  only  an  IPP  was  appropriate.  The  judge 
 
carefully analysed the position. In our view he was right to conclude that Malik was 
dangerous and justified in his conclusion that only a sentence of IPP would meet that 
danger. 

 

169.	  The minimum term imposed is less than that imposed on Farooqi and properly reflects 
the judge’s view that Malik’s culpability was significantly less than that of Farooqi. 
We  see  no  basis  upon  which  it  could  properly  be  argued  that  either  the  IPP  or  the 
minimum term were manifestly excessive.  

 

170.	  Having  considered  the  merits  and  determined  that  there  are  none,  we  dismiss  this 
 
application. Insofar as any extension of time was required in Malik’s case, that too is 
 
refused. 

171.  Accordingly, both applications relating to sentence fail.

JUDGMENT OF H.H. JUDGE PETER MURPHY IN RELATION TO WEARING 
OF NIQAAB BY DEFENDANT DURING PROCEEDINGS IN CROWN COURT 

 
 
 
Counsel for the Prosecution:  Ms. Kate Wilkinson 
Counsel for the Defence: Ms. Susan Meek 
 

Introduction 

 
1. The defendant, to whom I shall refer in this judgment as D, is a woman who has 
been charged on indictment at this court with a single count of witness intimidation.  
The facts alleged are not relevant for the purposes of this judgment, except for the fact 
that the defendant is alleged to have committed the offence while wearing the burq’a 
and niqaab,1 and no issue of visual identification will arise at trial.   
 
2. The question now before me was initially raised by the Court of its own motion, 
and not by the prosecution or the defence.  The case was listed before me for a plea 
and  case  management  hearing  on  22  August  2013.    A  person,  who  both  the 
prosecution and the defence agreed was D, appeared and surrendered to the dock.  D 
was wearing a burq’a and niqaab. (I understand that burq’a is the term applied to the 
black  loose  shroud  which  covers  the  head  and  body,  and  that  niqaab  is  the  term 
applied to the black veil which covers the entire face, except for the eyes.  In case my 
understanding is wrong, and so that there is no doubt, my concern is with the covering 
of the face, by whatever means that may be achieved.  I am not concerned with any

For simplicity, I have adopted uniform spellings of niqaab and burq’a.

other aspect of D’s dress or appearance.) When I refer to the niqaab in this judgement, 
I refer to a covering of the face.  
 
3. Through her counsel, I conveyed to D the court’s request that she reveal her face 
(but no other part of her body) for the purpose of identification.  After conferring with 
D, counsel said that D declined to comply with my request because her Muslim faith 
requires that she may not reveal her face in the presence of men.  It may be that this 
refers to men who are not members of her immediate family. 
 
4.  I  decided  to  take  time  to  consider  the  matter.    I  adjourned  the  hearing  until  12 
September  2013,  to  be  listed  before  me  for  further  proceedings  including  legal 
argument, and extended the defendant’s bail until that date.  It became clear to me 
that,  because  the  issue  of  the  niqaab  was  bound  to  recur  during  the  proceedings,  it 
would  be  desirable  to  deal  with  it  on  a  broader  basis  during  the  plea  and  case 
management hearing.  I asked counsel to submit skeleton arguments dealing with the 
way in which the Court should approach the matter.  I received skeleton arguments 
from both parties, and heard oral argument on the adjourned date.  I am extremely 
grateful to both counsel for their clear, well-judged, and helpful submissions.  I also 
received an expert report from Professor Susan Edwards, an expert witness on Gender 
and Islamic Dress, which was prepared on behalf of D.   
 
5.  At the hearing on 12 September 2013, I allowed the defendant to be identified by 
means of evidence from P.C. Hughes, a female police officer who knows D, and who 
observed D in private without her niqaab during a short adjournment for that purpose, 
and was able to say that she was certain that the person before the Court was in fact 
D.    D  was  arraigned  and  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  sole  count  of  the  indictment.    I 
conducted  a  general  plea  and  case  management  hearing  and  heard  argument  about 
what further directions, if any, should be given about the wearing of the niqaab during 
the  proceedings.    Having  heard  argument,  I  adjourned  the  case  further  until  16 
September 2013, to prepare this judgment.

Question to be Decided 

 
6.  The question is to what extent D is entitled to wear the niqaab during proceedings 
against  her  in  the  Crown  Court.    The  plea  and  case  management  hearing  is  the 
occasion on which the judge should give directions for the proper management of the 
case, and this is, therefore, the proper occasion to consider the question of the niqaab 
generally in relation to the proceedings.  No purpose would be served by re-opening 
the question every time the defendant comes before the Court for another appearance 
or hearing. Moreover, it is right that D should be aware of the directions given as soon 
as possible, so that she has ample time to consider her position further and take advice 
as needed.  Thus, the purpose of this judgment is essentially to give further directions 
for the conduct of the proceedings.   
 
7.  I  make  clear  at  the  outset  that  I  address  only  the  case  of  a  defendant  before  the 
Crown Court.  I do not intend to address the practice of Courts other than the Crown 
Court,  especially  that  of  civil  or  family  Courts,  in  which  other  considerations  may 
come into play.  The practice of these courts differs greatly from that of the Crown 
Court.    Cases  are  almost  always  heard  by  a  judge  sitting  without  a  jury.    In  some 
proceedings  in  family  courts,  the  procedure  may  be  less  adversarial  and  may  lean 
more towards an inquisitorial approach.  Ms. Wilkinson referred me to a decision of 
Macur J in the Family Division (SL v. MJ [2006] EWHC 3743 (Fam)) in which an 
informal  compromise  was  arrived  at.    I  will  refer  to  it  again  later.    The  rules  of 
evidence applicable to criminal trials are not applied, or are not applied as strictly, in 
civil  and  family  cases  and  are  subject  to  an  ultimate  judicial  discretion.    Most 
importantly, the panoply of procedural and evidential structures which are necessary 
when a person is accused of a criminal offence can be dispensed with.  
 
8.  Nor  do  I  address  the  situation  in  which  a  woman  wearing  a  niqaab  attends  the 
Crown Court solely as a witness, or as a juror, or appears as an advocate.  I accept that 
there are different considerations in these instances.  For example, the public has a 
strong interest in encouraging women who may be the victims of crime from coming 
forward,  without  the  fear  that  the  court  process  may  compromise  their  religious 
beliefs and practices.  On the other hand, the rights of the defendant in any resulting 
criminal proceedings must also be protected.  So there is a potential for a challenging 

 

3
--------
conflict of competing public interests.  A defendant may, of course, be a witness; but 
this does not define her role in the proceedings.  As a defendant, she plays the central 
role  throughout  proceedings,  and  unlike  a  witness,  she  is  brought  before  the  court 
under  compulsion  and  does  not  appear  as  a  matter  of  choice.    I  hope  that  my 
observations may be helpful to judges who may have to confront these situations in 
future cases.  But these questions are not before me, and must await another day. 
 

The Need for Legal Principle 

 
9. There is a pressing need for a court to provide a clear statement of law for trial 
judges  who  have  to  deal  with  cases  in  which  a  woman  wearing  the  niqaab  attends 
Court as a defendant.  Given the ever-increasing diversity of society in England and 
Wales, this is a question which may be expected to arise more and more frequently, 
and  to  which  an  answer  must  be  provided.      I  have  found  no  authority  directly  on 
point in our domestic law.  There are various extra-judicial sources which offer some 
guidance as a matter of general principle. 
 
10. The Equal Treatment Bench Book (JSB 2004, Chapter 3.3, 2007) offers what the 
Bench Book itself describes as general guidance about the wearing of religious dress 
in the courtroom.  Both counsel and Professor Edwards allude to this guidance, and I 
do  not  mean  to  disregard  it,  though  I  cannot  agree  with  Professor  Edwards’  stark 
conclusion  that  ‘[i]n  the  UK  the  JSB  permits  the  wearing  of  niqaabs’.    The  Bench 
Book rightly emphasises that, while various approaches are possible, the Court must 
balance any competing interests: but it concludes that ‘the interests of justice remain 
paramount’.  It rightly draws attention to the question of why, and to what extent, the 
judicial  function  may  be  impeded  if  a  participant  in  the  proceedings  has  her  face 
covered.    It  rightly  points  out  that  the  stress  of  appearing  as  a  defendant  may  be 
increased, and the quality of any evidence she gives may be affected, if a defendant is 
obliged to uncover her face.  The judge must weigh all these matters.  In conclusion, 
the  Bench  Book  says  that  ‘the  best  way  of  proceeding  comes  down  to  basic  good 
judge craft’.     
 
11. It is at this point that I respectfully depart from the Bench Book.  The issue of 
whether a defendant before the Crown Court may wear the niqaab during some or all 

 

4
--------
the proceedings is not one of ‘judge craft’, or even one for ‘general guidance’.  It is a 
question  of  law.    The  defendant  has  the  qualified  right  to  manifest  her  religion  or 
belief  pursuant  to  art.  9  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  (‘the 
Convention’).  By virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998, that right is cognisable as a 
matter of domestic law in the Crown Court.  By virtue of s.6(1) and (3) of that Act, 
the  Court  is  a  public  authority  and  may  not  act  in  a  way  incompatible  with  a 
Convention right.  At the same time, the Court may be entitled to place restrictions on 
a  qualified  Convention  right,  such  as  that  under  art.  9.    There  is  a  line  of  judicial 
authority on that subject in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR).  There is domestic judicial authority.  I refer to this authority below.  Both 
the Convention and the judicial authority clearly insist that specific legal tests are to 
be applied, which cannot simply be reduced to a rubric of acting ‘in the interests of 
justice’. The goal of the legal tests to be applied is, of course, to serve the interests of 
justice,  but  a  more  detailed  analysis  is  required  if  the  law  is  to  be  followed  and 
applied. These are legal issues which engage both an important right of the defendant 
and the duty of the Crown Court to conduct proceedings in accordance with law.  
 
12. The relegation of such important issues to the sphere of ‘judge craft’ or ‘general 
guidance’  has  resulted  in  widespread  judicial  anxiety  and  uncertainty  and  to  a 
reluctance  to  address  the  issue.  To  borrow  and  adapt  slightly  a  phrase  currently  in 
vogue, the niqaab has become the ‘elephant in the courtroom.’  Trial judges need, not 
only general guidance, however helpful, but a statement of the law.  It is my intent to 
attempt to provide such a statement in this judgment, but as may be imagined, I do so 
with some misgivings.  I am a male judge dealing with an issue which mainly affects 
female Muslim defendants, and does so in an intimate way; though I make clear at the 
outset  that  everything  I  say  in  this  judgment  is  intended  to  apply  to  defendants  of 
either gender and to those of any religious faith, or none, in analogous situations.  I 
am conscious also of the place of the Crown Court in the hierarchy of legal authority, 
and  I  express  the  hope  that  Parliament  or  a  higher  court  will  review  this  question 
sooner rather than later and provide a definitive statement of the law to trial judges. 
 
13.  Valuable  assistance  is  to  be  found  in  the  judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Canada in R. v. NS, 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, and below, I gratefully adopt 
some of the propositions laid down in that case.  But the decision must be approached 

 

5
--------
with caution with respect to the issue now before me, for two reasons.  First, the case 
concerned the wearing of a niqaab, not by a defendant, but by a prosecution witness, 
which as I have indicated above, may raise different and challenging issues.  Second, 
the right to freedom of conscience and religion under s.2(a) of the Canadian Charter, 
on which the witness in NS relied in claiming that she was entitled to wear the niqaab 
while  giving  evidence,  appears  to  be  a  primary  constitutional  right  in  Canada.    As 
such, it appears to be entitled, under Canadian law, to far greater weight in the balance 
of  conflicting  interests  than  the  qualified  right  of  manifestation  of  religious  belief 
under art. 9 of the Convention, on which reliance is placed in this case.  Indeed, under 
Canadian law, it may be equal in status to the right to a fair trial. 
 

Sincerity of Belief in Obligation to wear Niqaab 

 
14.  I accept for the purposes of this judgment that D sincerely takes the view that, as 
a Muslim woman, she either is not permitted, or chooses not to uncover her face in the 
presence  of  men  who  are  not  members  of  her  close  family.    I  have  been  given  no 
reason  to  doubt  the  sincerity  of  her  belief.    I  say  this  because  in  one  of  the  cases 
considered under the rubric of R v. NS, to which I shall refer in more detail below, the 
Supreme  Court  of  Canada  held  that  the  judge  at  first  instance  should  have  taken 
evidence  on  the  voir  dire  to  establish  the  sincerity  of  the  witness’s  beliefs  before 
making  a  ruling  on  whether  a  niqaab  should  be  removed  while  giving  evidence.  
Neither counsel suggested that I had any duty to do this, and I would not take that step 
unless obliged to do so.  This is for three reasons. 
 
15. First, unlike cases where the question of religious dress or ornamentation arise in 
connection with employment or education, the practice of the courts must be uniform; 
they cannot vary between different cases or between different locations of the Crown 
Court.    The  highly  variable  conditions  in  different  places  of  employment  and 
education  may  suggest  different  results  in  different  cases.    But  the  practice  of  the 
Crown Court is a constant.  If judges sitting in different cases or at different locations 
took different approaches with respect to whether or not a defendant may wear the 
niqaab in court, the result would be a kind of judicial anarchy.  There must be a single 
practice, which does not depend upon the individual defendant.  That being the case, 
the  only  fair  course  to  take,  it  seems  to  me,  is  to  make  every  assumption  in  the 

 

6
--------
defendant’s favour about her sincerity in wearing the niqaab as a manifestation of her 
religion or belief. 
 
16.  Second,  if  the  Court  sought  to  explore  the  question  of  sincerity  with  every 
defendant,  it would necessarily involve the Court in entering into a religious debate 
with  the  witness,  which  would  be  unseemly,  and  might  even  smack  of  a  religious 
inquisition.  
 
17.  Third,  it  would  from  a  practical  point  of  view,  be  impossible  for  a  judge  to 
determine with consistency with what degree of sincerity such a choice is made by 
different defendants.  Such a decision would be highly subjective.  Even if it were 
possible, it is not clear that the Court’s decision about whether the niqaab should be 
worn during court proceedings would be informed by that information.  For example, 
Ms. Meek’s written submission candidly tells me that D has been wearing the niqaab 
only since May 2012, but I do not think that this would justify the Court in treating D 
differently from a woman who had been wearing it for thirty years.  It would not even 
be possible, as a matter of practical reality, to determine whether a woman’s choice to 
wear the niqaab is freely made, or is the result of compulsion of some kind.  For the 
Court to attempt to weigh degrees of sincerity would not only be unseemly, but also 
very dangerous; it may well justifiably expose the Court to charges of discrimination 
or of meddling in religious affairs in which it is not competent to meddle. 
 
18. There may be exceptional cases where, for example, the prosecution has evidence 
that the niqaab is being abused as a disguise, to facilitate impersonation or for some 
other improper purpose.  That kind of case would pose no real problem.  The Court 
would be justified in taking immediate steps to protect the integrity of its proceedings.  
But in the absence of evidence of that kind, in a case where a woman states that she 
will not remove her veil in the presence of men because of her religious belief, I take 
the view that the Court should make the assumption that she does so sincerely.  The 
Court should then decide the question before it on the basis of a universally applicable 
legal principle, and not on the basis of a subjective assessment of the motives of a 
particular defendant.

--------
The Niqaab: Obligation and Choice 

 

19.  Ms. Meek submits, and I accept, that whether or not there is an obligation to wear 
the niqaab, a choice to do so must be respected as a manifestation of religion or belief.  
But it seems to me relevant to observe that whether or not there is an obligation to 
wear the niqaab is not a subject of universal agreement within Islam; rather, it is a 
choice  made  by  individual  women  on  a  personal  basis.    This  has  been  recognized 
judicially:  see  the  opinion  of  Baroness  Hale  in  the  Denbigh  High  School  case, 
discussed  below,  at  [95].    It  is  also  confirmed  by  the  expert  report  of  Professor 
Edwards, who draws attention to the potential political aspects of the question.  Quite 
apart from that, it is a matter of common observation on the streets of London, on any 
day of the week, that not all Muslim women wear the niqaab.  Many, indeed it would 
seem, the majority, go out in public with their faces uncovered, albeit they may wear a 
head dress and cover their bodies with conservative garments.  This is consistent also 
with  information  disseminated  by  the  Muslim  Council  of  Britain,  whose  website 
contains the following information about Muslim female attire (Hijab). 
 

'What does the word Hijab mean?' 
 
Hijab is the Arabic term used to describe the attire worn by Muslim women. 
The literal meaning of Hijab is 'covering', but this term also carries a more 
general connotation of 'modesty'. Hijab as a social practise thus embraces not 
only clothing but also values and behaviour.  
 
 
The word Hijab is often mistranslated as the 'veil', which implies covering of 
the face and this is misleading. Although Hijab can involve the covering of a 
woman's face, most Muslims do not regard this to be essential. 
 
'Does a Muslim woman have to wear Hijab?' 
 
A central principle of the Holy Qur'an is that 'there is no compulsion in 
religion', as it is reiterated often in the Qur'an that truth stands out for itself. It 
is thus up to us as autonomous beings to contemplate and evaluate the merits 
of these teachings. Hence, although Hijab is certainly an integral part of the 
overall Islamic dress code, it is not for anyone to force it upon another human 
being.  
 
'So how should a Muslim woman dress?' 
 
 

 

8
--------
In Islam, the basic rule is that women should cover their body with loose 
fitting clothes. This is a generic requirement and so the actual style of clothing 
is adaptable to suit personal preferences, cultural norms and practical 
requirements. There are therefore different styles of Hijab worn by women 
throughout the world. Some Muslim women, particularly those in the Arab 
world, also interpret Hijab to include an outer covering (Burka).  
 
[www.mcb.org.uk/features, accessed on 4 September 2013.] 

 
20.  There is also a question about whether D would be entitled, and perhaps obliged, 
to uncover her face in proceedings before a court which applies Muslim law.  I have 
received  no  expert  evidence  specifically  dealing  with  foreign  law;  it  would  be  ill-
advised  for  me  to  try  to  make  findings  of  fact  about  foreign  law  for  evidential 
purposes,  and  I  do  not  purport  to  do  so:  see  Bumper  Development  Corp.  v. 
Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [1991] 1 WLR 1362.  Professor Edwards, 
however, indicates that whether or not a woman may wear a veil in court is a question 
on which courts which apply Muslim law are divided.  I mention it because D may 
well be aware of information readily available on the internet which might inform her 
decision to insist, or not to insist, on wearing the niqaab in this Court, or provide a 
basis  for  her  to  seek  advice  about  her  position  from  her  Imam  or  another  trusted 
source.   
 
21. The following are included as exceptions to the general rules about covering the 
face by Shaykh Muhammads Al-Munajjid: see Islam Question and Answer: When is it 
permissible for a woman to uncover her face?  www.islam-qa.com/en/2198 accessed 
on 25 August 2013.  
 

IV – Testimony 
 
It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face when she is giving testimony 
in court, whether she is a witness in a case or is there to witness a deal, and it 
is permissible for the qaadi (judge) to look at her in order to know who she is 
and to protect the rights of all concerned. 
 
Shaykh  al-Dardeer  said:  “It  is  not  permitted  to  give  testimony  against  a 
woman in niqaab until she uncovers her face so that it may be known who she 
is and what she looks like.”  
 
(Al-Sharh al-Kabeer li’l- Shaykh al-Dardeer, 4/194) 
 

 

9
--------
Ibn Qudaamah said: “The witness may look at the face of the woman against 
whom  he  is  testifying  so  that  his  testimony  will  speak  about  her  in  specific 
terms.” 
 
Ahmad  said:  ‘He  cannot  testify  against  a  woman  unless  he  knows  who  she 
is.’”  
 
(Al-Mughni,  7/459;  al-Sharh  al-Kabeer  ‘ala  Matan  al-Muqni’,  7/348,  bi 
haamish al-Mughni; al-Hidaayah ma’a Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/26). 
 
V – In court cases 
 
It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of a qaadi (judge) 
who is to rule either in her favour or against her, and in this situation he may 
look at her face in order to know who she is and for the sake of protecting 
people’s rights. 
 
The same rules that apply to giving testimony or bearing witness also apply in 
court cases, because they serve the same purpose.  
 
(See  Al-Durar  al-Mukhtaar,  5/237;  Al-Hadiyah  al-‘Alaa’iyah,  p.  244;  Al-
Hadiyah ma’a Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/26). 

 
 
 22.  I  will  now  proceed  as  follows.    First,  I  set  out  what  seem  to  me  to  be  the 
governing basic principles on which my decision of this matter must ultimately rest. 
Second,  I  will  examine  the  correct  approach  to  D’s  claim  under  art.  9  of  the 
Convention,  in  the  light  of  those  principles.    Third,  I  will  consider  what  additional 
guidance  is  to  be  derived  from  NS.    Finally,  I  reach  a  conclusion  on  the  question 
before me and give directions accordingly. 
 
  

Basic Governing Principles. 

 
23. The Court recognises that all those who live in England and Wales enjoy freedom 
of conscience, freedom of religion, and freedom of religious expression.  These rights 
are protected by the Common Law, but now derive also from art. 9 of the Convention.  
The  Courts  of  England  and  Wales  have  a  proud  record  of  upholding  religious 
freedoms, which are a valued part of our democratic way of life.  The Court has the 
utmost  respect  for  all  religious  beliefs,  traditions  and  practices,  and  makes  no 
distinction  between  those  of  different  religious  faiths,  or  between  those  with  a 

 

10
--------
religious faith and those with no religious faith.  The law applies to all alike without 
distinction.  The fundamental importance of these rights in a pluralistic, multi-cultural 
society  was  clearly  stated  by  Lord  Nicholls  of  Birkenhead  in  R  (Williamson)  v 
Secretary  of  State  for  Education  and  Employment  [2005]  UKHL  15,  [2005]  2  AC 
246, paras 15-19.   
 
24.  The  Courts  of  England  and  Wales  may  address  rights  under  the  Convention 
directly  and  may  enforce  and  protect  those  rights  as  a  matter  of  domestic  law  by 
virtue  of  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998.    The  Court  is  a  public  authority  for  the 
purposes of the Act, and must not act in a manner incompatible with a Convention 
right. 
 
25. The corollary of the right of conscience and freedom of religion conferred by the 
law of England and Wales is that those who live in the jurisdiction have an obligation 
to respect its institutions, including the Courts.  They have an obligation to obey the 
law, to participate in court proceedings when compelled to do so by law, and in so 
doing, to respect and follow the rules and practice of the Court.   
 
26. The Crown Court is the creature of statute.  Its jurisdiction and powers have been 
defined  by  a  series  of  statutory  provisions  beginning  with  the  Courts  Act  1971.    It 
applies the law of England and Wales, supplemented by Rules of Criminal Procedure.  
But its detailed practice in relation to the conduct of criminal proceedings also derives 
from that of its predecessors, the Courts of Assize and Quarter Sessions, and is the 
product of centuries of development and refinement at Common Law.  In my view, 
there are three governing principles underlying the Court’s practice. 
 
27. First, the rule of law.  In essence, this means that the law of the land must be the 
basis of all decisions taken by the Court, and that the law must apply equally to all 
those  who  come  before  the  Court,  regardless  of  ethnicity,  religion,  or  any  other 
personal attributes which might otherwise be the object of either prejudice or special 
favour.   There can be no exceptions to, or derogations from, this principle. 
 
28. Second, the principle of open justice.  The primary meaning of open justice that 
criminal proceedings should be held in open court, in public, and be open to reporting 

 

11
--------
by  the  press:  see  Attorney-General  v.  Leveller  Magazine  [1979]  AC  440,  450,  per 
Lord  Diplock.    Any  derogation  from  open justice  should  occur  only  in  exceptional 
circumstances and where the interests of justice require it.  The Court cannot derogate 
from  this  principle  for  lesser  purposes,  including  that  of  sparing  the  feelings  of  a 
defendant: cf. Malvern Justices, ex parte Evans [1988] QB 540. 
 
29.  Third,  the  principle  of  adversarial  trial.    The  adversarial  trial  is  central  to  the 
administration of criminal justice in England and Wales, and the Crown Court relies 
on it to conduct trials in accordance with the rule of law.  This principle is based on 
the proposition, derived from centuries of experimentation, practice, and experience, 
that the truth is most likely to emerge when: 

 the prosecution and defence are free to present their conflicting cases; 
 to an impartial jury; 
in accordance with law and the rules of evidence and procedure; 

 
 
 
  enforced by an impartial judge; and  
 

in open court in a public forum.   

 
30. It is essential to the proper working of an adversarial trial that all involved with 
the trial – judge, jury, witnesses, and defendant - be able to see and identify each other 
at  all  times  during  the  proceedings.  This  is  partly  a  matter  of  identification.    It  is 
obviously essential for the Court to know the identity of the person who comes before 
it as a defendant before a plea can be taken, and the defendant brought before a jury, 
and perhaps convicted and sentenced.  Otherwise, there is an obvious potential for the 
interests of justice to be compromised.  But the principle is much wider than that.  If a 
fair trial is to take place, the jury (and for some limited purposes, the judge) must be 
able  to  assess  the  credibility  of  the  witnesses  -    to  judge  how  they  react  to  being 
questioned, particularly, though by no means exclusively, during cross-examination.  
If  the  defendant  gives  evidence,  this  observation  applies  equally  to  her  evidence.  
Moreover,  juries  very  properly  rely  on  their  observation  of  the  defendant,  not  only 
when she gives evidence (if she does so) but throughout the trial as all the evidence is 
given.    Adversarial  trials  have  always  depended  in  part  on  these  conditions  being 
present in the courtroom.   
 

 

12
--------
31.  In the case of SL v. MJ, to which Ms. Wilkinson referred me, Macur J, sitting 
without a jury, allowed a female Muslim witness to give evidence, having lifted her 
veil on condition that she was shielded from male counsel but could be seen by the 
(female) judge.  I make no comment on that decision, but I take note that Macur J 
said: ‘the ability to observe a witness’ demeanour and deportment during the giving of 
evidence is important and, in my view, essential to assess accuracy and credibility’.  I 
respectfully associate myself with that observation because it comports with the long 
experience of judges and counsel in adversarial proceedings in England and Wales.    
 
32.  McLachlin CJ, writing for majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in NS, said: 

 
[25] Covering a witness’s face may also impede credibility assessment by the trier 
of fact, be it judge or jury. It is a settled axiom of appellate review that deference 
should be shown to the trier of fact on issues of credibility because trial judges 
(and juries) have the “overwhelming advantage” of seeing and hearing the witness 
— an advantage that a written transcript cannot replicate: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 
2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 24; see also White v. The King, [1947] 
S.C.R. 268, at p. 272; R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 131. This advantage 
is described as stemming from the ability to assess the demeanour of the witness, 
that  is,  to  see  how  the  witness  gives  her  evidence  and  responds  to  cross-
examination.  
 
[26]  Changes  in  a  witness’s  demeanour  can  be  highly  instructive;  in  Police  v. 
Razamjoo,  [2005]  D.C.R.  408,  a  New  Zealand  judge  asked  to  decide  whether 
witnesses could testify wearing burkas commented:  
 
“.  .  .  there  are  types  of  situations  .  .  .  in  which  the  demeanour  of  a  witness 
undergoes a quite dramatic change in the course of his evidence. The look which 
says “I hoped not to be asked that question”, sometimes even a look of downright 
hatred at counsel by a witness who obviously senses he is getting trapped, can be 
expressive. So too can abrupt changes in mode of speaking, facial expression or 
body  language.  The  witness  who  moves  from  expressing  himself  calmly  to  an 
excited  gabble;  the  witness  who  from  speaking  clearly  with  good  eye  contact 
becomes hesitant and starts looking at his feet; the witness who at a particular point 
becomes  flustered  and  sweaty,  all  provide  examples  of  circumstances  which, 
despite  cultural  and  language  barriers,  convey,  at  least  in  part  by  his  facial 
expression, a message touching credibility.”  [para. 78] 

[27]  On  the  record  before  us,  I  conclude  that  there  is  a  strong  connection 
between the ability to see the face of a witness and a fair trial. Being able to 
see  the  face  of  a  witness  is  not  the  only  —  or  indeed  perhaps  the  most 
important  —  factor  in  cross-examination  or  accurate  credibility  assessment. 
But its importance is too deeply rooted in our criminal justice system to be set 
aside absent compelling evidence. [id. at [27].

33. These long-established propositions are recognised, not only at Common Law, but 
more widely in States bound by of the fair trial provisions of art. 6 of the Convention.  
In  van  Mechelen  v.  The  Netherlands  (1997)  25  EHRR  647,  the  ECHR  held  the 
defendant’s right to a fair trial was infringed where anonymous police witnesses gave 
evidence against the defendant in circumstances such that, not only did the defendant 
know  their  identities,  but  he  was  unable  to  observe  their  demeanour  under  direct 
questioning, and thus judge their reliability.  This, also, was a case about witnesses, 
not defendants, but the principle applies readily to defendants also.  As I noted earlier, 
it appears (though I make no finding of fact on this point) that at least some courts 
which apply Muslim law take the same view about the face being uncovered while a 
woman gives evidence, and indeed, while evidence is given against a woman. 
 
34.  Both Ms. Meek and Professor Edwards argue that the value of seeing a witness in 
the process of evaluating her evidence can be overstated; the dissenting judgment of 
Abella J in NS adverts to this proposition; and it must be weighed in the balance.  I 
recognise that there is a school of thought to that effect, and I do not mean to suggest 
that other factors, including the substance of the evidence itself, are not also of great 
importance.  Moreover, there may, of course, be cases in which the evidence given is 
formal  or  unchallenged.    But  I  am  satisfied  that  the  ability  of  the  jury  to  see  and 
observe a witness remains of cardinal importance in almost all cases in the context of 
the adversarial trial.  Otherwise, the witness is effectively immunised against cross-
examination,  which  is  incompatible  with  an  adversarial  trial.    Ms.  Wilkinson,  on 
behalf of the Crown, supports this view in principle, though she does not accept that 
the Court should go beyond advising a defendant about the possible consequences of 
not being seen, and giving the jury an appropriate direction. 
 
35. While the law permits no derogations from the principle of the rule of law, it does 
permit derogations from the principles of open justice and the adversarial trial process 
in  limited  circumstances.    Witnesses  are  not  always  present  in  the  courtroom.  
Unchallenged  evidence  may  be  given  by  way of  the  reading  of  witness  statements, 
pursuant  to  s.9  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  1967,  or  may  be  presented  by  way  of 
formal admission pursuant to s.10 of the same Act.  Hearsay evidence may be given, 
enabling  the  jury  to  consider  evidence  of  witnesses  who  do  not  appear  before  the 

 

14
--------
Court, in accordance with a specific statutory scheme: see Criminal Justice Act 2003, 
s.114 et seq.  Witnesses may give evidence with the benefit of special measures: see 
Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, Part II, Chapter 1.  Evidence by way 
of  ABE  interviews  and  live  link  remove  the  witness  from  the  courtroom  itself.  
Witnesses may be permitted to give evidence from behind a screen, which prevents 
the  defendant  and  the  public  from  seeing  them,  while  allowing  the  judge,  jury  and 
counsel to do so.  Some witnesses are permitted to give evidence anonymously: see 
Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008.  There are provisions restricting 
publication  of  the  identities  of  children  and  complainants  in  sexual  cases:  Children 
and  Young  Persons  Act  1933,  s.39;  Sexual  Offences  (Amendment)  Act  1992,  s.1.  
Information may be withheld if it attracts public interest immunity, and hearings may 
be  held  in  chambers  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  disclosure  of  such  materials 
must be made: see H [2004] 2 AC 134.  But in all these cases, there is a reason for 
permitting  such  an  exceptional  course;  that  course  is  based  on  specific  statutory 
provisions and linked to the fair and proper administration of justice.   
 

The Right of Manifestation of Religion and Belief: art. 9 of the Convention 

 
36.  The  question,  therefore,  is  whether  D’s  right  to  manifest  her  religion  or  belief 
under art. 9 of the Convention entitles her to wear the niqaab during proceedings in 
the Crown Court in which she is a defendant; and whether this right overrides, or must 
be balanced against the public interest in the Courts conducting criminal proceedings 
in accordance with the rule of law, open justice, and the adversarial trial process; and 
if so, what the result of that balancing process should be.  Both counsel broadly agree 
that this is the question I must address. 
 
37. Article 9 provides: 

 
1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this 
right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either 
alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his 
religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.  

2.  Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such 

limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic 

 

15
--------
38. Art. 9 contains two distinct rights, which are different in character.  The first is the 
right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, which is absolute.  This seems 
to me to be the equivalent of the right to freedom of religion guaranteed by s.2(a) of 
the Canadian Charter, which was in issue in NS. 
 
39. But the second, the right to manifest religion or belief, is a qualified right, which 
by  virtue  of  art.  9(2)  may  be  balanced  against  the  public  interest  in  public  safety, 
public order, health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others: 
as long as any limitation is prescribed by law, necessary in a democratic society, and 
proportionate.    The  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  others  include,  in  my 
judgment,  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  persons  who  come  before  the  court  as 
complainants,  witnesses  and  jurors;  and  of  the  public  insofar  as  the  public  has  an 
interest  in  the  fair  administration  of  criminal  justice  by  the  Crown  Court.  In  Refah 
Partisi (The Welfare Party) v. Turkey (2003) 37 EHRR 1, [92] the Grand Chamber of 
the European Court of Human Rights (‘ECHR’) said: 
 

The Court’s established case law confirms this function of the State [to ensure 
tolerance between religious groups].  It was held that in a democratic society 
the State may limit the freedom to manifest a religion, for example by wearing 
an Islamic headscarf, if the exercise of that freedom clashes with the aim of 
protecting the rights and freedoms of others, public order and public safety … 
 
While  freedom  of  religion  is  in  the  first  place  a  matter  of  individual 
conscience, it also implies a freedom to manifest one’s religion alone and in 
private or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those 
whose faith one shares.  Article 9 lists a number of forms and manifestations 
which manifestation of a religious belief may take, namely worship, teaching, 
practice and observance.  Nevertheless, it does not protect every act motivated 
or influenced by a religion or belief …The obligation for a teacher to observe 
normal working hours which, he asserts, clash with his attendance at prayers, 
may be compatible with the freedom of religion … as may be the obligation 
requiring  a  motorcyclist  to  wear  a  crash  helmet,  which  in  his  view  is 
incompatible with his religious duties. 

 
40.  Following  this  general  principle,  the  ECHR  has  upheld  necessary  and 
proportionate restrictions on the manifestation of religion or belief in connection with

an employee’s obligations in the workplace: Kosteski v. Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia  (2007)  45  EHRR  712  (no  breach  of  art.  9  involved  in  employer  fining 
employee for unauthorised taking time off work to attend prayers); in the context of 
education:  Dahlab  v.  Switzerland  (App.  42393/98)  Decision  of  15  February  2001, 
ECHR 2001-V (proper to order teacher not to wear Islamic headscarf while teaching, 
to protect religious neutrality in schools); and Leyla Şahin v. Turkey (2007) 44 EHRR 
99 (proper to forbid wearing Islamic Headscarf in University to protect principle of 
secularism in higher education); the armed forces: Kalaç v. Turkey (1999) 27 EHRR 
552 (officer’s expression of religious views lawfully restrained to support government 
policy  of  secularism  in  the  armed  forces);  and  the  professional  sphere:  Pichon  and 
Sajous  v.  France  (App.  49853/99,  Decision  of  2  October  2001,  ECHR-2001-X  (no 
violation in prosecuting pharmacists for refusing to honour legal obligation to supply 
contraceptives). 
 
41.  I have been unable to detect any difference of principle between the decisions of 
the ECHR and those of the courts of England and Wales with respect to the right of 
manifestation  of  religion.  In  R  v.  Headteacher  and  Governors  of  Denbigh  High 
School [2006] UKHL 15, the House of Lords held that no violation occurred when a 
Muslim  schoolgirl  was  required  to  wear  a  form  of  school  uniform  which  had  been 
approved for girls of all religions after extensive consultation within the community.  
The girl, or her guardian, could have chosen another school where the uniform was 
not required, and there were important interests in promoting equality and preventing 
discrimination which supported the adoption of the uniform.  Lord Hoffman said (at 
[63]): 
 

In  applying  the  Convention  rights  which  have  been  reproduced  as  part  of 
domestic  law  by  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998,  the  concept  of  the  margin  of 
appreciation  has,  as  such,  no  application.  It  is  for  the  courts  of  the  United 
Kingdom to decide how the area of judgment allowed by that margin should 
be  distributed  between  the  legislative,  executive  and  judicial  branches  of 
government.  As  Lord  Hope  of  Craighead  said  in  R  v  Director  of  Public 
Prosecutions, Ex p Kebilene [2000] 2 AC 326, 380-381:  
 

The  doctrine  of  the  'margin  of  appreciation'  is  a  familiar  part  of  the 
jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. The European 
Court has acknowledged that, by reason of their direct and continuous 
contact with the vital forces of their countries, the national authorities 
are  in  principle  better  placed  to  evaluate  local  needs  and  conditions

--------
than  an  international  court…  This  technique  is  not  available  to  the 
national  courts  when  they  are  considering  Convention  issues  arising 
within their own countries. But in the hands of the national courts also 
the  Convention  should  be  seen  as  an  expression  of  fundamental 
principles rather than as a set of mere rules. The questions which the 
courts  will  have  to  decide  in  the  application  of  these  principles  will 
involve questions of balance between competing interests and issues of 
proportionality. 

 
42.  Several cases arising in the UK were decided by the ECHR in Eweida and Others 
v.  UK  (2013)  57  EHRR  37.    In  the  Eweida  case,  the  applicant,  a  Christian,  was 
dismissed by British Airways (BA) for wearing a small silver cross in such a way as 
to be visible to members of the public with whom she dealt on behalf of her employer, 
in contravention of the employer’s dress code for employees, and after she had been 
repeatedly admonished about it.  The Court of Appeal ([2010] EWCA Civ 80) upheld 
the  employment  tribunal  and  found  in  BA’s  favour  on  the  ground  that:  as  the 
regulation was applicable to those of all religious faiths alike; and as the applicant had 
no religious obligation to wear the cross, the restriction did not violate the applicant’s 
rights under art. 9.  But the ECHR held that the Court had given undue emphasis to 
BA’s commercial interests – there was no  evidence of any harm done to BA’s brand 
or  image  -  and  had  not  sufficiently  balanced  and  protected  the  applicant’s  right  to 
manifest her religion or belief under art. 9.   
 
43.  But  in  another  case  heard  at  the  same  time,  the  ECHR  came  to  a  different 
conclusion  on  similar  facts.    In  Chaplin  v.  Royal  Devon  and  Exeter  Hospital  NHS 
Foundation Trust ([2010] ET 1702886/2009) it was held proper to restrict a nursing 
sister from wearing a cross over her uniform on safety grounds, namely that it was 
liable  to  seized  by  a  patient  during  her  nursing  duties.    In  other  cases  heard  at  the 
same time, the EHCR also dismissed applications based on the applicant’s refusal, on 
religious  grounds,  to  conduct  civil  partnership  ceremonies  as  a  registrar  (London 
Borough  of  Islington  v.  Ladele);  and  the  applicant’s  refusal  as  a  psychological 
counselor  to  offer  counseling  to  same-sex  couples  (McFarlane  v.  Relate  Avon  Ltd 
[2009]  UKEAT  0106  69  3011).    In  these  cases,  the  ECHR  found  that  the  UK  was 
entitled  to  a  margin  of  appreciation  to  uphold  its  laws  made  by  a  democratically 
elected Parliament and that no violation of art. 9 had occurred. 
 

 

18
--------
44. While the decisions in these cases arose from laws made by the legislative branch 
of government, there is no reason to suppose that different principles are to apply to 
the case where a Court makes an order which affects an art. 9 right, and I proceed on 
that assumption.  I also hold that if necessary and proportionate restrictions may be 
imposed on art. 9 right in the workplace, in schools, and in the armed forces, there can 
be no objection in principle to restrictions being placed on that right in the Courts, if 
the legal requirements for the restriction are present. 
 
45.  Restrictions on the qualified right of religious manifestation may not be imposed 
arbitrarily, but must conform to art. 9(2).  They must satisfy four legal requirements, 
which are as follows. 
 
46. First, the restriction must have an established basis in law.  This basis may derive 
from common law or statute, but must be accessible to the defendant in the sense that 
the law has been promulgated and is available to the defendant.  See Sunday Times v. 
UK (1979-1980) 2 EHRR 245 at [47]; Silver v. UK (1983) 5 EHRR 347.   Ms. Meek 
rightly draws attention to the way it was put in the former case, namely: that a person 
‘must  be  able  –  if  need  be  with  appropriate  advice  –  to  foresee  to  a  degree  that  is 
reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail’. 
 
47.  Second,  the  restriction  must  be  legitimate.    A  restriction  is  legitimate  if  it 
genuinely pursues one of the aims set out in art. 9 (2) itself, which are the protection 
of  national  security,  public  safety,  the  prevention  of  disorder  and  crime,  and  the 
protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  The Court must be clear about its 
objective, so that it can balance it against the proposed restriction on the defendant’s 
qualified right of manifestation of religion or belief.  The fair and effective operation 
of the criminal courts, which act in the interests of victims of crime and the public 
generally, is in my view both an important vehicle for the prevention of disorder and 
crime,  and  an  important  vehicle  for  the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedom  of 
persons including the victims of crime, and the public at large.  The aim must be to 
allow the Court to function fairly and effectively in those interests.  
 
48.  Third,  the  restriction  must  be  necessary  in  a  democratic  society.    The  word 
‘necessary’ is not precisely defined, but it has been held must be more than ‘useful’, 

 

19
--------
‘reasonable’,  or  ‘desirable’.    At  the  same  time  it  does  not  mean  ‘indispensable’: 
Handyside v. UK (1976) 1 EHRR 737, at [48].  Similar observations can be found in 
the  analogous  case  of  the  journalistic  privilege  under    art.10  of  the  Convention, 
enacted in English law in the same terms by Contempt of Court Act 1981, s.10, by 
virtue of which disclosure of sources may be order only if ‘necessary in the interests 
of justice …’  Considering the meaning of ‘necessary’ in this context, the House of 
Lords  in  Re  an  Inquiry  under  the  Company  Securities  (Insider  Dealing)  Act  1985 
[1988]  AC  660,  held  that  it  requires  more  than  relevance  to  the  case,  and  falls 
somewhere between ‘indispensable’ and ‘useful’ or ‘expedient’. Lord Griffiths said 
that  it  means  ‘really  needed’  [id.  At  704].    I  confess,  with  respect,  to  finding  this 
rather circular guidance not particularly helpful.  
 
49.  Fourth,  the  restriction  must  be  proportionate  in  the  sense  that  there  must  be  a 
rational connection between the objective and the restriction; and the means employed 
are  not  more  than  is  necessary  to  achieve  the  objective.    The  Court  must  consider 
whether there is a less restrictive, but equally effective way of achieving the objective.   
 
50.  Thus  far,  as  far  as  my  researches  go,  no  court  in  England  and  Wales  has 
considered  how  these  principles  should  apply  to  the  specific  case  of  the  defendant 
who wishes to wear a niqaab in the Crown Court.  But the Supreme Court of Canada 
has  considered  the  position  of  a  prosecution  witness,  and  some  valuable  assistance 
can be derived from this case. 
 

 

R v. NS, 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726 (Supreme Court of Canada) 

 
51. In this case, NS was the complainant in a criminal case of sexual assault.  NS was 
a Muslim, and indicated that for religious reasons she wished to testify while wearing 
her  niqaab.  The  preliminary  inquiry  judge  held  a  voir  dire,  concluded  that  NS’s 
religious belief was ‘not that strong’ and ordered her to remove her niqaab. On appeal, 
the Court of Appeal held that if the witness’s freedom of religion and the accused’s 
fair  trial  interests  were  both  engaged  on  the  facts  and  could  not  be  reconciled,  the 
witness may be ordered to remove the niqaab, depending on the context. The Court of 
Appeal  returned  the  matter  to  the  preliminary  inquiry  judge.  NS  appealed.    The 

 

20
--------
majority (McLachlin C.J.,Deschamps, Fish and Cromwell JJ) allowed the appeal. The 
following  summary  of  the  majority  view  is  taken  from  the  headnote,  which  I  find, 
accurately reflects the majority opinion, paragraphs [1] – [57], written by McLachlin 
CJ: 
 

The issue is when, if ever, a witness who wears a niqaab for religious reasons 
can be required to remove it while testifying. Two sets of Charter rights are 
potentially engaged — the witness’s freedom of religion and the accused’s fair 
trial rights, including the right to make full answer and defence. An extreme 
approach that would always require the witness to remove her niqaab while 
testifying, or one that would never do so, is untenable. The answer lies in a 
just and proportionate balance between freedom of religion and trial fairness, 
based  on  the  particular  case  before  the  court.  A  witness  who  for  sincere 
religious  reasons  wishes  to  wear  the  niqaab  while  testifying  in  a  criminal 
proceeding will be required to remove it if (a) this is necessary to prevent a 
serious risk to the fairness of the trial, because reasonably available alternative 
measures will not prevent the risk; and (b) the salutary effects of requiring her 
to remove the niqaab outweigh the deleterious effects of doing so. 
 
Applying  this  framework  involves  answering  four  questions.  First,  would 
requiring the witness to remove the niqaab while testifying interfere with her 
religious freedom?  … 
 
The second question is: would permitting the witness to wear the niqaab while 
testifying  create  a  serious  risk  to  trial  fairness?  There  is  a  deeply  rooted 
presumption in our legal system that seeing a witness’s face is important to a 
fair trial, by enabling effective cross-examination and credibility assessment. 
The  record  before  us  has  not  shown  this  presumption  to  be  unfounded  or 
erroneous. However, whether being unable to see the witness’s face threatens 
trial  fairness  in  any  particular  case  will  depend  on  the  evidence  that  the 
witness is to provide. Where evidence is uncontested, credibility assessment 
and  cross-examination  are  not  in  issue.  Therefore,  being  unable  to  see  the 
witness’s face will not impinge on trial fairness. If wearing the niqaab poses 
no  serious  risk  to  trial  fairness,  a  witness  who  wishes  to  wear  it  for  sincere 
religious reasons may do so. 
 
If both freedom of religion and trial fairness are engaged on the facts, a third 
question  must  be  answered:  is  there  a  way  to  accommodate  both  rights  and 
avoid the conflict between them? The judge must consider whether there are 
reasonably available alternative measures that would conform to the witness’s 
religious convictions while still preventing a serious risk to trial fairness. 
 
If no accommodation is possible, then a fourth question must be answered: do 
the salutary effects of requiring the witness to remove the niqaab outweigh the 
deleterious effects of doing so? Deleterious effects include the harm done by 
limiting  the  witness’s  sincerely  held  religious  practice.  The  judge  should 
consider the importance of the religious practice to the witness, the degree of 
state interference with that practice, and the actual situation in the courtroom 

21
--------
— such as the people present and any measures to limit facial exposure. The 
judge  should  also  consider  broader  societal  harms,  such  as  discouraging 
niqaab-wearing women from reporting offences and participating in the justice 
system. These deleterious effects must be weighed against the salutary effects 
of  requiring  the  witness  to  remove  the  niqaab.  Salutary  effects  include 
preventing harm to the fair trial interest of the accused and safeguarding the 
repute of the administration of justice.  

 
52.  While the approach taken by the majority is in some ways persuasive with respect 
to witnesses, it must be applied with caution to the case before me, for reasons I have 
mentioned previously but now repeat because of their importance.  First, the case is 
that of a prosecution witness, and while a defendant may be a witness, she is before 
the  case  on  a  very  different  basis  and  occupies  a  more  significant  role  in  the  trial.  
Second, the majority’s analysis clearly treats the right to freedom of religion under 
s.2(a)  of  the  Canadian  Charter  in  a  manner  which  corresponds  to  the  freedom  of 
thought, conscience and religion under art. 9(1) of the Convention.  On this approach, 
for the purpose of balancing the right against any  proposed limitation of the right, far 
greater weight must given to the right of freedom of religion, compared to balancing 
involving the right of manifestation of religion or belief under art. 9(2).  Indeed, the 
Court  seems  to  treat  it  as  equivalent  to  the  right  to  a  fair  trial.    For  those  reasons, 
while  the  majority  opinion  offers  valuable  guidance,  I  do  not  think  that  it  can  be 
applied directly to the present case. 
 
53. But in a separate concurring opinion, LeBel and Rothstein JJ [id. [58] – [79]] state 
some  propositions  which  seem  to  me,  not  only  to  be  correct,  but  to  be  capable  of 
direct application to the question of whether a defendant is to be permitted to wear the 
niqaab  during  criminal  proceedings.    Once  again,  I  cite  from  the  headnote,  finding 
that it accurately reflects the opinion. 

 
This appeal illustrates the tension and changes caused by the rapid evolution of 
contemporary Canadian society and by the growing presence in Canada of new 
cultures, religions, traditions and social practices. This case is not purely one of 
conflict and reconciliation between a religious right and the protection of the right 
of the accused to make full answer and defence, but engages basic values of the 
Canadian  criminal  justice  system.  The  Charter  protects  freedom  of  religion  in 
express words at s. 2(a). But fundamental too are the rights of the accused to a 
fair trial, to make full answer and defence to the charges brought against him, to 
benefit from the constitutional presumption of  innocence and to avert wrongful 
convictions.  Since  cross-examination  is  a  necessary  tool  for  the  exercise  of  the 
right  to  make  full  answer  and  defence,  the  consequences  of  restrictions  on  that 

 

22
--------
right weigh more heavily on the accused, and the balancing process must work in 
his  or  her  favour.  A  defence  that  is  unduly  and  improperly  constrained  might 
impact on the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. 
 
The  Constitution  requires  an  openness  to  new  differences  that  appear  within 
Canada, but also an acceptance of the principle that it remains connected with the 
roots of our contemporary democratic society. A system of open and independent 
courts is a core component of a democratic state, ruled by law and a fundamental 
Canadian value. From this broader constitutional perspective, the trial becomes an 
act of communication with the public at large. The public must be able to see how 
the justice system works. Wearing a niqaab in the courtroom does not facilitate 
acts of communication. Rather, it shields the witness from interacting fully with 
the  parties,  their  counsel,  the  judge  and  the  jurors.  Wearing  the  niqaab  is  also 
incompatible  with  the  rights  of  the  accused,  the  nature  of  the  Canadian  public 
adversarial  trials,  and  with  the  constitutional  values  of  openness  and  religious 
neutrality in contemporary democratic, but diverse, Canada. Nor should wearing a 
niqaab be dependent on the nature or importance of the evidence, as this would 
only add a new layer of complexity to the trial process. A clear rule that niqaabs 
may not be worn at any stage of the criminal trial would be consistent with the 
principle of public openness of the trial process and would safeguard the integrity 
of that process as one of communication. 

 
54. In addition, I cite the following paragraphs from the opinion. 
 

take  part 

in 

limited  mobility, 

[76]  From  this  broader  constitutional  perspective,  the  trial  becomes  an  act  of 
communication with the public at large. The public must be able to see how the 
justice system works. The principle of openness ensures that the courts and the 
trial process belong to all regardless of religion, gender or origin.  
 
[77] In the courts themselves … the trial is a process of communication. To 
facilitate  this  process,  the  justice  system  uses  rules  and  methods  that  try  to 
assist parties that struggle with handicaps to overcome them in order to gain 
access to justice and take part effectively in a trial. Blind or deaf litigants, and 
parties  with 
judicial  proceedings. 
Communication may sometimes be more difficult. But the efforts to overcome 
these  obstacles  and  the  rules  crafted  to  address  them  tend  to  improve  the 
quality of the communication process. Wearing a niqaab, on the other hand, 
does not facilitate acts of communication. Rather, it restricts them. It removes 
the witness from the scope of certain elements of those acts on the basis of the 
assertion  of  a  religious  belief  in  circumstances  in  which  the  sincerity  and 
strength  of  the  belief  are  difficult  to  assess  or  even  to  question.  The  niqaab 
shields  the  witness  from  interacting  fully  with  the  parties,  their  counsel,  the 
judge and, where applicable, the jurors.  
 
[78] A clear rule that niqaabs may not be worn would be consistent with the 
principle of openness of the trial process and would safeguard the integrity of 
that  process  as  one  of  communication.  It  would  also  be  consistent  with  the 
tradition that justice is public and open to all in our democratic society. This 
rule should apply at all stages of the criminal trial, at the preliminary inquiry 
as well as at the trial itself. Indeed, evidentiary issues arise and evolve at the 

 

23
--------
different  stages  of  the  criminal  process,  and  they  affect  the  conduct  of  the 
communication process taking place during the trial.  

 
55. These principles were laid down in the context of Canadian law and practice but I 
find them persuasive in the context of the defendant in the Crown Court in England 
and Wales.  In my view, LeBell and Rothstein JJ have stated the underlying principles 
in  a  way  which  would  be  hard  to  improve  on.    I  must  now  consider  how  those 
principles are to be applied to the law of England and Wales, taking into account art. 9 
of the Convention. 

 

Analysis 

 
56. For several centuries the criminal courts in England and Wales have relied on the 
process of adversarial trial in open court.  That process has evolved and changed over 
time, and may not always have functioned as effectively or as fairly as it does today.  
But today, the courts rely on this process to uphold the rule of law, to provide a trial 
which is fair to all parties, and to allow the highest possible degree of openness and 
transparency.  The  adversarial  trial  as  used  in  England  and  Wales  has  never  been 
impugned on the ground of its fairness or its ability to uphold the rule of law in any 
case, either domestic or before the ECHR.  Nor can anyone deny its pivotal role in the 
administration of justice in England and Wales. 
 
57.  It must not be forgotten that the defendant is not the only person whose rights and 
freedoms are engaged by criminal proceedings.  There are also victims.  In the present 
case, there is a complainant, who claims to be the victim of witness intimidation, and 
who is also entitled to a fair determination of his allegations. It is the task of the Court 
to  ensure  that  he  receives  that  fair  determination.    There  are  also  jurors.    Twelve 
members of the public will take an onerous oath or affirmation as jurors to faithfully 
try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence.   It is the task of 
the  Court  to  provide  conditions  under  which  they  can  discharge  that  important 
function.  There is also the public. In a democratic society, the public has a strong 
interest in criminal proceedings being conducted fairly and effectively in the interests 
of public order and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  It is the task 
of the Court to ensure that the public’s interest is protected. 

 

24
--------
58.  In my judgment, the adversarial trial demands full openness and communication, 
and, like LeBel and Rothstein JJ, I am firmly convinced that the wearing of the niqaab 
necessarily hinders that openness and communication.  A criminal trial in the Crown 
Court is, by definition, a serious matter.  It has the potential to change lives – not only 
that of the defendant, but also that of victims, witnesses and even jurors.  The rights of 
all  participants  in  the  trial  must  be  considered.    I  accept  that  a  rule  prohibiting  the 
wearing of the niqaab in court at any stage would cause a defendant some degree of 
discomfort.  That is a matter which cannot be overlooked.  The court may, however, 
be able to mitigate that sense of discomfort in some ways, for example by forbidding 
the making or dissemination of images of the defendant in court, a minor but justified 
restriction  on  the  freedom  of  the  press,  and  by  using  its  inherent  powers  to  permit 
some limited special measures. 
 
59.  On the other hand, there is the question of the comfort – and beyond comfort, the 
rights  and  freedoms  -  of  others  whose  participation  in  the  trial  is  essential.    In  my 
view,  it  is  unfair  to  ask  a  witness  to  give  evidence  against  a  defendant  whom  he 
cannot see.  It is unfair to ask a juror to pass judgment on a person whom she cannot 
see.  It is unfair to expect that juror to try to evaluate the evidence given by a person 
whom she cannot see, deprived of an essential tool for doing so: namely, being able to 
observe the demeanour of the witness; her reaction to being questioned; her reaction 
to other evidence as it is given. These are not trivial or superficial invasions of the 
procedure of the adversarial trial.  At best, they require a compromise of the quality of 
criminal justice delivered by the trial process.  At worst, they go to its very essence, 
and they may render it altogether impotent to deliver a fair and just outcome.  They 
drive a coach and horses through the way in which justice has been administered in 
the courts of England and Wales for centuries. I would add that, although of lesser 
significance in the case of a judge, it is also unfair to require a judge to sentence a 
person he cannot see.   
 
60.  The  question  of  the  identification  of  the  defendant  when  she  comes  before  the 
Court,  which  was  the  immediate  catalyst  for  this  judgment,  is  a  microcosm  of  the 
problems which may arise from compromising the Court’s procedure.  The Court has 
to be as sure as it can be that the person who enters a plea, and who is to be tried and 

 

25
--------
perhaps  sentenced  is  the  person  named  in  the  indictment.    As  I  indicated  above,  I 
found that the evidence of P.C. Hughes was sufficient to identify D for the purposes 
of  the  plea  and  case  management  hearing.    But  there  may  be  cases  in  which  such 
evidence is not sufficient, for example where visual identification is an issue in the 
trial.  Ms. Wilkinson agreed that the Court would have to take a different view in that 
case.  Moreover, the Court must be conscious that it cannot apply the law differently 
on the basis of religion.  The Court may not discriminate between different religious 
traditions,  or  between  those  with  a  religious  belief  and  those  with  none.      If  D  is 
entitled to keep her face covered, it becomes impossible for the Court to refuse the 
same privilege to others, whether or not they hold the same or another religious belief, 
or none at all. 
 
61. There is a disturbing sub-text in this case. It seems to be suggested, in effect, that 
the mere assertion of the right to wear the niqaab deprives the Court of control over its 
own  procedure.    In  argument,  Ms.  Meek  suggested  that  D  is  entitled  to  wear  the 
niqaab in public or in private at all times, and the Court must simply find a way to 
accommodate that right.  In her written submission, Ms. Meek says that, if ordered to 
remove her niqaab in the court room in front of men and in public, ‘[D] will be upset 
and is likely to use her hands to cover her face, turn away, or look down’. How is the 
Court to respond to that?   
 
62. It must be conceded that it is impossible in practice to compel a defendant who 
does  not  wish  to  cooperate  with  the  Court  to  do  so  at  all  times.    For  example,  a 
defendant may fail to appear for his trial, or may abscond during trial.  A defendant in 
custody may refuse to leave his cell to come up to court.  Any defendant may behave 
in such an obstructive or disruptive way that the judge is forced to have him removed 
from court.  In such circumstances, the Court must continue, but must give the jury a 
careful  direction  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  does  not  mean  that  he  is  guilty,  and 
does not support the prosecution’s case against him, and the judge must ensure, as far 
as possible, that the jury is not prejudiced against him because of his conduct.  The 
defendant’s conduct in keeping her face covered, though not intended as any form of 
misconduct, is analogous to these situations.  It impedes the work of the Court, and it 
must be addressed by means of an appropriate direction by the judge.  
 

 

26
--------
63.  The  jurisdiction  of  England  and  Wales  is  essentially  (though  not  formally)  a 
secular democracy.  I recognise that the jurisdiction is in the rather odd position that 
part of it (England) has an established church, while the other part (Wales) does not.  
But in neither part does the church interfere with the working of the courts.  I do not 
for  a  moment  suggest,  to  borrow  language  used  in  NS,  that  courts  should  be  a 
religion-free zone where religious beliefs and practices must be parked at the door of 
the court.  On the contrary, the Courts must respect and protect religious rights as far 
as that can properly be done.  But in my view, it is necessary to the working of the 
Crown Court in a democratic society for the Court, not the defendant, to control the 
conduct of judicial proceedings. A defendant cannot, by claiming to adopt a particular 
religious  practice,  oblige  the  court  to  set  aside  its  established  procedure  to 
accommodate  that  practice.    That  would  be  to  privilege  religious  practice  in  a 
discriminatory way, and would adversely affect the administration of justice. 
 
64.  Ultimately, it seems to me that Court must be entitled to place some restriction on 
art.  9  right  if  it  reaches  the  point  where  the  unrestrained  exercise  of  that  right 
interferes to an unacceptable degree with the Court’s ability to conduct a trial which is 
fair to all parties.  I am unable to accept the proposition that the Court is powerless to 
protect its proceedings from unfairness merely because a defendant asserts an art. 9 
right. 
 
65.  As Ms. Meek points out, unlike an employee, or even a witness, a defendant does 
not have the ability to choose whether or not to appear before the Crown Court.  Nor 
is she free to approach another location of the Court to explore whether the judges 
there may take a different view.  But she is free to make choices in the context of the 
trial,  including  the  choice  of  how  to  dress  for  court,  and  whether  or  not  to  give 
evidence.  In the Denbigh High School case, at [22], Lord Bingham noted: 

As the Strasbourg court put it in Kalaç v Turkey (1997) 27 EHRR 552, para 27: 
 

“Article  9  does  not  protect  every  act  motivated  or  inspired  by  a  religion  or 
belief.  Moreover,  in  exercising  his  freedom  to  manifest  his  religion,  an 
individual may need to take his specific situation into account.” 
 
The Grand Chamber endorsed this paragraph in Sahin v Turkey, (Application No 
44774/98, 10 November 2005, unreported), para 105. 
 

 

27
--------
The Commission ruled to similar effect in Ahmad v United Kingdom (1981) 4 
EHRR 126, para 11: 

 

“. . . the freedom of religion, as guaranteed by Article 9, is not absolute, but 
subject to the limitations set out in Article 9(2). Moreover, it may, as regards 
the  modality  of  a  particular  religious  manifestation,  be  influenced  by  the 
situation of the person claiming that freedom.” 

 
66.    But,  having  said  that,  I  remind  myself  of  the  importance  of  honouring  a 
defendant’s right under art. 9 to dress, in general, in such manner as she wishes in 
accordance with her religious beliefs; and of the discomfort she may suffer if she is 
not permitted to wear the niqaab.   
 
67.  I also recognise the intrinsic merit which the niqaab has in the eyes of women 
who  wear  it.    I  reject  the  view,  which  has  its  adherents  among  the  public  and  the 
press,  that  the  niqaab  is  somehow  incompatible  with  participation  in  public  life  in 
England and Wales; or is nothing more than a form of abuse, imposed under the guise 
of religion, on women by men.  There may be individual cases where that is true. But 
the niqaab is worn by choice by many spiritually-minded, thoughtful and intelligent 
women, who do not deserve to be demeaned by superficial and uninformed criticisms 
of their choice.  The Court must consider the potential positive benefits of the niqaab.  
As Baroness Hale said in the Denbigh High School case (above, at [94-[95]): 
 

If  a  Sikh  man  wears  a  turban  or  a  Jewish  man  a  yamoulka,  we  can  readily 
assume that it was his free choice to adopt the dress dictated by the teachings 
of  his  religion.  I  would  make  the  same  assumption  about  an  adult  Muslim 
woman who chooses to wear the Islamic headscarf. There are many reasons 
why  she  might  wish  to  do  this.  As  Yasmin  Alibhai-Brown  (WHO  do  WE 
THINK we ARE?, (2000), p 246) explains: 
 
“What critics of Islam fail to understand is that when they see a young woman 
in a hijab she may have chosen the garment as a mark of her defiant political 
identity and also as a way of regaining control over her body.” 
 
Bhikhu Parekh makes the same point (in “A Varied Moral World, A Response 
to  Susan  Okin’s  ‘Is  Multiculturalism  Bad  for  Women’”,  Boston  Review, 
October/November 1997): 
 
“In  France  and  the  Netherlands  several  Muslim  girls  freely  wore  the  hijab 
(headscarf), partly to reassure their conservative parents that they would not be 
corrupted by the public culture of the school, and partly to reshape the latter 
by indicating to white boys how they wished to be treated. The hijab in their 

28
--------
case was a highly complex autonomous act intended to use the resources of 
the tradition both to change and to preserve it.” 
 
… 
 
But it must be the woman's choice, not something imposed upon her by others. 
It is quite clear from the evidence in this case that there are different views in 
different communities about what is required of a Muslim woman who leaves 
the privacy of her home and family and goes out into the public world …  
 

 
68.    The  question  is  how  these  considerations  should  be  balanced.    Leaving  aside 
questions of identification, I do not consider that it is necessary to ask a defendant to 
remove her niqaab for the purposes of the trial generally.  While it remains true that 
juries scrutinise defendants throughout the proceedings, and take note of a defendant’s 
reaction to the evidence as it is given throughout the trial, I am not persuaded that this 
is of sufficient importance to require a restriction on the defendant’s right to wear the 
niqaab.   
 
69.  But the question of the defendant’s evidence, if she gives evidence, is a different 
matter.  For the reasons given earlier in this judgment, the ability of the jury to see the 
defendant for the purposes of evaluating her evidence is crucial.  There is an obvious 
possibility that a rule that the niqaab must not be worn would inhibit some defendants 
from  giving  evidence  in  their  defence,  or  would  make  the  giving  of  evidence  an 
uncomfortable  experience.  Ms.  Meek  rightly  emphasises  this  important  point.    The 
right to give evidence is a fundamental one, and it must be protected.  It is an essential 
component of the defendant’s right to a fair trial, both at Common Law and under art. 
6 of the Convention.  But Member States are free to give effect to that right within the 
framework  of  their  respective  legal  systems.    Article  6  does  not  prevent  the  Court 
from adopting a fair and proportionate procedural rule to prevent that right from being 
abused. 
 
70.  In my judgment, the right to give evidence must be seen in context.  When seen 
in context, it becomes clear that the right to give evidence involves a corresponding 
duty to submit that evidence to the scrutiny of the jury.  The jury has a duty to decide 
what evidence to accept, what evidence not to accept, and what weight to accord to 
any  particular  piece  of  evidence.    They  must  decide  what  evidence  is  credible  and 

 

29
--------
reliable,  and  what  is  not.    There  is  rarely,  if  ever,  a  case  in  which  a  defendant’s 
evidence could be described as unimportant or in which the defendant’s evidence is 
not challenged.  Very often, that evidence plays a decisive part in the jury’s decision; 
it  always  plays  an  important  role.    I  dealt  earlier  in  this  judgment  with  the  pivotal 
requirement that the jury must be able to see the witness.  It is no accident that our 
appellate  reports  are  replete  with  observations  that  the  jury,  or  judge,  ‘had  the 
advantage of seeing as well as hearing the witnesses’.  That is a recognition of the fact 
that, as Macur J said in SL v. MJ, ‘the ability to observe a witness’ demeanour and 
deportment  during  the  giving  of  evidence  is  important  and  …  essential  to  assess 
accuracy and credibility’. This process is a fundamental and necessary attribute of the 
adversarial trial, and if it is taken away, the ability of the jury to return a true verdict 
in accordance with the evidence is necessarily compromised.  

 

71.  In other areas of public life, accommodations are routinely found.  For example, 
if a woman wearing a niqaab presents herself at the security check point at an airport, 
or  has  to  be  photographed  to  obtain  a  passport  or  a  driving  licence,  the  necessary 
procedures  can  be  complied  with  privately,  presided  over  by  female  officials.    The 
same accommodation cannot be made at the Crown Court, both because the rule of 
law is engaged, and because to do so might well involve a disproportionate allocation 
of court resources.  For example, a claim to be tried before a female judge and jurors, 
with female court staff, and excluding males from the public gallery would probably 
constitute  an  unlawful  discrimination  against  male  judges,  jurors,  court  staff  and 
members of the public and the press; it would also represent a huge disruption of the 
court’s administration.  I hasten to add that D has made no such claim in this case, but 
it is necessary for the Court to try to foresee the consequences of any rule of law it 
may adopt. 
 
72. There will inevitably be occasions when the manifestation of a person’s religion 
or belief comes into potential conflict with the demands of court proceedings.  In most 
cases, these conflicts are easily resolved: for example, witnesses and jurors may be 
sworn on a book appropriate to their beliefs (or may make a secular affirmation); a 
juror’s wish to observe a religious festival during which the Court is sitting is often 
accommodated;  advocates  are  often  permitted  to  wear  a  turban  or  full  length  dress 
while  appearing  professionally  in  court.    These  accommodations  do  not  affect  the 

 

30
--------
proper  functioning  of  the  Court,  and  are  proper  in  an  age  when  the  Court  serves  a 
pluralist, multi-cultural society.  But in cases where such conflicts cannot be resolved, 
the Court must balance the right of manifestation of religion against the interests of 
justice in securing a fair trial for all the participants and the strong public interest in 
the proper administration of criminal justice.  Although D claims a right to wear the 
niqaab  in  court,  I  note  that  the  derogations  from  the  principles  of  open  justice  and 
adversarial trial to which I referred earlier – for example, hearsay evidence, special 
measures,  and  anonymous  witnesses  –  would  not  be  permitted  in  the  absence  of 
specific statutory provisions.  There is no statutory provision regarding niqaabs, and it 
is at least arguable that wearing the niqaab cannot be permitted in law to the extent 
that it derogates from those principles. 
 
73.    It  is  rare  for  the  defendant’s  manner  of  dress  to  be  an  issue  in  the  conduct  of 
judicial business.  Today, the Courts are rightly tolerant of informality or diversity of 
dress on the part of defendants, witnesses, and jurors.  But a defendant’s dress may 
become an issue.  For example, the defendant’s choice of dress may invoke the rules 
of  bad  character  evidence  if,  unless  corrected,  it  would  give  the  jury  a  false 
impression, for example if the defendant appears at court wearing a clerical collar or 
military uniform: see Criminal Justice Act 2003, s.101(1)(f). If a defendant were to 
appear  wearing  a  t-shirt  with  an  obscene,  racist,  or  offensive  logo,  it  cannot  be 
doubted  that  the  Court  would  be  entitled  to  take  steps  to  protect  the  dignity  of  the 
proceedings.  And it the defendant’s dress interferes to an unacceptable degree with 
the  Court’s  ability  to  conduct  a  trial  which  is  fair  to  all  parties,  the  Court  may 
similarly  have  to  take  action  to  ensure  that  the  trial  can  proceed  in  the  manner 
prescribed by law, and is fair to all parties. 
 
74.  While  any  restriction  on  the  defendant’s  right  to  give  evidence  is  a  serious 
measure, and one to be taken only when really necessary, the principle of imposing 
such a restriction is not unknown, and indeed can be found in contemporary practice 
as far back as the notice of alibi provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967.  I regard 
such a measure in the circumstances of this case, not as infringing the right to give 
evidence, but as protecting it from abuse. 
 

 

31
--------
75.    I  now  consider  the  four  questions  I  must  ask  before  deciding  whether  some 
restriction on D’s general right to wear the niqaab should be imposed for the purpose 
of trial in the Crown Court. 

 

Basis in Law 

 
76. There is no legal restriction on the wearing of the niqaab anywhere in the United 
Kingdom.  Nor is there any statutory provision or rule of procedure in England and 
Wales which deals with the wearing of the niqaab in court.  Certain materials in the 
public domain, for example the Equal Treatment Bench Book, might lead a reader to 
suppose that there is at least a limited right to do so, at least in some courts.  But the 
Bench Book is not a source of law.  In my view, a reader who considers all relevant 
materials in the public domain about the practice of the Crown Court would be clear 
about the essential ingredients of an adversarial trial, to which I have referred above.  
Moreover, that reader would also be aware that a trial judge has an inherent power to 
regulate  the  conduct  of  proceedings  in  the  Crown  Court  in  order  to  ensure  that  no 
abuse of the Court occurs, and to ensure that the proceedings are fair to all parties.  
This principle of law, too, is in the public domain and available to D, as it is to the 
public generally.  It is a matter on which a person could receive accurate advice from 
any experienced solicitor.  For these reasons, I hold that there is a proper basis in law 
for restricting the wearing of the niqaab in court, but only if the other conditions are 
present. 
 

Legitimacy of Aim 

 
77.  As I have already observed, the Court must be clear about its objective, so that it 
can  balance  it  against  the  proposed  restriction  on  the  defendant’s  qualified  right  of 
manifestation of religion or belief.  The fair and effective operation of the criminal 
courts, which act in the interests of victims of crime and the public generally, is in my 
view  both  an  important  vehicle  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  and  crime,  and  an 
important vehicle for the protection of the rights and freedom of persons including the 
victims  of  crime,  and  the  public  at  large.    The  aim  must  be  to  allow  the  Court  to 
function fairly and effectively in those interests.  I conclude for this reason that the 

 

32
--------
aim  involved  in  restricting  the  right  to  wear  the  niqaab  on  this  limited  basis  is 
legitimate. 

 

Necessity in a Democratic Society 

 
78.  I  need  not  repeat  what  I  have  said  about  what  seem  to  me  to  be  the  essential 
components  of  an  adversarial  trial  and  the  centrality  of  the  adversarial  trial  in  the 
administration  of  justice  in  England  and  Wales  and,  through  the  administration  of 
justice, the protection of the rights and freedoms of victims of crime, and of the public 
at large.  Nor do I need to repeat what I have said about the adverse effect produced 
on the adversarial trial if a defendant wears the niqaab in court.  This is not just a 
question of a restriction being ‘useful’, ‘reasonable’ or ‘desirable’.  I conclude that 
some  restriction  of  the  right  of  a  defendant  to  wear  the  niqaab  during  proceedings 
against her in the Crown Court is necessary in a democratic society.  Balancing the 
right  of  religious  manifestation  against  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  public,  the 
press, and other interested parties such as the complainant in the proper administration 
of  justice,  the  latter  must  prevail  over  D’s  right  to  manifest  her  religion  or  belief 
during the proceedings against her to the extent necessary in the interests of justice.  
No tradition or practice, whether religious or otherwise, can claim to occupy such a 
privileged position that the rule of law, open justice, and the adversarial trial process 
are sacrificed to accommodate it.  That is not a discrimination against religion.  It is a 
matter of upholding the rule of law in a democratic society.   
 

Proportionality 

 
79.  But I must also consider whether the restriction is proportionate in the sense that 
there is a rational connection between the aim and the restriction; and that the means 
employed are no more than is necessary to achieve the aim.  As both counsel rightly 
submit,  the  Court  must  consider  whether  there  is  a  less  restrictive,  but  equally 
effective way of achieving the aim.  I must consider specifically whether the Court’s 
aim can be achieved by an approach other than removing the niqaab at all times.  That 
there is a rational connection between the aim and the restriction seems clear.  The 
restriction tends to maintain the quality and fairness of the trial process.  But is there a 
less restrictive approach which would be equally effective in promoting the aim?   

 

33
--------
Conclusion 

 
80.  I propose to adopt the least restrictive approach consistent with what I see as the 
necessity of enabling the Court to conduct the proceedings fairly and effectively in the 
interests  of  all  parties.  In  my  judgment,  the  following  principles  should  be  applied 
when a defendant in the Crown Court asserts the right to wear the niqaab during the 
proceedings. 
 
81. The question of identification must be dealt with in open court whenever it arises.  
The defendant should be asked to remove the niqaab for this purpose.  If she refuses 
to do so, the Court should adjourn briefly to allow an officer or other reliable female 
witness to examine the defendant’s face in private, and to give positive evidence of 
identification  in  open  court.    This  procedure  must  be  followed  on  every  occasion 
when identification is needed, especially before arraignment, the return of the verdict, 
and sentence, if the defendant is convicted.  There may be cases where this procedure 
is insufficient, and where the niqaab must be removed, for example when there is an 
issue of visual identification, or suspicion of impersonation. 
 
82. In general, the defendant is free to wear the niqaab during trial.  The judge should, 
nonetheless,  in  the  absence  of  the  jury,  advise  the  defendant  of  the  possible 
consequences of so doing, and make it clear that she will not be free to do so while 
giving evidence.  She should be invited to remove the niqaab during trial, and given 
time to reflect and take advice if she wishes to do so.  Again, if there is an issue of 
visual  identification  to  be  decided  by  the  jury,  it  may  necessary  to  order  that  the 
niqaab be removed, at least while evidence relevant to that issue is given.   
 
83.  If  the  defendant  gives  evidence,  she  must  remove  the  niqaab  throughout  her 
evidence.  The Court may use its inherent powers to do what it can to alleviate any 
discomfort,  for  example  by  allowing  the  use  of  screens  or  allowing  her  to  give 
evidence by live link.  Again, the judge should, in the absence of the jury, advise the 
defendant of the possible consequences of refusing to remove the niqaab.  She should 
be invited to remove the niqaab and given time to reflect and take advice if she wishes 

 

34
--------
to do so.  If she refuses, the judge should not allow her to give evidence, and must 
give  the  jury  a  clear  direction  in  the  terms  suggested  in  the  Bench  Book,  with 
appropriate modifications, about the defendant’s failure to give evidence. 
 
84. I recognise that particular circumstances may arise in other cases which may lead 
a judge, having considered the matters which must be considered, to make a different 
order.  I cannot, and do not attempt to enumerate such situations, but they may include 
cases in which the evidence is effectively agreed; or where the defendant’s evidence 
would be purely formal, or would not be challenged.  This must be a matter for the 
judge to decide on the facts of each case. 
 
85. Though I have made much use of the feminine form in this judgment, everything I 
have  said  is  to  be  taken  to  apply  to  male  defendants  in  equal  measure,  should  an 
analogous situation arise; and it applies alike to both male and female defendants of 
any, or no, religious faith. 
 

Directions 

 
86.  Accordingly,  before  this  plea  and  case  management  hearing  ends,  I  give  the 
following directions - 
 

(1) The defendant must comply with all directions given by the Court to enable 
her to be properly identified at any stage of the proceedings. 
 
(2) The defendant is free to wear the niqaab during trial, except while giving 
evidence.  
 
(3) The defendant may not give evidence wearing the niqaab.  
 
(4) The defendant may give evidence from behind a screen shielding her from 
public view, but not from the view of the judge, the jury, and counsel; or by 
mean of a live TV link.   
 

 

35
--------
(5)  Photographs and filming are never permitted in court.  But in this case, I 
also order that no drawing, sketch or other image of any kind of the defendant 
while  her  face  is  uncovered  be  made  in  court,  or  disseminated,  or  published 
outside court. 
 
(6) I reserve the case to myself until further order.

or, 

another 

indeed, 

 
I  have  had  the  matter  listed  before  me 
today  as  part  of  the  sentence,  not  that  part 
relating to sexual activity with a child, requires 
correcting.  It was not appreciated by the parties 
that  I  could  not  pass  a  community  order  with  a 
supervision  requirement  for  three  years  to  run 
alongside  a  suspended  sentence  on  the  same 
indictment, 
indictment, 
sentenced  on  the  same  occasion.  In  amending  the 
sentence, I sought to ensure that all parts of the 
order  will  be  complied  with  by  the  defendant  and 
that any breach will be brought before a court and 
consideration  given  to  further  penalty,  including 
immediate imprisonment. 
 
I  therefore  vary  the  original  sentence 
by  revoking  the  community  order  and  will  impose 
additional  terms  of  imprisonment,  suspended,  for 
Counts  3  and  4,  and  for  the  York  indictment,  six 
counts,  and  impose  a  supervision  requirement  for 
two  years  together  with,  as  before,  a  requirement 
that  you  attend  and  complete  a  sex  offender 
treatment  programme.  The  other  orders  remain  as

I  will  now  repeat  and  pass  sentence  on 

Neil  Wilson,  the  sentence  of  the  court 

before.  The  addition  of  the  suspended  sentences 
for  Count  3  and  4  is  commensurate  with  the 
reduction in the supervision element from three to 
two years. 
 
you, Neil Wilson.  You can remain seated. 
 
is therefore as follows. 
 
On  Count  2,  sexual  activity  with  a 
child, the sentence is eight months’ imprisonment, 
suspended for two years.  That is the same sentence 
as last Monday.  On Count 3, indecent photographs, 
four months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years; 
on  Count  4,  indecent  photographs,  four  months’ 
imprisonment, suspended for two years. 
 
I  should  add  Count  1  was  not  proceeded 
with, the defendant, having previously pleaded not 
guilty on 24 June 2013.  I was not the judge that 
day.  The prosecution, on that occasion, indicated 
their  acceptance  of  the  pleas  and  requested  that 
Count 1 would be left on the file. 
 
On  the  York  indictment,  six  counts  of 
possessing  extreme  pornographic  images,  four 
months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years.

Counts  3  and  4  and  the  York  indictment 
will be concurrent to one another and will together 
be consecutive to Count 2. 
 
Therefore,  the  total  sentence  thus  far 
is  12  months’  imprisonment,  suspended  for  two 
years. 
 
As  I  said  to  you  last  week,  if  you 
commit any offence in the next two years, then in 
addition to any sentence you will receive for the 
new  matter,  this  sentence  of  12  months  will  be 
activated and added. 
 
You  will  subject,  as  part  of  the 
suspended  sentence  order,  to  a  supervision 
requirement  for  two  years,  which  requires  you  to 
attend  regular  interviews  with  your  appointed 
probation officer. 
 
You  will  be  required  to  complete  the 
Northumbria Sex Offender Treatment Programme of 100

days.

You  must  attend

have to catch up before resuming the programme.  If

reason approved by your probation officer, you will 
be in breach and you will be returned to court and 
that  court  will  have  wide  powers,  including 
imprisonment. 
 
The  same  strictures  apply  if  you  fail, 
without  good  reason,  to  attend  appointments  with 
your probation officer. 
 
The  original  sexual  offences  prevention 
order  remains  in  force,  save  that  I  have  added 
smartphone to original order, and I therefore spell 
out what the sexual offences prevention order is. 
 
You  are  not  to  delete  your  computer  or 
any  smartphone,  any  internet  history  or  use  any 
programme  to  delete  such  history  permanently;  to 
allow a police officer to examine your computer and 
data  storage  device  on  request;  not  to  work  with 
children  under  16  unless  inadvertently  through 
normal everyday life or with the express permission 
of  the  Public  Protection  Unit  where  you  are 
managed;  you  should  already,  since  last  Monday, 
have signed the Sex Offenders’ Register. 
 
As  a  registered  sex  offender  you  fall

Those  are  my  rulings  in  the  matter. 
Copies  are  now  available;  initially,  please,  to 
counsel  in  the  case.  I  do  not  know  whether  you 
have any further observations, either of you? 

MR THOMSON:  No. 
MS BLANE:  No, thank you. 
JUDGE  PETERS:  I  mean,  obviously  I  am  now  going  to 
retire.  If there are, then you can have the matter 
called on as soon as possible.  But copies will now 
be  available  from  the  usher  for  members  of  the 
press.  Count  1  is  lying  on  the  file,  as  I  have 
indicated. 

(Hushed conversation) 

JUDGE PETERS:  Mr Thomson, is it five or six counts in 

York? 

MR THOMSON:  Five counts.

will amend that, then.  Can we amend the copies, I 
am sorry, where it says on the first page … let me 
show you.  It is five there.  I am sure the press 
have got that, but the copy needs to be amended to 
five counts.  Thank you very much.

PROCEEDINGS 
 

THE  CLERK  OF  THE  COURT:  The  case  of  Neil  Wilson  for 
sentence.  Are you Neil Wilson? 
THE DEFENDANT:  Yes. 
MR  COLOVER:  May  it  please  your  Honour,  I appear  on 
behalf  of  the  Crown. 
My  learned  friend  Miss Blain 
appears  on  behalf  of  this  defendant.  He  appeared  in 
front  of,  as  I understand  it,  in  front  of  His  Honour 
Judge  Kennedy  on  an  earlier  occasion  when  a  plea  to 
Count 1 of not guilty was entered.  That is to be left 
on the file today. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Yes. 
MR COLOVER:  Count 2: there was a plea of guilty. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Yes. 
MR  COLOVER:  Count  3  has  not  been  put  yet.  I would 
like  to  particularise  Count  3,  if  I may,  with  your 
Honour’s consent. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Count? 
MR COLOVER:  Count 3 which is the making indecent ---
JUDGE PETERS:  Was Count 4 put?  Neither was Count 4? 
MR COLOVER:  I will come on to Count 4. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Count 3, carry on. 
MR COLOVER:  Count 3: can I invite your Honour to add 
these  are  eight  photographs  at  levels  1  to  3. 
My 
learned  friend  knows  there  were  2  at  level  1,  two  at

level 2 and four at level 3. 

JUDGE PETERS:  What is the level 3s all about? 

MR COLOVER:  I am trying to do so ---

JUDGE  PETERS: 
course. 

MR  COLOVER:  Then  Count  4  there  are  in  fact  again  if  

I can particularise that as 11 images of pornographic, 

extreme pornographic images. 

JUDGE PETERS:  All right. 

MR COLOVER:  And again if your Honour adds those words 

then counts 3 and 4 can be put. 

JUDGE  PETERS:  Yes.  All  right.  Thank  you  for  that.  

 
So he needs to be arraigned now on 3 and 4. 

THE  CLERK  OF  THE  COURT: 
Your  Honour,  if  you  have  

marked the indictment with the wording and I can follow 

yours. 

JUDGE PETERS:  In terms of the wording, it is made --  

is it made indecent photographs? 

MR COLOVER:  Yes, your Honour, I am so sorry. 

JUDGE PETERS:  It is indecent photographs.  Do you wish 

to include the 2 plus 2 plus 4 within the particulars? 

MR COLOVER:  Yes.  That is probably the right thing to 

do. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Two of level 1. 

MR COLOVER:  Two of level 1, two of level 2. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Two of level 2.

MR COLOVER:  And four of level 3. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Four of level 3 and in Count 4 we add 
in,  where  are  we?  Possessed  11  extreme  pornographic 
images. 
MR COLOVER:  Yes. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Thank you.  I think that is clear. 
Instead  of  “made”,  two,  sorry,  made  indecent 
photographs of a child, two of level 1, two of level 2 
and  then  this  is  11.  Made  11  extreme,  possessed  11. 
 
Yes, thanks. 
THE CLERK OF THE COURT:  Would you stand, please?  Neil 
Wilson, you stand charged on this indictment containing 
four counts.  On Count 3 you stand charged with making 
indecent  photographs  of  a  child.    The  particulars  of 
the  offence  are  that  between  the  16th March 2012  and 
23rd March 2012  you  made  indecent  photographs  of 
a child,  two  of  level  1,  two  of  level  2  and  four  of 
level 3.  To Count 3 do you plead guilty or not guilty? 
THE DEFENDANT:  Guilty, ma’am. 
THE CLERK OF THE COURT:  On Count 4 you stand charged 
with  possessing  an  extreme  pornographic  image  and  the 
particulars of the offence are that between 16th March 
2012  and  23rd March 2012  you  possessed  11  extreme 
pornographic  images  which  were  grossly  offensive, 
disgusting  or  otherwise  of  an  obscene  character  or 
portrayed  in  an  explicit  and  realistic  way  a  person

performing  an  act  of  intercourse  or oral  sex  with  an 
animal.  To Count 4 do you plead guilty or not guilty? 
THE DEFENDANT:  Guilty, ma’am. 
THE  CLERK  OF  THE  COURT:  Guilty.  Thank  you.  Please 
sit down. 
JUDGE PETERS:  The report that was prepared appreciated 
that there were images, the details of course were not 
known  to  the  Probation  Services. 
Have  I summarised 
correctly? 
UNKNOWN FEMALE SPEAKER:  That is correct, your Honour. 
There is an additional difficulty in this case in that 
there  is  a  second  indictment,  transferred  from  York 
Crown Court which also deals with images to which this 
defendant has pleaded guilty. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Is that before us today? 
MR COLOVER:  It is, your Honour.  I have to say: at the 
moment  I do  not  possess  any  papers  at  all  of  the 
transfer. 
JUDGE  PETERS:  There  is  the  --  here  we  are.  These 
relate to October 2013 -- 2012 -- and he pleaded guilty 
on 5th July.  Is that right? 
UNKNOWN  FEMALE  SPEAKER:  That  is  right,  your  Honour, 
yes. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Now, they are all animals are they? 
UNKNOWN  FEMALE  SPEAKER: 
They  are  all 
extreme  pornography,  your  Honour,  as  opposed  to 

They  are.

As  far  as  I can  see  and  what  I  can 

indecent images of children. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Just a moment.  Are you briefed in this? 

MR COLOVER:  Well, to the extent that I represent the  

Crown, your Honour, but I do not have papers in respect 

of that. 
JUDGE PETERS:  I now do.  You now do. 
MR  COLOVER: 
gather ---
JUDGE PETERS:  It speaks for itself. 
MR COLOVER:  It seems an identical set of (inaudible)  

of bestiality, discovered on  a  computer  at  an  address  

that he has access to in York. 

MISS BLAIN:  I think the only difficulty, your Honour, 

is  that  again  the  papers  in  the  York  case  do  not  

particularise the level or the number or certainly the 

copy papers I have do not. 

JUDGE  PETERS:  But  when  you  are  dealing  with  extreme  

pornographic images. 

MISS  BLAIN:  As  far  as  I am  aware,  your  Honour,  yes.  

 
Unfortunately,  counsel  who  dealt  with  that  case

JUDGE  PETERS:

MISS  BLAIN:  There  will  not  be  any  levels.  Quantity  

perhaps.

MISS BLAIN:  It is simply quantity and ---
JUDGE PETERS:  I think they are. 
MR COLOVER:  I think they are all deemed to be level 4 
and 5. 
JUDGE  PETERS: 
I have  not  got  any  Sentencing 
Guidelines in relation to the new offences.  Are there 
any  guidelines?  Where  is  it  deemed  to  be  4  and  5? 
 
Where does it say they are deemed to be 4 and 5? 
MR COLOVER:  Certainly, in terms of other cases. 
JUDGE PETERS:  I have got in front of me the guidelines 
for indecent photographs of children but ---
I  think  that  is  the 
UNKNOWN  FEMALE  SPEAKER: 
difficulty,  your  Honour. 
There  is  an  assumption 
because there is some similarities between the wording 
of  extreme  pornography  legislation  and  that  dealing 
with  indecent  images,  but  of  course  there  is 
a distinction  between  extreme  pornography  and  that  it 
does not involve children. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Well, of course. 
MR  COLOVER:  Your  Honour,  they  are  just  described  as 
“five videos”.

pornographic images, but of course  it  is  still,  there 
is  still  an  issue  if  a defendant  was  to  plead  not 
guilty  as  to  whether  it  was  grossly  offensive, 
The 
disgusting  or  otherwise  of  an  obscene  nature. 
difference  between  this  legislation  and  The  Obscene 
Publications  Act  is  of  course  under  the  Obscene 
Publications Act the prosecution would have to prove or 
you would have to be guilty that the material depraved 
and corrupted the likely person who is seeing it.  An 
obscene  publications  requires  again  aimed  at  those 
selling  it  rather  than  those  viewing  it. 
This 
legislation, as indeed the legislation that deals with 
children,  outlaws  possession,  pure  and  simply. 
It 
still has to be grossly offensive, but it goes without 
saying that, and you have pleaded guilty to it, it goes 
without  saying  that  those  who  engage  in  sex  with 
animals  fall  within  the  legislation,  obviously.    Yes. 
All right. 
Let me hear the Opening and then we will take it from 
there. 
MR COLOVER:  Thank you very much. 
Your  Honour,  this  concerns  this  defendant  and  his 
activities involving a 13 year old girl.  If I give the 
name then your Honour ought to make an order in respect 
of ---
JUDGE  PETERS:  Yes.  There  will  be  a prohibition  of

publication of section 39 of the CYPA. 
MR COLOVER:  Her name is [redacted for legal reasons]. 
JUDGE  PETERS: 
There  is  a  gentleman  from  the  Press 
here.  So  no  publication  as  usual  in  relation  to  the 
girl.  Yes.  Please.  So a 13 year old girl. 
MR  COLOVER:  On  6th March 2012,  which  is  the  date  in 
respect of the first count which has been left on the 
file. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Yes. 
MR COLOVER:  She left school early, bunked off school. 
 
She  was  in  Romford  town  centre.  She  was  interviewed 
and  gave  a very  lengthy  ABE  which  lasted  for  50 
minutes.  She said that she was by the subway.  She was 
asking members of the public for cigarettes.  She asked 
a  man  who  stated  that  he  did  not  smoke  and  then  he 
returned and say “I will buy you some”.  They went to 
a shop. 
She  says  that  he  gave  her  a packet  of  cigarettes  and 
then  said,  “I am  going  home  for  some  coffee,  do  you 
want  to  come.”  She  went  with  him  to  his  address  in 
Romford,  went  to  the  flat  and  there  there  was,  it  is 
fair to say, she has made but is not a complainant in 
this  case  and  has  not  co-operated  apart  from  taking 
part  of  the  ABE  video  that  she  described  in  graphic 
detail what was said to have happened then. 
JUDGE PETERS:  That is ---

MR COLOVER:  That has been left on the file. 

JUDGE PETERS:  All right. 

MR  COLOVER: 
I only  say  that  by  way  of  background  

because I will come on to what he says both in summary 

and in interview, but the upshot was that she left. 

Can  I  just  pause  there  and  ask  you.  

JUDGE  PETERS: 
 
Your  instructions  should  be  able  to  assist,  is  the  

officer here by the way? 

MR COLOVER:  Yes, your Honour. 

JUDGE  PETERS:  Are  we  talking  about  a 13  looking  13,  

looking 16, looking 10? 

MR COLOVER:  Your Honour, she said to him according to 

the  police  interview  she  told  him  initially  that  she  

was 16 and then she said, “I am nearly 16”. 

JUDGE  PETERS: 
officer’s opinion, what does she look like? 

THE OFFICER:  Your Honour, I would say 14, 15.  In my  

experience of ---

JUDGE PETERS:  That is when you saw her. 

THE OFFICER:  14, 15 years of age. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Did she, again, it does not in any way  

seek to lessen the position in this case, but does she 

speak like a 14, 15 year old or a 12 year old or an 18 

year old?  It is very important. 

THE OFFICER:  I would say she speaks like a 14, 15 year 

old. 


The  real  question  is,  in  the

JUDGE PETERS:  And she is 13? 
THE OFFICER:  Yes. 
THE JUDGE:  All right.  Thank you. 
MR COLOVER:  She certainly appears on the face of it to 
behave  as  somebody  who  is  very  much  more  sexually 
experienced;  that  we  can  confirm,  both  from  what  he 
says and what she says. 
She left on the first afternoon that they met.  There 
was  apparently  contact  through  telephones,  texts  and 
other  matters.  Ultimately,  on  20th March she went to 
his home address and that relates to the count that you 
have. 
JUDGE  PETERS: 
address, was there communication between them? 
MR COLOVER:  There had been communication, yes. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Setting it up. 
MR COLOVER:  They agreed to meet, and he texted back. 
JUDGE PETERS:  I am sorry to keep interrupting but when 
you  say  “agreed  to  meet”,  this  is  very  much  a 50-50 
consensual meeting? 
MR COLOVER:  Yes, your Honour.  Very much so, and she 
is  undoubtedly  it  is  fair  to  say  very  sexually 
experienced, and one hesitates to use the word, but it 
is  a word  that  has  been  used  in  other  cases,  I  think 
the  officer  would  agree  that  she  may  well  be  what  is 
described as predatory in respect of her activities. 

When  you  say  she  went  to  his  home

JUDGE PETERS:  Yes.  Well, as I say, I need to know all 
these things.  She said she was nearly 16. 
MR COLOVER:  Yes, your Honour. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Whatever that means. 
MR  COLOVER:  Initially  she  said  that  she  was  16  and 
then she said, “I am nearly 16”.  I was 16 a couple of 
months ago.  I am nearly 16. 
JUDGE PETERS:  All right.  Thank you. 
MR  COLOVER: 
Then  there  was  according  to  her  again 
sexual  activity  took  place.  As  I  say,  she  is  not  a 
complainant.  What she said was this, and this is ---
JUDGE PETERS:  Sorry, sexual activity, we are now on to 
Count 2? 
MR COLOVER:  We are now on to Count 2. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Sexual activity takes place but she does 
not wish to, she did not want to be a complainant? 
MR COLOVER:  No, that is right.  He says they sat in 
the lounge.  She had arrived in school uniform.  They 
sat  in  the  lounge. 
They  talked  about  their 
relationship.  He  told  her  there was no relationship, 
this could not go on as he would get into trouble.  He 
asked her to leave, but she asked if she could change 
out  of  her  school  uniform. 
He  left  the  room  and 
returned a short time later to find her sitting on the 
settee with just a t-shirt on and no other clothing. 
He  sat  on  the  floor  and  told  her  to  put  her  clothes

back  on.  She  came  round  to  where  he  was  sitting  and 
began  kissing  and  touching  him. 
He  told  her  to  go 
She  sat  astride  him  facing  him,  undid 
away. 
She  began  to 
his trousers,  took  his  penis  out. 
masturbate  him. 
He  was  angry  and  said,  “leave  me 
alone”.  She then turned around, still astride him with 
her back to him.  She lowered herself on to his back. 
 
He  believes  his  penis  may  have  touched  her  vagina  or 
near  to  that  area.  He  pushed  her  away  and  she  was 
upset. 
After  further  conversation  about  him  not 
wanting to see her any more she got dressed and left. 
 
He has said at no time did he have penetrative sex with 
her. 
Again,  in  terms  of  the  Sentencing  Guidelines 
there  is  contact  between  his  naked  genitalia  and  her 
naked genitalia, within the section (inaudible) falling 
short of penetrative sexual relationships. 
JUDGE PETERS:  I am looking at page 40 of the ---
MR COLOVER:  Your Honour, the starting point in ranges 
is said to be 2 years in one to four. 
JUDGE PETERS:  I am looking at the same box. 
MR COLOVER:  Yes.  It would seem to be the third of the 
four  possible  boxes  going  up  the  scale.  That  is  the

the authorities. 

JUDGE PETERS:  How? 

MR COLOVER:  She spoke to a friend, the friend spoke to 

somebody else and there was an investigation I think.  

 
She was concerned that she had been caught bunking off 

school.  It came not through her ---

JUDGE  PETERS:  No,  no.  She  never  complained.  Is  it  

that her phone was then analysed that he comes out of  

it? 

MR COLOVER:  Will your Honour forgive me? 

JUDGE PETERS:  Yes. 

MR  COLOVER: 
I understand  ultimately  she  

identified an address to the authorities who went to go 

and see him and there they found the computer that had 

the other images on it. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Yes.  Now tell me about that. 

MR COLOVER:  Yes. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Count 3. 

MR  COLOVER:  The  computer  was  examined  in  respect  of  

the most serious ones that we ---

JUDGE PETERS:  Let us deal with Count 3. 

MR COLOVER:  I am sorry, my Lord. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Count 3 are the ---

MR COLOVER:  Count 3 is these images.  The counts, I do 

not  know  whether  your  Honour  has  a  statement  from  

Mr Paul Andrews?  That may have been served late.

Prepubescent  child.    Turning  over  the 

JUDGE PETERS:  As you know: I have come into this case 
very, just now.  You were due elsewhere. 
MR COLOVER:  Yes. 
JUDGE PETERS:  There are two statements. 
MR  COLOVER: 
3rd June. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Got this. 
MR COLOVER:  There are two starting at page 5 where the 
level 1s are ---
JUDGE PETERS:  Naked girls, younger children. 
MR  COLOVER: 
page, at page 6, level 1s. 
JUDGE  PETERS:  These  are  photographs  that  have  found 
their way on to the computer? 
MR COLOVER:  And then ---
JUDGE PETERS:  He is charged with “making”. 
MR  COLOVER:  Yes.  Your  Honour,  that  is  on  the  basis 
that once they are downloaded. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Yes.  Yes.  So we are into level 3. 
MR  COLOVER: 
Level  3  is,  the  four  level  3s  are 
described  as  the  first  one  on  page 7  as  a  very  small 
picture, face and naked torso of a child and an adult 
penis  being  held  over  a  child.  A  very  small  picture 
showing a young female child holding an erect penis of 
an adult male.  Number 4: this is a very small picture 
showing a very young child of indeterminate sex holding

the  penis  of  an  adult  male,  and  the  same --  sorry --  

the fourth one, this is a very small picture showing a 

very young naked female child with her legs being held 

open by an adult of indeterminate sex.  Those are the  

levels. 

JUDGE PETERS:  There is level 4 there? 

MR COLOVER:  Your Honour, that is level 3. 

JUDGE PETERS:  But he is not on any level 4s? 

MR COLOVER:  No, your Honour.  No. 

JUDGE PETERS:  There is a reference to a level 4. 

MR COLOVER:  There is videos, and I have to say on the 

indictment  I have  got  those  do  not  seem  to  have  been  

charged  separately.  In  the  general scheme of things,  

your  Honour,  I  think  somebody  has  taken  a  pragmatic  

view. 

On page 9 of 13 there are graphic descriptions of the  

bestiality  that  comprises  Count  4,  the  11  photographs  

of  women  with  horses  and  dogs,  and  I can  only  assume  

that the York matters are videos of a similar nature. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Let us have a look. 

MR  COLOVER:  They  are  described  as,  in  the  officer’s  

notes. 

JUDGE PETERS:  There is no actual ---

MR COLOVER:  Described as “extreme pornographic videos, 

5 videos of bestiality, penetrative sexual acts between 

humans and animals.

JUDGE  PETERS: 
I  assume  they  are  of  the  same  kind  

unless I am told otherwise.  These are videos that have 

been downloaded into the hard drive? 

MR COLOVER:  Into the hard drives, your Honour, yes. 

JUDGE  PETERS:  And  you  say  that  I have  to  deal  with  

them as a level 4 or 5?  Is that right? 

MR  COLOVER:  As  I recollect  from  (inaudible)  dealing  

with  a  number  of  (inaudible)  look  at  one  of  these  in  

respect of other matters elsewhere. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Yes. 

MR COLOVER:  And my recollection is that they were to  

be  dealt  with  as  though  they  were  level  4.  I am  not  

sure if that is correct. 

JUDGE  PETERS:  I am  just  re-reading  the  report  while  

you are finding that. 

MR COLOVER:  Thank you. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Yes.  Can you help me with that?  Where 

in Archbold? 

MR COLOVER:  Chapter 31. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Are you in the supplement? 

MR COLOVER:  Yes.  I was looking at it to see if there 

was a reference to it.  It may be in the main volume. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Let us have a look.  Sorry, you say 31? 

MR COLOVER:  Chapter 31, your Honour.

this.  3 years.  Is it not exceeding 3? 

MISS BLAIN:  It is, your Honour. 

JUDGE PETERS:  If it is not exceeding 3 how can it be  

level 4 or 5? 

MISS  BLAIN:  The  only  example  in  Banks  does  not  make  

any reference ---

JUDGE PETERS:  Mr Colover, it cannot be 4 or 5 if 3 is 

the maximum. 

MR COLOVER:  Yes, I am sorry, your Honour. 

JUDGE PETERS:  It cannot be because it is 10 for 4 and 

5 maximum, and a possession offence is 5 anyway. 

MISS BLAIN:  Yes, and in terms of extreme pornography, 

your  Honour,  it  can  be  2  years  maximum  depending  on  

which section of the legislation applies. 

JUDGE PETERS:  We are on -- can I have the indictment  

back?  Thanks.  He is charged with 63(1). 

MR COLOVER:  63(7), yes, it is 3 years.  It is section, 

I am  sorry,  your  Honour,  it  is  31-124,  so  if  it  is  

under  63(1)  it  is  3  years. 
Any  acts  within  

section 63(7),  which  is  the  one  that  relates  to  the  

violence or injury. 

JUDGE PETERS:  Ah. 

MR COLOVER:  Although, no, I am sorry. 

JUDGE PETERS:  No, it is not right.

MR COLOVER:  It does ---

JUDGE PETERS:  Just a moment.  (Talking to the Clerk of 

the Court re another case).  Yes, sorry. 

MR COLOVER:  I am so sorry, your Honour.  The maximum  

sentence  for  this  allegation  under  section 63(1)  is  3  

years. 

JUDGE PETERS:  You do agree, Miss Blain? 

MR  COLOVER: 
The  wording  is  that  if  it  is  under  

a section which does not portray any act within 67(3), 

well, this is an act. 

THE CLERK OF THE COURT:  They are ready, your Honour. 

JUDGE  PETERS:  Bear  with  we.  Just  bring  them  here,  

counsel and the officer.  2 or 3? 

MR COLOVER:  It is 2, your Honour. 

JUDGE PETERS:  It is 2 years. 

MR  COLOVER:  It  is  2  years  because  subsection  67(3)  

relates to 63(7)(a) or (b) and it is ---

case).

JUDGE PETERS:  Yes.  Anything else you need to tell me

register anyway. 
MR COLOVER:  He does, your Honour.  That is the advice 
of  the  officer  who  has  taken  advice  from  the  local 
team. 
JUDGE  PETERS:  That  is  probably  the  least  of  defence 
counsel’s concerns at the moment.  All right.  Just in 
outline, yes, thank you very much, what do you tell me 
at  this  stage?  Are  we  ready  to  proceed?  The  only 
point is that the report does not perhaps have or the 
officer in charge of the report does not really address 
the pornographic side. 
MISS BLAIN:  She does not, your Honour, but in view of 
the conclusions that she reaches in terms of I suppose 
what one could deem the more serious count, it may be 
that your Honour is able to deal with this matter.  It 
is a relatively comprehensive report. 
JUDGE  PETERS:  It  is.  I mean,  Count  3  is,  they  are, 
there are some level 3 there are there not? 
I would 
MISS  BLAIN: 
certainly  advance  that  the  attitudes  that  are 
identified by the author of the report more than likely 
relate to those images as well in that the way that she 
proposes that they can be dealt with, ie Sex Offenders 
Treatment  Programme,  is  undoubtedly  suitable  in  terms 
of those images.

prosecution. 
MISS BLAIN:  Your Honour hit the nail on the head, as 
it  were,  when  asked  if  it  was  by  reference  to  the 
mobile  phone  that  he  was  arrested. 
Quite  to  the 
contrary.  They came to his house.  He made extremely 
lengthy admissions that your Honour has seen.  He makes 
admissions in relation to the offences in York as the 
extreme  pornography  and  when  asked  about  the  indecent 
images  he  says:  “I access  a large  quantity  of  adult 
material.  Occasionally there is (inaudible) material. 
 
I hold  my  hands  up.    I  have  either  looked  through 
a thumbnail index or I have downloaded and viewed it.” 
That  would  seem  to  be  true  because  when  one  looks  at 
the expert report those images are no longer accessible 
by ordinary people, as it were, and that would tend to 
suggest  that  either  they  were  being  downloaded  and  to 
use it as the defendant says or they were seen only on 
a brief thumbnail as the defendant says.  Of course, if 
they  were  downloaded  and  stored  they  would  still  be 
there.  That would tend to apply some credence to what 
the defendant said. 
JUDGE  PETERS: 
He  clearly  needs  treatment  because 
anyone  who,  for  whatever  reason,  finds  themselves

looking at that sort of material of the young children 
with  men,  and  animals  with  women,  I mean,  it  goes 
without saying. 
MISS  BLAIN:  Yes.  The  point  about  the  Sex  Offender 
Treatment Programme, your Honour, is that a court order 
is in fact the only way that one can ensure that that 
is undertaken.  If the defendant is sent to immediate 
custody he is placed upon a waiting list.  There is no 
way  of  knowing  if  a place  will become available while 
he is serving his term.  In any event, his release is 
not  conditional  upon  completion  of  that  court  as 
opposed  to  a  court  order,  which  of  course  he  must 
complete  it  to  discharge  his  obligations  or  be  placed 
 
in immediate custody.  If your Honour shares the view 
of the author of the report that treatment is what is 
needed, the only way to ensure that is undertaken is by 
attaching a court order.  Custody might finish him.  He 
is a disabled man.  He will be placed on the hospital 
wing.  I dare  say  although  deprivation  of  his  liberty 
is seen as an infringement it will not ameliorate the 
(inaudible)  identified  either  by  your  Honour  or  the 
author of the report. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Yes. 
MISS BLAIN:  Your Honour may also derive some comfort 
from  those  matters  that  have  been  identified  that 
whatever the views of the author of that report she was

vulnerable 

which 

(inaudible) 

perhaps  absent  the  material  about  the  complainant  as 
she  perhaps  did  not  appreciate  that  there  was 
(inaudible)  on  both  sides  and  notwithstanding  this 
offence  the  defendant  retains  the  support  of  his 
friends and his family, his partner of some years and 
they all appear here for him today.  He will be further 
supported  albeit  perhaps  supported  by  notification  of 
(inaudible)  sexual  offences  prevention  order  and 
safeguarding 
will 
automatically  enter  him  on  to  a  register  to  protect 
others.  A significant part of the Pre-Sentence Report 
is that although he is assessed as some risk the author 
is very careful to say that it is not an imminent risk. 
 
Again,  that  may  have  caused  (inaudible)  his  treatment 
and  that  treatment  can  best  be  administered  in 
(inaudible). 
JUDGE PETERS:  Yes.  You have persuaded me to deal with 
this now in the way you suggest.  Yes.  You are there. 
 
You are there.  Do you wish to say anything about the 
prevention order? 
There  is  an  error  in  the 
THE  PROBATION  OFFICER: 
Pre-Sentence  Report  proposal,  your  Honour.  They  have 
asked for a 3 year suspended sentence. 
JUDGE PETERS:  2 years. 
THE  PROBATION  OFFICER: 
I spoke  to  York  probation 
because a sex offender programme takes 3 years and they

couldn’t guarantee to complete it within 2 years and so 
I would need to ask for a community order with 3 years 
supervision in the programme. 
A  suspended  sentence  order  which  is 
JUDGE  PETERS: 
obviously 2 years.  I was going to ask you this, but I 
was  going  say  2  years  supervision,  so  we  are  talking 
about 3 years supervision. 
THE  PROBATION  OFFICER:  That  cannot  be  attached  to  a 
suspended sentence order. 
JUDGE PETERS:  No, but I am still going to impose that. 
 
Because  it  is,  because  they  are  stand  alone  orders 
though. 
It  is  no  longer  necessary  as  part  of  a 
suspended sentence to give a community order I take the 
view that I can impose that as a separate order. 
THE PROBATION OFFICER:  I am not sure how you achieve 
that. 
JUDGE  PETERS:  If  I pass  a prison  sentence  suspended 
for  2  years  in  addition  there  will  be  a community 
sentence, a supervision order of 3 years involving the 
sex offending programme. 
THE  PROBATION  OFFICER: 
community order. 
JUDGE  PETERS:  Not  a  community  order.  A  supervision 
order of 3 years. 
THE  PROBATION  OFFICER:  Supervision  is  attached  to  a 
community order. 

That  would  be  as  part  of  a

JUDGE PETERS:  Yes, as part of a community order, but 
it  is  no  longer,  I do  not  have  to  make  any  specific 
orders  when  I pass  a suspended  sentence.    That  has 
gone. 
THE PROBATION OFFICER:  Yes, your Honour. 
JUDGE PETERS:  I am passing two quite separate regimes 
now. 
One  is  a prison  sentence  suspended  within  the 
terms  of  that,  and  then  in  addition  I am  imposing 
a community order whereby he will be under supervision 
to complete his sex offending programme. 
THE PROBATION OFFICER:  Are you minded to impose then 
different  sentences  for  different  offences,  your 
Honour? 
JUDGE PETERS:  Yes.  Ah.  That is the way to deal with 
it.  Thank you for your help.  That is the way to deal 
with it.  I will impose a sex offending programme under 
a  supervision  order  for  one  group  of  offences  and 
I will  give  him  a suspended  sentence  for  the  sexual 
activity  offences.  That  is  the  way  to  deal  with  it. 
Excellent.  We are there.  Thank you very much.  Let me 
just amend that.  Thank you. 
Any observations? 
MISS  BLAIN: 
prevention order is as basic as it can be. 
JUDGE  PETERS: 
Well,  his  computer,  it  is  perfectly 
usual to impose limits on people’s computer use.  It is

not preventing him going online.  It is just preventing 
him, if a policeman was so minded to knock on his door 
and inspect his computer, that is all it is.  That is a 
very normal order. 
MISS BLAIN:  It is, your Honour. 
JUDGE PETERS:  As far as the under 16s, well, that only 
goes, really that is no more or less the registration 
requirement. 
MISS  BLAIN:  Also  (inaudible).  Simply  bolsters  what 
would already be in place. 
JUDGE PETERS:  Very well.  Thank you. 
Neil  Wilson,  you  come  as  close  as  going  to  prison  as 
you know imaginable because prevalent today are people 
who get involved in sexual activity with people who are 
too young and that is what you have done. 
I take  into  account  in  relation  to  Count  2  on  this 
indictment  that  the  girl  herself,  only  13,  the 
prosecution  accept  looked  and  behaved  a little  bit 
older, but you knew when she said to you that she was 
16 or near 16 was not that age.  There is no doubt, and 
your plea of guilty recognises that you knew that she 
was not 16 years of age.  So allowing her to visit you 
at  your  home  is  something  which  the  courts  have  to 
clamp  down  on,  and  in  normal  circumstances  involves 
a term  of  significant  imprisonment. 
These  are 
prevalent offences and young girls need the protection

of the courts by such sentences. 
On  these  facts,  the  girl  involved,  I am  told,  to  use 
the expression was “predatory” and was seriously egging 
you  on.  That,  of  course,  is  no  defence  when  dealing 
with  children,  but  in  all  the  circumstances  I am 
prepared  to  impose  upon  you  a prison  sentence 
suspended.  Giving you a discount for pleading guilty, 
the sentence is reduced  to 8 months imprisonment from 
12 months and that will be suspended for 2 years.  That 
means  that  if  you  commit  any  further  offence  in  the 
next 2 years in addition to anything you commit the 8 
months will be added on. 
That deals with Count 2. 
When  you  were  arrested,  and  I appreciate  you 
co-operated  with  the  authorities,  you  were  found  in 
possession  of  a significant  but  not  huge  amount  of 
material.  At  this  court,  Count  3,  you  were  found  in 
possession of two of level 1, two of level 2 and four 
of level 3, indecent images of a child.  I am told that 
these  had  been,  you  attempted  to  delete  them,  but  as 
you know they do not get deleted. 
Anyone who seeks, for whatever reason, gratification or 
the  use  of  such  photographs  again  faces  a term  of 
imprisonment. 
They,  in  your  case,  stop  at  level  3 
which is bad of itself.  Young children with adult men 
in sexual poses.  Anyone who seeks gratification from

that  needs  treatment  and  that  is  the  order  that  I am 
going  to  pass  upon  you  today.  I do  not  think  given 
your history there is any need to send you immediately 
to  prison  for  that,  although,  as  I say,  you  came  as 
near to it today as you will ever come.  So I hope this 
is the last day you appear in court. 
On  Count  4,  you  were  found  in  possession  of  extreme 
pornographic  images,  where  women  are  behaving  in  a 
sexual  way,  performing  in  a  sexual  way  with  animals. 
 
You  face  another  indictment  sent  to  us  from  York  of 
six,  five  counts  of  the  same  nature.  Those  who  seek 
gratification or pleasure from watching such extreme or 
pornographic  images  need  treatment,  and  that  is  what 
I am  going  to  order  against  you.    Again,  in  normal 
circumstances  a prison  sentence  is  appropriate,  but 
there is no evidence that you showed any of these items 
to anybody else or exchanged them with anybody else or 
published them to anybody else.  Had you been involved 
in showing these to others, if there was any scintilla 
of  evidence  I  would  have  sent  you  immediately  to 
prison. 
The sentence of the court on Count 3 and Count 4 and in 
relation to the indictment from York Crown Court, each 
count  concurrent  will  be  a supervision  order  for  3 
years.  The primary condition of that supervision order 
is  that  you  attend  and  complete  a Sex  Offenders

Programme  as  directed  by  the,  in  your  case,  the 
York probation services. 
As  far  as  the  supervision  is  concerned  and  the 
programme:  it  is  crucial  that  you  attend  all  the 
appointments that you are  granted  and  given.    Failure 
to  attend  will  mean  a breach  of  the  order.    Do  you 
follow?  If you are ill or if there is a proper reason 
you  contact  them  with  a reason  because  if  you  do  not 
and there is no proper reason I have no doubt that they 
will  bring  proceedings  against  you  for  breach  of  the 
order. 
Clearly,  being  in  York  that  can  be  brought 
before the York Magistrates’ Court  to  start  with,  but 
if  it  is  serious  it  can  be  brought  before  this  court 
and then you can be sentenced for breach of the order. 
In addition, you are obliged to sign the Sex Offenders 
Register. 
I need  not  say  any  more  of  that.    Your 
lawyer will advise you about that, but that effectively 
provides the police with your address and any movements 
away  from  your  address  which  protects  the  public  or 
those  who  wish  to  employ  people  within  certain 
industries,  the  right  to  check  that  register.    In 
addition,  I will  impose  upon  you  a Sexual  Offences 
Prevention Order which is imposed upon people convicted 
of offences involving those under 16 and those who use 
the  internet  to  download  extreme  images  and  those 
In  the  terms  set  out  in  the 
involving  children.

schedule  before  me  which  involves  you  not  to  delete 
your computer history or use any programme of deletion, 
permanent deletion, allowing police if they wish to to 
examine  your  computer  and  data  storage  device.  There 
of course does not in any way stop you using computers, 
but  of  course  it  allows  people  to  check.  So  if  you 
breach  this  order  you  commit  a criminal  offence.    Do 
you follow? 
Similarly, you are not to work with children under the 
age of 16, whether paid or voluntary.  Not to contact 
or communicate with a child under the age of 16 unless 
inadvertently  through  normal  everyday  life  with  the 
express permission of the public protection unit where 
you  are  managed.  These  are  important  conditions,  Mr 
Wilson,  to  prevent  you  falling  prey,  foul, either you 
yourself contacting children or if they contact you. 
I hope that this is the last time you appear before the 
courts. 
These  measures  are  necessary  in  your 
interests,  but  primarily  to  protect  the  public  from 
people like yourself who get involved or are interested 
in either children or unnatural sexual activity, which 
is  the  case  where  you  pleaded  guilty  to  possessing 
extreme pornographic images. 
Are there any other matters that I need to deal with?

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE DAVIS QC, RECORDER OF
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
BIRMINGHAM
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

   

  
 

Lisa Burrows.  You are 42.  You worked for the Crown Prosecution Service for 
 
more than 20 years.  By 2008 you were the Area Finance Manager for West 
 
Midlands  Crown  Prosecution  Service.  That  was  a  position  of  high  financial 
 
responsibility.  You were authorised to submit any invoice up to the value of 
 
£25,000 without recourse to any more senior manager.  Between 2008 and the 
 
early  part  of  2013  you  grossly  abused  the  trust  placed  in  you  by  the  Crown 
 
 
In  a  planned  and  persistent  fraud  you  defrauded  that 
Prosecution  Service. 
 
   
Service of just over £1 million. 
 
 

 
 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Tahir Mahmood.  You are aged 50.  In 2012 you commenced employment with 
 
 
the Crown Prosecution Service, an employment facilitated by Burrows.  Prior to 
 
 
that  you  were  a  taxi  driver. 
It  was  that  experience  which  underpinned  the 
 
   
fraud practised from 2008. 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The two of you were in some kind of relationship over the course of the fraud. 
  
What  you  did  was  to  agree  that  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  would  be 
 
invoiced for bogus taxi journeys.  The bogus invoices were in the name of a taxi 
 
  
It  was  you,  Mahmood,  who  set  up  bank 
firm  invented  for  the  purpose.
--------
accounts in the name Joseph O’Neil into which the proceeds of the fraud were 
 
paid.  You went to the lengths of changing your name by deed poll to enable 
 
you to set up those accounts.  You had sole access to the accounts from which 
   
you withdrew over £985,000 in cash over a five year period. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
  
 

 
It  was  you,  Burrows,  who  created  and  then  authorised  the  payment  of  the 
 
bogus invoices.  You involved other members of staff to the extent that you 
 
obtained their counter signatures on the invoices as part of the authorisation 
 
process.  You knew how the system worked.  You knew that the invoices were 
 
capable  of  deceiving  the  auditing  system  operated  by  your  employer, 
 
particularly  since  you  ensured  that  each  individual  invoice  was  not  so 
 
substantial  in  value  as  to  excite  any  particular  interest  during  the  auditing 
 
process.  It is only by chance that the fraud was discovered when it was. 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

  

 
 

 
It is not possible to say where all of the money accrued in the course of the 
 
fraud went.  Over the course of five years you, Burrows, paid into your bank 
 
account over £320,000 in cash, all of which must have been the proceeds of 
 
the fraud, together with some £28,000 in cheques drawn on the bank accounts 
 
opened by Mahmood in the name O’Neil.  That money went on high living – 
 
expensive holidays in Dubai and New York, designer clothing, jewellery.  What 
 
happened to rest of the money – some £664,000 – is not known save that it 
 
was you, Mahmood, who withdrew the money in cash over the course of the 
 
fraud. 

  
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Aside from the sheer amount involved, the features that make this conspiracy 
 
particularly serious are these: 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  This was a huge fraud on the public purse causing substantial losses to a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   
department already under serious financial pressure. 
   
It was carried out by someone in a position of very considerable trust. 

 
 
 
  The fraud involved significant planning by both of you. 
  
 
 
 
 

 
   
It continued for more than five years. 
 
It would have carried on had it not been discovered as is apparent from 
 
the  fact  that  you,  Burrows,  had  further  bogus  invoices  ready  for 
   
submission. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  Very large sums of money remain outstanding. 
 
 
  Where the proceeds can be traced, they went largely on high living.  The 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
fraud was motivated purely by greed.
--------
	  The fact that the fraud involved the Crown Prosecution Service and was 
 
 
committed by a senior member of that Service – the body responsible 
 
for bringing criminals to justice – will have affected and eroded public 
 
confidence in that Service. 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The only feature which mitigates the starting point for the proper sentence in 
 
this  case  –  i.e.  the  sentence  that  would  have  been  appropriate  had  you 
 
contested  the  case  –  is  your  good  character.  Neither  of  you  has  been  in 
 
trouble  before.  You,  Burrows,  have  thrown  away  20  years  of  hard  work  in 
 
building up a career in public service.  The fact that both of you have brought 
 
shame upon and pain and suffering to your families is not something of any 
 
significance in mitigating the sentence.  All of that is the result of your greed. 

 
  

 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 
I have to consider whether there is any distinction to be drawn between you in 
 
terms of the proper sentence.  Plainly the element of breach of trust applies 
 
most significantly to you, Burrows.  Whilst you, Mahmood, were an employee 
 
of  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  in  the  latter  stages  of  the  fraud,  your 
 
employment  was  not  an  integral  part  of  the  fraudulent  process.  Equally, 
 
 
Burrows, you have lost everything as a result of the fraud and I cannot ignore 
 
 
   
the  fact  that  you,  Mahmood,  held  the  purse  strings. 
I  do  not  intend  to 
 
distinguish between you in the sentence I impose. 

   
 

 
   

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
It  is  difficult  to  envisage  a  more  serious  fraud  of  its  type  that  the  one  you 
 
committed.  Had  you  contested  the  case  the  sentence  in  your  case  in  the 
 
region of nine years would have been appropriate. 

 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
You each must be given credit for your plea of guilty.  Your pleas were entered 
 
at the preliminary hearing after full admissions were made to the police.  I am 
 
satisfied that the pleas were indicated at the first opportunity.  Although your 
 
admissions may have been inevitable given the evidence that you must have 
 
known would be available, I shall give you the conventional full credit of one‐
 
third to take account of your pleas. 

    
 
 
 

 
   
 

  
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The sentence in each of your cases will be six years’ imprisonment.  You will be 
  
eligible  for  automatic  release  at  the  half  way  point  of  the  sentence. 
 
Thereafter, you will be subject to licence and liable to recall to serve part or all 
 
of the remaining part of your sentence if you breach the terms of your licence 
 
or commit a further offence.

There will be a surcharge in the appropriate amount.

I have had the matter listed before me today as part of the sentence, not that part 
 
 
relating to sexual activity with a child, requires correcting. It was not appreciated by 
 
the parties that I could not pass a Community Order with a supervision requirement 
 
for 3 years to run alongside a suspended sentence on the same indictment or indeed 
 
another indictment sentenced on the same occasion. In amending the sentence I 
   
have sought to ensure that all parts of the order will be complied with by the 
 
defendant and that any breach will be brought before a Court and consideration 
 
given to further penalty including immediate imprisonment. 
  
 
I therefore vary the original sentence by revoking the Community Order and will 
 
 
impose additional suspended terms of imprisonment for counts 3‐4 and for the York 
 
 
indictment (5 counts) and impose a supervision requirement for 2 years together 
 
with, as before, a requirement that you attend and complete a Sex Offender 
 
Treatment Programme. The other orders remain as before. The addition of the 
 
suspended sentences for counts 3 and 4 is commensurate with the reduction in the 
 
 
supervision element from 3 to 2 years. 
  
 
Neil Wilson the sentence of the Court is therefore as follows:‐
 
Count 2, sexual activity with a child the sentence is 8 months suspended for 2 years, 
 
this is the same sentence as last Monday. 
 
 
Count 3 indecent photographs 4 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years. 
 
 
Count 4 indecent photographs 4 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years.
--------
Count 1 was not proceeded with, the defendant having previously pleaded not guilty 
 
on 24 June 2013. I was not the Judge that day. The prosecution on that occasion 
 
indicated their acceptance of the pleas and requested that Count 1 would be left on 
 
the file. 
  
 
On the York indictment 5 counts of possessing extreme pornographic images 4 
 
months imprisonment suspended 2 years. 
 
 
Count 3 and 4 and the York indictment will be concurrent to one another but will 
 
together be consecutive to Count 2. 
  
 
Therefore the total sentence thus far is 12 months imprisonment suspended for 2 
 
years. As I said to you last week if you commit any offence in the next 2 years then in 
 
addition to any sentence you will receive for the new matter, this sentence of 12 
 
months will be activated and added. 
 
 
You will be subject as part of the suspended sentence order to a supervision 
 
requirement for 2 years which requires you to attend regular interviews with your 
 
appointed probation officer. 
  
 
You will be required to complete the Northumbria Sex Offender Treatment 
 
Programme of 100 days. This has to be completed within the 2 years. 
  
 
This is and is meant to be an intensive course of treatment, you must attend every 
 
 
session. If sessions are missed you will have to catch up before resuming the 
 
programme. If two sessions are missed without an acceptable reason approved by 
 
the probation officer, you will be in breach and you will be returned to Court which 
 
will have wide powers including prison. The same strictures will apply if you fail 
 
without good reason to attend appointments with your probation officer. 
 
 
The original Sexual Offences Prevention Order remains in force, save that I have 
 
 
added smartphone to the original order.

2225467,R v Mariusz Krezolek and Magdelena Luczak,"R v Mariusz Krezolek and Magdelena Luczak (T20127199) 

 

Birmingham Crown Court 

 

2 August 2013 

Sentencing remarks of Mrs Justice Cox 

  

 
 

 

 

 

Mariusz Krezolek and Magdelena Luczak, the sentence for the crime of murder is fixed by 
law.  It is one of life imprisonment; and that is the sentence I now impose upon each of you.   
 
I must therefore specify the minimum term of imprisonment which each of you must serve, 
before the Parole Board can even consider whether you might be released.  That is the 
punitive period I consider appropriate, having regard to the particular facts of the case and 
the overall seriousness of this offence.   
  
The facts of this case are deeply shocking and disturbing.   
 
As the trial has progressed, harrowing details of the unimaginable acts of cruelty and 
brutality inflicted on little Daniel, over many months, have exposed both the torment and 
despair he must have suffered and your callous disregard for his pain and distress.  Time and 
again, knowing exactly what you were doing to him, both of you concealed your conduct 
from the authorities by a series of deliberate and elaborate lies, designed to put them off 
the scent and to prevent them discovering Daniel’s true plight.  Your campaign of cruelty, as 
it has accurately been described, culminated in the severe blow or blows to his head that 
killed him.  He was just 4½ years old.   
   
Exactly when this appalling cruelty started is not clear.  Until your relationship began, in 
early 2010, Daniel appears to have been a healthy child, developing appropriately and giving 
no real cause for concern.  
  
While the evidence demonstrates that systematic cruelty probably began when Daniel 
started school in September 2011, your complicity in his ill treatment was first evidenced by 
the displaced fracture to his arm, sustained 14 months before his death on 5 January 2011, 
when he was just 3½.  This serious injury would have resulted immediately in excruciating 
pain and loss of function, yet you did not take him to hospital until the following day, clearly 
increasing his mental and physical suffering.  I have no doubt that you, Mariusz Krezolek, 
deliberately used considerable force to inflict that injury, and that you Magdelena Luczak, 
discovering what had happened, joined with him in waiting to see if you could keep it secret,
--------
and then in lying to the doctors about how it had happened.  This determination to lie and to 
protect yourselves at all costs was to become the hallmark of your subsequent conduct.  
 
There was further evidence of your real attitude towards Daniel, Mariusz Krezolek, in your 
description of him in July, to a colleague at work, as “all fucked up” and autistic, and not 
worth beating because he wouldn’t feel pain.   
 
Nevertheless, at the time he started school in September 2011, Daniel was described by the 
Reception staff as appearing to be a healthy and well cared for little boy.  It may be that he 
had some behavioural or communication difficulties, as you have constantly suggested, 
though such difficulties as he had are in my view more likely to have been due to your 
abusive treatment of him rather than to any other cause.  They would have warranted, in 
any event, even greater affection, care and support for Daniel – not less. 
 
Instead, over the months that followed, he was subjected by both of you to deliberate, 
escalating and incomprehensible brutality, which continued right up to his death.  There is 
no evidence of such ill treatment by you towards your two daughters.  But, for reasons 
which are unfathomable, Daniel became a target for derision, abuse and systematic cruelty, 
designed to cause him significant mental and physical suffering.   
 
The scale of his suffering was truly horrific.  
 
He was subjected to acts described by you as punishments but which, in reality, were acts 
designed to cause pain, to humiliate and to intimidate. He was required to kneel on the floor 
for long periods of time, to run continuously around the living room, or to perform squats 
repeatedly and slowly.   
 
He was repeatedly forced to swallow salt, which you admit was poured neat into his mouth 
from the salt container and which caused him to vomit.   
 
He was subjected to a form of cold water punishment, being held under cold water until the 
point of unconsciousness, something his [sibling], then aged 6, saw and had to describe to 
this court.  Exactly what form that particular punishment took we will never know, since 
neither of you has explained it.  He must have been absolutely terrified.   
 
He was subjected to regular beatings, as the teachers’ observations of bruising and the 
multiple bruises seen on his body after death testify.  There were nine separate bruises to 
his head. 
 
He was confined for regular and prolonged periods of time in the small, bare box room 
upstairs.  The inner door handle was removed and the metal panel so arranged that he could 
not even see out of the keyhole.  The small hand and finger marks on the inside of that door 
provided a poignant image of his desperate attempts to escape.  The urine stains to the 
mattress on which he was made to sleep and the damp state of the carpet testify to his 
inability to go to the toilet when he needed.  There is evidence of him soiling himself.    
 

Page 2 of 6
--------
It is a particularly grave aggravating feature in this case that, before the fatal blows to his 
head, Daniel was the victim of chronic and systematic starvation.  Both of you deliberately 
deprived him of food over a prolonged period of time.  He was literally wasting away.  His 
starvation was so chronic that his bones ceased to grow.  Expert medical witnesses and 
others with extensive experience in the field of child protection described their shock at the 
extent of Daniel’s emaciation at his death.  They regarded it as unprecedented in this 
country.  They likened his appearance to those who failed to survive concentration camps, 
and that comparison was not made lightly.  As the months passed, Daniel increasingly 
scavenged for food, from other children’s lunch boxes, from the playground or from rubbish 
bins.  He would have suffered extraordinary hunger, increasing abdominal pain and, 
ultimately, a feeling of hopelessness. You, Magdelena Luczak, knowing of his hunger, gave 
specific instructions to his teachers that Daniel was not to eat any more food than the small 
packed lunch he had with him.   
 
Both of you constructed a careful and wholly untruthful account that Daniel had a serious 
eating disorder and learning difficulties, which he may have inherited and for which he was 
receiving medical treatment.  This account was deliberately designed to prevent interference 
by school, medical and welfare personnel, and to perpetuate the brutality being meted out 
to him.  You instructed and encouraged Daniel’s older [sibling] to tell lies to the authorities if 
she were asked any questions about what was happening at home.   
 
At some time in the evening of Thursday 1 March 2012, by which time Daniel’s weakened 
physical condition made him particularly vulnerable, I am satisfied on all the evidence that in 
the minutes preceding the fatal blow or blows to his head, he was subjected to a brutal 
assault, in which he was given salt and subjected to a form of cold water punishment in the 
bath.   It is submitted in mitigation that I cannot be sure that cold water punishment was 
inflicted in the minutes before he died, but I cannot accept that submission.  On all the 
evidence, including the computer searches on the Friday morning, as Daniel lay unconscious, 
and the failure of each of you to explain them, I am entirely satisfied that it was.      
 
The preponderance of the medical evidence establishes that the injury then inflicted to his 
head was severe, resulting as it did in damage to the bridging veins, axonal damage and a 
large subdural haematoma.  I am satisfied, Mariusz Krezolek, that this head injury was 
inflicted by you and that you applied considerable force.  By their verdict, Magdelena Luczak, 
the jury clearly rejected your account that you tried to intervene and were sure that you 
were jointly liable for Daniel’s death.   
 
The combined neuropathological and neurosurgical opinion is that Daniel would have lost 
consciousness immediately, or almost immediately after this impact so that any lucid 
interval, involving undoubted mental anguish and physical pain, would, mercifully, have 
been short. 
  
Daniel then lay alone in the box room, as his life slipped away, from that Thursday evening 
until just before 3 a.m. on Saturday morning, while you both continued your lives, hoping 
that he would regain consciousness and that your conduct towards him could continue 
unabated and undiscovered.  

Page 3 of 6
--------
Your internet searches on that Friday morning reveal both the scale of the cruelty you had 
inflicted on him and your growing realisation that he was not responding.  Still you did not 
take him to hospital, until you discovered in the early hours that he was not breathing and 
eventually called the emergency services.  I am in no doubt that,   before you made that call, 
you had deliberately planned the detailed lies you would tell in an attempt to deceive the 
authorities and save your own skin.  That plan was put into action even in the call to the 
emergency operator.   
 
Before your arrest you made concerted efforts to remove evidence by deleting the computer 
search history, attempting to tidy the house and concealing the stained mattress from the 
box room.  You lied persistently   when you were interviewed by the police.  By their verdicts 
the jury were sure that you continued to lie at this trial.  Over the nine weeks of acutely 
distressing evidence I have not observed a single sign of genuine remorse at any stage from 
either of you.         
       
In my judgment there is no basis for distinguishing between you in relation to this campaign 
of cruelty and the assault leading to Daniel’s death.  While the evidence indicates that you, 
Magdelena Luczak, were the victim of domestic violence by your partner on occasions, I do 
not consider that lessens your culpability in this case.  On your own admission you had a 
supportive network of family and friends to whom you could have turned for help, as well as 
the names of organisations and contact details provided to you by midwives or health 
visitors.  In any event your relationship has been revealed on the evidence to be an intense 
and stormy one, marked by heavy drinking, mutual acts of aggression and yet strong physical 
attraction.  Your continuing affection for and loyalty towards each other was demonstrated 
by the intimate gestures observed between you when you were produced before the 
Magistrates Court on 7 March 2012.  That you, Magdelena Luczak, were fully complicit in 
these acts of incomprehensible cruelty towards your own son is clearly established by the 
chilling text messages you sent to Mariusz Krezolek, between 7 October and 2 March.   
Yours, as the Crown have contended throughout, was always a partnership of equals.   
 
In relation to the minimum term to be served, it has been common ground before me that 
the starting point in this case, having regard to the relevant statutory provisions, is 15 years 
imprisonment.  That, however, is only the starting point.  Each case will depend on its own 
particular facts, as will the level of overall seriousness.  There are in this case exceptionally 
serious aggravating features, as the facts I have set out demonstrate.   
 
At the time he was murdered Daniel was just 4 years old and was therefore particularly 
vulnerable because of his young age.  However, his vulnerability was considerably increased 
by his wretched physical condition, which rendered him completely defenceless. 
 
I am satisfied that acts of brutality were inflicted on him in the minutes before the final 
blows to his head, including forcing him to eat salt and applying a form of cold water 
punishment in the bath, thereby inflicting serious mental and physical suffering upon Daniel 
immediately before his death.  
 
After the blows to his head there may have been a lucid interval which, though short‐lived, 
would have resulted in Daniel suffering fear, anguish and physical pain before he lost 

Page 4 of 6
--------
consciousness.  Further, for the reasons already set out in detail, Daniel had already been 
subjected to persistent and escalating cruelty on an unprecedented scale over the course of 
approximately 6 months before he died, which was plainly designed to cause him, and must 
have caused him significant mental and physical suffering.  Your concerted, deliberate and 
prolonged starvation of Daniel is particularly grave. There was also an earlier serious fracture 
to his arm, deliberately inflicted, when you delayed in seeking prompt medical treatment for 
him, causing him severe pain and distress. 
 
Both of you are in breach of what is probably the most important position of trust, as the 
parents of a small child who was entitled to their protection, their love and their care.  Your 
breach of trust, Magdelena Luczak, is wholly irreconcilable with the loving care that a 
mother should show towards her own son.  
 
Both of you carried out a deliberate and cynical deception of teaching, welfare and medical 
personnel, which was designed to conceal what was happening, to prevent any help being 
provided for Daniel and to enable you to continue your ill treatment of him without 
interference.  You instructed and encouraged Daniel’s older [sibling] to tell lies to anyone in 
authority about what was happening at home. 
 
Once you became aware that Daniel had stopped breathing, you made a concerted and 
deliberate attempt to deceive the authorities from the outset, and to seek to remove 
evidence of your involvement in Daniel’s abuse and death. 
 
I have listened carefully to all the matters your counsel have advanced by way of mitigation, 
but in my judgment there are no real mitigating features in this case.  The fact that you 
intended to cause Daniel really serious bodily harm, rather than to kill him, in my judgment 
provides minimal mitigation in this case.  This is one of those rare cases where the sustained 
campaign of cruelty you carried out over many months, which culminated in the fatal blows 
to his head, amounted in my judgment to conduct likely to cause or which may possibly have 
caused Daniel’s death, notwithstanding that such a consequence may have been 
unintended.   The level of culpability for each of you is extremely high. Your expressions of 
regret and sorrow made now ring hollow in the circumstances of this case.  
 
I shall direct that the period of days, which each of you has already spent in custody on 
remand, are to be deducted from the minimum term that each of you is to serve, and which 
I will now pronounce.  In your case, Mariusz Krezolek, I am told that is a period of 345 days; 
and in your case, Magdelena Luczak, it is 510 days.  But if either period is later shown to be 
incorrectly calculated it can be amended administratively.  
 
On Count 4, the charge of child cruelty to which you pleaded guilty on a limited basis not 
accepted by the Crown, I shall order that there is no separate penalty in the circumstances.    
  
I emphasise that the minimum term I now specify is the minimum amount of time that you 
will spend in prison, from the date of sentence, before the Parole Board can even consider 
whether you might be released.   If it remains necessary for the protection of the public you 
will continue to be detained in custody after that date. You will in any event remain on 
licence for the rest of your life.   

Page 5 of 6
--------
In all the circumstances, and having regard to what I consider are exceptionally serious 
aggravating features, I judge this case to be one where the overall seriousness is particularly 
high.  The minimum term that each of you is to serve will be 30 years imprisonment.

Lady Justice Rafferty: 
 

R v Sheard 

In reliance on the provisions of S36 CJA 1988 this is an application by HM AG for 
leave  to  refer  to  this  court  as  unduly  lenient  a  sentence  of  three  and  a  half  years’ 
detention in a young offender institution imposed on 21st March 2013 in the Crown 
Court  sitting  at  Sheffield  upon  Jordan  Sheard.  He  had  earlier  pleaded  guilty  to 
manslaughter. Born on 17th March 1993 JS is 20 years old. We give leave. 

Steven Simpson, born on 22nd June 1994 died on 24th June 2012 as a result of burns 
sustained at his 18th birthday party two days earlier. He was vulnerable – he suffered 
Asperger’s  syndrome,  was  speech-impaired, epileptic, and had learning difficulties. 
 
He lived alone in a flat and attended Barnsley College and a Youth Club. Openly gay, 
he  was  described  as  sociable,  with  a  large  circle  of  friends,  a  very  nice  lad  who 
wouldn’t hurt a fly. His friend Miss Sweeney said he  was “easily influenced and if he 
firstly refuses to do what is asked of him, people know that if they badger him and 
ask him again and again he will eventually do what is asked.” He was “easily led and 
suggestible.” 

On Friday 22nd June 2012 Steven held a party at his flat to celebrate his 18th birthday. 
He had invited a number of his friends from the Youth Club. At about 9 p.m JS,  then 
19, turned up with others. Steven said that he had invited them but did not seem too 
sure about it. 

In the course of the evening, a great deal of alcohol was drunk. 

JS and his friends tried to persuade Steven to remove his clothes, chanting, “Strip! 
Strip! Strip!” At first apparently reluctant Steven stripped down to his boxer shorts, 
events still seen by Miss Sweeney as good-natured fun, but there followed an amount 
of  horseplay.  Steven  did  not  by  then  seem  happy.  As  the  evening  wore  on  he  had 
more  and  more  to  drink.  JS  mocked   him  calling  him,  “a  gay  cunt.”  He  wrote  on 
Steven’s  stomach,  “I  love  dick”.  He  also  wrote  on  Reece  Thompson’s  stomach  “I 
love Jordan”. Someone drew a penis and testicles on Steven’s face. “Gay boy” was 
written on the bathroom door. 

   

At  about  11p.m.,  police  attended  after  a  complaint  about  the  noise.  The  party 
continued after the police had gone. 

A witness saw Steven, fully dressed again, angry and telling JS and Brendan King to 
 
get out of his bedroom. He said they had been “trashing it”. JS and King came out, JS 
holding a small hammer. Miss Murphy took it and told him off. He laughed at her. 
His plea of guilty was accepted on the basis he had found in Steven’s bedroom two 
youths causing damage, gone into the bedroom to stop them. seen and removed the 
hammer. 

 

Horseplay  resumed,  Steven  and  JS  dancing  with  their  trousers  at  their  ankles.  By 
about 2 a.m., a number had left. Steven was in a bedroom with JS, Thompson, King 
and  two  others.  Steven’s  trousers  had  been  pulled  down  and  his  genitals  exposed. 
Thompson  had  sprayed  him  with  tanning  oil.  The  bottle  label  shows  a  warning  in 
small  print  that  its  contents  were  flammable.  Steven  did  not  object;  indeed,  he 
appeared still to be enjoying himself.

JS held a lit cigarette lighter to Steven’s groin. Steven immediately caught fire and 
ran into the sitting room, the lower half of his body engulfed in flames. A guest  tried 
with his bare hands to extinguish the flames. Material from Steven’s trousers stuck to 
his hands. Using his own top, he tried to smother the flames. He rang 999. Those who 
had been in the bedroom with Steven ran from the flat.  

By  the  time  the  ambulance  crew  arrived,  Steven  was  in  a  bath  of  cold  water  and 
 
appeared calm. P.C. Taylor asked what had happened. Steven said, “I didn’t want to. 
They sprayed fire lighter on my dick and set fire to me. I think it was Reece. After 
that, I dunno what happened.”  He suffered 60% burns, in large part full thickness. 
He was transferred to a specialist burns unit. 

 

Later  that  day  Steven  told  his  father  he  and  others  had  been  “messing  about  with 
tanning lotion.” The next thing he could remember was going up in flames. He told 
the  police  that  he  had  invited  three  named  friends,  others  he  did  not  know  arrived 
uninvited.  He  remembered  Thompson  squirting  him  with  a  bottle  of  liquid  – 
including on his penis. Someone put a lighter to his penis and set it alight. 

 

He died the following day. 

After running away JS returned to the area and was arrested at 3.15 a.m. He said, “I 
burnt my hand trying to take his trousers off when he was on fire.” He had partial 
 
thickness burns to three of the fingers of one hand.  

Interviewed, he first claimed Steven had set himself alight but later admitted having 
 
held the lighter to Steven’s groin. He said others in the room said, “’Light it, light it. 
See what it does.’ And like an idiot I did.” 

He said that he had expected the oil to have flared up and burned out without causing 
injury. He said that he had previously deliberately set his own pubic hair alight. He 
claimed he had not intended to cause any injury. He would not have acted as he did 
had he been sober. 

 
16.	 

A Basis of Plea read: 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

Steven had invited JS to the party earlier that day; 

Two others had been causing damage in Steven’s bedroom. JS went in to stop 
them. Once inside he had seen a hammer and picked it up to remove it from 
harm’s way;  

He had freely involved himself in what he saw as “good-natured horseplay.” 
He and others had sprayed Steven with shaving foam and written on his body. 
References to Steven’s sexuality had been part of this horseplay. Steven had 
been enjoying himself and had gone along with it; 

Others had egged on JS into lighting the cigarette lighter. He had not given 
any thought to the consequences. The risk of injury would have been obvious 
 
to anyone sober; 

 
v) 

He had tried to extinguish the flames and burnt his hands in the process;
--------

R v Sheard 

 
vi)	 

He ran away in panic and soon returned. 
 

 
17.	 

 
18.	 

The Crown did not accept (iii) and (iv). It was necessary to resolve the question of 
bullying/horseplay  and  whether  JS  had  been  encouraged  to  act  as  he  did.    It  was 
 
agreed with the defence that a Newton hearing (“a Newton”) could be conducted on 
 
the papers and it was listed on 21st March 2013. 

 

The Judge expressed some surprise at how it was proposed the issues should be dealt 
with. Nonetheless, faced with agreement at the Bar, he agreed to resolve the matter on 
 
the papers. 

The Crown submitted that what had taken place amounted to cruel behaviour towards 
 
a vulnerable target; and that there was no evidence to support the claim that JS had 
been egged on. Mr Smith for JS submitted that the Judge could not be sure that what 
had  gone  on  had  been  as  a  result  either  of  the  victim’s  vulnerability  or  his 
 
homosexuality.  Counsel  accepted  that  were  the  contrary  true  it  would  be  a  serious 
aggravating feature. 

 

19.	  Mr.  Smith  raised  the  extent  to  which  JS  would  have  been  aware  of  Steven’s 
 
disabilities: the Crown appeared to be able to prove no more than that JS and Steven 
might have met before but there was no evidence they had known each other “very 
 
well.” Absent detailed knowledge it would have looked as though Steven had been 
 
“going  along  with  this  raucous,  boisterous  activity”.  Mr.  Smith  contended  no 
evidence pointed to anyone having discouraged JS though it did not matter greatly.  

 

 
20.	 

 
21.	 

The Judge made plain he would hear any evidence Mr. Smith wished to call and if JS 
chose  not  to  give  evidence  that  would  not  be  held  against  him.  Mr.  Smith  took 
instructions and called no evidence. 

The Judge pointed out that the Crown had not drawn to his attention anything to show 
JS was aware of the difficulties from which Steven suffered.  The evidence had to be 
seen in the context of the timescale of some five hours. JS and his friends had made 
references  to  Steven’s  homosexuality  and  were  “ribbing”  him.  However,  “There  is 
also evidence that JS involved himself in homosexual play and no evidence I can find 
 
that SS objected to what was taking place. The only evidence to which I have been 
referred  indicated  that  he  was  having  a  good  time,  as  were  others…The  Crown 
submits it’s irrelevant whether or not he appeared to be enjoying himself because he 
could not make an informed decision. The Crown has drawn no evidence whatsoever 
to my attention to support that submission and it is not something that can be inferred 
from  the  evidence……I  apply  the  test:  has  the  Crown  made  me  sure  that  this  was 
 
cruel behaviour towards a vulnerable, easy target? It falls very far short of making me 
 
sure,  and  therefore  the  defendant  is  entitled  to  be  sentenced  on  the  basis  he  put 
forward……the  Crown  has  no  evidence  to  contradict  what  the  defendant  is  saying 
[about anyone discouraging him] and asks me to infer from silence on the point from 
other witnesses that it did not happen. It is not a properly constructed argument. So, 
again, the Crown has not persuaded me so that I am sure that they are right and the 
defendant is entitled to be sentenced on the basis that he put forward”. 

 

 
22.	 

To the author of the psychiatric report, Dr. Hayes, JS appeared “very subdued and 
overwhelmed by the results of his prank”. He exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic
--------

R v Sheard 

stress disorder as a result of what had happened. The author of the pre-sentence report 
felt this offence an aberration unlikely to be repeated. 

Aggravating features for which the Attorney General argues. 

 
23.	 

Assuming JS knew little or nothing of Steven’s vulnerability before the party (albeit 
he should at least have known of his speech impairment), over five hours he realised 
Steven tolerated or endured the following: 

 

24.	  Mockery of the size of his penis, homophobic abuse verbal and written, damage to his 
bedroom,  removal  of  his  clothes,  and  oil  sprayed  on  his  genitals  whilst  a  crowd 
looked on. There was ample evidence to tell JS that Steven was vulnerable and taken 
advantage of (sic). The finding of the Judge to the contrary was wrong. Horseplay 
turned into bullying. 

 
25.	 

 
26.	 

 
27.	 

 
28.	 

Aware a guest said “Light it, light it – see what it does” on his own account JS took a 
risk as to the consequences. 

He fled albeit he returned. 

He first claimed Steven had set himself alight. 

Steven suffered terribly. 
 

Mitigating features conceded by the Attorney General. 

 
29.	 

Others also took advantage, He pleaded guilty. He is remorseful. He had been of good 
 
 
character. 

Developed arguments advanced before us 

 
30.	 

 
31.	 

 
32.	 

 
33.	 

The  AG  argues  that  the  Judge  paid  insufficient  regard  to  Steven’s  vulnerability,  to 
JS’s behaviour overall, to the highly dangerous nature of applying the lighter and to 
the terrible consequences. He took us to extracts from JS’s interviews under caution 
from which he distils the following as supporting that contention:- 

Told  he  had  been  identified  as  setting  Steven  alight,  JS  claimed  to  have  said,  “It 
weren’t  me,  Steven,  was  it?”  Steven  agreed  and  pointed  at  someone  else.  The  AG 
suggests this makes it only too clear that JS had read the suggestibility of Steven. 

JS  said  “And  then  I  just  reached  forward,  ‘cos  somebody  said,  ‘Light  it,  see  what 
happens.’” 

He  fled  because  he  had  been  told  by  another  partygoer  that  he  would  get  twenty 
years. 

 

34.	  Walking past JS’s house Steven was asked if JS and his friends could come to the 
 
party. He had talked to Steven a few times. He denied knowing Steven had problems. 
He became distressed and insisted it had been an accident. 

 
35.	 

The Attorney-General accepts that the Crown should have made clear that JS and his 
 
friends had invited themselves and that Steven acquiesced. No reference was made to
--------

R v Sheard 

the hammer by the Crown during the Newton or in opening nor was it relied upon in 
 
mitigation.  Mr  Aylett  QC  for  the  AG  submits  that  the  only  way  for  the  Judge  to 
 
resolve factual disputes ensuring justice to both sides was by receiving oral evidence, 
from guests and, if JS chose, from JS. JS might have raised a doubt as to the Crown’s 
submissions.  Alternatively  he  had  already  given  contradictory  accounts  and  risked 
being  disbelieved.  The  responsibility  for  the  failure  to  call  evidence  rests  with  the 
Crown, Mr Aylett concedes. On the other hand, it was open to the Judge to ask for 
oral evidence. Indeed the Judge said he was “at a total loss to understand” why the 
case had been listed as it was. 

 

 
36.	 

Additionally, during the Newton the Crown failed to refer to evidence which might 
have affected the findings. Nothing was said about someone pulling down Steven’s 
boxers,  counsel  referred  only  to  someone  pulling  down  his  trousers,  someone 
mocking  the  size  of  Steven’s  penis,  the  suggestion  Steven  had  become  unhappy, 
someone  (per  Basis  of  Plea  not  JS)  trashing  Steven’s  bedroom,  that  Steven  had 
initially blamed another, and that JS tried to exploit Steven’s suggestibility by getting 
him to withdraw his accusation against JS and to blame someone else.  

 

The Ruling 

 
37.	 

 
38.	 

 
39.	 

The Attorney-General does not challenge the finding that JS had not set out to subject 
Steven  to  homophobic  bullying.  Nonetheless  he  argues  that  the  Judge  should  have 
found there came a time when JS realised Steven was vulnerable. JS and his friends 
 
had taken over and the party had become theirs. The Judge also set some store by 
 
events at the party being over a period of five hours. Since there was ample evidence 
that JS and his friends were taking advantage of Steven it was not necessary for the 
 
Crown to call evidence of Steven’s inability to make an informed decision. 

 

The Attorney-General does not quarrel with the finding that JS was egged on. “Light 
it,  see  what  it  does”  is  an  aggravating  feature,  importing  implicit  recognition  that 
 
setting oil alight carried some risk of bodily harm.  

The AG contends that assuming as he said he had done that the Judge had read all the 
 
papers, he should have realised, even as late as during submissions at the conclusion 
of the Newton, that there was more he needed to explore and he should have directed 
the calling of evidence. He could not of course have obliged JS to give evidence, but 
the Crown could certainly have been alerted to his analysis, and JS even if he stood 
 
firm in relying on the privilege against self-incrimination put in a position to make an 
informed decision.

deeper water he drowned. One offender dived in to try and save him. The offenders

years; allowing for their pleas seven-and-a-half years was imposed. What had taken

on  the  other  side  of  the  ground,  killing  him  instantly.  They  pleaded  guilty  to 
manslaughter by reason of gross negligence and on the basis they had thought it a 
flare not a rocket. They were sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. The Court of 
Appeal, concluding ignorance not malice, declined to interfere. 

In R v Whitbrook and Smith  [1998] 2 Cr. App. R. (S) 322,  the appellants, 17 and 18, 
placed a lit firework through the letter-box of a house. In the resultant fire a ten-year 
old  died.  They  pleaded  guilty  to  arson  being  reckless  as  to  whether  life  were 
 
endangered.  Their  appeals  against  sentences  of  three  and  of  three  and  a  half  years 
detention were dismissed. 

In R v K.C. [2005] 1 Cr. App. R. (S) 97, the appellant, 15, and two friends took it in 
turns to shut one another in a large metal waste container. The appellant was first shut 
in  then  the  victim.  Knowing  there  was  flammable  material  in  the  container,  but 
thinking the door easy to open, a view reasonably held, the appellant threw in a lit 
piece of paper. The door jammed and the victim died. The appellant was convicted of 
manslaughter after a trial in which he blamed others including the victim. Four years’ 
 
detention was reduced to three. 

In Lewis and Walker, the offenders directly exposed the victim to risk of death; in the 
other  cases  such  risk  was  more  tenuous.  The  Attorney-General  submits  that  while 
falling short of Lewis and Walker, this case is closer to it than to the other three cases 
 
cited, Flame had been applied to skin, so that JS exposed Steven to the risk of harm 
with the possibility of far more serious harm.  

 (R v 
All authorities cited preceded Attorney-General’s Reference (No. 60 of 2009)
 
Appleby) [2010] 2 Cr. App. R. (S) 46, which raised the sentencing bar for homicide. 
 
This case post-dated it. 

 

For JS Mr Smith explained that he relied on what he took to be an indication from the 
J in dialogue. During the Newton Mr Smith made what in a trial would be termed a 
 
submission of no case to answer. The Judge told him that the evidence could make 
him sure, and the emphasis was on “could”. Mr Smith thought he read the runes to 
indicate  that  a  finding  for  the  Crown  was  less  likely  than  likely  and  after  taking 
 
instructions called no evidence. It was a judgment call, similar to those made day in 
day  out  by  counsel  who  know  and  hope  to  read  a  Judge.  Mr  Smith  read  them 
 
correctly, if runes they were, because, without calling evidence, he succeeded. The J 
 
found for JS on both Newton issues. 

 

47.	  Mr Smith submits that consequently this court should pause to examine the effect of a 
conclusion that the sentence was unduly lenient. So to find would necessarily amount 
to our substituting for the findings of the Judge findings of our own because it would 
require us to take a view on the Newton issues adverse to JS. There is no possibility 
of remitting the matter to the Crown court for a rehearing of the Newton issues. It

R v Sheard 

 
follows  that  JS  has  lost  the  potential  advantage  of  giving  oral  evidence  during  the 
Newton. We see the force in that argument.  

Discussion and conclusion 

 
48.	 

A Judge - already surprised to find the Newton hearing listed without witnesses to 
attend  -  might  on  a  careful  reading  of  these  papers  have  been  prompted  to  review 
whether that were the appropriate course. We readily understand the AG’s contention 
 
that it was not. Hearing witnesses, called not only for the Crown but potentially also 
for JS, could so have affected the Judge’s findings as to inform his assessment of the 
appropriate loss of liberty. Equally, their tested evidence might have reinforced the 
view he took and led to the same or a yet more sympathetic sentencing outcome.  

 

 

49.	  We are wary of going further. Though each of us might have directed the attendance 
 
of witnesses the better to satisfy ourselves of the true position, we must be careful 
now to avoid reaching a confident conclusion without that very advantage.  

 
50.	 

Had  the  AG’s  contentions  been  supported  by  oral  evidence  during  the  Newton 
hearing the likelihood is that his appeal would have been allowed and the sentence 
quashed as unduly lenient. However, on the reasoning we have adopted JS lost the 
opportunity  to  present  himself  sympathetically  assuming  he  elected  to  give  oral 
evidence. It would not be fair or right to penalise him at this stage. 

51.	  We  decline  to  interfere  with  the  sentence  of  three  and  a  half  years  detention  in  a

jUDICIARY OF
ENGLAND AND WALES
The Queen v Wendell Wilberforce Baker
Central Criminal Court
28 June 2013
Sentencing Remarks of His Honour Judge Rook QC
1) You have been found guilty by a jury of a particularly grave case of rape.
2) You anally raped a 66—year—old woman in her own bedroom having broken into her home at
night. Up to that night she had always felt secure and safe in her home.
3) She lived on her own. She lived a quiet life. She was afraid of the dark. She slept in a
downstairs room as she was nervous and it made her feel better if she slept near the front door
especially if there was a fire.
4) This was a planned offence. You broke into her home to steal. There is a clear inference that
you targeted her because you somehow had acquired inside knowledge and you expected to find
money. She was awoken in the early hours to find you searching the downstairs room where she
slept. You were desperate for money and even searched the loft. When you failed to find any, you
decided to punish her by subjecting her to a brutal and vicious attack and by raping her.
5) You put a blanket over her head. Once you had done so, you tied her wrists together behind
her back with flex. You punched her in the face with your fists, and then worked downwards
punching her chest, and bare stomach. You asked if there was anyone else in the house and you said
”If I find anyone else, I'll kill you.""
6) You searched for money. When you returned you said ”Give me the money or I’ll murder
you."" Somehow you had learnt about her friend George. You said ""Does he ever fuck you because I’m
going to?”
7) You made her lean over the bed. You penetrated her anus with your penis. Clearly she
suffered great pain. Somehow you manoeuvered her to the hallway. You wanted her out of the way
so she would not raise the alarm or seek help. You took out the upright hoover so as to place her in a
cupboard.You put the bolt across which secures the cupboard from the outside. There were no inside
locks. There are shelves in the cupboard. They do not extend to the front leaving a small gap
between the shelves and the door when it is closed. This meant that she was trapped locked inside
that cupboard for many hours .Her legs were scrunched up to her chest. Her feet started to go numb.
She could not stand in the space because of the shelves. She was aware of the flex around her neck
--------
and under her chest. She had great difficulty breathing. Understandably she felt that she was going
to die.
8) It is likely that she would have died but for the fact that she was visited early the following
evening by her friend George Worpole. She went through hours of torment during her ordeal inside
that cupboard thinking she had been left for dead.
9) Fortunately, it was a Thursday. George would visit once a week on Thursdays. When he came
that evening, he could not let himself in through the front door as it was on the latch from the inside.
He sensed there was a problem when Hazel did not respond. He called the police and eventually she
was released from her grueling ordeal in that cupboard.
10) She was completely traumatised. She was black and blue. Her face was unrecognizable even
to her own son who states that it was only her voice that told him it was her. The photographs taken
at the time confirm this. The doctor who examined her found extensive bruising of her body. In
particular, there were bruises to her back with spare areas which show that you struck her with an
object. She stayed in hospital several weeks.
11) Quite apart from the physical injuries she suffered, Hazel Backwell was severely affected by
this dreadful attack. In short it ruined the last years of her life. She became more depressed and
reclusive. She lost her home and her cat. She lost all confidence and suffered from panic attacks. She
was too frightened to go out on her own. She moved several times as she did not feel secure and
moved to sheltered accommodation where animals are not allowed.
12) Sadly Hazel Backwell did not live to see her attacker finally brought to justice. In 2002 she
was admitted to Newham General Hospital and died a short while later. When a verdict of Not Guilty
was entered at your last trial in 1999 as a result of the law as it then appeared to be to the then—trial
judge, she felt completely let down. She never got over what happened to her in the early hours of
that morning.
13) Your actions have had impact well beyond the immediate impact upon the victim. I have had
the benefit of reading two statements from her son David Backwell. Your actions have put massive
pressure on both him and his wife, who have had to endure the pain of seeing Hazel Backwell go
downhill so rapidly after your attack.
14) Short of a case where the victim is actually murdered or caused a life threatening injury, it is
hard to think of a more serious example of the offence of rape of a person in their home. At the very
least, you were reckless as to whether Hazel Backwell would be rescued in time to save her life.
15) It is submitted on your behalf by Mr Newton that after a lifetime of regular criminal
offending, you have changed. There have been no offences for eight years. Your landlady and close
friend Terry Day, who has known you since 2004, spoke of you in glowing terms during the trial. I
have read a reference from Jak Miller to the same effect.
16) Mr Newton submits that a critical example is your drug use. He relies on evidence of what
you said in interview in October 1998. This evidence was not adduced by the Crown at your trial.
During the course of the interview you admitted that you were smoking a large amount of crack
cocaine in January 1997 having started in 1996. The amount you took would vary according to the
amount of money you had. You were claiming social benefits at the time. That was not enough to
meet your requirements.
17) Mr Newton argues that there is clear evidence that you have changed since 1997 as there is
no evidence of drug—taking during the last decade or so. I accept that you have no convictions for
Page 2 of4
--------
sexual offences. You have a number of convictions for burglary. However there is no evidence that
any of those convictions involved physical or sexual violence. You do have convictions for violence,
but nothing in this league. You assaulted your then—girlfriend in 1993 causing her actual bodily harm.
18) Mr Newton contends that the crack cocaine may provide an explanation for your conduct in
committing this offence (although you continue to deny your involvement.) It may explain why you
acted as thejury have found you did in 1997. Accordingly he invites me to treat the matter as out of
character. He submits that the combination of your improved record during the last 10 years and
your abandonment of drugs means that you are no longer a significant risk of causing serious harm
by committing serious offences.
19) I have noted that you have violent swings of mood and you still have every appearance of
having a short temper if matters do not go your way. I also note that I am dealing with a man who
committed an offence involving extreme violence and depravity when aged 40. It is difficult to accept
that anyone capable of such a crime when 40 does not continue to represent a substantial risk of
serious harm from the commission of further serious offences in his fifties.
20) I have to consider whether a discretionary life sentence is appropriate in this case to mark
the public abhorrence at your conduct. lam asked by both counsel to apply the principles in R v
Hodgson (1968) 52 Cr. App. R 113, as recently applied in R v D [2013] 1 Cr App R (S) 127, I have no
doubt that a life sentence is more than justified.
21) This was a truly grave case. The stark profoundly disturbing facts speak for themselves. On
any view such conduct must attract a long sentence.
22) From both the nature of the offence and your history it is clear that you are an unstable
character who may commit serious offences in the future which will involve serious physical or
psychological harm to members of the public. I have no doubt that, although you are now 56, you are
a dangerous man and will remain so for many years.
23) It follows that I have concluded that this offence with all the aggravating features I have set
out falls in the category of case which should and will attract the ultimate penal sanction — a life
sentence. Quite apart from the principle in Hodgson, in any event, in my view this is a case which
because of its exceptional gravity should attract a sentence of life imprisonment. See Red Saunders
and others [2013] EWCA Crim 1027.
24) I come to the appropriate length of the minimum term. I must have regard to the Definitive
Guideline in respect of sexual offences and the guideline case of Attorney—General's Reference (Nos
73, 75 of 2010, and 03 of 2011) ( Michael Anigbugu and others.) [2011] 2 Cr App R. (S) 100. In my
view on the basis of this case, the appropriate starting point must be over and above 15 years in the
light of the aggravating features of this case. Realistically, Mr Newton accepts this but argues that on
these facts I should not go significantly higher.
25) Locking your vulnerable victim in a cupboard where she might have died takes this case to a
different level of seriousness beyond the cases envisaged in the Attorney— General's reference and
the Definitive Guideline. In my view the appropriate starting point is 24 years.
26) Mr Newton asks me to make an allowance for (i) the delay in this case; (ii) an allied point in
relation to doublejeopardy; and (iii) the time spent in custody from October 1998 until the trial in
1999.

Page 3 of4
--------
27) I accept that you are not to blame for the delays that have occurred as a result of the long
history of this case. I also accept that as a result of double jeopardy you have no doubt suffered
distress and anxiety. However, in the face of the seriousness of this offence, these amount to very
limited mitigation, and I am only prepared to make a small allowance for these factors.
28) However I am satisfied that I should make appropriate allowance for the period you spent in
custody before your first trial. lam told that was nine months.
29) Taking into account these factors, I have concluded that the appropriate term, had this been
a determinate sentence is 21 years’ imprisonment.
30) It follows that the sentence of the court is life imprisonment with a minimum term of 10
years 6 months, less the 652 days you have spent in custody before the re—trial.
31) You must understand that that is the term you must serve before the Parole Board will be
entitled to release you if it is safe to so.
32) Notification requirements will apply in your case for the rest of your life.

MOHAMMED KARRAR, BASSAM KARRAR 

 

CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT 

 

27 JUNE 2013 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE PETER ROOK QC 

 
 
  1) You have been found guilty by a jury of a series of sexual crimes of the utmost 
gravity. The offences involved the exploitation and abuse of young, highly vulnerable 
girls in the Oxford area over a long period. 
  
   2) There are many aggravating features. On occasions the depravity was extreme.  
You targeted the young girls because they were vulnerable, under age and out of control.  
They tended to have troubled upbringings and unsettled home lives. You subjected them 
to repeated abuse. This was a pattern which repeated itself over and over again. With the 
exception of CD, the offences took place over long periods. 
 
  3) Each victim was “groomed”, coerced, and intimidated to facilitate the commission of 
the offences and to make the likelihood of them ever reporting them remote. This 
involved planning. You would build up their trust, providing them with drink, drugs and 
attention which they craved. The effect was that some complainants became addicted to 
drugs, whilst others had an existing habit hardened. You would develop power over the 
children which would drive a wedge between them and their parents. If a girl showed 
reluctance, you would enforce compliance with threats and brutality. In some cases it 
may not have been in day-to-day control, but you were in a position to enforce your 
power over them when you wanted to do so. 
  
4) Each of the first four complainants felt both fear and misguided loyalty to you. They 
were reluctant to tell the authorities what you were doing to them.  Police and social 
services missed tell tale signs. Their sexualized behaviour was misunderstood. 
 
 5) No doubt you committed these terrible crimes in the belief that these girls would 
never be believed. No doubt this encouraged you to carry on your depraved conduct. 
  

 

1
--------
6) We have heard about a sub-culture in the Cowley Road where there was little moral 
compass and little or no effort to control. The defence have gone so far as to suggest there 
was a willful blindness by the authorities. Whether that be right or not, it does not in any 
way justify your actions. 
 
  7) Assad Hussein and Zeshan Ahmed: You have both been found guilty of two 
serious offences under s.9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Again your victims were 
under age vulnerable girls who had been given drink and drugs to make them more 
malleable as you well knew. I shall sentence you both after sentencing the other five. 
 
 8)  The complainants:  Each of these six young girls have showed enormous courage in 
coming to the Old Bailey to give evidence 

(i) knowing that they would be accused of lying 
(ii) knowing they would have to re-live their ordeals 
(iii) knowing they have not been believed by the authorities in the past. 
  

 9) The jury has found that they came to this court to tell the truth. It is to be hoped that 
their courage in coming forward to give evidence has not only exposed your activities but 
will send a message to and act as a deterrent to others who are tempted to act in this way. 
Furthermore, it is to be hoped that lessons will be learnt and the appropriate authorities 
will not fail in the future to take appropriate action in the face of evidence of such 
activities.   
 
10) In my sentencing remarks I propose to give each the victims anonymous initials 
reflecting the order of the counts on the indictment: AB (1), CD (2), EF (3), GH (4), IJ 
(5) , KL (6). 
 
 11)  I am grateful for very full pre-sentence reports upon each defendant. The respective 
authors have put in a great deal of work to assist me in this sentencing exercise. When 
dealing with the facts of this case, they did not have the benefit of hearing the evidence. I 
will sentence only upon the basis of matters borne out by the evidence. 
 
 12)   I must have regard to the Sexual Offences Definitive Guidelines. I accept, as do all 
counsel, in respect of the first three defendants and the fifth and sixth defendant, that 
these cases fall outside the cases envisaged in the guidelines in the sense that the 
combination of offences takes them above the highest categories in the guidelines. To 
that extent I will depart from the guidelines. However, I will take into account where 
present the aggravating and mitigating factors identified in the guideline. I will seek to 
pass sentences which are proportionate to the recommendations in the guideline, and I 
will apply the totality principle in all cases.   
 
 13) I wish to begin by considering the impact of your actions upon your victims, and 
their families, as there can be no doubt that you have blighted their lives and robbed them 
of their adolescence.  There can be no doubt that your activities have caused them 
immense psychological harm. In some instances you have put their parents through many 
days of torment and distress. 

 

2
--------
14)  AB: At various stages she was the victim of the activities of three of you - Akhtar 
Dogar, Anjum Dogar, Kamar Jamil.  I have read victim statements from AB’s parents, 
and a victim personal statement from AB herself.  AB writes that since the abuse began 
she has suffered ongoing emotional and psychological issues. She has been diagnosed 
with Post Traumatic Distress Disorder, and suffers from bouts of anxiety and depression 
as a result of this. She suffers from self-loathing. She has difficulties in relationships. She 
has completely lost self-confidence. She missed out on much of her education from the 
start of secondary school when she had shown so much early potential. It is a great credit 
to her that notwithstanding these setbacks, she has six-seven years afterwards managed to 
have successful jobs. 
  
 15)  Her parents’ statements, and their evidence during the trial, have revealed the 
devastating effect your actions have had on the family. How the parents looked on as 
their bright intelligent loving open little girl turned into a sullen, secretive, evasive, and 
frightened girl who lost all ambition for the future. Inevitably they have feelings of anger 
and guilt. As a result of your actions, their daughter has been changed forever. You put 
not just AB but her family through years of sheer torture depriving AB of her teenager 
years. Instead of enjoying a proper family life, they went through years of distress, upset, 
anger, fear and helplessness. Her parents were made to feel powerless whilst their child 
had become entangled in something truly evil. They recognise that it was your actions 
that caused this. However, it is hardly surprising that they feel that these emotions were 
compounded by failures within the social care system, the criminal justice system and the 
police service. As a family they felt isolated even from their own extended family.  
 
16) EF:At various stages she was the victim of the activities of four of you - Akhtar 
Dogar, Anjum Dogar, Mohammed Karrar, and Bassam Karrar. I have read a victim 
personal statement from EF’s mother. She says that she does not think her daughter will 
ever get over it. She lost half her childhood and almost all of her secondary education as a 
result of the abuse she suffered. She has totally changed. She is now ultra fearful and 
cautious and is unable to enjoy the sorts of activities a young person of her age should be 
able to.  She suffers from nightmares, panic attacks and flash backs and is being treated 
for depression. Despite being the victim she carries with her a great burden of shame and 
embarrassment about what happened. Her courage in giving evidence in this case and 
having to re-live experiences made her so anxious that she had to give up her college 
course. 
 
17) Her mother was working hard to establish a real bond and win her trust. She did not 
know she would be struggling against the influence of a gang who used every tactic to 
turn her against her mother to the extent that EF would be seriously violent towards her if 
she tried to stand between her and them. 
 
18)   Inevitably your activities took its toll upon her mother. Hunting the streets for her 
night after night and driving all over southern England to pick her up when she surfaced 
from the latest trafficking episode took its toll upon her mother emotionally and 
physically. Threats meant that her mother had to sell their home and flee from Oxford.  

 

3
--------
19) AKHTAR DOGAR, ANJUM DOGAR, KAMAR JAMIL:  Akhtar Dogar, 
Anjum Dogar Your depraved conduct involved the brutal sexual exploitation of three 
young vulnerable girls. On occasions, you Akhtar Dogar and Anjum Dogar acted with 
great brutality.Kamar Jamil  You were involved in the exploitation of 2 of those girls.  
  
AB:  You Akhtar Dogar have been convicted of six counts against AB - one of vaginal 
rape, two of oral rape, one of anal rape, one of conspiracy to rape, one of arranging child 
prostitution.  
    You Anjum Dogar, you have been convicted of four counts against AB – one count of 
oral, one of vaginal rape, one of conspiracy to rape, and one of arranging child 
prostitution.  
     You, Kamar Jamil, have been convicted of five counts against AB – one of vaginal 
rape, two of oral rape, one of conspiracy to rape, and one of arranging child prostitution.  
 
 20) You robbed AB of her early teenage years. You started to abuse her from the time 
she was 13. It is true that she was already absconding and had take drugs. You took it to a 
different level. You targeted her. She was highly vulnerable and easy prey for you. You 
groomed her with drink, drugs, trinkets and attention. You well knew her age. You made 
her feel that she had to comply with your wishes. To enforce your demands, you told her 
that you’d come and burn her house down, and burn her little brother. She believed you 
and it was always in the back of her mind. 
 
21) Quite apart from using her for your own sexual self-gratification, you coerced her 
into providing sex to vast numbers of strangers.  Up to four or five men would be invited 
to addresses so they could have sex with her. Men were brought from Bradford, Leeds, 
Slough and London. Sometimes the sex would be photographed no doubt to lure more 
customers. Men would say they had come a long way to see her.  AB describes you and 
the men who would come as having a “pack mentality.”   You were oblivious as to what 
was happening to her. She became emotionally and physically exhausted. Threats were 
made to kill her. Your only concerns were your own self-gratification and the satisfaction 
of your customers so you could achieve commercial gain from arranging for others to 
abuse her. If she resisted, she would be coerced. Customers would become angry. For 
instance if oral sex was required, her head would be pushed down, her hair pulled and she 
would be slapped.  Strangers would burn her with cigarettes. A stranger almost throttled 
her. One deliberately scratched her vagina with his nails. One inserted a hairbrush into 
her vagina.  
 
22) One of the rapes of which you have all three been convicted relates to the terrifying 
ordeal to which you subjected AB at Shotover Woods [Count 10].  This episode provides 
a graphic example of how you would react if she failed to comply. AB pretended she had 
a period to avoid sex. You, Akhtar, reacted by putting your hand down her trousers so as 
to check whether this was true. You Akhtar, Anjum and Kamar Jamil then embarked 
upon a wicked plan to punish her for lying. At night you took her to a remote car park up 
a hill near Shotover Woods. It was pitch black. You ignored her pleading. You made her 
get down to her knees and forced her to give each of you oral sex. You subjected her to 

 

4
--------
verbal abuse telling her that she knew what they do to pigs, and they were going to cut 
her throat if she did not comply.” It is a clear inference that you had invited others to join 
you. Another car arrived within 10 to 15 minutes. There were four men in that car. She 
was made to give oral sex to all four. She said they were all encouraging each other. You 
then abandoned her. Ironically, so pitiful was the state in which you left her, she had to 
contact you as she felt there was no one else she could turn to in the circumstances. 
  
23) Your conduct continued until she was 15 over a period of about two years with 
breaks when she was placed out of the county in the care system. Her mother describes 
how by that time there was not much left of her apart from aggression. You took her soul. 
She felt as though it had been ripped out. She hated herself at the time. You put her 
parents through years of sheer torture.  
 
24)   CD: AKHTAR DOGAR, ANJUM DOGAR, KAMAR JAMIL You have all been 
convicted of one count of conspiracy to rape (Count 12) which relates to providing CD 
for penetrative sex with others. You Akhtar Dogar and Anjum Dogar have each been 
convicted of separate counts involving oral rapes by each of you upon CD (Count 12). 
You Kamar Jamil apart from conspiracy to rape and two counts of rape relating to same 
episode when you with others took CD by car to near a lake (Counts 11A, 11B).   
 
 25) CD was a very shy young girl looked her young age. She was emotionally very 
immature. She was extremely vulnerable. She was introduced to you by AB, and you 
immediately exploited her. All three of you would take CD to various places. Sometimes 
you would invite other men to come and have sex with her. You would get her drunk 
before the men had sex with her. True the offending was shorter than in other cases and 
lasted less than seven weeks over the late summer of 2006. Nevertheless I regard this 
sexual exploitation as very grave. 
 
25)  You,Akhtar, on one occasion forced her to have sex with you (Count 14). You 
Anjum pressurized her into giving you oral sex pulling her head down (Count 15). You, 
Akhtar, changed from presenting as “nice “ to becoming “threatening”, grabbing, pulling 
her, and threatening her with a gun. You, Anjum, also changed from presenting as 
“nice”to becoming threatening saying he had a “gun.” You Kamar Jamil with another 
man took CD in a car to a quiet place near a lake where you raped her first orally and 
then vaginally. You grabbed her ponytail and forced her head onto your penis. You then 
raped her vaginally. She felt she had no choice with two men in a car in a remote place. 
You fully participated in these offences. However, I accept from what CD said about you, 
your offences against her were not accompanied by same brutality as in the case of your 
co-defendants.  
 
 26)  EF: Akhtar Dogar, Anjum Dogar:   You have been convicted of one count of 
conspiracy to rape, one of trafficking and one of arranging child prostitution (Counts 16, 
18, 19).  Akhtar Dogar: on three occasions, you both took EF to the Nanford Guest House 
to provide sex to men who were strangers to her. You both groomed her for the task by 
plying her with drugs.  No doubt theses strangers were your customers who were paying 
you for providing EF.

Anjum Dogar, you were acting with your brother on two occasions. On a fourth occasion, 
acting together, you both rang EF at night summoning her into your car where you forced 
her to give oral sex to one of, your customers by pulling her head down onto his penis. 
You AnjumDogar subjercted her to degrading and humiliating verbal abuse at the same 
time. 
 
 27) Akhtar Dogar, you are now aged 29. I accept that you have no previous convictions 
for sexual offences. I have read references from those who speak well of you. Anjum 
Dogar, you are now aged 31. Again I accept that you have no previous convictions for 
sexual offences.  
      First, I have to consider on the information before me whether each of you are 
dangerous. In particular I have to decide whether there is a significant risk to members of 
the public of serious harm by the commission by you of further specified 
offences.S.225(1) (b) CJA 2003. 
 
28)  I have considered cumulatively (i) the young age of your three victims and their 
vulnerability; (ii) the manner in which they were targeted, groomed and abused; (iii) the 
number of strangers who you arranged to come and have sex with them and the depraved 
sex that occurred on occasions; (iv) the repeated abuse and the length of time during 
which it occurred , particularly in the case of AB; (v) the serious psychological harm your  
actions have caused. I have read the pre-sentence reports. The authors are of the clear 
view that you do represent such a risk. I have made an allowance for the fact that the 
authors have not heard the evidence. However, I have no doubt given this catalogue of 
offending over a protracted period as well as evidence of your continued preoccupation 
with young girls after the time of these offences, that you do represent such a risk, and 
that risk will continue for many years. It is impossible at this stage to say how long you 
will remain dangerous. I do not consider that a determinate sentence or an extended 
sentence combined with a SOPO would eliminate or sufficiently reduce the risk, or 
sufficiently mark the exceptional gravity of this case.  . 
  
29) Second, I MUST impose a sentence for imprisonment for life if I consider that the 
seriousness of the offence, or of the offence and one of more offences associated with it, 
is such as to justify the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life. S. 225(2)(b) 
CJA 2003. 
 
 30) I have come to that conclusion without hesitation in both your cases. The three 
conspiracies to rape against separate victims (Counts 3, 12 and 16) were exceptionally 
grave crimes. Count 10 (Shotover Woods) was an offence involving extreme depravity. 
  
 31)  In any event, I have concluded your offending is particularly grave and your 
culpability is particularly high. It follows that, in my judgement, in any event, the 
seriousness is such that a life sentence would have a denunciatory value reflecting of 
public abhorrence for the crime. 
  

 

6
--------
32) The sentences are Akhtar Dogar: Counts 3, 12, and 16 the conspiracies to rape: Life 
imprisonment with a minimum sentence of 17 years. (From this will be deducted the time 
you have already spent in custody. 460 days)  Count 10: 20 years imprisonment 
(concurrent)   Counts 2, 7, 8, 14 : 10 years imprisonment (concurrent). Counts 6, 18, 19:  
8 years imprisonment (concurrent). 
   
 33) The totality of your offending is reflected in the minimum sentences that I have 
passed. To avoid any misunderstanding, let me make it clear that the minimum sentence 
of 17 years is the equivalent of determinate sentences of 34 years. Even after serving the 
minimum sentence, you will only be released if the Parole Board considers that it is safe 
to do so. 
  
 34)  Looking at the overall position as to your culpability and the seriousness of the 
offences,  I see no reason to distinguish between Akhtar Dogar  and his older brother 
Anjum Dogar. The sentences are Anjum Dogar: Counts 3, 12, 16 - the conspiracies to 
rape: Life imprisonment with a minimum sentence of 17 years.  This minimum sentence 
reflects your overall criminality. It is the equivalent of 34 years determinate 
imprisonment. The time you have spent already in custody will be deducted from that 
minimum sentence. It is only after you have served that minimum sentence that the 
Parole Board will be entitled to consider whether it is safe to release you.  All other 
sentences will be concurrent to the life sentences.  Counts 2, 15: 10 years imprisonment 
(concurrent). Count 10: 20 years imprisonment (concurrent), Counts 6, 18, 19:  8 years 
imprisonment (concurrent).   
 
35) Kamar Jamil: Miss O’Neill QC, on your behalf, has submitted in respect of the 
offences that (i) you were more of a follower than a prime mover; (ii) your involvement 
mat have arisen particularly because  you had access to vehicles; (iii) according to CD at 
least, your conduct did not become brutal; (iv) you voluntarily desisted in September 
2006; (v) in your cases there were two victims as opposed to three victims in respect of 
the Dogars. 
   
36) As to your personal mitigation, she has invited me to take account of fact that (i) you 
have produced numerous positive references from family and friends; (ii) you are a 
devoted husband and father of three children. It is clear to me that there was a significant 
change in your lifestyle in the years before your arrest for this matter, and you have been 
taking your family responsibilities very seriously. 
  
37)  It is accepted that you were not mentally ill at the time of the offences. However 
your mental condition has deteriorated. I have had the benefit of reading a psychological 
report prepared immediately before you gave evidence at your trial and a recent 
psychiatric report prepared by Dr Cumming at Belmarsh which indicates that you have 
developed psychotic symptoms and there is evidence of a complex set of delusionary 
beliefs. Your illness will be managed within the custodial setting. 
 
38) The author of the pre-sentence of the report assesses you as posing a high risk of 
serious harm to female children aged 11 to 16. I accept that you do pose a significant risk 

 

7
--------
of this at this stage. However, having considered all the information about you, I am not 
in a position to say that you would necessarily pose such a significant risk if there was a 
sentencing package in your case of an extended sentence and the SOPO that has been 
drafted. 
  
39)   I now come to consider whether in your case the case is of such exceptional gravity, 
it must be marked by a life sentence. I accept that you were a follower rather than a 
leader. The leadership role was played by the Dogar brothers. I accept that your conduct 
was not marked with same brutality. There were two victims rather than three. There is 
no evidence of criminal conduct towards either girl after September 2006. 
  
 40) Even taking all these matters into account, I consider your conduct was such as to 
warrant a life sentence. You willingly participated in the two conspiracies to rape. In 
respect of AB, the conspiracy involved AB being provided to large numbers of strangers 
for penetrative sex. These episodes lasted the best part of two years. You were fully 
participating in the group rape at Shotover designed to humiliate AB.  It follows that in 
your case, the conspiracies to rape will attract life sentences. The minimum term will 
reflect your lesser role. 
 
41) The sentences are: Counts 3 and 12: Life imprisonment with a minimum sentence of 
12 years. All other sentences will be concurrent to the life imprisonment. The minimum 
term reflects the totality of your offending. It is the equivalent to a determinate term of 24 
years. It is only after you have served that time that the Parole Board will be entitled to 
release you if they believe it is safe to do so. Count 10: 16 years. Counts 2, 9, 11A, 11B:   
10 years. Count s 6 and 13: 8 years. Such time as you have spent in custody (460 days) 
will be deducted from the minimum term.  
 
 
(42)  MOHAMMED KARRAR AND BASSAM KARRAR: You, Mohammed Karrar, 
have been convicted of two very serious offences against EF – conspiracy to rape her 
which involved arranging for men to come and rape her (Count 20) and trafficking her 
(Count 21). 
 
(43) EF had a particularly disrupted childhood having been placed with various foster 
parents. You met her when she was under 13. You knew her true age. You groomed her 
so that you would have a hold over her.  Wickedly, you turned against her mother. You 
got her hooked on drugs providing cannabis and cocaine. You had a complete disregard 
for her own welfare and treated her as if she was a commodity. 
 
From the time when EF was 13 you started selling her to other men for sex. To use her 
words this happened “loads of times” over the next few years.  Sometimes you would 
take photos presumably to entice further customers. Clearly it was a commercial 
operation. You would actually ask customers whether they were satisfied. 
  

 

8
--------
44) When she was 14 or 15, you started to instruct her to go to London. You’d make her 
meet men at Paddington station and provide them with sex. This happened on five or six 
occasions. 
  
45) Even at the end of 2009 / 2010 you were trying to lure EF to so-called parties where 
no doubt you wished her to provide sexual services to other men. When she refused, you 
threatened both EF and her mother. You terrified them. Over the phone you threatened to 
kill them. EF was not ready then to expose what you had been doing to her over the 
years, but at least the police were contacted to prevent this frightening harassment.  
 
46) You, Bassam Karrar, were not involved in the trafficking of EF. However have been 
convicted of a violent rape of EP on a specific occasion at the Nanford House (Count 22). 
  
 47) In November 2006 when she was 14 you took her to Nanford House for sex. She 
agreed. There came a time she wanted to go. However after taking cocaine, you would 
not let her go. She made it very clear she wanted to go home. Her mother would be 
worried. You insisted on further sex knowing that she was no longer consenting. You 
subjected her to a prolonged assault involving sexual and physical violence, degradation 
and humiliation. In particular, you became very angry. You jumped on top of her, pulled 
her hair, and forced her head onto your penis. You penetrated her vagina twice and 
ejaculated. At one stage, she could not breathe because your hands were tight around her 
neck and she felt that she was being throttled. You told her you were going to kill her. 
You also pushed her in the shower and urinated upon her. No doubt because you wanted 
to punish her and humiliate her.   
 
48) Mohammed Karrar, Bassam Karrar:  I now come to the dreadful offences you 
committed as against GH.  
 
GH (4): You, Mohammed Karrar, have been convicted of no less than 16 offences 
against GH. These include nine counts when she was under 13, six counts when she was 
well under 16, and one count when she was 17 and 18.

49)  Bassam Karrar, over and above the serious offence you committed against EF, you 
yourself, often acting with your older brother committed numerous offences upon GH:  
Three offences when she was under 13.  

COUNT 29 Rape of a child under 13   specimen vaginal  
COUNT 31 Conspiracy to rape a child under 13 - with Mohammed  taken to 
locations for sex with other men  
COUNT 32 Arranging child prostitution - with Mohammed 

 
Two offences where her age is unclear, and I must assume she was at : 

COUNT 33  Trafficking  - with Mohammed   11 – 15 ) 
COUNT 28  Conspiracy to rape   Spit roasting  age unclear ) 

 
Three offences when she was 13 or over:  

COUNT 35    Conspiracy to rape when J 13,14, 15 - with Mohammed 
COUNT 36    Arranging child prostitution   13,14,15 
COUNT 39    Rape when GH 13, 14, 15 specimen count 

 
50) You, Mohammed Karrar, were introduced to GH when she was only 11. It is a clear 
from the video clip we have seen, she was a small girl at the age of 12. You were in your 
thirties. [You knew that both her parents had profound disabilities, and at a very early age 
she shouldered a huge responsibility towards her parents. You would go to her home and 
smoke joints with her father who no doubt would have had no idea what you were doing 
to his daughter, including having sex with her at his home.] You anally raped her when 
she was 11. After a period of months when you groomed her, you were having regular 
oral, vaginal and anal sex with her. You duped her by telling her that you’d take her to 
Saudia Arabia and marry her when she was 15.  She became pregnant. Your reaction was 
to become angry with her and slap her. You took her to Reading so that an illegal 
abortion could be performed upon her at an underground so-called clinic. Clearly this was 
highly dangerous to her health. As always you had no regard to her welfare and the 
damage you were causing her.  She became obsessed with you, and you exploited her. 
 
51) There came at time before she was 13 that both of you Mohammed and Bassam 
Karrar started to bring strangers to have sex with her. You Bassam would organise the 
sessions. Mohammed was closely involved and would be at most of these sessions. These 

 

10
--------
occasions happened many times. You would make her act as a hostess at sex parties no 
doubt charging for her services.  If she did not want to have sex with the men, you both 
would get angry. She had to endure depraved sexual demands including the acting out of 
weird sex fantasies, and the insertion of objects in her vagina. If she kicked out, she 
would be restrained. If she said that she did not have sex. She said “Mo and Bassam 
would get mad at me.” You, Mohammed, made videos of GH performing sex acts no 
doubt with a view to selling her sexual services. 
  
51) You, Mohammed Karrar, took her to various places to provide sex to others – a hotel 
in Bournemouth, a flat near a school in Oxford. She was taken to High Wycombe for sex 
on a regular basis. Both of you took her to High Wycombe for sex with others. Bassam 
took her two or three times without Mohammed. Sometimes there were three or four men 
at a session. Sometimes as many as nine or ten. GH thought that Bassam was taking lots 
of phone calls in relation to the Wycombe trips where there would be sex acts and sexual 
fantasies acted upon. 
 
52) GH would hear both Mohammed and Bassam speaking to customers over the phone 
before going to the Nanford for sex. She was taken to Nanford House over 50 times. The 
charge would vary according to the sex act you’d make her perform. Mainly Mohammed 
would take her, but Bassam took her more than a couple of times. Sometimes she would 
be to taken to the Nanford twice or three times a week. 
  
53)  You, Mohammed Karrar, prepared her for gang anal rape by using a pump to expand 
her anal passage.  You subjected her to a gang rape by five or six men (count 30). At one 
point she had four men inside her. A red ball was placed in her mouth to keep her quiet. 
Not only were you both involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of  GH, you also 
used her for your own self-gratification. You both raped her when she was under 13. 
When she was very young, although it is not clear whether she was under 13, you both 
raped her at the same time (oral and vaginal/anal). It happened on more than one occasion 
(Count 28).  
 
54) Mohammed Karrar, on one occasion when GH was 12, after raping her, she 
threatened you with your lock knife. Your reaction was to pick up a baseball bat with a 
silver metal handle, strike her on the head with it, and then insert the baseball bat inside 
her vagina. You treated her as if she was your commodity. You branded her (with your 
initial near her anal passage) using a hot hair pin. If GH did not comply with your wishes, 
if you were not with other people, you would lose your temper with her. As part of the 
grooming, you would provide her with crack cocaine and you  injected GH with heroin 
on numerous occasions (Count 40). 
 
55) When she was not prepared to participate any more, you would issue terrible threats. 
Your activities took a heavy toll upon her both physically and mentally. In late 
2010/2011 she phoned you. You invited her to come and see you. You said “We’ll sort it 
and make it better.” Once there, you had an argument, and to exert your power and 
punish her, you pulled down her trousers and raped her.   
     

 

11
--------
56) Mohammed Karrar: I take into account that you have no previous convictions for 
sexual offences. However, these are very grave offences. You exhibited exceptional 
depravity both for your own sexual gratification and for your own commercial 
operations. Many of your activities involved planning. The sufferings of your two young 
vulnerable victims were extreme, and over a long period. I consider on all the information 
before me, including the pre-sentence report, that you do and will continue to represent a 
high risk of causing serious harm to young girls by the commission of  further specified 
offences. Your offences do fall into the category where only a life sentence can be 
justified.  
 
57)  Sentence: Counts 20, 31, 35: Life with a minimum term of 20 years imprisonment 
(concurrent.) That 20 years reflects the total criminality involved. It is the equivalent of a 
determinate sentence of 40 years. You will serve the minimum sentence less the time you 
have already spent in custody. It is only then that the Parole Board will be entitled to 
consider whether it is safe for you to be released.  
 
The sentences on the other counts will all be concurrent to the life sentence: 

Counts 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30,: 20 years 
Counts 37, 38 and 50: 17 years 
Counts 21,, ,24, , 32, 33, 36  and 40: 10 years. 

 
58) BASSAM KARRAR: You have no conviction for sexual offences and I take that 
into account. However your offending involves two victims. Whilst you were not 
involved in the trafficking of EF, you carried out a brutal and violent rape upon her when 
she was only 14 and very vulnerable and you sought to humiliate her. On its own that 
would attract a sentence of 17 years imprisonment following the guidelines. 
  
59) You were also well involved in both organising the commercial exploitation of GH 
from when she was under 13, and you used her for your own sexual gratification by 
making her perform grotesque sex acts such as is exhibited by count 28. I have to 
consider whether you meet the dangerousness criteria. I agree with the conclusion of the 
author of the pre-sentence report, and upon all the material before, principally the 
evidence in this long trial, you do pose a significant risk of serious harm to young girls 
from the commission of further offences. Furthermore, looking at your offending, I am 
unable to say how long that risk will continue. I cannot say that it will be sufficiently 
reduced by the imposition of an extended sentence combined with a SPO. In my view 
Counts 31 and 35 are offences of truly exceptional gravity, and your overall offending 
does fall into the category where only a life sentence can be justified.  
. 
60)  The sentences of the court are: Counts 31, 35: Life sentence with a minimum term of 
15 years. That is equivalent to a determinate sentence of 30 years. It means you will have 
to serve that minimum sentence less the time you have spent in custody.( 460 days).  
Only then will the Parole Board entitled to consider whether it is safe to release you. 
 
All other sentences are concurrent with the life sentences.:  

 

12
--------
Counts 22, 29, 39: 17 years 
Counts 28, 32: 20 years. 
Count 33, 36   10 years 

 
61)  ASSAD HUSSAIN: you have been convicted of two offences of sexual activity with 
a child under 16. There were two separate victims spanning a period of six to seven 
years: Count 4 sexual activity with a child, AB; Count 47 sexual activity with a child IJ. 
You are now aged 32. I accept that you were not an organiser. You exploited young girls 
for your own sexual gratification. 
  
62)  In my view you have a predatory sexual interest in young girls, and your actions 
show a callous disregard for the consequences of your actions. In respect of AB, during 
the period when she was being groomed and coerced into performing a series of violent 
and degrading sexual assaults at the hands of other men at pre-arranged events, you came 
to one of these events, and took advantage of AB and had vaginal sex with her. There are 
the following aggravating features. The nature of circumstances that led to AB being 
available for sex with you cannot have escaped your notice, although I accept that you 
had no hand in organising or arranging the event. You played no part in the corruption of 
AB, and there is no evidence that you paid for sex. In your case, there was no violence. 
However, there is a clear inference from the evidence that you would have been aware 
that AB was being passed around between men for sex. Since this was a specimen count, 
I sentence you on the basis that you had sex with her on just the one occasion. Of course, 
I accept the jury’s verdict that you may have reasonably believed she was consenting. 
  
63) I am quite satisfied that you attended the event in order to have sex with her. You 
well knew (i) she was under 16; (ii) she was being groomed to provide sex to you and 
others; and (iii) she was being plied with alcohol and drugs to achieve that object.  It 
follows that I regard this as an extremely serious example of this offence. You would 
have been at least ten years older than her. 
  
64) Some years later between July 2011 and December 2011, you took advantage of IJ, 
just 14 yrs old and approximately 16 years younger than you.  It would have been very 
clear that IJ, whatever the position was in respect of her physical maturity, was 
emotionally very immature. She was out of control and easily manipulated when under 
the influence of alcohol and drugs. During that weekend when she was back on Oxford to 
see her mother before Christmas. You took advantage of her and had vaginal sexual 
intercourse with her. You well knew that she was under age, and heavily under the 
influence of alcohol and drugs. No doubt because of the drugs and alcohol she has little 
or no recollection of the events of that weekend. No doubt you felt there was no chance 
that this would come to the notice of the authorities. The discovery of your DNA led to 
your apprehension. 
  
65) You appear unable to understand the exploitative nature of your relationship with IJ. I 
agree with the author of the pre-sentence report. You had sex with each of these young 
girls. Your actions will have compounded the harmful and damaging impact sexual abuse 
has had on their lives. 

 

13
--------
66)  I take into account that you have no history of sexual offending. Although you are 
not a person of previous good character, your convictions are of a different nature and 
have little or no relevance in the context of this case. I have regard to your personal 
circumstances. In particular you and your wife have lost two children because of a 
congenital defect. Sarah West, the author of the pre-sentence report, has concluded that 
you do pose a high risk of harm to females aged 12 to 16, presenting a medium risk 
likelihood of re-offending in this way. In the light of your roles in these offences, I am 
not able to say you represent a significant risk of serious harm to the public from the 
commission of specified offences. It follows that I conclude that the dangerousness 
criteria are not met. 
 
67) Following the guidelines the appropriate starting point for an offence of this nature 
under s.9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is four years. . As I have indicated that in 
respect of Count 4, there are aggravating features, not least your knowledge of the 
exploitative context and the involvement of other men. The sentence of this court is five 
years imprisonment. 
  
68) In respect of Count 47, this a further serious offence since you took advantage of a 
immature young girl over 10 years younger than you who would have been under the 
influence of alcohol. I accept the sexual activity was consensual, and there was no 
corruption. I take into account the principle of totality. The sentence is two years 
imprisonment to run consecutively to the sentence in respect of Count 4. It follows that 
the total sentence is one of seven years, You will serve half and be on licence for the 
remainder of your sentence.  I impose a SOPO in the terms of the draft order. It will be 
for an indefinite period.  
 
69) ZEESHAN AHMED: you have been convicted of two offences of sexual activity 
with a child under 16: Count 45, a specimen count in respect of vaginal intercourse on a 
number of occasions with IJ when she under 16. It is accepted that sex took place 
between five and ten occasions; and Count 49 vaginal intercourse with KL when she was 
aged 15. 
 
70) The jury has rejected your defence that you reasonably believed these girls were 
under 16 at the time. I have no doubt that you had and have a predatory sexual interest in 
young girls. You believed that somehow you had an entitlement to have your sexual 
needs met. You are now aged 28. At the time you were over ten years older than the girls 
you preyed upon. 
   
71) You first contacted IJ pretending to be someone else. You adopted various grooming 
strategies. You enticed her to your address. You would have been aware that she was 
emotionally immature and highly vulnerable to abuse. You were, at the very least, aware 
that at your premises IJ would have access to alcohol, cannabis and cocaine. You knew 
that this would have a disinhibiting effect upon her which would facilitate your abuse of 
her. You had no regard whatsoever to the effect your actions would have upon her.  No 

 

14
--------
doubt you thought that IJ would not go to the authorities, and, even if she did, she would 
not be believed. Your DNA was found on her clothing leading to your apprehension. 
 
72) During this period you also took advantage of KL when she was under the influence 
of drink. You well knew her age as she had told you when she was 14. I do not accept 
that there was any genuine friendship between you. You were manipulating the situation  
grooming her for your own sexual self-gratification without any thought as to the effect 
upon her. 
 
73) I take into account (i) the fact that there came a time when you ceased contact with IJ; 
(ii) you have no previous convictions for sexual offences; (ii) you have mental health 
issues and may have suffered from clinical depression. 
  
74) The author of the pre-sentence report Corina Johnson states that your attitudes 
towards substance misuse, sexual behaviour and gratification are all areas of concern. She 
is of the view that you present a high risk of serious harm to children (specifically 
females between the ages of 13-16). On the basis of the information before me 
(specifically the nature of your offending), I have no doubt that you do pose a significant 
risk in the future of serious harm to members of the public from the commission of 
specified offences. I need to consider whether there are interventions which could serve 
to reduce and/ or eliminate that risk. 
 
74) Corina Johnson has assessed that in retrospect, you do have an understanding of your 
sexual behaviour, and you could respond positively to a Sex Offender Treatment 
programme. It follows that sentencing package with a SOPO can be imposed with 
appropriate prohibitions in order to reduce the risk you pose. It follows I do not consider 
it necessary to pass an extended sentence in your case. 
 
75) Nevertheless these are serious matters. The starting point following the Guidelines is 
four years imprisonment. In respect of Count 45 (IJ), there are aggravating features. 
There were at least five occasions. This was not a genuine relationship. It was 
exploitation of a very immature young girl addicted to drink and drugs at a very young 
age. The sentence is five years imprisonment. As for Count 49(KL), I accept that she was 
15 at the time and there no violence. However, you knew her age, She had told you. She

Winchester Crown Court
 
 

 

 

2 July 2013
 
 
 

 

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Bean
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Jamie Boult, this is a shocking case. On 18 August last year you walked into the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home of an 85 year old lady, Delia Hughes, and battered her to death with a heavy 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lump hammer which you had brought to the scene from your home more than two 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

miles away.  Her death is a terrible loss to her daughter Beryl Catterall and to all her 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

family and friends. The jury this morning convicted you of murder. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

The sentence for murder is, as it must be, imprisonment for life. I turn to consider, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I am required to do by Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the minimum 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period which you must serve in prison. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

The starting point in an ordinary case of murder with a weapon taken to the scene 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  minimum  term  of  25  years.  But  in  this  case  your  victim  was  vulnerable  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenceless. I accept that you did not target her because of her age, and that the
--------
killing was random in the sense that you walked in through the open patio doors and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

killed the occupier who happened to be Mrs Hughes. Nevertheless the fact that she 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an 85 year old lady killed in her own home in the course of a burglary makes this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a particularly serious case. I have decided, therefore, that the starting point in this 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case before taking account of mitigating factors is a minimum term of 30 years. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     

I turn to mitigating factors. I take into account your previous good character; and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  handed  yourself  in  to  the  police  at  a  time  when  they  had  no  evidence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against you. I also accept that you were suffering from a persistent and chronic social 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anxiety disorder, a recognised medical condition which in the view of both expert 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses  gave  rise  to  some  abnormality  of  your  mental  functioning.  For  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of paragraph 11 of Schedule 21 that lowers the degree of culpability in this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, at least to some extent. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

     

I  consider  that  the  appropriate  minimum  term  is  25  years.  You  are  entitled  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit  for  the  288 days you  have  already  spent  on  remand  in  custody:  the  formal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order of the court will therefore specify a period of 24 years and 27 days from today. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  will  be  concurrent  sentences  of  9  years’  imprisonment  for  the  aggravated 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary of which the jury have convicted you and of 2 years’ imprisonment on the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

count of theft to which you have pleaded guilty. These will not affect the minimum 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period which you will spend in custody. By virtue of section 267 of the 2003 Act I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have taken them into account in assessing the minimum term to be served on count 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1, but set alongside the brutal murder of Delia Hughes the aggravated burglary only
--------
affects the minimum term very marginally and the theft count not at all. The axe and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hammer are to be forfeited and destroyed. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     

I emphasise that the 25 year term is the minimum that you will serve. I am not 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordering that you are to be released at the end of it. That will be a matter for the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Parole  Board  and  only  in  the  year  2037  will  they  be  entitled  for  the  first  time  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide whether it is safe to release you. Until and unless the Board is satisfied that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  no  longer  a  danger  to  the  public  you  will  remain  in  custody.  It  is  quite 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible that it will never be safe to release you. If the Board does ever release you, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you will remain on licence and liable to recall for the rest of your life.",2013-07-02 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

 ABDULRAHMAN 

BIRMINGHAM CROWN COURT 

20 JUNE 2013 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MRS JUSTICE THIRLWALL 

 

1.  Jaymin Abdulrahman, on 2nd September last year you gave birth to your baby 

daughter.  6 days later on the 8th you placed her in a black bin liner.  You placed the 

bin liner in the rubbish chute and closed the chute.  She fell from the 5th floor to the 

bins below.  She sustained catastrophic head injuries from which she will never 

recover.  She will be dependent on other people for the rest of her life. 

2.  You gave a false story to your husband and the police about the baby being abducted.  

That story was obvious nonsense, it wasted police resources and misled your 

husband.  It was many months before you were able to admit what you had done.  As 

a result you faced a trial for attempted murder with an alternative charge of causing 

grievous bodily harm with intent and, later, a further alternative of causing grievous 

bodily harm. 

3.  By the time the matter came before this court you had accepted that you were 

responsible for the injuries to your baby.  You were responsible for putting her into 

the rubbish chute with all those consequences.  You have expressed your remorse and 

I accept it is genuine.  I also accept that [redacted] was a much wanted baby who you 

looked after with great love and care until the events of the 8th September.   

4.   The jury have given the most careful consideration to this case.  You have been 

acquitted of attempted murder.  You have been acquitted of causing grievous bodily 

harm with intent.  That means that you did not intend either to kill or seriously to 

injure your baby.  It is of count 3, causing grievous bodily harm that you have been 

convicted.    To demonstrate the difference between the seriousness of the counts as 

many people in this courtroom will know attempted murder and causing grievous
--------
bodily harm with intent carry maximum sentences of life imprisonment.  Causing 

grievous bodily harm carries a maximum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. 

5.  That is the sentencing framework within which I deal with you.   
6.  It is quite clear from the verdicts that the jury were satisfied that you were or may 
have been suffering from post partum psychosis at the time you acted as you did.  

Anyone who sat through the whole of the trial will understand exactly how they came 

to that conclusion.  The evidence of the psychiatrists was that this condition occurs in 

1 in 500 new mothers.  Sometimes it is missed because, as in your case, the initial 

symptoms may be confused with other much less serious experiences that women 

undergo after giving birth.  In your case there was a particular difficulty because you 

spoke no English and were very reserved.  It was only when you were seen at length 

by a psychiatrist skilled in dealing with women who have just given birth that the 

diagnosis of post partum psychosis was made.   

7.  As the court has heard, in only a very few cases does this condition lead to tragedy as 
it did here.   You will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of 

your life.     

8.  As the jury have found you appreciated that there was some risk of injury to your 
baby from your actions.  As you said yourself - You were her mother.  You should 

have been her guardian.   

9.  I have been referred by both counsel to the Sentencing Guidelines for causing 

grievous bodily harm.  I am quite sure that this offence was not premeditated.  The 

harm was extremely grave and it is permanent.   I am satisfied that this offence comes 

into the second category within the guidelines with a starting point of 18 months.  

The question for me is where in the range this offence comes.    

10. Ms Brand submits that I should pass a sentence that would allow for your immediate 
release so that you may be assessed within the family proceedings as a potential carer 

for your daughter.   I have considered that submission with great care.  However I 

have to mark the seriousness of the consequences of this offence on your daughter.  

The shortest sentence that I can pass is one of 30 months’ imprisonment.    You will 

serve half of that term.  After that you will be released on licence.  If you commit any 

further offences you will be recalled to serve the rest of your sentence. 

11.  The time that you have already spent in prison will count towards your sentence.",2013-06-20 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Jeremy Forrest 


Lewes Crown Court 


21 June 2013 


Sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Lawson QC 


 

It is a huge privilege for an adult to be permitted to teach children – to pass on not 

just what they know but how to discover more, to excite curiosity and to open new 

vistas.  An inspiring teacher can lift a child to levels neither they, nor their parents, 

ever dreamt of. It appears that you had both the personality and the talent to do that 

for those whom you taught. 

 

But you chose to ignore the cardinal rule of teaching – that you should do so in an 

environment that was utterly safe and with no hidden agendas. I say ‘ignored’ 

because the evidence showed clearly how concerned your fellow members of staff 

were for your reputation as a teacher. They responded to the reports from students of 

your behavior and their own observations.  Time and time again between Feb and 

July 2012, they warned and advised you and offered you support.  You lied to them 

as to the nature of your developing relationship and denied sending the messages 

and photos that pupils had seen. 

 

You even complained that the rumours that were circulating were lies by X.  You lied 

to her mother and complained that X’s silence in relation to those ‘false’ rumours was 

ruining your career and that she was harassing you. She felt mortified that her 

daughter was behaving in that way. 

 

In reality you had by then already started an intimate relationship with X - her first - 

within days of her 15th. birthday and, as you spoke, you were preparing to spend
--------
much of the summer  holidays pursuing that relationship with her in your and your 

wife’s home, in hotel rooms and in the back of your car. 

 

I am satisfied that you deceived X, too, about the true nature of your relationship 

with your wife. You took her away with you when it was likely that you would be 

suspended and possibly even arrested. 

 

When you first started teaching X in September 2011, you noticed her, and she 

responded to your care and concern about difficulties she was having.  She developed 

an affection for you.  For her it was a supportive relationship she should have been 

able to trust. Her attendance and performance at school improved.  It was evident to 

others who went on the school trip to Los Angeles that by then she had become 

infatuated with you.  She told you of her eating disorder and other insecurities. 

I have seen nothing in the evidence which shows that at any stage you tried to 

provide proper boundaries between yourself and her, to discourage her, or let other 

staff deal with the matter appropriately.  Indeed all the evidence shows that you 

encouraged her infatuation and provided opportunities for her to communicate with 

you and be alone with you. 

 

By her 15th birthday any thought of waiting until she was 16 had been abandoned, if 

ever that had been the plan, and you embarked upon a full sexual relationship soon 

after.  Texts that we have heard of show that you were active in driving that 

relationship forward. 

 

It is argued that she was willing for that to happen but to urge that argument is to 

ignore the rationale for the ‘age of consent’ rules.  It was your duty as a teacher to 

stop her infatuation, not to fuel it. Your research into what might happen to you, if 

caught, is proof of the deliberate nature of your behavior.  

 

On 20th September you took her to France.  I suspect you went for your own 

purposes.  In taking her with you, you subjected her family to appalling distress and 

concerns for her safety. You made no attempt to think of their welfare or let someone 

know she was safe.  Since her return to this country X has had to endure the 

relentless spotlight on what should have been a very private matter at the mere age of
--------
15.  You have contested the abduction charge raising a spurious defense, so that she 

had to give evidence, evidence very different in content from her original account and 

designed to support it.  She had clearly received assistance in relation to what she 

should say. Further publicity will follow today’s hearing.  Where is that genuine care 

for her welfare that is the hallmark of a truly loving relationship? 

 

Your behavior over this period had been motivated by self interest and has hurt and 


damaged many people – her family; your family; staff and pupils at the School and 


respect for teachers everywhere.  It has damaged you too, but that was something 


you were prepared to risk. 


 

You now have to pay that price. 


 

You have redeemed yourself to some very small degree by waving your right to full 


extradition, but not before you had repeatedly tried to avoid being brought back to 


this country for crimes you knew you had committed. 


 

You know that the matters for which I have to sentence you demand an immediate 


sentence of imprisonment – as punishment for you and a clear signal to others.  


Other consequences automatically follow and they will prevent you being able to 


damage other vulnerable children. 


 

I have to have regard to the total sentence and therefore each element is reduced 


slightly. 


 

The total sentence is 5.5 years imprisonment. 


Sex offences x 5 counts: 4.5 yrs on each concurrent. 


Abduction: 1 yr consecutive.

The Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Lord Justice Moses and Mrs Justice Thirlwall) has today 
 
issued guidance to courts about how the interests of those who are or may be victims of human 
 
trafficking and who become involved in criminal activities should be approached in criminal 
 
proceedings. The guidance is provided in a judgment dealing with four separate appeals against 
 
conviction. 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
 
Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court said: 
 
 
“In these appeals we are dealing with the problems raised by four otherwise unconnected cases in 
 
 
which three children and one adult who were trafficked by criminals for their own purposes have 
 
been prosecuted and convicted.  Unfortunately the criminals who trafficked them have escaped 
 
justice. 
 
   
“This vile trade in people has different manifestations.  Women and children, usually girls, are 
 
 
trafficked into prostitution: others, usually teenage boys, but sometimes young adults, are 
 
trafficked into cannabis farming: yet others are trafficked to commit a wide range of further 
 
offences. Sometimes they are trafficked into this country from the other side of the world: 
 
sometimes they enter into this country unlawfully, and are trafficked after their arrival: sometimes 
 
they are trafficked within the towns or cities in this country where they live.  Whether trafficked 
 
from home or overseas, they are all victims of crime.  That is how they must be treated and, in the 
 
vast majority of cases they are:  but not always.  For convenience in this judgment we shall refer to 
 
the victim as he or him, although as we have made clear, women and girls as well as men and boys 
 
are the victims of trafficking. 
 
 
“We understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions is shortly to reconsider his present guidance 
 
on the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion in relation to victims of trafficking. The form to be 
 
taken by prosecutorial guidance is ultimately his responsibility. Despite suggestions in the 
 
submissions to the contrary, the court cannot become involved either in the investigation of the case 
 
 
 
or the prosecutorial decision whether it is in the public interest for the prosecution to proceed. 
  
Nevertheless we propose to offer guidance to courts (not, we emphasise, to the Director of Public 
 
Prosecutions) about how the interests of those who are or may be victims of human trafficking, and 
 
in particular child victims, who become enmeshed in criminal activities in consequence, should be 
 
approached after criminal proceedings against them have begun.” (paras 1 – 3)

Discussion 
 
 
Lord Judge, on behalf of the Court, said: 
 
 
“… It has not, however, and could not have been argued that if and when victims of trafficking 
 
participate or become involved in criminal activities, a trafficked individual should be given some 
 
kind of immunity from prosecution, just because he or she was or has been trafficked, nor for that 
 
reason alone, that a substantive defence to a criminal charge is available to a victim of trafficking. 
 
What, however, is clearly established, and numerous different papers, reports and decided cases 
 
have demonstrated, is that when there is evidence that victims of trafficking have been involved in 
 
 
criminal activities, the investigation and the decision whether there should be a prosecution, and, if 
 
 
so, any subsequent proceedings require to be approached with the greatest sensitivity.  The 
 
reasoning is not always spelled out, and perhaps we should do so now.  The criminality, or putting it 
 
another way, the culpability, of any victim of trafficking may be significantly diminished, and in 
 
some cases effectively extinguished, not merely because of age (always a relevant factor in the 
 
case of a child defendant) but because no realistic alternative was available to the exploited victim 
 
but to comply with the dominant force of another individual, or group of individuals.” (para 13) 
  
 
He went on to say: 
 
 
“ … [What] is required in the context of the prosecutorial decision to proceed is a level of 
 
 
protection from prosecution or punishment for trafficked victims who have been compelled to 
 
commit criminal offences.  These arrangements should follow the “basic principles” of our legal 
 
system.  In this jurisdiction that protection is provided by the exercise by the “abuse of process” 
 
jurisdiction.” (para 14) 
 
 
“… In any case, where it is necessary to do so, whether issues of trafficking or other questions arise, 
 
the court reviews the decision to prosecute through the exercise of the jurisdiction to stay.  The court 
 
protects the rights of a victim of trafficking by overseeing the decision of the prosecutor and refusing 
 
to countenance any prosecution which fails to acknowledge and address the victim’s subservient 
 
situation, and the international obligations to which the United Kingdom is a party.  The role of the 
 
court replicates its role in relation to agents provocateurs.  It stands between the prosecution and 
 
the victim of trafficking where the crimes are committed as an aspect of the victim’s exploitation.” 
 
(para 16) 
 
 
“…. In the context of an abuse of process argument on behalf of an alleged victim of trafficking, the 
 
court will reach its own decision on the basis of the material advanced in support and against the 
 
continuation of the prosecution.  Where a court considers issues relevant to age, trafficking and 
 
exploitation, the prosecution will be stayed if the court disagrees with the decision to prosecute. 
  
The fears that the exercise of the jurisdiction to stay will be inadequate are groundless.” (para 17) 
 
 
 
Evidential Issues 
 
 
The Court discusses the evidential issues for courts to consider in paragraphs 19 – 33. 
 
 
Lord Judge, on behalf of the Court, concludes: 
 
 
“As we have already explained the distinct question for decision once it is found that the 
 
defendant is a victim of trafficking is the extent to which the offences of which he is charged, or of 
 
which he has been found guilty are integral to or consequent on the exploitation of which he was 
 
the victim. We cannot be prescriptive.  In some cases the facts will indeed show that he was under

levels of compulsion which mean that in reality culpability was extinguished.  If so when such cases

applied in these appeals.  In other cases, more likely in the case of a defendant who is no longer a 
 
 
child, culpability may be diminished but nevertheless be significant.  For these individuals 
 
prosecution may well be appropriate, with due allowance to be made in the sentencing decision 
 
for their diminished culpability.  In yet other cases, the fact that the defendant was a victim of 
 
trafficking will provide no more than a colourable excuse for criminality which is unconnected to 
 
 
and does not arise from their victimisation.  In such cases an abuse of process submission would 
 
 
fail.” (para 33) 
 
 
 
Appeals: 
 
 
The Court went on to consider the four separate appeals before it and makes fact specific decisions. 
  
Lord Judge said: “Our approach does however provide some broad guidance about the kind of case in 
 
 
which, following a proper investigation of the facts, a prosecution would have been unlikely, and if 
 
undertaken, would have culminated in a successful abuse of process argument.  What they do, 
 
however, underline, is that the investigating and prosecuting authorities, the legal professions, and 
 
 
the courts must be alert to the potential difficulties to which cases involving victims of trafficking can 
 
 
give rise.” (para 34) 
 
 
 
THN 
 
 
The case of THN is considered in paragraphs 35 – 45. THN had pleaded guilty to producing a 
 
controlled drug, Class B. In quashing THN’s conviction, Lord Judge said on behalf of the Court: 
 
 
“… We agree that there is now powerful evidence that the appellant was a trafficked child and 
 
that his criminal activities were integral to the circumstances in which he was a victim.  On the 
 
basis of the evidence now available, if the appellant had been prosecuted, an abuse of process 
 
argument would have been likely to succeed.  Accordingly this conviction will be quashed.” 
 
(para 45) 
 
 
 
T 
 
 
The case of T is considered in paragraphs 46 – 55. T was convicted of the offence of cultivating 
 
 
cannabis. The Court quashed T’s conviction saying: 
  
 
“ … On the basis of the evidence which was not then available, the Crown accepts that had these 
 
 
facts been known at the time when the decision to prosecute was made, the appellant would not 
 
have been prosecuted.  To that we should add that if he had been prosecuted, on the basis now 
 
available, an abuse of process argument would have been likely to succeed.  This appeal will be 
 
 
allowed.” (para 55)

“… On the basis of the evidence now available it is clear, that the appellant would not have been 
 
prosecuted, and that if the prosecution had proceeded and the Crown Court was fully informed of 
 
 
the facts now available, the case would have been stopped as an abuse of process.  Accordingly the 
 
 
appeal against conviction will be allowed.” (para 67) 
 
 
   
L 
  
 
The case of L is considered in paragraphs 68 ‐ 74. L, a woman in her mid thirties, pleaded guilty to 
 
possession of a false identity document. The Court quashed L’s conviction saying: 
  
 
“Given the appellant’s prolonged exposure to involuntary prostitution and enforced control, the 
 
offence she actually committed appears to us to have arisen as a result of her being a victim of 
 
trafficking who was provided with a forged passport for her to use as if it were genuine, and the 
 
use of it represented a step in a process by which she would escape.  On the basis of the facts 
 
which are now known, if this appellant had been prosecuted, an abuse of process argument would 
 
have been advanced with a realistic prospect of success.  The appeal will therefore be allowed.”

REBECCA SHUTTLEWORTH
 

 
LUKE SOUTHERTON
 

 
BIRMINGHAM CROWN COURT
 

25 JUNE 2013 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE SPENCER
 

 

1.  Rebecca  Shuttleworth,  you  are  still  only  25  years  old.  After  a  trial  lasting  over  5 

months  the  jury  have  convicted  you  of  the  brutal  murder  of  your  2  year  old  son,  
 

Keanu. He was a defenceless child, and it was your duty to protect him. Instead you 

 

beat him so severely that he died a lingering death from his injuries a day or so later. 

The jury have also convicted you of offences of cruelty to Keanu by assaulting him on 
 

several  occasions  in  the  months  leading  up  to  his  death,  resulting  in  significant 

injuries, count 4, and by ill-treating and neglecting Keanu throughout his short life, 

count 5. The jury found each and every one of the multiple allegations in those counts 
 

proved. You have been convicted of cruelty in neglecting Keanu in the last hours of 
 

his life  by failing  to summon the  medical  aid  he so  badly  needed. Finally and  quite 

separately  you  have  been  convicted  of  cruelty  towards  [another  child*]  in  2005  by 
 

deliberately burning her hand and wrist.  

 

 

2. Luke Southerton, you are 32 years old. You  have been acquitted by the jury of any 
 

involvement  in  the  death  of  Keanu,  and  acquitted  of  all  allegations  of  child  cruelty 

save  for  one  occasion  when  you  deliberately  bit  Keanu  at  Rebecca  Shuttleworth’s 
 

instigation, supposedly as a way of teaching him not to bite when this 2 year old child 
 

 

 

had bitten you.   

 

3. Keanu was a delightful little boy, described as a real character, a little entertainer, 
 

 

who remained cheerful despite everything. Joyful was the word that more than one 
 

 

1
--------
witness used to describe him. He was a much loved brother, grandson, nephew and 
 

cousin. He was a favourite at nursery as well as in the family, His death has left a void 
 

 

in many lives which will never be filled. No sentence I pass can change that. 
  

 

 

 

 

4. For murder, Rebecca Shuttleworth, there is only one sentence: life imprisonment. 
 

But I am required to determine what period you must serve in prison before you are 
 

even eligible to be considered for parole. In determining how long you must serve I 

shall take into account all the offences of which you have been convicted.  First I must 

set out the factual basis upon which I pass sentence. 

 

5.  You,  Rebecca  Shuttleworth,  had  the  misfortune  and  disadvantage  of  a  very  poor 
 

start in life with a disrupted childhood spent in and out of care. You have had more 

than  your  share  of  tragedy,  losing  your  mother  and  your  grandmother  within  a 

matter of weeks when you were only 18 years old. To your credit you always kept out 

of  trouble  with  the  police.  You  are  an  intelligent  young  woman.  You  learned  to  be 

resilient  and  streetwise  but  I  am  satisfied  on  the  evidence  I  have  heard,  with  the 
 

 

benefit of observing you in the witness box for many days, that you also learned to be 
 

manipulative  and  deceitful.  You  have  always  been  well  able  to  create  a  good  
 

 

impression when it was to your advantage. 

 

 

6. You became involved in an abusive relationship with a violent man and at the age 

of  only  16  gave  birth  to  twins.  Your  father  provided  a  home  for  you  and  for  them. 

 

 

 

[redacted*] He took over full responsibility for them in 2007 when a residence order 
 

was made in his favour. 

 

 

7.  Leaving  your  father  to  look  after  the  twins  you  moved  to  Torquay  in  2007, 
 

attempting to make a new life for yourself. You met a much older man and you were 
 

soon pregnant with Keanu who was born on 11th December 2008. You had help and 
 

support from social services in looking after him in a structured setting for the first 

 
few months of his life. You impressed the social workers sufficiently to pass various 

assessments  and  to  persuade  them  that  your  parenting  was  “good  enough”.  Even 

 
then,  however,  there  were  signs  of  neglect  and  ill-treatment  of  Keanu,  particularly 

when  you  were  away  from  the  eyes  of  the  professionals.  I  am  satisfied  that  you 

consistently shouted and swore at Keanu in Torquay just as you did in Birmingham. 

 
You failed to attend appropriately to his needs, and failed to wash and clean him or 

his  clothes  appropriately.  You  persistently  neglected  to  change  his  nappy  through  a 

 
callous  indifference  to  his  welfare  rather  than  through  lack  of  practical  skill  or 

 

2
--------
knowledge.  It  caused  him  evident  discomfort  and  distress.  The  social  workers  spelt 

out for you the negative impact on any small child of being sworn and shouted at but 

you laughed it off as simply part  of your character, on a take it or leave it basis. 
  

 

8. In the summer of 2009 you returned to live in Birmingham with Keanu. You were 
 

fortunate  to  be  provided  with  a  home  and  a  great  deal  of  practical  support  by  your 

 

 

 

friend Kay Filmer and her mother Karen Selvey. They were shocked on occasions by 
 

 

 

the way you treated Keanu, failing to attend to his basic needs like nappy changing 

You were not prepared to give him the time and attention he needed and craved. You 

 

 

 

were  more  interested  in  pursuing  your  own  selfish  interests.  Despite  this,  and 

 

 

perhaps  to  a  degree  because  of  it,  Keanu  relished  the  attention  you  gave  him  when 
 

you could  be bothered  to do so and there  is no  doubt that there was  a  strong  bond 
 

 

 

between  the  two  of  you  for  the  good.  That  was  observed  by  the  professionals  at 
 

nursery, and on the face of it all was well.  

 

9.  This  was  the  situation  when  you  met  and  began  a  relationship  with  your  co­

defendant. You, Luke Southerton, were then living in a hostel in Birmingham in the 
 

 

 

wake of a painful separation from your long-term partner which necessarily limited 
 

 

the amount of contact you were able to have with your own two boys, one of whom 

 

was  only  a  few  months  older  than  Keanu.  Rebecca  Shuttleworth  became  infatuated 
 

 

with  you  and  you  were,  I  am  sure,  flattered  by  her  attention.  She  of  the  two  of  you 

was  the  dominant  personality.  But  as  you  told  your  friend  Wayne  Collins,  Rebecca 

and Keanu came as a package. You were prepared to put up with him as the price of 
 

seeing more of your girlfriend. For your own boys I have no doubt you have and have 
 

always had the deepest love and affection. There is no criticism of you whatsoever as 
 

a father to your own boys. But you had double standards when it came to Keanu. You 

would never have dreamed of biting one of your own sons in the way you bit Keanu, 

even to teach him a lesson. 

 

10.  That  was  the  first  deliberate  assault  inflicted  on  Keanu.  You  Rebecca 
 

Shuttleworth encouraged him to inflict it. You, Luke Southerton, bit Keanu very hard 
 

 

 

on his bare arm, causing a nasty injury involving bruising and breaking of the skin. 
 

You  surprised  yourself  by  the  ferocity  with  which  you  bit  him,  and  you  expressed 
 

regret  to  your  friend  Wayne  Collins  for  what  you  had  done.  You  Rebecca  
 

 

Shuttleworth  covered  up  what  your  boyfriend  had  done  by  lying  at  nursery  and 
 

saying that Keanu had been bitten by another child, his cousin.  

 

 

 

3
--------
11. On 7th December you, Rebecca Shuttleworth, took Keanu to hospital with a head 

injury  which,  on  the  jury’s  verdict  you  had  inflicted  that  day  when  you  returned  to 

Luke  Southerton’s  flat  after  he  had  been  babysitting  for  Keanu.  There  was  a  very 
 

prominent  bruise  to  his  forehead  with  indications  of  tramline  markings  which 

strongly suggest you hit him with a stick. At hospital you misled the consultant nurse 

you  saw  by  pretending  that  it  was  the  recurrence  of  an  earlier  injury  the  previous 

week and that the original injury had been caused by a fall at nursery. 

 

12. On 9th December, 2 days later, Keanu was taken to hospital again with a series of 
 

injuries. There was a nasty burn to the sole of his foot with bruising on the upper part 
 

of the foot consistent with his foot being held by force against a hot radiator or other 
 

hot  surface.  On  the  jury’s  verdict,  you,  Rebecca  Shuttleworth,  deliberately  inflicted 

that  injury.  It  is  horribly  reminiscent  of  the  injury  you  had  inflicted  nearly  5  years 

earlier to [another child*]. Instead of seeking professional medical attention for this 
 

burn you merely put some cream on it and left Keanu to limp in pain all day until he 
 

 

 

 

 

 

had to go to hospital that evening when even more serious injuries had been caused.   

 

 

13.  Sometime  that  day,  9th  December,  a  further  head  injury  was  inflicted  to  Keanu, 

 
this time resulting in bruising and boggy swelling to the top of his head. On the jury's 

 
verdict it was you alone, Rebecca Shuttleworth, who caused that injury. There must 

 
have  been  a  substantial  blow  to  his  head,  quite  possibly  with  a  weapon.  You  were 

 

sufficiently  concerned  by  the  early  evening  to  call  NHS  Direct  and  ask  for  advice, 

 

 

 
although it is telling that you were hoping they could give you advice over the phone 

 
without  having  to  take  Keanu  into  hospital  where  all  these  injuries  would  be 

 
examined  critically  by  medical  staff  and  quite  possibly  by  social  services.  You  also 

caused the bruising to Keanu’s back which was seen at hospital on 9th December. It 

was a troubling injury, as all the doctors agreed, because of its unusual site. You lied 

in  suggesting  that  it  was  caused  accidentally  when  Keanu  fell  against  a  wall  in  the 

bedroom at your father’s house. You deliberately inflicted that injury and there were 

 
subsequent bruises inflicted in the same general area of Keanu’s back on two further 

occasions, seen at nursery on 5th January and over the fatal weekend.  

 

 
14.  Around  Christmas  or  New  Year  you,  Rebecca  Shuttleworth,  were  confronted  by 

 
your  sister  Angela  with  the  livid  hand  prints  bruises  you  had  inflicted  to  Keanu’s 

buttocks,  which  she  discovered  when  she  was  bathing  him.  It  is  telling,  once  more, 

 
that you were unconcerned and merely shrugged your shoulders when  she told you 

that if she saw anything like that again she would report you to social services.  

 

 

4
--------
15. It is clearly established on the medical evidence that sometime in the last week of 

his life, 3-5 days before he dies, Keanu received a serious blow to the right hand side 
 

 

of his head, hard enough to cause damage to the skull itself and extensive bruising to 
 

 

the scalp. I strongly suspect it was you who inflicted that injury as well, but no-one 
 

could be sure and for that reason you were never charged with causing it. 

 

16. I turn finally to the  events of the fatal weekend. By the  jury’s verdict it was you 
 

alone,  Rebecca  Shuttleworth,  who  was  responsible  for  the  violence  which  led  to 

Keanu’s death. You were with Keanu in Luke Southerton’s flat from the Friday night 

 

through to the Sunday afternoon, by which time Keanu had undoubtedly suffered his 

fatal  injuries.  You  claimed  that  it  was  Luke  Southerton  who  inflicted  those  injuries 

but  the  jury  decided  otherwise.  Keanu  would  have  been  bound  to  scream 
 

inconsolably for many minutes when such injuries were inflicted. Your claim to have 
 

seen and heard nothing of any such attack and its aftermath was as unconvincing as it 
 

was  dishonest.  It  must  have  been  on  the  Saturday  morning,  when  Luke  Southerton  
 

 

 

was away from the flat for 2 hours, that you inflicted the injuries. 

 

17. No one could look at the photographs of Keanu taken after his death, or even the 

 

body mapping images of the multiple injuries he suffered, without being appalled at 

the brutality they represent. There must have been many separate blows. At least one 
 

must  have  been  inflicted  with  a  weapon,  in  all  probability  a  pool  cue  or  broom 

handle, hence the tramline bruising. 
 

 

18. There were injuries inflicted to his abdomen, his chest, his face, his head, and his 

back. The abdominal injury which killed Keanu was a massive tear of the mesentery, 
 

the apron of fat which provides the blood supply for the whole of the intestine. The 
 

force  required  to  cause  such  an  injury  was  very  great  indeed,  likened  by  the 
 

pathologist, Dr Kolar, to the forces in a road traffic collision. It must have been the 

result  of  heavy  punches,  a  stamp  or  kick,  or  other  blows.  The  depth  and  extent  of 
 

bruising  to  Keanu’s  back  strongly  suggests  he  must  have  been  thrown  or  slammed  
 

 

 

 

against the floor or a wall or another firm surface for at least part of the attack upon 
 

him. 

 

19.  One  can  scarcely  imagine  the  pain  and  distress  Keanu  must  have  suffered  from 
 

this  outburst  of  violence.  Although  he  had  become  used  to  assaults,  he  must  have  
 

 

been terrified. You told the police how at one stage that weekend, you saw him lying 

 

5
--------
face  down  cold  and  helpless  on  the  floor  in  the  room  where  he  had  been  sleeping. 
 

That was a vivid image which remained with you, as it will remain with everyone who 
 

heard that evidence. 

 

 

20. It must have been clear to you as soon as the violence had taken place that Keanu 
 

was  badly  in  need  of  medical  attention.  He  got  worse  during  Saturday.  I  am  quite 

sure  it  was  Keanu  whom  Andrew  Scroggie  heard  crying  and  screaming  in  the  early 
 

part of Saturday evening. The likelihood is that, Keanu was left to cry and scream in 
 

his  pushchair,  as  was  not  uncommon,  and  on  this  occasion  the  pushchair  was 

probably taken downstairs to the hallway, between the inner and outer door so that 
 

he would be out of sight if not out of mind. He got worse overnight and was very ill 
 

 

indeed all next day, Sunday. The reality is that he was dying.  

 

21.  There  was  only  one  reason  why  you,  Keanu’s  mother,  did  not  summon  medical 

help or take him to hospital that weekend, as any normal parent would have done. It 
 

 

was your fear that this time the injuries inflicted upon him could never be explained 

away. Instead you took the chance that he  might recover. You were buying yourself 

 

time, but it was time that Keanu could not afford to lose if there was any chance of 
 

saving his life. In reality, on the medical evidence as a whole, there was not. You left 
 

the flat for the first and only time on Sunday afternoon, initially to  go to the shops 
 

and  later  to  go  to  your  father’s  house.  You  wanted  to  get  away  from  the  flat.  You 
 

wanted time to think of the explanation you would give, [redacted*].  

 

22.  Against  that  background  of  my  findings  on  the  evidence  I  turn  to  the  
 

 

determination of the minimum period you must serve. Parliament has decreed that 
 

for a murder such as this the starting point is 15 years.  I am required to consider and 
 

 

 

assess  the  aggravating  factors  and  mitigating  factors  to  decide  what  the  minimum 

term should be. 

 

23. First the aggravating factors. There are three such factors within paragraph 10 of 
 

schedule  21  to  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003.  First,  Keanu  was  particularly 

vulnerable because of his age. He was barely 2 years old, a defenceless child. Secondly 
 

 

 

there  was  mental  and  physical  suffering  inflicted  on  him  before  death.  His  was  a 

lingering  death  over  many  hours  following  a  brutal  assault  by  his  own mother.  The 
 

physical suffering was very considerable, and so must have been his mental suffering. 

 

Thirdly, this was the grossest abuse of a position of trust. You were his mother and it 
 

 

was your most basic and natural duty to protect him.  

 

6
--------
24.  It  is  also  an  aggravating  factor  that  the  fatal  violence  that  weekend  was  not  the 

first time you had inflicted injury deliberately on Keanu, as I have already set out in 
 

 

detail.  It  was  the  culmination  of  weeks  of  violence.  Although  I  will  pass  concurrent 

determinate sentences for the offences of child cruelty on the indictment, there must 

be  a  significant  increase  in  the  minimum  term  you  must  serve  to  reflect  this 

additional  criminal  conduct.  That  also  includes  the  assault  [in  2005*],  although  I 

 

bear in mind that you were only 16 when that offence was committed.  

 

25. I turn to the mitigating factors. I accept that there was no intention to kill, but this 
 

 

 

was a brutal and sustained attack on a small child so the mitigation is substantially 
 

less. I accept as well that there was a lack of premeditation in the sense that you did 
 

not plan to assault Keanu so severely that weekend. It may even have been a response 
 

to  the  way  in  which  he  was  crying  and  screaming.  But  again,  the  mitigation  is 
 

substantially  less  because  of  the  history  of  assaults.    You  were  provoked  by  his 

behaviour  in  a  way  which  could  amount  to  a  mitigating  factor  for  the  purpose  of 

schedule 21. Your age at the time is a mitigating factor. You were then still only 22. As 
 

 

to  more  general  mitigating  factors  beyond  paragraph  11  of  schedule  21,  I  bear  in 

 

mind, that you have no previous convictions or cautions. Having said that, if you had 

you  been  prosecuted  and  convicted  at  the  time  for  [the  earlier  offence*]  you  would 
 

 

 

have  had  a  very  significant  previous  conviction.  I  also  bear  in  mind  your  troubled 
 

upbringing, the domestic violence you yourself suffered from a previous partner, and 

the  assistance  you  have  provided  to  the  police  recently  in  connection  with  another 
 

distressing criminal investigation. 

 

26.  I  take  15  years  as  the  starting  point  for  your  minimum  term.  The  statutory 
 

 

aggravating factors I have identified would justify a significant increase. In addition, 

the child cruelty offences would, together, merit a determinate sentence of at least 4 
 

years, of which you would serve half. On this basis all those aggravating factors would 

justify a total increase in the starting point to 21 years. Against that are the mitigating 
 

factors I have identified which in my judgment justify a significant, but substantially 

 

smaller,  reduction.  Finally  I  have  to  stand  back  and  look  at  the  totality  of  the 

sentence. Doing so, and taking everything into account I conclude that the minimum 
 

term you must serve is 18 years. That is the equivalent of a determinate sentence of 
 

 

 

36  years.  You  have  served  13  days  in  custody  already.  That  figure  will  be  deducted 
 

 

from the period of 18 years. There will be concurrent sentences of 4 years on count 4, 
 

 

7
--------
3 years on counts 5 and 6. On count 9, bearing in mind you were only 16 at the time 
 

 

 

 

and only for that reason, there will be a concurrent sentence of 3 years. 
  

 

27. Luke Southerton, I have to sentence you for a single offence of child cruelty. You 

 

wilfully  assaulted  Keanu  in  a  manner  likley  to  cause  him  unnecessary  suffering  or 
 

injury  to  his  health  by  deliberately  biting  him.  I  accept  that  you  did  so  at  the  
 

 

instigation  of  Rebecca  Shuttleworth  and  that  you  did  so  only  because  Keanu  had 
 

bitten you and she suggested this was a way of teaching him a lesson. But that cannot 
 

excuse you, a grown man, biting the arm of a 2 year old child hard enough to break 
 

the  skin  and  leave  a  large  bruise  with  obvious  teeth  marks,  as  the  witnesses 
 

 

described. I am satisfied it was done in anger, although you regretted it straightaway 
 

when  you  realised  what  you  had  done.  You  admitted  to  the  police  in  interview  that 
 

you had bitten Keanu but you deliberately played down the seriousness of what was, 

frankly, a shocking injury.  

 

28.  I  have  read  the  material  placed  before  me  by  your  counsel  which  confirms 

 

 

 

everything  in  the  evidence  the  jury  heard  during  the  trial  about  the  quality  of  your 
 

relationship with your sons, and your generally placid nature. I have been assisted by 
 

a  pre-sentence  report.  I  have  also  read  the  psychologist’s  report  from  Dr  Tim  Hull, 

dated  9th  March  2012,  from  which  it  is  evident  that  you  are  of  limited  intellectual 
 

 
ability. There is nothing, however, to indicate that you were not fully in possession of 

 
your faculties at the time of the offence. You were weak and, to an extent, naïve. You 

 

 

 
have endured the strain of 5 months on trial for murder, on top of 2 years waiting for 

 
the trial to begin. You have spent a total of 13 days on remand during the course of 

 
the proceedings. All those factors enable me to take a course which does not involve 

your going to prison today. 

 

29.  This  was,  however,  a  serious  offence.  I  have  considered  the  Sentencing  Council 

 

guideline  for  assaults  on  children  and  cruelty  to  the  child.  I  am  satisfied  that  your 

 

offence merits a short term of imprisonment, but for the reasons I have explained I 

 
am  able  to  follow  the  recommendation  in  the  pre-sentence  report  to  suspend  that 

 
sentence. There will be a sentence of 9 months imprisonment, suspended for a period 

 

 
of 2 years. The supervision requirement will also be for 2 years. In addition you will 

 
perform 200hrs of unpaid work for the community within the next 12 months. There 

 
will  also  be  a  specified  activity  requirement  of  30  days  to  undertake  the  victim 

 

awareness workbook in order to increase your understanding of your actions and the 

 
harm caused. It is my duty to inform you that this conviction means that you will be

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
  

We have all contributed to this judgment of the court. 

L; HVN; THN; T -v- R 

 
1.	 

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

 
4.	 

In  these  appeals  we  are  dealing  with  the  problems  raised  by  four  otherwise 
unconnected  cases  in  which  three  children  and  one  adult  who  were  trafficked  by 
criminals for their own purposes have been prosecuted and convicted.  Unfortunately 
the criminals who trafficked them have escaped justice.   

This vile trade in people has different manifestations.  Women and children, usually 
girls,  are  trafficked  into  prostitution:  others,  usually  teenage  boys,  but  sometimes 
 
young adults, are trafficked into cannabis farming: yet others are trafficked to commit 
 
a wide range of further offences. Sometimes they are trafficked into this country from 
the other side of the world: sometimes they enter into this country unlawfully, and are 
 
trafficked after their arrival: sometimes they are trafficked within the towns or cities 
in this country where they live.  Whether trafficked from home or overseas, they are 
all victims of crime.  That is how they must be treated and, in the vast majority of 
cases they are:  but not always.  For convenience in this judgment we shall refer to the 
 
victim as he or him, although as we have made clear, women and girls as well as men 
and boys are the victims of trafficking. 

 

We  understand  that  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  is  shortly  to  reconsider  his 
 
present guidance on the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion in relation to victims 
 
of  trafficking.  The  form  to  be  taken  by  prosecutorial  guidance  is  ultimately  his 
responsibility. Despite suggestions in the submissions to the contrary, the court cannot 
become involved either in the investigation of the case or the prosecutorial decision 
whether it is in the public interest for the prosecution to proceed.  Nevertheless we 
propose  to  offer  guidance  to  courts  (not,  we  emphasise,  to  the  Director  of  Public 
 
Prosecutions) about how the interests of those who are or may be victims of human 
trafficking,  and  in  particular  child  victims,  who  become  enmeshed  in  criminal 
 
activities  in  consequence,  should  be  approached  after  criminal  proceedings  against 
them have begun. 

Beyond the individual and specific circumstances involved in each of these separate 
appeals (which were heard together) we have sought assistance on the broader issues 
 
to which the appeals give rise.  We have examined the decisions of this court in R v 
M(L), B(M) and G(D) [2011] 1 Cr. App. R 12 and R v N; R v L [2013] QB 379 in the 
 
light  of  EU  Directive  2011/36/EU  on  Preventing  and  Combating  Trafficking  in 
Human Beings and Protecting its Victims, (the EU Directive) which came into effect 
on 6 April 2013. 

 
5.	 

Recital 8 of the EU Directive underlines: 

“Children  are  more  vulnerable  than  adults  and  therefore  at 
greater  risk  of  becoming  victims  of  trafficking  in  human 
beings.  In  the  application  of  this  Directive,  the  child’s  best 
interest  must  be  of  primary  consideration,  in  accordance  with
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

L; HVN; THN; T -v- R 

the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and 
the  1989  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the 
Child”. 

 
6.	 

Recital 14 provides: 

“Victims of trafficking in human beings should, in accordance 
with  the  basic  principles  of  the  legal  systems  of  the  relevant 
Member  States,  be  protected  from  prosecution  or  punishment 
for  criminal  activities  …  that  they  have  been  compelled  to 
commit as a direct consequence of being subject to trafficking. 
 
The aim of such protection is to safeguard the human rights of 
victims, to avoid further victimisation and to encourage them to 
act  as  witnesses 
the 
perpetrators.  The safeguard should not exclude prosecution or 
punishment  for  offences 
that  a  person  has  voluntarily 
committed or participated in.” 

in  criminal  proceedings  against 

 
7.	 

Article 8 makes provision for the non-prosecution or the non-application of penalties 
to the victim so that: 

“Member States shall, in accordance with the basic principles 
of  their  legal  systems,  take  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure 
that competent national authorities are entitled not to prosecute 
or impose penalties on victims of trafficking human beings for 
their  involvement  in  criminal  activities  which  they  have  been 
compelled  to  commit  as  a  direct  consequence  of  being 
subjected to (trafficking)”. 

This  provision  echoes  Article  26  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Convention  on  Action 
against  Trafficking  in  Human  Beings  (the  Anti-Trafficking  Convention)  which 
requires the United Kingdom: 
 

“In accordance with the basic principles of its legal system, [to] 
provide for the possibility of not imposing penalties on victims 
 
[of trafficking] for their involvement in unlawful activities, to 
the extent that they have been compelled to do so”. 

These provisions recognise that different Member States have different legal systems 
for  providing  the  necessary  protection  for  victims  of  trafficking,  and  that  this  may 
take the form of non-prosecution or the imposition after prosecution and conviction of 
what  in  this  jurisdiction  would  be  described  as  a  discharge.    Whether  absolute  or 
conditional, this order does not constitute a penalty.  If it arises, it is the end of the 
process.  That issue, however, is not the problem to which the present appeals give 
 
rise:  we  are  concerned  with  the  prosecution  and  conviction  of  the  appellants  rather 
than the sentences imposed after conviction.

10.	  We have had the advantage of detailed written submissions not only from counsel for 
the  appellants  and  the  prosecution,  but  also  from  the  Children’s  Commissioner  for 
England  and  the  Equality  and  Human  Rights  Commission.    For  understandable 
forensic  reasons  we  have  been  provided  with  a  multiplicity  of  reports  and  papers, 
protocols and conventions in which, using different language to the same effect, the 
evils of trafficking, and in particular the evils of trafficking and exploiting children, 
are  simultaneously  highlighted  and  condemned.    We  shall  not  repeat  them  in  this 
judgment,  but  a  complete  list  of  this  material  is  annexed  to  it.    In  reality,  despite 
 
lengthy  repetition,  the  principles  to  be  applied  are  not  complicated,  and  we  shall 
endeavour  to  encapsulate  them  in  this  judgment.    Henceforth  it  will  rarely  be 
 
necessary  for  them,  or  even  a  substantial  proportion  of  them,  to  be  copied  and 
repeated in proceedings where these and similar issues arise.  

 
11.	 

The abuse to which victims of trafficking are exposed takes many different forms. At 
 
some levels it may amount to “slavery”, or not far distant from “slavery”, “servitude”, 
or “forced or compulsory labour”.  Activities of this kind are prohibited by Article 4 
of  the  European  Convention  of  Human  Rights,  and  were  criminalised  in  this 
jurisdiction by the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004, the 
 
Gang Masters’ Licensing Act 2004, and s.71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. 
With effect from 6 April 2013 two further offences of trafficking people set out in 
ss.109 and 110 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 have been brought into force. 
  
The first of these offences substitutes a new s.59A in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, 
directed  at  covering  the  trafficking  of  individuals  within  and  outside  the  United 
Kingdom with a view to sexual exploitation, and the second substitutes a new s.4(1A) 
 
into the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004 an offence 
to  cover  trafficking  within  and  outside  the  United  Kingdom  with  a  view  to 
exploitation, largely directed at exploitation through labour.  

 

12.	  We need not further expound the principles.  They can be readily found in Siliadin v 
France (Application No 73316/01, 26 October 2004); Rantsev v Cyprus and Russia 
(Application No 25965/05, 10 January 2010); and R v K(S) [2013] QB 82 and R v 
Connors [2013] EWCA Crim. 324 where, in effect repeating what had just been said 
in R v N; R v L [2013] QB 379 at paras [2]-[6], the court observed: 

“Every  vulnerable  victim  of  exploitation  will  be  protected  by 
 
the  criminal  law,  …  there  is  no  victim,  so  vulnerable  to 
exploitation,  that  he  or  she  somehow  becomes  invisible  or 
 
unknown  to  or  somehow  beyond  the  protection  of  the  law. 
Exploitation  of  fellow  human  beings  …  represents  deliberate 
degrading of a fellow human being or human beings”.  

 

It is surely elementary that every court, whether a Crown Court or magistrates court, 
understands  the  abhorrence  with  which  trafficking  in  human  beings  of  any  age  is 
regarded both in the United Kingdom and throughout the civilised world.  It has not, 
however,  and  could  not  have  been  argued  that  if  and  when  victims  of  trafficking 
participate or become involved in criminal activities, a trafficked individual should be 
given  some  kind  of  immunity  from  prosecution,  just  because  he  or  she  was  or  has 
been  trafficked,  nor  for  that  reason  alone,  that  a  substantive  defence  to  a  criminal 

 
13.
--------

L; HVN; THN; T -v- R 

charge is available to a victim of trafficking. What, however, is clearly established, 
and numerous different papers, reports and decided cases have demonstrated, is that 
when  there  is  evidence  that  victims  of  trafficking  have  been  involved  in  criminal 
activities, the investigation and the decision whether there should be a prosecution, 
and,  if  so,  any  subsequent  proceedings  require  to  be  approached  with  the  greatest 
 
sensitivity.  The  reasoning  is  not  always  spelled  out,  and  perhaps  we  should  do  so 
now.  The  criminality,  or  putting  it  another  way,  the  culpability,  of  any  victim  of 
trafficking  may  be  significantly  diminished,  and 
in  some  cases  effectively 
extinguished,  not  merely  because  of  age  (always  a  relevant  factor  in  the  case  of  a 
child  defendant)  but  because  no  realistic  alternative  was  available  to  the  exploited 
victim  but  to  comply  with  the  dominant  force  of  another  individual,  or  group  of 
individuals. 

 
14.	 

 
15.	 

In the context of a prosecution of a defendant aged under 18 years of age, the best 
interests of the victim are not and cannot be the only relevant consideration, but they 
represent  a  primary  consideration.    These  defendants    are  not  safeguarded  from 
prosecution  or  punishment  for  offences  which  were  unconnected  with  the  fact  that 
 
they were being or have been trafficked, although we do not overlook that the fact that 
they  have  been  trafficked  may  sometimes  provide  substantial  mitigation.  What, 
however, is required in the context of the prosecutorial decision to proceed is a level 
of protection from prosecution or punishment for trafficked victims who have been 
 
compelled to commit criminal offences.  These arrangements should follow the “basic 
 
principles” of our legal system.  In this jurisdiction that protection is provided by the 
exercise by the “abuse of process” jurisdiction. 

 

 

It  was  submitted,  particularly,  on  behalf  of  L  and  T,  that  the  courts’  obligation  to 
safeguard  a  trafficked  victim’s  rights  was  independent  of  any  review  of  the 
prosecutor’s decision to bring or continue a prosecution.  It was argued that the court 
should afford the protection required by the Directive and Convention by exercising 
what was described as a “primary role”.    The submission was based on the Supreme 
Court’s consideration of the need to ensure that confiscation orders are proportionate 
in  order  to  safeguard  a  defendant’s  rights  under  A1P1  of  the  ECHR  in  R  v  Waya 
 
[2012] UKSC 51, [2013] 1 AC 294: 

“But the safeguard of the defendant’s Convention right under 
 
A1P1 not to be the object of a disproportionate order does not, 
and  must  not,  depend  on  prosecutorial  discretion,  nor  on  the 
very  limited  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  to  review  the 
exercise of such discretion by way of judicial review” [19]. 

 

 

16.	  Waya is not analogous.  In that case the Supreme Court was seeking to ensure that the 
order  of  the  court  adequately  protected  the  rights  of  a  defendant  against  whom  an 
 
order  of  confiscation  was  sought.    The  court  is  the  primary  decision-maker  as  to 
whether  a  confiscation  order  should  be  made.    In  contrast,  the  prosecution  is  and 
remains responsible for deciding whether to prosecute or not.  In any case, where it is 
necessary  to  do  so,  whether  issues  of  trafficking  or  other  questions  arise,  the  court 
reviews the decision to prosecute through the exercise of the jurisdiction to stay.  The 
court protects the rights of a victim of trafficking by overseeing the decision of the

prosecutor and refusing to countenance any prosecution which fails to acknowledge 
and  address  the  victim’s  subservient  situation,  and  the  international  obligations  to 
which  the  United  Kingdom  is  a  party.    The  role  of  the  court  replicates  its  role  in 
relation to agents provocateurs.  It stands between the prosecution and the victim of 
 
trafficking where the crimes are committed as an aspect of the victim’s exploitation 
(see R v Loosely A-G’s Ref (No.3 of 2000) [2001] UKHL, [2002] 1 Cr.App.R.29). 

 

 

 
17.	 

 
18.	 

It may be that the submissions advanced in erroneous reliance on Waya stem from a 
fear that the court will do no more than review the prosecutor’s decision on traditional 
Wednesbury grounds and decline to interfere, even though its own conclusion would 
be that the offences were a manifestation of the exploitation of a victim of trafficking. 
 
For the reasons we have already given, no such danger exists. In the context of an 
abuse of process argument on behalf of an alleged victim of trafficking, the court will 
reach its own decision on the basis of the material advanced in support of and against 
 
the continuation of the prosecution.  Where a court considers issues relevant to age, 
trafficking and exploitation, the prosecution will be stayed if the court disagrees with 
the decision to prosecute.  The fears that the exercise of the jurisdiction to stay will be 
inadequate are groundless. 

 

If issues relating to the age of the victim arise, and questions whether the defendant is 
or was a victim of trafficking, or whether the alleged offences were an aspect of the 
victim’s exploitation, have reached the Crown Court, or a magistrates court, they must 
be  resolved  by  the  exercise  of  the  jurisdiction  to  stay  a  prosecution.  In  accordance 
with  the  process  endorsed  in  M(L)(15-19)  and  N;L(86)  that  remains  the  correct 
procedure  for  determining  such  issues  even  after  the  EU  Directive  2011/36/EU 
 
became  directly  effective.  This  provides  sufficient  vindication  for  the  rights 
 
enshrined in the EU Directive as well as the Anti-Trafficking Convention, and indeed 
in Articles 4, 6 and 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. In short Waya 
 
did  not  provide  an  additional  remedy  to  the  well  understood  abuse  of  process 
remedies  or  widen  the  judicial  review  procedures  to  encompass  situations  where  a 
clear remedy is available at or before the criminal trial.  

 

The evidential issues 

The question whether a potential defendant has indeed been a victim of trafficking, 
and the extent to which his ability to resist involvement in criminal activities has been 
undermined is fact specific. Usually, but not always, the starting point is the moment 
 
of arrest.  When a young person is arrested the police must consider his age, and in 
the  overwhelming  majority  of  cases  it  is  known  or  can  readily  be  discovered. 
 
Arrangements are then made for attendance at a police station by an appropriate adult. 
 
After charge the child is brought before the Youth Court or before an Adult Court if 
no Youth Court is sitting. Difficulties relating to age are most likely to arise where a 
young person has entered the United Kingdom illegally, and has no genuine passport 
or similar identifying documents.  When a young person without parents comes to the 
 
attention of a local authority (often via the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) 
 
as an illegal entrant), the Children Act 1989 imposes a duty on the local authority to 
determine whether he is a child in need.  If so, he is entitled to number of services, 

 
19.
--------

L; HVN; THN; T -v- R 

including the provision of accommodation.  However the first step is to establish the 
person’s  age.  Since  2003  local  authorities  have  assessed  age  by  a  process  which 
complies  with  the  principles  set  out  in  R(B)  v  London  Borough  of  Merton  [2003] 
EWHC 1689 (Admin).  In the case of HVN an age assessment was carried out on the 
day of arrest and the fact that HVN was a child was established by the time he made 
 
his first appearance in court. 

 

20.	  When the defendant may be a child victim of trafficking, two linked questions must 
be  addressed.  First,  the  defendant’s  age  must  be  ascertained,  and  second,  the 
 
evidence  which  suggests  that  he  has  been  trafficked  must  be  assessed.    In  the  vast 
majority  of  cases  the  questions  will  be  investigated  by  and  in  the  same  processes. 
 
Assuming  that  the  factual  conclusion  is  that  the  defendant  was  a  child  victim  of 
trafficking, a quite distinct question for consideration is the extent to which the crime 
alleged against him was consequent on and integral to the exploitation of which he 
was the victim.  That question also arises in the case of an adult victim.  In some cases 
 
(as in these appeals) the answer to both questions will be that the criminal offence is 
 
here, or at least, a manifestation of the exploitation. 

 
21.	 

In  a  variety  of  different  ways  the  administration  of  criminal  justice  recognises  that 
provisions  which  relate  to  adults  may  have  no  appropriate  application  to  cases 
 
involving individuals under 18 years of age. These are summarised in R (HC, a child) 
v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 982 (Admin) paras 31-
43. Self evidently we are not here dealing with children who are below the statutory 
age of criminal responsibility.  Where questions about the age of a potential defendant 
arise after the case has been brought to court, the decision whether the defendant is or 
is not under 18 years old, or was or was not under that age for any relevant purpose, is 
 
addressed  in  statute.  The  Children’s  Commissioner  has  suggested  that  a  thorough, 
multi-disciplinary approach should be taken to the assessment of the defendant’s age, 
and  she  has  expressed  concern  that  there  are  too  many  occasions  when  the  “due 
inquiry” into the age of the defendant who appears to be a child or young person, as 
required  by  s.99(1)  of  the  Children  and  Young  Persons’  Act  1933,  is  overlooked. 
 
This provision directs the court to “make due inquiry” about the defendant’s age, and 
“take  such  evidence  as  may  be  forthcoming  at  the  hearing  of  the  case”  for  this 
 
purpose. Similar provisions require the court addressing the age question to consider 
 
“any  available  evidence”.  (S.150  of  the  Magistrates  Court  Act  1980;  S.1(6)  of  the 
 
Criminal Justice Act 1982; and S.305(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003).  

 

22.	  When  the  issue  arises,  we  agree  that  compliance  with  these  provisions  in 
contemporary  society  requires  much  more  than  superficial  observation  of  the 
defendant  in  court  or  in  the  dock  to  enable  the  judge  to  make  an  appropriate  age 
assessment.    The  facial  features  of  the  defendant  may  provide  a  clue  or  two,  but 
 
experience  has  shown  that  this  is  very  soft  evidence  indeed  and  liable  to  mislead. 
What we do know is that young people mature at different ages, and that their early 
life experiences can sometimes leave them with a misleading appearance.  We also 
appreciate that young people from an ethnic group with which the court is unfamiliar 
 
may  seem  older,  or  indeed  younger,  than  those  from  ethnic  groups  with  which  the 
court has greater experience. Therefore when an age issue arises, the court must be 
provided with all the relevant evidence which bears on it.  Although the court may
--------

adjourn  proceedings  for  further  investigations  to  be  conducted,  these  have  to  be 
undertaken by one or other or both sides, or by the relevant social services.  The court 
is not vested with any jurisdiction, and is not provided with the resources to conduct 
its own investigations into the age of a potential defendant until after the investigation 
has completed its course, and the individual in question is brought before the court.   

 
23.	 

In this context we repeat the observations of this court in R v Steed [1990] 12 Cr. App. 
R(S) 230, where the question of the appellant’s age was significant to the different 
methods of the disposal of the case on sentence, and therefore went to the legality of 
the sentence,  

“It  may  often  be  right,  indeed  might  usually  be  right,  for  the 
matter  to  be  adjourned,  if  there is  any  real  doubt  about  it,  so 
that it may be more satisfactorily determined”. 

More  recently,  this  approach  was  underlined  in  R  v  O  [2008]  EWCA  Crim.  2835 
where the court emphasised that: 

 

“(W)here there is doubt about the age of a defendant who is a 
possible victim of trafficking, proper enquiries must be made, 
indeed statute so required.” 

24.	

 

 The Children’s Commissioner invites us to consider the impact of Article 10(3) of the 
Anti-Trafficking Convention which provides: 

“When the age of the victim is uncertain and there are reasons 
to believe that the victim is a child, he or she shall presume to 
 
be  a  child  and  shall  be  accorded  special  protection  measures 
 
pending verification of his/her age”. 

The  explanatory  report  to  the  Anti-Trafficking  Convention  also  refers  to  a 
 
requirement  that  the  parties  should  “presume  that  a  victim  is  a  child  if  there  are 
reasons for believing that to be so and if there is uncertainty about their age.”  In our 
judgment  Article  10(3)  addresses  evidential  issues.    Where  there  are  reasons  to 
believe that the defendant is a child, then he should be treated as a child.  In other 
 
words it is not possible for the court to brush aside evidence which suggest that the 
defendant may be a child. The issue must be addressed head on. If at the end of an 
examination of the available evidence, the question remains in doubt, the presumption 
applies and the defendant must be treated as a child.  There is therefore no relevant 
difference  between  the  approach  required  by  Article  10(3)  of  the  Anti-Trafficking 
Convention and the Guidance provided by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  

The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) was set up on 1 April 2009 to give effect 
 
in  the  United  Kingdom  to  Article  10  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Anti-Trafficking 
Convention.  Enough is now known about people who are trafficked into and within 
the United Kingdom for all those involved in the criminal justice process to recognise

L; HVN; THN; T -v- R 

the need to consider at an early stage whether the defendant (child or adult) is in fact a 
victim of trafficking.  The NRM establishes a three stage process for this purpose: 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

An initial referral of a potential victim of trafficking by a first responder to a 
competent authority.  At present there are two competent authorities.  They are 
UKBA and the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC), a multi 
disciplinary  organisation  led  by  SOCA  (The  Serious  and  Organised  Crime 
 
Agency).  In the present appeals we are concerned only with UKBA because 
the potentially trafficked individual were subject to immigration control.  We 
 
note that where the potential victim of trafficking is a child his consent is not 
necessary  before  the  referral  is  made,  but  where  he  is  an  adult  consent  is 
required. 

An  UKBA  official  decides  whether  the  person  referred  might  have  been  a 
victim of trafficking.  This is known as a “reasonable grounds” decision, for 
which UKBA have a target of five days.  We are told that the average time is 
nine  days.  If  and  when  a  favourable  reasonable  grounds  decision  has  been 
made the first responder is notified, and, in effect that decision allows for a 
period  of  forty  five  days  during  which  the  final  stage  of  the  NRM  process 
continues, leading to 

 
iii)	 

consideration  by  UKBA  whether  the  evidence  is  sufficient  to  confirm 
conclusively that the individual has been trafficked. 

 

27.	  We were informed that the median time now taken for this third stage to be concluded 
is  not  short  of  three  months.    The  delay  is  unfortunate,  but  any  decision  on  the 
trafficking question adverse to the defendant in whose favour a reasonable grounds 
decision  has  already  been  made,  but  before  the  third  stage  in  the  process  has  been 
completed is liable to be flawed. 

 

Neither  the  appellants  nor  the  interveners  accept  that  the  conclusive  decision  of 
UKBA (or whichever department becomes a competent authority for these purposes) 
is  determinative  of  the  question  whether  or  not  an  individual  has  been  trafficked. 
  
They, of course, are concerned with the impact of a decision adverse to the individual.  
We are asked to note that the number of concluded decisions in favour of victims of 
trafficking is relatively low, and it seems unlikely that a prosecutor will challenge or 
seem to disregard a concluded decision that an individual has been trafficked, but that 
 
possibility may arise.  Whether the concluded decision of the competent authority is 
 
favourable or adverse to the individual it will have been made by an authority vested 
with  the  responsibility  for  investigating  these  issues,  and  although  the  court  is  not 
bound by the decision, unless there is evidence to contradict it, or significant evidence 
that was not considered, it is likely that the criminal courts will abide by it. 
  

In the final analysis all the relevant evidence bearing on the issue of age, trafficking, 
exploitation and culpability must be addressed. The Crown is under an obligation to 
disclose all the material bearing on this issue which is available to it.  The defendant 

 
28.

L; HVN; THN; T -v- R 

is not so obliged, but if any such material exists, it would be remarkably foolish for 
the investigating authority to be deprived of it.  Without any obligation to refer the 
 
case to any of the different organisations or experts specialising in this field for their 
assessments  or  observations,  the  court  may  adjourn  as  appropriate,  for  further 
information  on  the  subject,  and  indeed  may  require  the  assistance  of  various 
authorities,  such  as  UKBA,  which  deal  in  these  issues.    However  that  may  be,  the 
ultimate responsibility cannot be abdicated by the court.   

 

30.	  What these appeals have revealed is that the issue of age in cases involving trafficked 
victims tends to attract less focus from those who act for the defendant rather than the 
 
Crown Prosecution Service which, on the whole appears to pursue the issues relating 
to age assessment with a measure of determination.  Our view is that the professions 
 
are  less  well  informed  about  the  importance of  these  issues  in  the  context  of  those 
 
who  are  or  may  be  trafficked  youngsters  than  perhaps  they  should  be.    Their 
 
importance is obvious and underlined by the outcome in each of the present appeals. 

 

31.	  We  suggest  that  where  any  issue  arises,  it  should  be  addressed  head  on  at  the  first 
appearance before the court, and that the documentation accompanying the defendant 
 
to court should record his date of birth, whether as asserted by him, or as best known 
to the prosecution, or indeed both.  Alternatively, the issues should be raised at the 
plea and case management hearing and appropriate adaptations should be made to the 
relevant forms to ensure that potential problems on this question are not overlooked. 

Indeed it is clear that abundant guidance is available to the various public bodies who 
may  be  involved  with  young  people  who  have  been  subjected  to  trafficking,  all 
consistent with our general approach.  In particular, such guidance is provided to the 
Crown Prosecution Service, the Police, and to Social Workers.  There is significant 
co-operation and sharing of information throughout the United Kingdom.  Thus, for 
example,  we  have  read  the  Guidance  provided  by  the  Association  of  Chief  Police 
Officers  to  officers  investigating  offences  involving  the  commercial  cultivation  of 
cannabis  where  children  are  found  on  the  relevant  premises.    The  availability  of 
detailed  informed  guidance  reinforces  the  seriousness  with  which  the  issue  of 
trafficking is being taken by the many different authorities into whose responsibility 
child  victims  of  trafficking  may  come,  long  before  the  court  processes  begin.    No 
doubt it will be at the heart of the fresh guidance to be issued by the Director of Public 
Prosecutions. 

As we have already explained the distinct question for decision once it is found that 
the defendant is a victim of trafficking is the extent to which the offences with which 
he is charged, or of which he has been found guilty are integral to or consequent on 
 
the exploitation of which he was the victim. We cannot be prescriptive.  In some cases 
 
the facts will indeed show that he was under levels of compulsion which mean that in 
reality culpability was extinguished.  If so when such cases are prosecuted, an abuse 
of process submission is likely to succeed. That is the test we have applied in these 
appeals.  In other cases, more likely in the case of a defendant who is no longer a 
child,  culpability  may  be  diminished  but  nevertheless  be  significant.    For  these 
individuals prosecution may well be appropriate, with due allowance to be made in 

 
32.	 

 
33.
--------

L; HVN; THN; T -v- R 

the sentencing decision for their diminished culpability.  In yet other cases, the fact 
that the defendant was a victim of trafficking will provide no more than a colourable 
excuse  for  criminality  which  is  unconnected  to  and  does  not  arise  from  their 
victimisation.  In such cases an abuse of process submission would fail. 

These appeals 

 
34.	 

The decisions reached in the present appeals are fact specific decisions. In order to 
ascertain  the  facts  we  have  admitted  as  fresh  evidence  under  s.23  of  the  Criminal 
Appeal Act 1968 a considerable body of evidence which, for different reasons, was 
 
not available to the trial court but which it would be unjust for this court to ignore. 
 
Our approach does however provide some broad guidance about the kind of case in 
which, following a proper investigation of the facts, a prosecution would have been 
unlikely, and if undertaken, would have culminated in a successful abuse of process 
argument.  What they do, however, underline, is that the investigating and prosecuting 
authorities,  the  legal  professions,  and  the  courts  must  be  alert  to  the  potential 
difficulties to which cases involving victims of trafficking can give rise. 

 

R v THN 

THN was born on 9 September 1994.  On 31  January 2012 in the Crown Court at 
Bristol he pleaded guilty to producing a controlled drug, of class B and was sentenced 
to a Detention and Training Order for 12 months.  He was released on 29 June 2012. 

The appellant had been removed from the United Kingdom in June 2009 after making 
two  attempts  to  enter  illegally.    On  1  September  2011  he  was  found  in  a  house  in 
Bristol  in  which  a  very  large  quantity  of  cannabis  was  being  cultivated.    He  was 
arrested.  He said that he had returned to the United Kingdom in December 2010.  He 
told the arresting officers that he was relieved to see them.  He was interviewed in the 
presence of his solicitor, and an interpreter, and an appropriate adult.  He said that he 
was nearly 17 years old.  A prepared statement was produced which indicated that he 
had been brought into England in a freezer container.  He owed money in Vietnam 
and the deeds to his parents’ home had been taken as collateral.   

On 2 September, at Bristol Youth Court, the CPS indicated that they had referred the 
case to Bristol City Council for age assessment.  On 7 September the police, acting as 
First Responders, referred THN to the UKBA.  So far, so good. 

On 7 October, it was concluded by those responsible for a full age assessment that the 
date of birth given to the police by the appellant was correct.  He was indeed nearly 
 
17 when he was arrested.  He had given the police a different account of the reasons 
and  circumstances  behind  his  departure  from  Vietnam.   He  appeared  in  the  Youth 
Court on 7 and 9 October, where the court concluded that the crime was too grave to 
be dealt with in the Youth Court.

On  18  October  the  appellant’s  solicitors  wrote  to  the  CPS  inviting  them  not  to 
prosecute THN on the basis that to do so would contravene the CPS Guidance relating 
to the prosecution of victims of trafficking.  By coincidence on 19 October UKBA 
gave a negative decision at the “reasonable grounds” stage.   

Two  days  later  the  case  was  committed  to  the  Crown  Court,  and  at  the  PCMH 
hearings  on  18  November  and  9  December  the  case  was  adjourned  for  further 
enquiries  into  the  appellant’s  allegation  that  he  was  the  victim  of  trafficking,  an 
assertion which was repeated as part of the defence statement. 

In December counsel for the appellant indicated that there would be an application to 
 
stay the indictment as an abuse of process, and the CPS was invited to reconsider the 
way in which the public interest test had been applied.  The CPS responded that the 
application would be opposed. 

 
42.	 

On 31 January 2012 the case was listed for plea.  No abuse of process application was 
pursued.  The appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced accordingly. 

 

43.	  While in custody the appellant met the Children’s Commissioner.  The NSPCC made 
 
a  further  referral  to  the  Competent  Authority.    On  28  June  a  positive  reasonable 
 
grounds decision was made by UKBA.  On the following day, on his release from the 
sentence,  the  appellant  was  put  into  the  care  of  the  local  authority.    He  was  there 
assessed as a child in need.  On 10 July he went missing.  It is believed that he had 
been re-trafficked.  By then he had waived privilege and instructions had been taken 
from him, and the appeal to this court was pursued in his absence on the basis of those 
instructions. 
 

Until shortly before the hearing of the appeal, the application for permission to appeal 
 
was opposed.  The respondent’s notice listed a number of features of the appellant’s 
case which was said to point away from the conclusion that he had been the victim of 
trafficking.  The  Crown  also  opposed  the  application  to  adduce  further  evidence 
which included a report on errors made by the UKBA during an initial assessment in 
2009  before  the  appellant’s  first  removal  from  the  United  Kingdom  in  June  2009. 
 
The  new  report  contains  a  constructive  account  of  the  operation  of  debt  bondage 
within Vietnam, and identifies a number of errors in the approach of UKBA when its 
first decision was adverse to the appellant. 

 

In  the  light  of  this  material  the  Crown  reconsidered  its  position.    Following  the 
reanalysis the Crown accepted that had the evidence which was now available been 
available at the time when the original decision to prosecute the appellant was made, 
on the basis of the public interest test in the context of trafficked children, there would 
have been no prosecution.  Mr Tim Owen QC therefore accepted that he would not 
seek to support the safety of the convictions.  We agree that there is now powerful 
evidence that the appellant was a trafficked child and that his criminal activities were 
integral to the circumstances in which he was a victim.  On the basis of the evidence

now  available,  if  the  appellant  had  been  prosecuted,  an  abuse  of  process  argument 
would have been likely to succeed.  Accordingly this conviction will be quashed. 

R v T

On  14  April  2010,  following  his  conviction  after  a  retrial  at  the  Crown  Court  at 
Harrow, T was sentenced to two years detention in a Young Offenders’ Institution for 
the  offence  of  cultivating  cannabis,  contrary  to  s.6(2)  of  the  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act 
1971.  305 days spent on remand were directed to count towards sentence. 

The evidence suggested that T had entered the United Kingdom illegally in 2007.  He 
 
was arrested and placed in the care of Kent County Council, which treated him as a 
 
child in need and provided him with accommodation.  Unfortunately he disappeared 
on the following day.  He next came to the attention of the authorities when he was 
arrested  in  a  house  in  Harrow  on  11  June  2009,  where  a  sophisticated  cannabis 
growing operation was discovered.  The Crown’s case was that he was responsible for 
tending the plants and cultivating them.  In interview he made no comment but, on the 
advice  of  his  solicitor,  read  a  prepared  statement,  in  which  he  denied  that  he  was 
tending  the  plants,  and  asserted  that  he  was  just  looking  after  the  house  while  the 
 
owner went to a party. 

At a hearing before the magistrates his age was considered.  On the basis of a report 
by  the  Youth  Offending  Team  the  magistrates  decided  that  he  was  an  adult  aged 
 
somewhere between 18 and 21 years.  In the Crown Court at Harrow in October 2009, 
before the first trial, the trial judge considered the appellant’s age before the jury were 
sworn.  He  heard  the  appellant  give  evidence,  and  concluded  that  he  was  over  18. 
 
The trial proceeded, but the jury could not agree and was discharged.   

On  23  November  2009  the  appellant  provided  the  police  with  his  birth  certificate. 
 
That showed his date of birth as 20 October 1992.  This was sent by the police to 
Interpol  and  to  UKBA  for  verification.  The  retrial  was  listed  for  2  March  2010. 
Interpol had received no information from Vietnam, and the officer in the case told 
the judge that in a previous case it had taken a year to obtain information about a birth 
certificate issued in Vietnam.  The judge was provided with a copy of the relevant 
document.  If genuine, it showed that even at the date of retrial, he was still 17 years 
old.  It was said on the appellant’s behalf that no issues had been raised by UKBA to 
contradict the accuracy of this birth certificate. 

 

 

The judge decided to hear evidence from the appellant.  He said that he had a passport 
when  he  left  Vietnam,  but  it  had  been  taken  from  him  by  those  responsible  for 
 
bringing  him  into  the  United  Kingdom.    He  said  that  he  had  obtained  the  birth 
certificate  via  an  uncle.    The  Crown  submitted  that  the  applicant  did  not  have  a 
passport, that the birth certificate may or may not be genuine, and that in addition to 
considering  his  evidence  the  judge  should  consider  the  appellant’s  appearance. 
 
Wisely, the judge suggested that this assessment was not always easy, particularly that 
cusp  “17  to  18”.  The  judge  gave  a  short  ruling  in  which  she  concluded  that  the
--------

appellant was 18 years old.  No questions were asked which related to the issue of 
trafficking.  In evidence the appellant in effect repeated what he had said to the police 
when  he  was  first  arrested,  and  purported  to  offer  an  innocent  explanation  for  the 
 
presence  of  his  finger  prints  on  the  side  of  a  tub  of  a  product  called  Bud  Blaster, 
which is used in the cultivation of cannabis.  Following conviction the appellant was 
due to be sentenced on 14 April. 

In  the  meantime,  while  evidence  relating  to  his  age  was  pursued,  the  appellant 
 
changed his legal representation.  A Merton compliant age assessment was carried out 
by the Kent County Council Social Services Department.  This gave him the benefit 
of the doubt. It concluded that the date of birth on the birth certificate was correct, and 
in  their  opinion,  therefore,  the  appellant  was  even  then  only  18  years  old.    The 
NSPCC provided a letter dated 13 April 2010, which indicated that the appellant may 
have been the victim of trafficking.  An application was then made to the judge to 
reconsider the question of the appellant’s age.  

The judge agreed to do so.  She considered the assessment made by the social services 
 
department,  observing  that  it  was  “not  unchallengeable”.    In  particular  those 
responsible for the preparation of the assessment had accepted the account given by 
 
the appellant without question. Having heard the evidence in the hearing before her, 
and then during the trial, she did not find him a convincing witness in relation to his 
age.  He was at least 18 years old. 

 

During the course of her ruling, she went on to add that throughout the trial, she had 
suspected that the appellant may have been the victim of trafficking, but as the issue 
was not raised, she had not voiced her suspicions.  In fact the appellant informed his 
 
new solicitors that he had been trafficked on the day before the judge gave her latest 
ruling.  Having  concluded  that  the  appellant  was  at  least  18  years  old,  she  heard 
submissions  in  mitigation  and  then  passed  sentence.    In  her  sentencing  remarks, 
significantly for present purposes, she said “you have been a very vulnerable young 
man, you have been used by others who are more sophisticated than yourself, … you 
played no part in setting up this sophisticated factory, and you were very low down in 
the chain of people involved”.  He was to be sentenced as a gardener. 

Subsequent events emphasised the difficulties  faced  by  judges  sitting  in  the  Crown 
Court who are called upon to make determinations about age and possible trafficking 
status.  On  the  information  available  to  the  sentencing  judge,  we  see  no  basis  for 
criticising  her  conclusions.  The  reality  however,  is  that,  until  after  conviction  no 
proper  consideration  was  given  to  the  question  whether  the  appellant  had  been  the 
 
victim  of  trafficking.  The  issue  continued  to  be  pursued  whilst  he  was  serving  his 
sentence, and indeed after his release.  On 28 March 2012 UKBA as the competent 
authority concluded that the appellant had indeed been a child victim of trafficking. 
  
This decision did not reach his solicitors until April 2013, and it was not provided to 
the Crown by those representing the appellant until 14 April 2013.  In addition those 
then  representing  the  appellant  obtained  a  report  from  a  former  police  officer  with 
considerable  experience  in  cases  involving  trafficked  victims,  including  from

Vietnam,  in  the  context  of  their  deployment  in  cannabis  factories.    His  report  also 
concluded that the appellant had been the victim of trafficking. 

 
55.	 

There  were  a  very  high  number  of  inconsistencies  in  the  accounts  given  by  the 
appellant at various stages in the investigation.  The Crown was minded to resist this 
appeal until shortly before the hearing, but once it was accepted that the appellant had 
 
been  the  victim  of  trafficking,  and  that  his  presence  as  a  gardener  in  the  cannabis 
factory formed part and parcel of the process in which he was victimised, a series of 
inconsistencies in the explanations provided by the appellant at different stages could 
 
not be determinative of the appellant’s age, nor indeed whether he was the victim of 
 
trafficking.  On the basis of the evidence which was not then available, the Crown 
accepts that had these facts been known at the time when the decision to prosecute 
was made, the appellant would not have been prosecuted.  To that we should add that 
if he had been prosecuted, on the basis now available, an abuse of process argument 
 
would have been likely to succeed.  This appeal will be allowed. 

R v HVN 

On 8 May 2012 at Nottingham Crown Court HVN pleaded guilty to two counts of 
producing a controlled drug of class B, contrary to s.4(2)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs 
Act  1971.  On  21  May  he  was  sentenced  to  8  months  detention  and  training 
concurrent on each count.   

Count  1  related  to  a  police raid  of  a  house  in  Derby  in  early  2011.    Cannabis  was 
being  grown  on  a  professional  scale,  but  no  one  was  there.    The  appellant’s  finger 
prints were found on items in this house, but at this stage he was not traced.  In the 
 
early  hours  of  the  morning  of  5  March  2012  police  officers  attended  a  house  in 
Mansfield.  They had been alerted by a number of local residents who had seen the 
 
defendant being removed from the house by a group of men.  His hands were bound. 
 
The police found him nearby, barefoot and apparently frightened.  Inside the house a 
large  quantity  of  cannabis  was  being  grown,  as  a  professional  operation.    The 
appellant was arrested.  He admitted that he had been in the premises and was looking 
after the crop.  He knew it was cannabis, but initially did not know it was illegal.  He 
worked  that  out  later.  In  the  meantime  the  finger  prints  taken  from  the  house  in 
Derby  were  matched  with  the  finger  prints  taken  from  the  appellant  when  he  was 
arrested. 

 

The  police  immediately  referred  HVN  to  the  social  services  department  of 
Nottinghamshire County Council.  An age assessment interview was conducted.  The 
 
appellant had provided a date of birth which was accepted by social workers, and it 
was concluded that he was then just under 17 years old.  They also recorded that he 
“described  being  locked  in  a  cannabis  cultivation  house  by  gang  members  that 
recruited him in London.  He was driven to Nottinghamshire – an unknown location 
to him at the time.  He was unable to leave the property once he was locked in.  He 
 
was left with ample food supplies by the gang.  They also set out his account of how 
he had travelled from Vietnam to the United Kingdom.  He has in fact given a number 

 
56.

L; HVN; THN; T -v- R 

of inconsistent accounts about his movements both during his journey to the United 
Kingdom, and within the United Kingdom itself”.  At this stage it does not appear that 
any  thought  was  given  by  anyone  to  the  fact that  the  appellant  may  have  been  the 
victim of trafficking. 

On 6 March the appellant was produced before the District Judge (Youth Court) in 
Mansfield.  He  was  represented  by  his  solicitor  and  indicated  that  he  would  be 
pleading guilty.  The prosecution submitted that these were not grave crimes, and that 
the  case  should  be  heard  in  the  Youth  Court.    The  District  Judge  disagreed  and 
directed that committal papers should be prepared.  The appellant was remanded in 
 
custody.  He was removed to a Wetherby Young Offenders’ Institution, which on 22 
April, referred the case to the NRM. The NSPCC, acting as first responder under the 
NRM  arrangements,  referred  the  appellant  to  UKBA  as  a  suspected  victim  of 
 
trafficking.  At this stage the system was working as it should.   

Shortly  afterwards,  on  23  April,  the  appellant  appeared  by  way  of  video  link  at 
Nottingham  Crown  Court.    As  there  was  no  interpreter,  the  case  was  adjourned. 
 
Before adjourning the case the judge was told that investigations were being made in 
to the question whether or not the appellant had been trafficked. 

Shortly afterwards, on 4 May, UKBA made a reasonable grounds decision that HVN 
may  indeed  have  been  the  victim  of  trafficking.    For  some  reason  this  was  not 
communicated  either  to  the  prosecution  or  to  the  defence,  and  there  is  nothing  to 
suggest that either the prosecution or the defence thought about contacting UKBA.  

On 8 May at Nottingham Crown Court HHJ Milmo QC expressed surprised that the 
case was being dealt with in the Crown Court at all.  He also made a direct inquiry 
 
whether or not the appellant had been trafficked.  No one told him, because no one 
 
knew, of the UKBA reasonable grounds decision.  The appellant pleaded guilty to the 
two counts on the indictment, and the case was adjourned for preparation of a pre-
sentence report. 

On  21  May  the  case  came  on  for  sentence  before  His  Honour  Judge  Sampson. 
 
Although it was now over a month old, no one in court appears to have been aware of 
the UKBA decision.  In sentencing the appellant the judge observed “the mitigation is 
 
your guilty plea, you are a vulnerable individual who was, to a degree, exploited and 
significantly, your youth”. 

Thereafter the CPS became aware of the UKBA decision.  On 19 July they wrote to 
the appellant’s solicitors informing them of it.  On 25 July, out of time, draft grounds 
of  appeal  were  sent  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  office,  now  well  out  of  time,  and  the 
 
Crown  responded  indicating  that  the  application  for  permission  to  appeal  would  be 
 
resisted.

According to the affidavit of the appellant’s representative, after he was sentenced, 
they  were  told  that  a  conclusive  UKBA  decision  was  imminent,  but  this  did  not 
appear until October 2012.  This confirmed the appellant’s trafficked status.  The file 
was provided by UKBA to the appellant’s solicitors in March 2013, and then passed 
to the Crown during the course of or immediately after a directions hearing in these 
 
appeals before Thirlwall J in April 2013. 

Amended grounds of appeal were then produced, very shortly before the hearing of 
the  appeals,  together,  belatedly,  with  the  appropriate  Form  Ws  in  support  of  an 
 
application to adduce evidence from the appellant and from his solicitors (whose firm 
 
still represented him).  The appellant’s statement is short and lacking in detail.   

  

   

The Crown’s initial response was that the application for permission to appeal against 
conviction  was  premature,  and  that  further  investigations  were  needed  before  the 
 
Crown  could  accept  UKBA’s  conclusion.  We  have  some  sympathy  with  this 
approach, particularly in a case where the defendant had pleaded guilty and was still 
represented  by  the  same  solicitors  who  had  advised  him.   However,  the  practical 
realities are that on arrest the appellant was identified as a young person, still under 17 
 
years of age.  Notwithstanding the circumstances in which the police were alerted to 
what was happening to the appellant in Mansfield no thought appears to have been 
given to the possibility that he was a trafficked child.  That arose for consideration 
after  the  referral  made  byNSPCC.    The  original  grounds  of  appeal  drafted  by  the 
 
solicitor  reveal  a  lack  of  understanding  about  the  nature  of  child  trafficking.    The 
information plainly required consideration (hence the referral under the NRM) but the 
solicitor  concluded  that  there  was  “no  indication  of  any  issues  relating  to  the 
 
possibility that the applicant had been trafficked”.  This was not because the appellant 
had  not  told  her  of  his  situation,  but  rather,  we  apprehend  (but  have  not  thought  it 
necessary  to  investigate  further)  because  she  may  have  thought  that  there  was  a 
relevant distinction to be drawn between the appellant having been “smuggled” rather 
than  “trafficked”  into  the  United  Kingdom.    However  that  may  be,  a  reasonable 
 
grounds decision that the appellant had been trafficked was made before he pleaded 
guilty.  Quite where the fault lies, the guilty plea was tendered in ignorance of that 
important  (albeit  not  conclusive)  fact.    We  have  now  been  provided  with  UKBA’s 
 
conclusive decision.  On the basis of the evidence now available it is clear, that the 
 
appellant would not have been prosecuted, and that if the prosecution had proceeded 
and the Crown Court was fully informed of the facts now available, the case would 
have been stopped as an abuse of process.  Accordingly the appeal against conviction 
will be allowed.

On 16 May 2011 at Blackfriars Crown Court she pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 
6 months imprisonment for possession of a false identity document contrary to s.25 of 
the Identity Cards Act 2006. 

The  facts  relating  to  the  offence  are  straightforward.    On  17  January  2011  the 
 
appellant  attended  the  Camden  Job  Centre  Plus  to  apply  for  a  national  insurance 
number.  In support of her application she produced a passport issued in Portugal, and 
gave her true name and date of birth.  The passport was checked, and proved to be 
 
forged.  She was arrested on 2 March 2011. 

Following  arrest  she  was  interviewed.    She  said  that  she  had  been  in  the  United 
 
Kingdom for seven years and came from Uganda. She was born in Portugal and she 
 
had  travelled  to  the  United  Kingdom  on  the  promise  of  finding  work  as  a  child 
minder, using a false passport from Uganda.  She said that she had been held captive 
 
in the North of England and forced into prostitution for several years. When she had 
been  released  by  her  female  trafficker  she  had  been  given  a  Portuguese  passport 
 
which  the  appellant  believed  she  was  entitled  to  and  believed  was  genuine.    She 
moved to London some six months before her arrest where a new man controlled her 
movements. 

It is clear from the correspondence between her and her solicitor that she was advised 
to  plead  not  guilty  on  the  basis  of  an  honest  belief  that  the  passport  she  used  was 
genuine, but her solicitor also advised her to report to the police the fact that she had 
 
in effect been a prisoner who was misused as a slave.  At the time she received this 
 
advice L was in custody in HMP Holloway.  However the solicitor’s advice contained 
this warning: 
 

“If the police conclude that your account is false then you risk 
being  charged  with  wasting  time  and/or  perverting  the  course 
of justice which are, potentially, more serious than the charge 
you currently face”. 

No attempt was made to use the NRM.  In the light of the advice she received, the 
appellant’s plea of guilty is not difficult to understand. 

 

73.	  While the appellant was in custody, on 31 May, she was referred by a support group 
within Holloway Prison to the Poppy Project.  Shortly afterwards, on 2 June she was 
released.  In early 2012 the Poppy Project began a detailed investigation of the case. 
 
The fresh material includes an affidavit from the appellant dated 18 May 2012, a letter 
dated  13  March  2012  from  a  senior  support  worker  at  the  Poppy  Project,  a  report 
dated 16 April 2012 from a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Zapata-Bravo and a letter dated 
4 July 2012 from UKBA. 

There  is  powerful  evidence  that  the  appellant  fell  to  be  treated  as  a  “victim  of 
international  trafficking  for  sexual  exploitation  in  forced  prostitution”.    She  was 
suffering  from  complex  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  with  severe  trauma.    UKBA

found  that  there  were  conclusive  grounds  for  believing  that  she  had  indeed  been 
trafficked.  Having  examined  the  evidence  the  prosecution  concluded  that  the 
appellant should indeed be treated as a credible victim of trafficking.  Although the 
 
Crown was concerned about a possible absence of any link between the offence the 
appellant had actually committed and any compulsion to commit the offence arising 
out of the fact that she was a victim of trafficking, the Crown concluded that if the 
 
actual  facts  had  been  known  at  the  time  when  the  decision  to  prosecute  had  been 
made, the case would not have proceeded.  Given the appellant’s prolonged exposure 
 
to involuntary prostitution and enforced control, the offence she actually committed 
appears to us to have arisen as a result of her being a victim of trafficking who was 
 
provided with a forged passport for her to use as if it were genuine, and the use of it 
represented a step in a process by which she would escape.  On the basis of the facts 
which  are  now  known,  if  this  appellant  had  been  prosecuted,  an  abuse  of  process 
 
argument would have been advanced with a realistic prospect of success.  The appeal 
will therefore be allowed.

LEICESTER CROWN COURT 

 

26 JUNE 2013 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE LEGGATT 

 
 
 
You have been found guilty by the jury of murder.  On 6 October 2012 – 2 days before the 
 

decree nisi for your divorce – you murdered your wife, Sally, by deliberately crashing your 
 

car in which she was a passenger into a tree.   

The  way  in  which  you  killed  Sally  was  both  brutal  and  carefully  planned.    You  must  have 
 

singled out the spot on the Gartree Road, a road you knew well, as a place that suited your 
 

 

purpose: a large tree with clear ground in front of it on a gentle bend in the road.  You chose 
 

 

a  weekend  when  your  son William  was  away  on  a school  trip.  Several journeys  before the 

 

 

final one, you disabled the passenger air bag in preparation for what you planned to do.  You 
 

 

chose  the  time  on  that  Saturday  evening  when  you  knew  that  Sally  would  be  leaving  the 
 

house to get into her car to drive to Derby, and you lay in wait for her.   

  

How you got Sally into your car, and whether by trickery or force, no one but you can know. 

 

I  suspect  it  was  a  combination  of  the  two.  However  you  achieved  it,  she  cannot  have 

 

imagined what you were planning to do next. 

The evidence at this trial has clearly established how you killed Sally.  As you approached the 
 

spot which was your target, you reached across and unclipped her seatbelt.  Then you steered 
 

  

 

the  car  at  the  tree  and  drove  straight  into  it  at  over  50  mph.    You  aimed  so  that  the  
 

 

 

 

passenger’s side of the car struck the tree and bore the full brunt of the collision.  You had 

the protection of an air bag and seatbelt – protection you had made sure that Sally did not 
 

 

have.  And to protect yourself further, you got into the brace position before the crash.  It was
--------
not  chance,  but  the  result  of  your  careful  and  cold-blooded  planning,  that  you  came  away 
 

from the collision with a few bruises, while Sally died of catastrophic injuries.  

 

You thought that the crash would be seen as a tragic accident and that you would get away 
 

with murder.  You would indeed have done so if it had not been for the careful and thorough 
 

investigation carried out by the police. 

As  we  have  heard  from  the  statement  that  has  been  read  out  just  now  in  court,  the 

consequences of what you did have been devastating.  Not only for Sally whose life you ended 

 

so cruelly, but for her daughters and sister and other members of her family and people who 

were close to her.  Above all for your own young son whom you have robbed of his mother, 

and who will have to live his life in the knowledge that she was murdered by his own father. 

 

The sentence for murder is fixed by law.  It is a life sentence.  I must also set the minimum 
 

term:  in  other  words,  the  length  of  time  you  must  stay  in  prison  before  you  can  even  be  
 

considered for release.  It is important to understand that at the end of the minimum term, 

 

you will not automatically be released: that will only happen if and when the Parole Board 
 

decides that it is safe to allow your release from prison.  If and when you are released it will 
 

 

be on licence, and your life sentence will not then come to an end.  You will have to obey the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions of your licence for the rest of your life – otherwise you may be recalled to prison. 

  

The  law  requires  me  to  set  the  minimum  term  by  first  deciding  the  appropriate  starting 
 

 

 

point,  following  rules  laid  down  by  Act  of  Parliament.   I  must  then  increase  the  minimum  
 

   

 

term  upwards  from  that  starting  point  to  take  account  of  any  factors  which  make  your 
 

offence worse, or downwards to take account of any factors which lessen your offence.    

 

In choosing the starting point, I must consider whether your crime falls within the category 
 

of  cases  specified  by  Parliament  where  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  is  particularly  high. 

 

Cases which would normally fall within this category include a murder done for gain.   

 

It is clear to me from the evidence that you had two motives for murdering Sally.  One was 
 

that you could not and would not accept that your marriage was over and were determined 
 

 

that  Sally  would  never  leave  you.    Your  other  motive  was  financial  gain.    You  refused  to 
 

accept that Sally should have the money from the house, although you had been advised that 
 

 

it was her due.  In a text message Sally sent to her daughter the night before she died – and 
 

after you had told her that you wanted half the house and by rights should have more, as well 

 

as keeping all your other assets – Sally said: “I know money isn’t everything, but to him it is”. 
  

You chose to murder Sally rather than lose her and face what you felt was the humiliation of 
 

 

 

2
--------
divorce;  but  also,  and  just  as  importantly  for  you,  to  prevent  her  from  getting  the  money 
 

from the house, and to keep the house for yourself. 

The fact that you were motivated partly by financial gain is therefore one factor which makes 
 

your crime all the more serious.  The law also punishes more severely crimes which involve 

  

the use of a weapon, particularly if the weapon is taken to the scene with the intention that it 
 

will be used.  In this case you did not arm yourself with a gun or a knife.  But in disabling the 

 

passenger airbag and unclipping Sally’s seatbelt  before crashing your car into the tree, you 
 

 

made  your  car  into  a  machine  as  lethal  as  any  weapon,  and  drove  it  to  the  scene  with  the 

intention of using it to kill.   

A  third  factor  which  makes  your  crime  all  the  more  serious  is  the  high  degree  of  planning  
 

and premeditation that went into it. The way in which you killed Sally involved a plan that 

you must have plotted out over days, if not weeks, in all its malevolent detail, and which you 

then executed with ruthless efficiency.  

Despite  these  factors,  the  view  I  take  is  that  this  case  falls  short  of  the  category  where  the 
 

seriousness of the offence is particularly high even for cases of murder – but only just.  That 
 

means  that  the  appropriate  starting  point  in  setting  the  minimum  term  is  15  years;  but  I 

must  increase  its  length  very  substantially  beyond  that  to  reflect  the  seriousness  of  your 

offence and the factors I have mentioned. 

The only factor in your favour is that you are previously of good character – though that can 

 

 

count for little where the crime you have committed is as vile as this.  

 

I also take account of your age – which is 53 – and how much of the rest of your life you are 
 

 

likely  to  have  to  spend  in  prison.    Had  I  not  made  allowance  for  that,  the  minimum  term 
 

 

would have been higher. 

 

I  have  weighed  up  all  these  factors.    My  conclusion  is  that  the  minimum  term  which  you  
 

 

 

must  spend  in  prison  before  you  can  be  considered  for  release  on  licence  is  a  term  of  24 
 

years. The 257 days you have already spent in prison will be deducted from that.  

The  result  is  that  the  sentence  I  pass  is  a  life  sentence,  and  you  must  stay  in  prison  for  at 

 

least the next 24 years (less 257 days).

DEVENDRA SINGH
 

 

 
STAFFORD CROWN COURT 

 

25 JUNE 2013 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE SIMON TONKING 

 
Facts of the offence 
 

You have been convicted by the jury of an offence of murder. That offence was 

 

committed on 3rd September of last year, your victim being your wife, Charlotte 
 
Smith. Miss Smith was 42 when she died and you had been married for a little under 
2 years. 
  
 
There can be no doubt that at the time of your marriage, and for some time 

 

beforehand, you and Miss Smith had been in a deep and loving relationship and that 
this continued to be the case after you came to England in November 2011.  

 
Equally there can be no doubt that during the course of last year, 2012, the 

 
relationship deteriorated - not through any significant fault on either side but simply 
because of the situation itself. This deterioration began when whilst Charlotte was 
 
working, you were not and, without friends or family in this country, you were 
entirely dependent on her - and although from April onwards, you were very 
 
generously provided with work by Charlotte’s father, Mr. Pater Smith, Charlotte 
remained the main breadwinner. As time went on she also came to realise that, 
having enjoyed a very independent lifestyle for so long, marriage was putting serious 
restrictions on her life and was not something that, after all, she really wanted.  

 

 

 

 

 
This is not to say that either of you stopped loving the other, but these 

 

 

difficulties led to strain, stress and argument which, try as you both did, you could 
not overcome.   

 

 
By 3rd September Charlotte had made it clear to you, as well as to others, that 

she was unhappy and that, at the very least, she was unsure that she wanted the 
marriage to continue. For your part you were determined for the marriage to 
continue and were becoming increasingly upset with the situation: and, as the two 
psychiatrists who have examined you in the course of these proceedings have both 
 
concluded, you had become moderately depressed. 

 

 

 

 

 
None of this however, whilst it provides the background to what happened on 
3rd September, can begin to explain let alone excuse what you did on that day. During 
 
the daytime, having shut the shop you drank vodka, although not in such quantity 

 

 

1
--------
that it significantly affected you. When you got home, I am prepared to accept that 
you and Charlotte argued and that your argument became heated: your attack on her 
cannot have come out of the blue. Nor can I be sure that this argument did not lead to 
some kind of physical struggle between you.  

 

 
What I do not accept however is that Charlotte took up a knife, held you by 

the collar and made to stab you with it: I reject this account (a) because of the 
implausibility of your account about this - in particular your inability to explain how 
 
you were able to disarm her without any injury to your hand - and (b) because of 
 
what I know of her character from those witnesses who described her. 

 

 

 
I am also sure that she did not tell you that she had contacts and that she 

would arrange for them to come and finish you off since, in the context of the 
evidence about your relationship and her character, this is so far fetched as to be 
fanciful. 
 
 
Instead, I am satisfied so that I am sure of it, that in the heat of the argument 

 

and the limited fight that you may have been having, you took up the ornamental 
elephant and, neither in revenge nor loss of control but in anger, you struck her with 
it and continued to strike her with it until, within a very short time, she lost 
consciousness and, very quickly, also lost her life.  

 

 
This was a ferocious and brutal attack, predominantly to her head, using force 
which Dr. Bedryzsci, an experienced pathologist, categorised as extreme and causing 
 
what he described as the worst head injuries that he has ever encountered. In the 
light of this I am satisfied that your intention, at that time, was to kill her. It was not 
an intention of longstanding but borne spontaneously of your anger, but it was your 
intention nevertheless. 

 

 

 

 

As a result of your actions your wife lost her life – and she is now lost to her 

 
Impact 
 
 
parents and to her many friends. I have read with care and compassion the victim 
 
personal statements of her father, Mr. Peter Smith, her mother Mrs. Irene Cork and a 
 
joint statement which they have made together with Miss Smith’s stepfather. I have 
also read two letters written by those who knew her well.  
 
 
These statements contain personal matters to which I deliberately do not refer 
in detail but it should be recorded that Charlie’s death is not the first tragedy that her 
parents have had to suffer, losing their son to cancer 5 years ago. Now both their 
children are gone and, in essence, both of Charlie’s parents, to whom she meant so 
much, have had their lives devastated and made empty and, as they say in a joint 
statement, words cannot express how it feels to lose her in such a brutal way.  
 
 
SENTENCE 
 
 
It is a sentence of imprisonment for life.  
 
 
Minimum term – considerations: 
 

There is only one sentence which I can pass for this offence – and I do so now. 

 

 

 

 

 
Because this is a life sentence I must set a minimum term which you must 

serve before you will be eligible for release on parole, but you will only be released if 
  
the Parole Board decide that it is safe to do so. 

 

 

 

2
--------
The minimum term which I set is to reflect the seriousness of your offence, 
not the danger which you may present, and in assessing the appropriate minimum 
term I have considered the starting point in the light of the provisions laid down by 
Parliament in Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. I have also been helpfully 
referred to 3 cases in which the Court of Appeal considered minimum terms in cases 
in each of which the appellant had murdered his wife.  
 
Starting point 

 
It is common ground in this case that the starting point for the minimum 

 

term in your case is one of 15 years. But that is only the starting point from which I 
must move on to consider both the aggravating and mitigating factors in your case.  
 
 
Aggravating factors: 
 

 

Your offence has no statutory aggravating factors, but it is aggravated by a 

number of other matters: 

 

the sheer ferocity of the attack which you perpetrated with what was a heavy 
  
and significant weapon; 
the fact that you fled the house knowing that, at the very least, your wife was 
unconscious and very seriously injured. In the event, even if you had 
summoned help, it is clear that she would not have survived but your thought 
at that time was entirely for yourself and not at all for her;  

 

 
- what is more, having fled the house you pretended both to one of her friends 
 

 

and to her own father - by responding to text messages which they had sent to 
 
her mobile phone - that Charlotte Smith was feeling unwell but otherwise 
unharmed; 
you also left your wife’s body at the house to be found by someone else: and in 
the event the person who found her was her father who, as a result, suffered 
very significant shock and distress.  

-

 

 
Mitigating factors: 
 
 

-

 

-

 

-
-

 
 

-

 

-

 

-

 

 

 

Your offence has this/these statutory mitigating features:  
your actions, whilst they were sustained, were not pre-meditated;  
you were suffering from a moderate depressive episode which, to a limited 
extent, affected your rational judgement and made you, to adopt Mr. Karu’s 
phrase “mentally fragile”, but the amount by which it lowers your culpability 
  
is small; 
you have no previous convictions or cautions.  

 

I also have regard to the facts that:  
despite your evidence that you do not know, or remember, what you did once 
your attack on your wife began, you have not contested the fact that you killed 
her and that you did so unlawfully; 
you are, I am satisfied, sorry for and ashamed by what you did.  

 

For reasons I have already explained, I am satisfied that you do not have the 
mitigation of having had an intention only to cause Miss Smith really serious injury 
rather than to kill her. I am also satisfied that you were not provoked by her to do 
what you did nor were you acting, to any extent at all, in self-defence.  
 
 

 

3
--------
Taking account of all of these factors and of the facts of the case, I am satisfied 

 
Minimum term: 
 
 
that the aggravating features outweigh the mitigating features in this case. The 
  
minimum term which you will serve is one of 16 years. 
 
Time spent in custody: 
 

From this is to be deducted the time which you have spent in custody on 

 

It is most important that you – and everyone concerned with this case – 

remand – namely 290 days – so that the actual minimum term will be one of 15 years 
and 75 days.  
 
Consequences of sentence: 
 
 
should understand what the minimum term means. The minimum term is NOT a 
 
fixed term after which you will automatically be released but the MINIMUM term 
after which you will be able to apply for release on parole. But it will be for the Parole 
Board to say, at that time, whether or not it is safe for you to be released: and until it 
is so satisfied you will remain in custody.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If and when you are released you stand to be deported automatically but if for 
any reason you are not deported you will be subject to licence for the rest of your life; 
 
and if for any reason that licence were to be revoked, you would be recalled to prison 
to continue to serve your life sentence in custody.  
 
 
I also paid tribute to the dignity and restraint which Miss Smith’s 
 
parents showed throughout the trial and to the professional manner in 
  
which the case was conducted by the advocates.

 ‐v‐

CHUDLEY 
 

18 June 2013 
 

 

 

Sentencing remarks of the Hon Mr Justice Bean 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michael Raymond Chudley.  Four years ago you began a court case against Christopher Sear. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

His solicitor was Jim Ward.  Mr Ward was a decent, conscientious, highly respected solicitor 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Devizes.  He did his proper professional duty for Mr Sear, as he had done for many clients 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over many years. 
 

 

 

You lost the case, and lost a great deal of money in the process.  So you decided to take your 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenge on Mr Ward.  You armed yourself with a sawn off shotgun, drove to the market 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

square in Devizes and walked into the offices of Mr Ward’s firm.  You threatened to shoot 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the receptionist Daphne Courtney and forced her to lead you upstairs.  I am quite satisfied 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you intended to kill Mr Ward.  You fired a single shot to his head, then walked out as 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calmly  as  you  had  arrived,  got  into  your  car  and  drove  off. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

execution. 
   

It  was  a  chilling,  calculated 
 

 

 

 

 

Mr Ward’s widow, Nicola Morris, gave her evidence with admirable dignity and composure, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the effect of this murder on her and her family has been appalling.  I have read the very 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moving  victim  impact  statement  written  on  behalf  of  the  whole  family  by  Mr  Ward’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

daughter Louise Ward Morris.  She writes that her mother and sister have suffered from 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depression  and  panic  attacks  which  sometimes  make  everyday  tasks into  mountains.  All
--------
three children of Mr Ward have lost a loving father.  His mother Susan has outlived her son. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  also  note  that  Daphne  Courtney  has  suffered  severe  post‐traumatic  stress  with  panic 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attacks  and  flashbacks  which  can  stop  her  in  her  tracks.  She  writes  in  her  victim  impact 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement that she was frightened beyond description by your attack and by the threat to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her life.  She feels a sense of guilt although in my view there was nothing she could have 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done to save Mr Ward. 
 

 

 

 

 

Because  you  wallow  in  self‐pity  and  think  only  of  yourself  I  doubt  whether  any  of  this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bothers you at all.  Indeed, when you are asked in the witness box whether you felt any 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remorse for the death of Mr Ward you replied “I don’t know what the word means.  I have 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no feelings about Ward.”  In this respect at least you were telling the truth. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The sentence for murder is, as it must be, imprisonment for life.  I turn to consider, as I am 
 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required to do by schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the minimum period which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you must serve in prison. 
   

 

 

 

 

The starting point for murder with a firearm is a minimum term of 30 years.  The statutory 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  factor  in  this  case  is  that  the  defence  involved  a  significant  degree  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premeditation.  This was a calculated revenge attack. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

If you were an offender in your late 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

twenties  or  thirties  the  appropriate  minimum  term  before  allowing  for  mitigating  factors 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be at least 33 years. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

I turn to possible mitigating factors.  The doctors agree that you have a paranoid personality 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disorder. 

     

I  do  not  consider  that  this  is  what  Parliament  had  in  mind  when  referring  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph  11  of  the  schedule  to  a  mental  disorder  or  mental  disability  which  lowers  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offender’s degree of culpability.  Its effect on sentence can be no more than marginal. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The mitigating factor which does apply in this case is your age.  You were 62 at the time of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the offence, far older than most murderers.  You will be an exceptionally elderly prisoner 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before you can be considered for release.  I bear in mind also that in 2008 you suffered a 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mild heart attack. 
 

 

 

I consider that the appropriate minimum term is 28 years.
--------
You are entitled to credit for the 349 days you have already spent on remand in custody: the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formal order of the court will therefore specify a period of 27 years and 16 days from today. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There will be concurrent sentences on the other counts: 5 years imprisonment for each of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  counts  of  possession  of  a  firearm  with  intent  and  7  years  imprisonment  for  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threat to kill Daphne Courtney.  These will not affect the length of time you will spend in 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

custody.  The  statutory  victim  surcharge  provisions  apply.  The  sawn  off  shotgun  and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ammunition are to be forfeited and destroyed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The 28 year term is the minimum that you will serve.  I am not ordering that you are to be 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released at the end of it.  That will be a matter for the Parole Board.  Only in the year 2040 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you will be 90, will they be entitled for the first time to decide whether it is safe to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

release you.  If the board does release you will remain on licence and liable to recall for the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest of your life. 
   

 

 

 

It may be that you will die in prison.  But that is a possibility for which you have only yourself

Sentencing Remarks by Mr Justice Singh

26 July 2013 

Mr Thomas was 76 years old and lived by himself at the Chapter House, on the edge of 

[The defendants may remain seated for the time being.] 
 
 
Introduction 
 
1. 
Frankie Parker and Gary Smith have been convicted by the jury of the murder of Llywelyn 
Thomas on 17 December 2011.  Gary Smith has also been convicted by the jury of robbery on the 
same occasion.  Frankie Parker had already pleaded guilty to that offence.  The third defendant, John 
Smith has pleaded guilty to a charge of assisting Gary Smith by providing him with a false alibi when 
interviewed by the police on 30 August 2012. 
 
2. 
Chittering, on the A10 between Cambridge and Ely.  Frankie Parker and Gary Smith had been 
observing the house for several days and had decided to burgle it.  They were professional burglars 
who had prepared carefully for the part, wearing dark clothing and gloves.  Frankie Parker was the 
older of the two, then aged 24, and was well aware of the need to avoid leaving forensic evidence.  
Gary Smith was then aged 19.  Although Frankie Parker was carrying a crowbar, there was in fact no 
need to break into the premises.  They went to the front door and knocked on it.  When Mr Thomas 
answered, they gave him a concocted story and barged into the house: at least one of them punched 
him in that process.  One of them put a blanket over the head of Mr Thomas.  The house was 
ransacked both downstairs and upstairs.  Not much of value could be found: only three watches, an 
ornamental egg and a wallet containing some money.  The burglars were interested in finding any 
safe.  It may be for that reason that they marched Mr Thomas upstairs.   
 
3. 
of one or both of them had been seen by him so that he might be able to identify them later, they 
decided to launch a violent and brutal attack on him at the entrance to his bedroom.  Having heard 
the evidence given at the trial, I conclude that both took part in that attack, which led to Mr Thomas’ 
death.  Frankie Parker used his crowbar to hit Mr Thomas on the head.  When Mr Thomas fell to the

The only sentence that the law permits me to impose for the offence of murder is life 

Before this trial began both Frankie Parker and Gary Smith had denied that they were at the 

I have no doubt that most of the evidence they gave at this trial was a complete pack of lies, 

floor, Gary Smith kicked and stamped his head, no doubt egged on by Frankie Parker.  In my view, 
they both shared an intention to kill Mr Thomas at that point, even if it was an intention that was 
formed during the attack. 
 
4. 
Chapter House that night.  On the first day of the trial Frankie Parker for the first time filed his 
Defence Statement, in which he accepted that he had been present and indeed that he had taken 
part in a robbery.  However, he blamed Gary Smith for the murder of Mr Thomas.  This led Gary 
Smith to rethink what his defence was; he too now accepted that he had been at the scene but 
insisted that it was Frankie Parker alone who was responsible for the murder.  Throughout this trial 
they have been at pains to blame each other.  In fact they were both in it together.  
 
5. 
as each tried to save his own skin and blame the other.  However, there were moments when a 
glimmer of what really happened was revealed.  One such moment was when Gary Smith said that 
Mr Thomas had kept saying that his son would be back soon.  Mr Thomas’ son had been with him at 
the Chapter House earlier that evening and this has the ring of truth to it.  One can only imagine the 
desperation and fear that Mr Thomas must have felt in what turned out to be the last minutes of his 
life but Frankie Parker and Gary Smith showed him no mercy.  They left him unconscious lying in a 
pool of his own blood. 
 
 
 
Murder 
 
6. 
imprisonment.  In imposing a life sentence I must set the minimum term that must be served before 
a defendant can be considered for release on licence.  It is important to emphasise that this is not the 
actual term that will be served in custody.  It is the minimum term that must be served before a 
prisoner can be considered for release by the Parole Board.  The time that is actually spent in prison 
may well be longer.  The Parole Board will only direct release on licence if it is satisfied that a 
prisoner is no longer a danger to members of the public.  Even if he is released he will then remain on 
licence for the rest of his life and will be liable to recall by the Secretary of State. 
 
7. 
It is common ground before me that, as Parliament has laid down, the starting point for 
consideration in a case like this, where a murder was committed in the course or furtherance of 
robbery or burglary, is 30 years: see para. 5(2)(c) of Sch. 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  I must 
also take into account aggravating and mitigating features of the case, particularly having regard to 
the matters set out at paras. 10 and 11 of Sch. 21.   
 
8. 
I have taken carefully into consideration everything that has been said at what has been a 
lengthy sentencing hearing, for example a psychiatric report in the case of Frankie Parker, and the 
numerous previous convictions that he and Gary Smith have: they are clearly professional criminals 
and have been from an early age.  Their previous offences include not only a lot of offences of 
dishonesty but also the use of force or threatened use of force.

John Smith 
 
15. 
A written basis of plea was proffered on behalf of John Smith, which suggested that the 
reason why he provided his son Gary with a false alibi was that he feared he had committed the 
offence of burglary, not murder.  That basis was not acceptable to the Crown.  I do not regard it as 
sustainable, not least because, at the time of his two interviews by the police, John Smith was well 
aware that the offence for which Gary Smith had been arrested was murder. 
 
16. 
of offence.  Again it is accepted that these are simply examples of decisions as to the appropriate 
sentence on the facts of a particular case. 
 
17. 
The fact that John Smith pleaded guilty to this offence means that he is entitled to some 
discount, albeit a small one (of about 10%) because his plea came only after the trial was due to 
start, when he discovered that the other defendants were no longer relying on a defence of alibi.

Smith.  He is now 67 years old.  He is of poor health, suffering from angina and is the primary carer of 
his wife, for whom alternative arrangements will have to be made while he is in prison.  Although he 
has previous convictions, many of them are old and the last time he was in prison was 1988. 
 
19. 
especially as the underlying offence that had been committed by Gary Smith was murder. 
 
  
 

My attention has been drawn to a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal about this sort

NICHOLLS, WOODMANSEY, DWYER-SKEATS AND CHALK
 

 
IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINCHESTER 

 

 
26 JUNE 2013 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF THE HON MR JUSTICE WALKER 

 

 

 

 

  
The chilling facts of this case can be stated starkly. Lee Nicholls, you got to know a 
vulnerable and homeless young man, Jamie Dack. The result was that Jamie Dack 
met you, Ryan Woodmansey, along with you, Andrew Dwyer-Skeats and you, Donna 
Chalk. On 21 March you Donna Chalk lied and said he had put his hand down your 
trousers. Your own boyfriend, Andrew Dwyer-Skeats, did not believe you. 
  
But you, Lee Nicholls, did believe Donna Chalk. You are a violent man. That, along 
with a desire to see yourself as a leader and a punisher led you to take the lead in 
beating up Jamie Dack. Your punch sent him to the ground, injured his face and 
rendered him unconscious. I make no finding as to whether you Ryan Woodmansey 
or you Andrew Dwyer-Skeats were among those who attacked Jamie Dack on this 
occasion. What is important is that you knew about it and the reason for it. As to you, 
Donna Chalk, I accept that you were initially distressed by the violence that had been 
inflicted on Jamie Dack and that you attempted to assist the police in investigating its 
circumstances. I also accept that what prompted your lie was an ill-judged belief that 
this would cement your relationship with Andrew Dwyer-Skeats, and that this must 
be viewed in the light of the immature personality and vulnerability spoken of by 
Doctor Clarke. What is clear to me, however, is that on this occasion if not before, you 
 
realised the impact of sexual allegations on the behaviour of Lee Nicholls, and that 
you could use such allegations to manipulate him, inducing him to act violently. 
  
A few days later an unsuspecting Jamie Dack visited the flat at BM which had 
 
featured in the events of 21 March. A photo was taken of his injuries by you, Andrew 
Dwyer-Skeats, and sent by you to Donna Chalk. You both retained the photo on your 
phones for some time. In your case, Donna Chalk, later events demonstrate that this 
 
was the start of your taking pleasure in manipulating Lee Nicholls and bringing about 
violence in this way. 
 
For that is what happened on Thursday 5 April. You all abused the trust of Jamie 
Dack by plotting to steal and sell his laptop so that Lee Nicholls would have the 
money he needed to go with the remaining three of you to a rave the following night. 
You planned for another person to go with you. That was Amber Patterson, Lee 
Nicholls’s former girlfriend who had been duped by you Lee Nicholls into thinking 
that you had changed your ways. You Donna Chalk showed Amber Patterson the
--------
photo on your phone of what happened to Jamie Dack on 21 March and told her how 
it came about. I have no doubt that you delighted in your sense of power. Amber 
Patterson became enmeshed in your plan to demonstrate once more how Lee 
Nicholls could be manipulated to violence. 
  
 
There was a fruitless attempt to obtain Jamie Dack’s PIN by spying on him. Even if 
 
that had been successful he would have been beaten to obtain his bank card. As it was 
he was beaten relentlessly not merely for the PIN and the bank card, but also as 
punishment for his alleged conduct to Amber Patterson. A bat was used, and I am 
sure that Ryan Woodmansey was right when he said that a knife was used as well. 
Photographs were taken on Jamie Dack’s phone that day of him lying in the bedroom 
covered in blood. While this attack happened you Donna Chalk went with Amber 
 
Patterson when she made a hapless attempt to disengage by going to Asda, and you 
Andrew Dwyer-Skeats ensured she left her handbag behind so that she would return. 
On that return she found herself involved, at least by her presence, in yet more 
beating. I accept that the roles of Ryan Woodmansey and Andrew Dwyer-Skeats in 
the beating of Jamie Dack that day were intermittent, but they were significant 
nonetheless. It was said to be to the credit of at least some of you that no more 
beating occurred after Lee Nicholls left that evening. What Jamie Dack needed by this 
 
stage was hospital, not the glass of water and cigarette which it is said were given to 
 
him. Amber Patterson left and did not come back again. When she left she was 
determined to call the police. Unfortunately she was unable to put that determination 
into effect. 
 
The following morning Jamie Dack was in an appalling state. He was incapable of 
 
responding to any sort of question. At a stage when all four of you were present, I am 
sure that Ryan Woodmansey was right when he said that you, Donna Chalk, went 
through Jamie Dack’s phone and commented that he was a ”weirdo”, or something 
 
similar. You well knew the effect that this would have on Lee Nicholls. What followed 
was an orgy of violence. Two more photos were taken of Jamie Dack suffering terrible 
injuries and wounds. In one of them he was naked from the waist up, to show him 
bleeding from stabs to the arms. These photos, like those the previous day, can only 
have been taken to derive pleasure and satisfaction from his injuries. It has been 
suggested that there was an intention to kill Jamie Dack in the half hour prior to the 
fatal wounds. I proceed on that basis. During that period further horrific violence was 
 
to be inflicted, producing a chewed-up, mashed, area of the body in the region of the 
shoulder. Then the fatal wounds, four of them to the neck, were inflicted by you, Lee 
Nicholls. However each of you Ryan Woodmansey and you Andrew Dwyer-Skeats 
were part of the fatal attack and shared that intention to kill. You all knew that Jamie 
Dack could not be allowed to live. Meanwhile you, Donna Chalk, by your “weirdo” 
remark had encouraged violence realising that really serious harm might be inflicted 
with a knife, and you deliberately continued to encourage this violence by your 
presence. 
  
Jamie Dack’s physical and mental suffering must have been terrible both on 5 and 6 
April. Eventually his death gave him a release from pain. The four of you eventually 
resolved upon and put in place a shocking plan to take his body away in a wheelie bin 
and burn it. In their dignified impact statement his family have described the terrible 
anguish that this and other aspects of what you did have caused them. 
  
 
Everything that could possibly be said on behalf of each of you has been said by your 
respective counsel. I take full account of it, and I take account of the psychiatric and 
other reports that have been provided, including those attesting to work in prison.
--------
As regards all defendants there was sadistic conduct or participation in sadistic 
conduct, demonstrated in the taking of photographs whose only purpose was to gain 
pleasure derived from seeing what had happened to Jamie Dack. When I come to set 
the minimum term that will entail a 30 year starting point. Even if it were wrong to 
 
describe the conduct as sadistic, it was so close to sadism that I would have increased 
any 15 year starting point to something close to 30 years. Combined with the 
 
aggravating factors of Jamie Dack’s mental and physical suffering and the way you 
disposed of the body, before taking account of mitigating factors I reach a period in 
excess of 30 years for all of you. 
  
 
 As to premeditation, its presence is an aggravating factor and its absence is a 
 
mitigating factor. There was some premeditation on the part of the male defendants. 
I do not think it warrants an increase in the minimum term. Conversely, no credit is 
due for lack of premeditation. 
  
 
To you Lee Nicholls, You were the leader and the sentence must recognise this. I will 
 
make a modest allowance for your plea of guilty and remorse. Both came far too late 
for anything more. I do not consider that mental disability lowered your degree of 
culpability to any significant extent. 
  
To you Ryan Woodmansey, I will make some allowance for the substantial extent to 
which you gave a true account to the police, and for the fact that you were not a 
leader but a follower. 
  
 
To you Andrew Dwyer-Skeats, there is little that I can give by way of mitigation other 
than to recognise that you, too, were not a leader but a follower. 
 
 
To you, Donna Chalk, I give a substantial allowance for the fact that you envisaged no 
more than grievous bodily harm, for your lack of premeditation, for your age and for 
 
the matters described in the report of Dr Clarke, along with the fact that you inflicted 
no of physical injury yourself. 
 
In the case of all there will be a concurrent term of 4 years imprisonment on count 2. 
(perverting the course of justice) 
  
You are entitled to credit for the days you have already spent on remand in custody: 
the formal order of the court will take account of this. The concurrent term will not 
affect the length of time you will spend in custody. The statutory victim surcharge 
provisions apply. 
  
When I come to the minimum that you will serve I make it plain that I am not 
 
ordering that you are to be released at the end of it. That will be a matter for the 
 
Parole Board. Only when it has, will the Board be entitled for the first time to decide 
whether it is safe to release you. If the board does release you will remain on licence 
and liable to recall for the rest of your life. 
  
Before I turn to the minimum term, some words of praise. 
 
I praise those working at and resident in Patrick House Hostel who raised matters 
with the police as soon as they were aware of cause for concern. 
  
I praise Amber Patterson for her determination to go to the police. It is apparent to 
me that what happened on 5 April put her in a position where she did not have the 
willpower necessary to overcome obstacles to the fulfilment of that determination. I 
praise her for finding the courage to go to the police on the evening of 9 April, and to
--------
give evidence at the trial last year. Amber Paterson has been vilified by those who 
have not understood the chilling characteristics of what happened in the flat at Bevois 
Mews that evening, how she had been drawn into the plans of those present, the 
impact of events that evening upon her, and the extent to which her mental state 
 
deprived her of real ability to do anything about what had happened. 
  
The sentence for murder is, as it must be, imprisonment for life. 
  
Lee Nicholls, for the reasons I have given the minimum term in your case will be 34 
years. 
 
Ryan Woodmansey, for the reasons I have given the minimum term in your case will 
be 30 years. 
 
 
Andrew Dwyer-Skeats, for the reasons I have given the minimum term in your case 
will be 32 years. 
  
 
Donna Chalk, for the reasons I have given the minimum term in your case will be 25 
years.",2013-06-26 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

R ‐v‐ Benjamin Curtis 

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Nicol 

17th June 2013  

You may stay seated for the time being. 
 
Benjamin Curtis you have pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Ocean Elliott. 
 
Ocean was 3 ½ months old in April 2007. She was your child and in your sole care. Like most babies, 
she cried. You picked her up and shook her 4 or 5 times. You may have been tired. You may have 
been uncertain as to how to placate Ocean. You may have been cross with your partner. But none of 
that is any excuse whatsoever for your loss of temper and mistreatment of that baby. 
 
The results were catastrophic.  A baby that young has undeveloped neck muscles. If  shaken violently, 
her head will have swung back and forth and her brain will have knocked against the inside of her 
skull. The brain injury which resulted had devastating effects. She was severely disabled. She could 
not sit on her own, let alone walk. She was functionally blind. She could not clear her lungs properly 
in the way that everybody else takes for granted. She had to be fed through a tube inserted into her 
body. In the course of 2009 she contracted pneumonia and then later swine flu. She suffered from 
seizures.  As time progressed these occurred every day and were difficult for even doctors to control. 
Her distress was clear to those who were caring for her. 
 
You have already been prosecuted once for inflicting really serious harm on Ocean. You were 
acquitted of intentionally causing her really serious harm. I acknowledge that what you did not with 
intentional malice to that baby. The conviction for assault  was in February 2008. But at that time, 
Ocean was still alive. The present case started after her death. Consequences matter and when the 
consequences become the more serious, they can lead, as in your case, to more serious charges. 
 
You are now 30 years old. I have seen and taken into account the pre‐sentence report which was 
prepared for the previous case. That notes you have a learning disability and a limited ability to 
understand verbal information. Your previous convictions and police record are not material to the 
task I have to perform with two qualifications. One is the assault on Ocean which I have already 
mentioned and to which I will return. The other is that you were cautioned in 2006 for hitting 
Ocean’s step‐brother on  his bare bottom. That, too, was, it seems, in a fit of temper. 
 
The pre‐sentence report also recognised that you had taken full responsibility for your actions. You 
pleaded guilty to the assault on Ocean, although only on the day of your previous trial.
--------
In these proceedings you have not resiled from your admission of responsibility for shaking Ocean. 
You did originally plead not guilty to the present charge, but, I accept that this was because of two 
matters which turned on expert evidence: whether your conduct was a significant contributory cause 
to Ocean’s death 2 ½ years later; and whether Ocean’s brain injury could possibly have been due to 
some other non‐accidental injury. These were not matters within your own knowledge. It was only 
last week that your legal team obtained clear evidence from the experts they had commissioned to 
say that it was plain your shaking had been a contributory cause of death and it was not possible that 
the injury to Ocean’s brain could have been the result of any earlier incident. This is therefore an 
unusual case where the lateness of  your plea of guilty should not be held against you. I will give you 
full credit for it. 
 
I also recognise that you have been previously prosecuted for the same wrongful act. I will, of course, 
make a reduction for the sentence which was then imposed. But over and above that, I should mark 
that this is the second time you have been through criminal proceedings and, as your counsel 
submitted, you did have to wait over 3 years after Ocean’s death before you were charged with 
manslaughter and learned that you were indeed to face a second prosecution. In that interval, you 
were convicted of another offence, but it was of a quite different kind and the magistrates thought it 
could be dealt with adequately by a conditional discharge and a restraining order. It is therefore of 
little importance in my decision in the present matter. 
 
Your counsel recognises that this offence is so serious that only a sentence of immediate 
imprisonment will be sufficient.  
 
Taking all of this into account (including the sentence which was passed on you for the assault on 
Ocean) but assuming you had contested the present charge, my sentence would have been 3 years 
imprisonment. Because of your plea of guilty, the sentence will be one of 2 years imprisonment.  
 
Stand up. 
 
Benjamin Curtis for the manslaughter of Ocean Elliott you are sentenced to 2 years imprisonment.

THE QUEEN

GORMAN
WILKINSON
WARD
8:
ALI
SENTENCING REMARKS OF THE HON MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE
13 JUNE 2013
Over a period of many weeks, the court has heard evidence of extremely grave offences.
On the 25th May 2012 you, Cregan, went into the Cotton Tree public house in Droylsden,
Manchester, and opened fire with a self-loading pistol. You killed one man, wounded three
others, and narrowly missed wounding a fourth. At a very late stage of this long trial you
pleaded guilty to murder and three offences of attempted murder, and the jury duly
returned guilty verdicts upon you. You, Livesey and German, were also willingly and
knowingly involved in that murderous attack. You denied your guilt but have been convicted
by the jury.
The shootings at the Cotton Tree involved the use of a firearm in a public place. I have no
doubt, and it is an aggravating feature, that they were premeditated. You Cregan must have
had a plan, at least in general terms, and you were just waiting for a suitable opportunity.
You had taken steps to ensure that you could move into action as soon as it was clear that
your intended victims, the members of the Short family and their associates, had gathered at
the Cotton Tree and could be expected to remain there at least until midnight. A gun and
ammunition, a balaclava, a stolen car and two others willing to play their parts in the
planned attack were all available as soon as required. I have no doubt, Cregan, that when
you shot Mark Short you intended to kill him, not merely to cause him serious injury. Each
offence of attempted murder involved a determined effort to take another life: you were
trying to kill as many persons as you could. In your cases, Livesey and Gorman, I have no
doubt that you knew Cregan's intentions, and you were nonetheless willing to play your
necessary parts.
--------
Further grave offences were then committed on 10th August 2012. You Cregan, Wilkinson
and Ward played your parts in the murder of David Short. David Short was shot repeatedly,
and a hand grenade was then exploded against his body. Minutes later, and clearly as part
of a single plan to carry out attacks at two different places, you Cregan attacked the home of
Sharon Hark. No one was killed or injured, but you carried and used a pistol, and exploded a
hand grenade. A third grenade was then exploded in an attempt to destroy evidence. The
three defendants then left the scene with the willing assistance of you, Ali: you provided
transport and secured accommodation, and I have no doubt that you also visited the other
three on later occasions and continued to assist them. A later search of Wilkinson's home
revealed another self-loading pistol. You Wilkinson pleaded guilty to the murder of David
Short at a late stage of this trial; you Cregan pleaded guilty to your two crimes at an even
later stage; you Ward and Ali denied your guilt but have been convicted by thejury.

It is entirely clear, and it is a serious aggravating feature, that a great deal of planning went
into the crimes committed that day. You Cregan learned that some of those accused of the
Cotton Tree shootings had been re-arrested. You must have expected that you too would
soon be arrested and kept in custody. I have no doubt that you had been planning to kill
David Short ever since he had escaped death at the Cotton Tree. I have no doubt that you
were determined to carry out that plan and murder the man you hated whilst you were still
able to do so. You were on police bail at the time, another aggravating feature. The specific
arrangements were then made over a period of about two days, with you Wilkinson making
enquiries about the times at which David Short could be expected to visit his son’s grave,
and then bidding farewell to your children. I have no doubt, Ward, that you knew on the 9th
August what was planned for the next day. The crimes committed on 10th August involved
not only the firing of many shots from two self-loading pistols but also the exploding of hand
grenades. You Wilkinson also had another pistol, loaded and with spare ammunition, which
was later found by the police at your flat: it was not one of the weapons which were carried
and used on 10th August, and it shows plainly that you had ready access to deadly weapons.
You admit that you had it in your possession with intent to endanger life. The murder of
David Short was further aggravated by the ruthlessness with which he was pursued through
his home, with shots being fired at him, and was then shot at close range by each of you,
Cregan and Wilkinson. It was an exceptional aggravating feature that you then exploded a
hand grenade against his dying body, causing dreadful injuries. I accept the submission that
the circumstances do not involve suffering before death, or destruction of the body, of
precisely the form contemplated in the relevant statutory provisions; but the court is
nonetheless entitled to have regard to those circumstances in concluding that this is a very
serious case of murder.

You, Cregan, managed to avoid arrest and remained at large until 18th September 2012,
when you committed two quite appalling crimes of murder. Again, there was substantial
premeditation and planning, even though it may have been of comparatively short duration.
You lured two female officers to their deaths by making a false report that you had been the
victim of a crime. I have no doubt that you were expecting one or more unarmed officers to
attend, and that is what happened. You had armed yourself with at least one grenade, and
with a self-loading pistol to which you had fitted an extended magazine containing 32 rounds.
PC Fiona Bone and PC Nicola Hughes were sent in response to your call for help, performing
their public duty for the public good. From your position within the house I have no doubt

Page 2 of6
--------
you were able to see them coming, and you must have seen that they were unarmed female
officers. You opened the front door and, with the advantage of surprise, you opened fire
before your victims had any chance to do anything to protect themselves. The analysis
made by an expert witness who attended the scene was chilling evidence. Although the
officers survived the first shots which hit them, you pursued them with a cold-blooded and
ruthless determination to end their lives. One of your shots struck PC Hughes in the back,
with the result that she lay on the ground paralyzed. You left her there and pursued PC
Bone, firing some 20 shots at her. You then returned to PC Hughes and made sure you killed
her by shooting her in the head. Finally, not content with what you had already done, you
exploded another hand grenade near the body of PC Hughes, inflicting yet further injuries.
You acted with premeditated savagery.
In an eloquent statement to the court, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester has rightly
noted that police officers daily accept risks to their own lives as they protect and serve the
public. They are able to make some assessment of those risks on the basis of their
experience and training. But you, Cregan, drew those two officers into a calculated trap for
the sole purpose of murdering them in cold blood.
Those bare facts, briefly stated, suffice to show the gravity of each of these crimes of murder
and attempted murder. The murderous use of a gun must always be viewed by the court as
a very serious offence, and the use of firearms in these crimes would in itself make it
necessary for the court to impose heavy sentences. But the crimes committed on 10th
August and 18th September 2012 were made even more serious by the use of hand grenades.
I bear in mind that in the relevant statutory provisions, murder involving the use of an
explosive attracts the same starting point for sentence as does murder involving the use of a
firearm. However, the nature and extent of the injury and mutilation likely to be caused by
the use of a hand grenade goes beyond that which can be expected from the use of a gun.
The court heard expert evidence that hand grenades are capable of causing fatalities at a
range of up to 12 or 15 metres, and casualties at a range of up to 50 metres. Moreover, the
court has been told that the use of hand grenades in circumstances such as these is not
something which the criminal courts in this country have encountered before. By 5142 of
the Criminal Justice Act 2003, any court dealing with an offender must have regard to
principles of sentencing which include the punishment of offenders and the reduction of
crime, including its reduction by deterrence. | make it plain that in my judgment the
murderous use of hand grenades is a crime which must be met with very severe punishment,
and the court must do what it properly can to deter any criminal contemplating a similar
offence.
The crime of murder ends one life but ruins many more. The harm you have caused, and the
pain, anguish and misery you have inflicted, extend far beyond those who were killed or
injured by your individual and collective acts. The court has been provided with statements
from many victims, which indicate in clear terms what they have suffered and will continue
to suffer, in many cases for the rest of their lives. By their nature, such statements contain
many highly personal matters, and it is not appropriate for them to be read aloud in a public
court. The authors ofthose statements can however rest assured that I have read and taken
account of them all. It is right that I mention some features of them, so that no one can be
left in any doubt about the true impact of crimes such as those which you have committed.
Page 3 of6
--------
The statements spell out the reality of witnessing the murder of a child or loved one; the
reality of the grim duty of identifying the body of a child or loved one, in two of these cases
in the knowledge that the body of the deceased has been disfigured by the explosion of a
grenade; the reality of living as a parent bereaved of a child, noting as the years go by each
anniversary or event which the deceased child has not lived to enjoy; the reality of living as
the parent of a bewildered young child, trying to explain why the deceased will not come
home and will not answer a phone call. Some of your victims have had to cope not only with
the murder of a loved one but at the same time with an urgent need to vacate their own
homes, and to remain apart from other close members of their families, because of a serious
risk to their own safety. The families of the murdered police officers, though of course
grateful for the overwhelming display of public support, have had to grieve for their losses in
the public eye and at the centre of media reporting. These impact statements make clear
that the anguish of your victims has been increased by the callous brutality with which death
was caused. Those who survived the shootings at the Cotton Tree, but were wounded, have
to live with the continuing physical and emotional injuries which they have suffered. Having
regard to the issues in this trial, it has neither been necessary nor appropriate to dwell on
those injuries, and so little evidence has been heard about them; but they are not to be
overlooked or their seriousness understated.
The court has also been provided with a statement from a senior police officer which makes
plain that the murder of two police officers, and the use of hand grenades, not only horrified
but also frightened many members of the public in the area in which those crimes were
committed.
In the course of this long trial, I have had ample opportunity to observe you all in the dock
and to note your reaction to the evidence which the jury have heard. I have seen no hint of
any real remorse or of any compassion for your victims. None of you has shown any sign
that you care at all for the death and injury you have caused to your immediate victims or
for the immense harm you have done to many others. Self-interest has been the motivating
force for each of you.
Before I come to the sentences of individual defendants, I need to say a word about the
court’s powers and duties when sentencing for offences of this kind. The sentence for
murder is fixed by law. Anyone convicted of murder must be sentenced to life imprisonment.
In an exceptionally serious case, the court may have to direct that the offender should never
be released. That is an order which is made in very few cases, and only when it is
inescapably necessary in the interests ofjustice. As the Lord ChiefJustice has recently said, a
whole life order is the order of last resort, and ”is reserved for the few exceptionally serious
offences in which, after reflecting on all the relevant features of aggravation and mitigation,
the judge is satisfied that the element of just punishment and retribution requires the
imposition of a whole life order"". In all other cases the court must make an order as to the
minimum term to be served before the offender can be considered for release on licence. In
deciding what minimum term is appropriate the court must take into account the overall
gravity of the offending. Time spent in custody as an unconvicted prisoner will count
towards that minimum term.

Page 4 of6
--------
It is important that you the defendants, and the general public, should understand what that
means in practice. If the court specifies a minimum term, you cannot be released until that
minimum term has expired. But even then you will not automatically be released. You will
not be released unless and until the Parole Board are satisfied that it is safe to release you
into the community. That time may never come. Even if you are released on licence, that is
not the end of your sentence. You will remain subject to the conditions of your licence for
the rest of your life. If you reoffend, the Secretary of State has the power to order that you
be returned to prison to continue to serve your life sentence until it is thought safe to
release you again.
For offences other than murder, the court must decide what sentence is appropriate having
regard to the seriousness of your offending and applying the relevant guidelines. In most of
your cases, I can properly deal with the offences other than murder by the imposition of a
long term of imprisonment. In your case, Cregan, I am satisfied not only that you have
committed very serious offences but also that you are a dangerous offender as defined by
the relevant Act of Parliament. For you, the appropriate sentence is one of life
imprisonment.
| now deal with you individually.
In your case, Cregan, I have to consider whether the seriousness of your crimes is
exceptionally high. Parliament has provided a non-exhaustive list of categories of murder
which will normally be regarded as being exceptionally serious. One of those categories
includes the murder of two or more persons where each murder involves a substantial
degree of premeditation or planning. There can be no doubt that at least three of your
crimes come within that category, but the full enormity of your offending extends even
further. The fact that you eventually pleaded guilty is a factor in your favour, and I take
those guilty pleas into account so far as I can do so, but the extent to which they can assist
you is minimal, for two reasons. First, because I have no doubt that your guilty pleas were
cynically timed to suit your own purposes, and did not reflect any regret for what you had
done. Secondly, because in your case the overall sentence which must be imposed is
dictated by the exceptional seriousness of your crimes. The aggravating features which I
have mentioned lead inescapably to the clear conclusion that your offending is so
exceptionally serious that the court must order that the early release provisions shall not
apply to you.
On each of counts 2, 3, 4 — the offences of attempted murder the sentence is one of life
imprisonment with a minimum term of 11 years. On count 8 — causing an explosion - the
sentence is one of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 6 years On each of counts 1, 6,
10 and 11 - the four offences of murder — the sentence is one of life imprisonment and in
each case the court is driven to the conclusion that there must be a whole life order. That
means, in plain terms, that you will never be released from prison.
In your case, Wilkinson, I accept the submission that the appropriate starting point is one of
30 years. However, your crimes are aggravated by your previous convictions, which include
a serious offence of armed robbery. The overall gravity of your offending against the
background of your previous convictions, and the use of a hand grenade as well as a firearm,
make it necessary for you to remain in prison for very many years before there can be any
Page 5 of6
--------
thought of releasing you. I can make a small allowance for your very late guilty pleas, and
for your limited personal mitigation. For the reasons which I have indicated in the course of
argument, I cannot give much weight to the submission that I should further reduce the
sentence because you acted out of fear of the harm which David Short had threatened to
cause to you and your family. On count 5, possession of a firearm with intent, the sentence
is 6 years’ imprisonment. On count 6, the murder of David Short, the sentence is life
imprisonment, with a minimum term of 35 years.
You Livesey and you Gorman have less serious criminal records than Wilkinson. So far as
these offences are concerned, however, you each played a willing and important part in the
commission of one murder by shooting and three attempted murders. You do not have the
benefit of any guilty plea. | see no reason to distinguish between you. On each of counts 2,
3 and 4, the sentence for each of you is one of 24 years’ imprisonment. On count 1, murder,
the sentence on each of you is one of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 33 years.
You Ward are somewhat younger than your co-accused, but I do not think that is a point to
which I can attach much weight. You played your willing role in a dreadful murder which
involved both firearms and a hand grenade. Having listened to weeks of evidence, I am sure
that you knew what was planned, and I am sure that you were not acting under duress. The
best that can be said on your behalf is that compared to your co-accused you were not the
dominant figure. You have previous convictions, and it is an aggravating feature that you
took part in the murder of David Short at the very time when you were due to answer to
your bail before the Crown Court in Bolton. In your case, the sentence for murder on count
6 is one of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 33 years.
You Ali have been convicted of a serious example of the offence of assisting an offender. It
may be right that you became involved at short notice, but it is clear that you played a
willing and important role. This was not a single, brief act of assistance: it was a course of
conduct which was intended to provide, and did provide, valuable assistance to men who
had committed murder. You must have known what they had done. You have a bad record
for drugs offences, and your own evidence was that you have more generally lived a life of
crime for many years. That is an aggravating feature. For those reasons, a sentence well
towards the maximum for this type of offence is appropriate. I am however able in your
case to take into account some personal mitigation, which does enable me to reduce your
sentence below the level which would otherwise be appropriate. In your case, on count 9,
the sentence is one of 7 years’ imprisonment.

It is not necessary for the Defendant to stand while sentence is pronounced. 
 
 
Stuart Hall – you fall to be sentenced by this court for 14 counts of indecent assault 
 
to which you pleaded guilty at a hearing in April. The offences were committed over 
 
a period of nearly 20 years, the first being in 1967, the last in 1985 or 1986. 
 
 
 
Facts 
 
 
The facts of this case have been opened in considerable detail by the prosecution 
 
and I do not propose to repeat all of those details now or to refer in these remarks to 
 
any of your victims by name in order to preserve their anonymity, because these 
 
 
remarks will be made available for the media and the public immediately after I have 
 
   
 
pronounced sentence. 
 
 
However the offences range in seriousness and it is appropriate for me to place 
 
them into their proper perspective, particularly in view of some of the reporting of 
 
 
this case and comments on it. You have pleaded guilty to 14 counts of indecent 
 
assaults each of which refers to one specific incident only. There are 13 victims 
 
whose ages at the time of the offences range from 9 to 17. One victim who was aged 
 
 
15 is the subject of two charges (Counts 10 and 11). Three of the charges, Counts 12, 
 
13 and 14 relate to one incident which took place in your home and involved 
 
 
children who were aged 11, 13 and 14. 
 
 
The least serious offences are those reflected in Counts 2 to 4 of the indictment. In 
 
each case the girl concerned was 16 or 17 at the time. Each involved touching over 
 
clothing, in the case of Count 2 grabbing and fondling over clothing and delivering an 
 
 
unwanted kiss, and Counts 3 and 4 touching breasts over clothing. Count 1 was more 
 
 
serious and involved touching the vagina of a 16 year old girl over her underclothing, 
 
 
with a degree of planning and you plied her with alcohol. 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
Count 6 was significantly more serious. It involved a 13 year old girl who was 
 
subjected to a series of sexual indignities at your hands at her home on Boxing Day 
 
 
1976. The victim had been drinking and was sick and you took advantage of the 
 
situation when she was in the bathroom and bathing to touch her naked breasts, 
 
inserted a finger in her vagina and kissed her upper body and touched her all over. 
 
 
Counts 10 and 11 involved a girl who was 15 who you met in your role as a television 
 
presenter. She was indecently assaulted by your sexually kissing her in her home on 
 
 
one occasion and on another occasion at the BBC studio when she was in her bra 
 
 
and knickers you took her to a settee, lay next to her and asked to use an object to 
 
 
 
massage her vagina. There is an abuse of trust element in these offences. 
 
 
Counts 12, 13 and 14 are serious because they involved 3 children at your home on 
 
the same occasion, ostensibly attending for elocution lessons. No doubt the parents 
 
of these children were pleased that such a person as yourself was offering elocution 
 
lessons to them, and you breached the trust they placed in you by assaulting their 
 
children for your own gratification. You persuaded the children to use the bathroom 
 
together and then they came to the lounge where you were dressed only in 
 
underpants. The assaults themselves were not of the most grave kind but the abuse 
 
of trust is serious and it appears that you set up the circumstances to enable these 
 
 
offences to take place. 
 
 
Count 15 involved a 10 year old child who was at your home. The assault was minor, 
 
amounting to no more than mild touching, in circumstances of indecency, but the 
 
serious aspect is that the child was so young. Furthermore this was an incident which 
 
undoubtedly caused the victim real distress and lasting emotional problems. 
 
 
Count 16 involved the youngest child, aged 9. You were a dinner guest at her 
 
parents’ home and whilst reading her a bedtime story you took the opportunity to 
 
put your hand under her bedclothes and onto her leg moving it towards her vagina. 
 
Again, although the incident itself is of minor indecency, the age of the child and the 
 
 
abuse of trust render this more serious. 
 
 
Count 17 involved a 13 year old girl who was a passenger in your car and whom you 
 
forcibly kissed putting your tongue in her mouth. 
 
 
Finally Count 18 involved a little girl aged 10 or 11 to whom you were supposedly to 
 
give an elocution lesson – this elocution lesson involved, somewhat unusually people 
 
may think, the child being taken into a bathroom and being dressed in her vest and 
 
knickers which she refused to take them off for you, and you measured her chest 
 
over her clothing with a tape measure. 
 
 
Although I agree with the submission made by your counsel that some of these 
 
incidents taken alone do not cross the custody threshold, some of them do ‐ either 
 
because of the age of the child concerned, or the nature of the indecent act and in 
 
the case of Counts 12, 13 and 14 because 3 children were involved.

--------
Further although individually a charge may not call for a custodial sentence the 
 
cumulative effect of your offending must be taken into account in determining 
 
 
whether a custodial sentence is called for. 
  
 
The court has been provided with statements from some of victims, which indicate 
 
in clear terms what they have suffered as a result of your offending. It is not 
 
appropriate for them to be read aloud in a public court. The authors of those 
 
statements can however rest assured that I have read and taken account of them all. 
 
Some of them make the point that these were not opportunistic offences and I agree 
   
 
– there was a degree of planning and premeditation in respect of some of the 
 
 
offences. 
 
 
There are no Guidelines specifically applicable to these particular offences. The 
 
Sexual Offences Guidelines only apply to offences charged under the Sexual Offences 
 
Act 2003, but there is assistance to be derived from the principles set out in those 
 
Guidelines. Further it is important to note the maximum sentence available when 
 
these offences were committed by you. I have considered with care the judgment of 
 
 
the Court of Appeal Criminal Division on the correct approach to sentencing for 
 
historic cases in the case of R v H and others [2011] EWCA Crim 2753. 
  
 
For most of these offences the maximum sentence at the time and which the court 
 
must have regard to was 2 years imprisonment, and for the remainder it was 5 years. 
 
The maximum sentence for this type of offence has been significantly increased, 
 
since these offences were committed, to 10 years. 
 
 
Considering the current Sentencing Council Guidelines for sexual offences, and the 
 
 
reported cases to which I have been referred, I have come to the following 
 
conclusions: 
 
 

 
   

   
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.	  Taken individually some of the offences do not cross the custody threshold 
 
2.	  However several of the offences, in my judgement more than your counsel 
 
 

has submitted, do cross the custody threshold, and those in each of Counts 6, 
 
15 and 16 do so significantly because of their facts and the ages of the 
 
children involved. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.	  Taken together the cumulative result of your offending is such that a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

custodial sentence is appropriate as the starting point for all of the offences. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
Having come to the conclusion that the offending taken as a whole crosses the 
 
custody threshold, as I have, I then have to determine whether the mitigation in your 
 
 
case is sufficient to justify retreating back over the custody threshold and to decide 
 
what the appropriate penalty should be. 
 
 
Plea of Guilty 
 
 
I now turn to the mitigation. 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
As in most cases the fact that you have pleaded guilty is an important piece of 
 
mitigation. In cases of sexual offending a plea of guilty avoids the necessity for the 
 
 
victim of the offence to undergo the ordeal of giving evidence which can at the very 
 
least be embarrassing and is often distressing and sometimes seriously damaging for 
 
the person involved. 
  
 
You pleaded guilty at the Plea and Case Management Hearing. That was not the 
 
earliest opportunity available to you to do so, because there was a Preliminary 
 
Hearing, and this Court has a widely publicised Early Guilty Plea Scheme which had 
 
 
you taken advantage of it would have enabled you to enter pleas of guilty at an 
 
earlier stage and gain full credit. I was made aware, at a hearing in chambers, at the 
 
 
Preliminary Hearing, that your lawyers were discussing a resolution of the case with 
 
the prosecution and accept that in the sensitive circumstances of a case of this kind 
 
those discussions needed to be conducted with a degree of delicacy. 
 
 
Instead of maintaining a dignified silence or stating that you would make no 
 
comment, you chose to make a public statement to the effect that the allegations 
 
were false, describing them as “spurious and pernicious” as was widely reported. 
 
Although your guilty pleas have meant that your victims have not had to give 
 
evidence and relive their experiences in a court hearing, and they now know this, 
 
 
your earlier observations about their complaints which you now accept were neither 
 
 
spurious nor pernicious will have distressed them all, and it is clear from the victim 
 
statements that I have seen that your brazen attitude when first charged and the 
 
public protests of your innocence have added to the distress of some if not all of 
 
your victims. 
  
 
I have come to the conclusion that it is not appropriate to give you full credit for a 
 
 
 
guilty plea entered at the first opportunity, but that I should give slightly reduced 
 
credit to reflect the fact that your observations will have meant that the victims will 
 
have thought that they would be required to give evidence and be cross‐examined. I 
   
have noted what has been said on your behalf about the advice you were given and 
 
 
agree with the observation that your remarks on the steps of the court were ill‐
advised but it is clear from some of the victims’ statements that this conduct added 
 
to their distress, and the fact is that you have always known that you were guilty of 
 
these offences. 
 
 
Other Mitigation 
 
 
I now turn to other mitigation. 
 
 
 
You are 83 years old with no previous convictions. Your age is an appropriate factor 
 
to take into account because for a man of your age a custodial sentence would be 
 
particularly difficult for you. It is also appropriate to note that your last offence on 
 
this indictment was over 25 years ago. When you entered your pleas of guilty your 
 
 
counsel, Mr Aylett QC, indicated that you were sorry and apologised for your 
 
offending to your victims and I accept that you have somewhat late in the day 
 
 
expressed your remorse.

--------
It has been submitted on your behalf that I should make a reduction in any sentence 
 
of one third to take account of your age. That submission is based upon the decision 
 
of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Heron [2009] EWCA Crim 
 
94. I do not read that case as setting a general principle that the court should reduce 
 
sentences by a specific amount but it is appropriate to note that you are elderly and 
 
in some respects your health is not robust and I shall do so and take those factors 
 
into account and reduce the overall sentence accordingly. 
 
 
As to your health I have read a report from your general medical practitioner and 
 
also a report about your wife’s health. You suffer from a number of complaints 
 
associated with old age, an irregular heart beat, an enlarged prostate and sinusitis. 
 
Your wife has restricted movement as a consequence of her health. However none 
 
of these matters is so serious as to warrant taking an exceptional course as a result, 
 
but they must be put into the overall balance. 
 
 
I have considered the contents of the pre‐sentence report with care. To the 
 
 
Probation officer you indicated that in 1986 you took the decision to stop your 
 
criminal behaviour towards others and stopped drinking spirits and chose to be 
 
celibate. There is no evidence before the Court of any offending since 1986 and I 
   
sentence you on that basis. This counters some of the adverse assessments in the 
 
pre‐sentence report. I consider that some of the negative attitudes referred to in the 
 
 
report are more an indication that having taken the decision to change your ways 
 
you thought and hoped that you had put it all behind you and have found the fact 
 
that these matters have come to light difficult to come to terms with. 
 
 
Character references, some from people well‐known to the court, have been 
 
submitted, referring to the positively good aspects of your character. I have read all 
 
 
those references with care and it is very sad to see someone who is so well‐regarded 
 
in the dock of this courtroom. 
 
 
You have done an enormous amount of charitable work over the years and shown 
 
much kindness to others.  In the course of your long career you have given pleasure 
 
to millions of people as a local television presenter in the North West, nationally in 
 
the “It’s a Knockout” series, and as a highly regarded sports commentator. You were 
 
known for the genial personality, charm, bonhomie and wit which you displayed in 
 
these various roles. 
 
 
However those who have admired you for these qualities and the general public now 
 
know that there is a darker side to you, one hidden from public view until now, and a 
 
 
side which you were able to conceal taking advantage of your status as a well‐liked 
 
celebrity. Several of these cases reveal an abuse of the trust placed in you by the 
 
parents of these children but all of them reveal an abuse of power by you because 
 
 
your status gave you an influence and standing which you abused.

--------
committed because nearly every victim was a child at the time, and unwanted sexual 
 
advances, even for an adult, are distressing for the victim, but when they are 
 
directed towards a child who is unable to repel the attentions of an adult, an 
 
 
important barrier is crossed. 
 
 
As is clear from the victim personal statements which I have read with care, many of 
 
your victims have lived with the shame and embarrassment resulting from your 
 
 
assaults, not sure how to cope with the effects of what were for these girls 
 
extremely unpleasant and distressing events, suffering what amounts in some cases 
 
 
to significant psychological trauma. I pay tribute to the victims who have come 
 
forward – it is by no means an easy thing to do. 
 
 
This is by no means the worst example of sexual abuse of children to come before 
 
the Court, but notwithstanding the mitigation I have come to the conclusion that 
 
taken together these offences do call for a sentence of imprisonment which must be 
 
 
served immediately. The repeated sexual abuse of young children, too young to 
 
consent and in no position to resist your advances, even if the individual acts are 
 
relatively mild, is a serious crime and it must be made clear to anyone tempted to 
 
take advantage of young children and other vulnerable victims that they face 
 
condemnation and punishment. 
  
 
I have considered whether consecutive sentences should be imposed. Undoubtedly 
 
 
applying general sentencing principles consecutive sentences could properly be 
 
imposed, but balanced against that is the need for the court to consider the principle 
 
of totality. I have come to the conclusion that in the circumstances of this case it is 
 
most appropriate to decide a sentence which reflects the totality of your offending 
 
and pass concurrent sentences for all matters distinguishing between the offences 
 
within the total sentence to reflect their relative seriousness. This also enables me to 
 
 
pass appropriate sentences for the more serious offences rather than to pass shorter 
 
sentences for each offence which would not reflect their individual seriousness if 
 
there were consecutive sentences, taking into account totality. 
 
 
The mitigation has been taken into account by me in determining the appropriate 
 
starting point for sentence after a trial and I have reduced that starting point 
 
significantly, but the least sentence overall that is in my view appropriate after a trial 
 
taking all those factors into account would be a sentence of 20 months 
 
imprisonment. I shall reduce that to 15 months in all to give the credit for the plea of 
 
 
guilty in accordance with the Guidelines for pleas of guilty and the time the pleas 
 
were entered for the reasons I have indicated earlier. I have, accordingly reduced 
 
each sentence by 25% to give that degree of credit for your pleas of guilty. 
 
 
The Sentence 
 
 
The sentence of the Court is as follows: 
 
 
For Count 1 
 
 
For Counts 2‐4 
 
  

6 months imprisonment

I have considered whether I should make compensation orders in this case to 
 
 
compensate your victims for any personal injury or damage they have suffered. 
 
Although it seems clear that some if not all of your victims may have suffered 
 
psychological damage I do not consider that I have sufficient information to make a 
 
 
finding and certainly not enough information to quantify any compensation. 
 
Accordingly any of your victims who wish to claim compensation should do so 
 
 
through the civil courts or statutory schemes if applicable. 
 
 
You are a wealthy man. You will pay £11,522 towards the costs of the prosecution. 
 
 
You will be subject to the notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 
 
for a period of 10 years from the date of your conviction and will be served with a 
 
notice setting out your obligations. Breach of the requirements would amount to a 
 
 
criminal offence punishable with imprisonment. 
 
 
Having regard to the fact that your last offence was over 25 years ago I do not 
 
 
consider it is necessary to make a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for the 
 
protection of the public who will as a consequence of this case be well aware of your 
 
 
criminal activities. 
 
 
I am required to inform you that by reason of your conviction your name will be 
 
 
included in the list of barred persons in relation to children compiled by the 
 
Disclosure and Barring Service pursuant to the provisions of the Safeguarding 
 
Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 
 
 
Finally I direct that the letter from your GP Dr HE Thompson should accompany you 
 
to prison.

PETER HEALY
 
 
 

AND
 
 
  
 

TARA SWIFT
 
 

10 JUNE 2013 
 

 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE FLAUX
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.	  Peter Healy, you have been found guilty by the jury of the murder of Kevin 
 
Kennedy.  Only  you  and  Tara  Swift  know  exactly  what  happened  at  63 
 
Rossington Road on the evening of 17 July 2012, but what is clear is that Mr 
 
Kennedy died as a result of a horrific and violent attack by you upon him. By 
 
its verdict the jury has rejected any suggestion that you acted in self‐defence. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
2.	  You went round to Tara Swift’s house that afternoon and for some hours the 
 
three  of  you  were  drinking  together.  Then,  at  about  9.30  that  evening, 
 
something  happened  which  was  the  spark  for  an  outburst  of  frenzied 
 
violence, in which all the evident dislike you had of him and jealousy of his 
 
relationship with Tara came welling to the surface. The spark may have been 
 
no  more  than  Tara  saying  she  wanted  him  to  leave  and  him  showing  a 
 
reluctance  to  do  so,  but  whatever  it  was,  it  triggered  you  picking  up  the 
 
heavy wooden chair in the downstairs sitting room and hitting Kevin Kennedy 
 
repeatedly over the head with it whilst he was sitting in the leatherette chair 
 
in that room, hitting him with sufficient force that the chair broke. You then 
 
set about hitting him again with bits of the chair which had broken off. As you 
 
were  hitting  him  you  were  saying  things  like:  “you  sold  me  out,  you’re 
 
shagging my missus, you’re dead, you’re dead, you’s done with my missus.” 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

3.	  At some point it appears he went upstairs to the back bedroom, possibly in 
 
an effort to escape you, but the attack upon him continued upstairs, where 
 
you hit him with another chair, again with sufficient force that it also broke. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
Although in your evidence you sought to implicate Tara Swift in the attack on 
 
Kevin Kennedy, by its verdict acquitting her of murder the jury has rejected 
 
your story that she hit him over the head with the crocodile ashtray and has 
 
rejected  any  suggestion  that  she  encouraged  you:  it  is  clear  that  the  only 
 
violence against him was perpetrated by you alone and that you needed no 
 
encouragement  to  perpetrate  that  violence.  When  you  and  Tara  left  the 
 
house, whilst Kevin Kennedy may still have been alive, he was in a sufficiently 
 
serious  state,  almost  certainly  with  horrific  head  injuries,  that  without 
 
medical intervention he was going to die, which you must have appreciated 
 
and yet you did nothing to help him nor did you call the emergency services. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

4.	  On 19 July 2012 you went back to the house in the early afternoon and even 
 
if you did not know it before, you realised then that he was dead inside that 
 
 
house. It was then that you started disposing of incriminating items in waste 
 
bins around Sneinton Dale and, in the early hours of 20 July, you began the 
 
macabre task of dismemberment and disposal of his body. The cruelty and 
 
degradation involved in cutting off his head and arms with a saw and a knife 
 
after his death is yet further demonstration of your hatred and contempt for 
 
him. Even now you have not disclosed what you did with the head and arms. 
 
At some point over the next few days you removed the torso from the house 
 
wrapped in a duvet cover and took it to some wooded ground above the top 
 
of  Rossington  Road  near  the derelict tower block  of  Burrows Court. There, 
 
evidently in something of a hurry, you dug a shallow grave into which you 
 
effectively bundled his torso and partially covered it. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

5.	  The  mandatory  sentence  for  murder  is  life  imprisonment  and  that  is  the 
 
sentence of the Court upon you. However, under Section 269 and Schedule 
 
21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, I have to determine the minimum term 
 
you should serve before you will be eligible to be considered by the Parole 
 
 
Board for release. 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
   

6.	  I am satisfied that the features identified in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Schedule 
 
 
21 are absent. Accordingly, the starting point is 15 years. I emphasise though 
 
that is only the starting point and I have to consider what aggravating and 
 
mitigating factors there are in order to determine the appropriate minimum 
 
term. Paragraphs 10 and 11 of Schedule 21 set out some of the aggravating 
 
and mitigating factors which may be relevant to the offence of murder, but 
 
neither list is intended to be exclusive and what may aggravate or mitigate 
 
the offence will depend upon all the circumstances of the particular case. 
  
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.	  A seriously aggravating feature of this case is the decapitation of Mr Kennedy 
 
and the dismemberment of his arms, followed by bundling his torso into a 
 
shallow  grave.  This  all  shows  a  depravity  which  is  difficult  to  comprehend. 
 
The horror and grief which Mr Kennedy’s murder has caused his family has 
 
been made appreciably worse by your degrading treatment of him after his

death and the fact that even now his head and arms have not been found. As 
 
 
I say this is a seriously aggravating feature. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

8.	  In  terms  of  mitigation  I  accept  that,  notwithstanding  the  letter  you  wrote 
 
Jamie Fraser from prison which contained a clear threat to Mr Kennedy, this 
 
attack was not planned or pre‐meditated in the sense that you went to 63 
 
Rossington Road intent on attacking him and I reject the suggestion made by 
 
Tara Swift in her evidence that the attack began the moment you entered the 
 
 
house. Notwithstanding the brutal nature of the attack together with the fact 
 
 
that you left him for dead in the house, I accept that when you attacked him 
 
 
you did not intend to kill him but only to cause him serious physical injury. 
  
 

 
 
 
   
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

9.	  Apart from the lack of premeditation and the lack of an intention to kill, there 
 
is little by way of mitigation available to you. Certainly your character cannot 
 
help  you.  The  savagery  of  this  attack  demonstrates  your  propensity  for 
 
violence and although you have not committed any offence as serious as this 
 
in  the  past  you  do  have  previous  convictions  for  violence  against  your 
 
partners, including Tara Swift. 
  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
10. You  have  shown	  no  remorse  for  the  terrible  fate  you  visited  on  Kevin 
 
Kennedy on 17 July and the ensuing days in your police interviews, in your 
 
evidence  or  before  the  Court  today.  In  evidence  you  maintained  the 
 
nonsensical position that Mr Kennedy had suffered no more than a bloodied 
 
nose and that you were more badly injured. Indeed, you seemed to regard 
 
the attack as somehow amusing. 
  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
11. In my judgment, considering the aggravating factors I have identified and in 
 
view of the absence of any real mitigation, the appropriate minimum term is 
 
21 years. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
12. From that will be deducted the days you have spent in custody in relation to 
 
this offence. What this means is that the minimum amount of time you will 
 
spend in prison from today before the Parole Board can order early release is 
 
21 years less those days on remand. If it remains necessary for the protection 
 
of the public, you will continue to be detained after that date. If the Parole 
 
Board  does  decide  to  direct  release  you  will  remain  on  licence  for  the 
 
remainder of your life and may be recalled to prison at any time. 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
13. You were also convicted of the offence of perverting the course of justice by 
 
concealing and disposing of his body and body parts. Even if that offending 
 
stood  alone  it  would  be  sufficiently  serious,  given  that  the  head  and  arms 
 
remain  missing  and  that  you  sought  to  conceal  Mr  Kennedy’s  body  in  a 
 
shallow grave covered with soil and leaves, to attract a sentence of 5 years

imprisonment.  That  sentence  for  that  offence  will  be  served  concurrently 
 
with  the  life  sentence.  No  other  course  would  be  appropriate  given  that  I 
   
have  treated  the  dismemberment  and  concealment  of  the  body  as  an 
 
aggravating feature in setting your minimum term. 
 

    

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
14. Tara  Swift,  you  were  acquitted  of  the  murder of  Kevin  Kennedy  but  found 
 
guilty  of  perverting  the  course  of  justice  by  assisting  Peter  Healy  in  the 
 
concealment and disposal of his body. I accept there is no evidence that you 
 
participated  actively  in  the  dismemberment,  the  decapitation  or  the  burial 
 
and, unlike Peter Healy, you are not seen on the CCTV going into and coming 
 
 
out of Rossington Road at any time during the hours of darkness. 
  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
15. However, it is quite clear that when you went to your house on 19 July, as 
 
you admitted you had in evidence, you knew that Kevin Kennedy was dead in 
 
the house. In those circumstances, it was necessary to dispose of his  body 
 
and  by  its  verdict  the  jury  must  have  concluded  that  you  encouraged  and 
 
urged Peter Healy to get the body out of the house and dispose of it and that 
 
you were aware that he had done so, even if you were not aware of the more 
 
gruesome aspects of the disposal. Once you were aware he was dead which 
 
was  on  the  evening  of  19  July  at  the  latest,  you  could  and  should  have 
 
informed the police the full truth of what had happened and any suggestion 
 
on  your  part  that  you  were  prevented  from  doing  so  by  Peter  Healy  was 
 
clearly  nonsense.  Had  you  done  so,  Peter  Healy  would  have  been 
 
apprehended for the murder earlier than he was and in all probability all of 
 
Kevin  Kennedy’s  body  would  have  been  recovered.  Instead  of  telling  the 
 
police the truth, that Peter Healy had murdered Kevin Kennedy and disposed 
 
of his body, you continued to maintain the lie that he had escaped through 
 
the window in a seriously injured condition.  I do not accept that the lies you 
 
told the police can be explained away by the fact that you were in fear of 
 
Peter Healy, although I do accept that had it not been for what Mr Barnes QC 
 
described  as  his  malign  influence,  you  would  not  have  committed  this 
 
offence. 
 

 
    

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
16. Clearly, as you must appreciate, a custodial sentence is inevitable. In urging 
 
the  Court  to  pass  a  lower  sentence  than  might  otherwise  be  the  case,  Mr 
 
Barnes relies upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in R v Gonsalves [2007] 
 
EWCA Crim 1408, a case in which a woman witnessed a brutal murder by her 
 
partner, the landlord of a public house, of a customer who had assaulted her. 
 
She  was  in  fear  of  her  partner  and  helped  clear  the  public  house  of 
 
incriminating items before dialling 999 and telling the police a false story of 
 
foreigners having committed the murder. The Court of appeal considered a 
 
sentence of 18 months imprisonment more appropriate than the 30 months 
 
passed by the trial judge.

--------
17. I regard your offending as more serious than that of the defendant in that 
 
case.  The  perverting  of  the  course  of  justice  of  which  you  have  been 
 
convicted was the concealment and disposal of the body and body parts of 
 
Kevin Kennedy. In the circumstances, although you are guilty as an aider and 
 
abetter rather than an active participant, your offending is more serious than 
 
merely  telling  lies  to  the  police.  Nonetheless,  your  involvement  in  this 
 
offence was less serious and extreme than that of Peter Healy. Furthermore, 
 
apart from convictions for drink driving and assaulting a police officer from 
 
fifteen years ago, you are a woman of previous good character.  You  have 
 
had an unfortunate life plagued by your alcoholism and the abuse you have 
 
suffered from men like Peter Healy. I also bear in mind your evident horror 
 
 
and remorse at what happened to Kevin Kennedy. 
  
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
18. Accordingly,  I  will  pass  what  I  regard	  as  the  lowest  possible  sentence 
 
commensurate  with  the  seriousness  of  your  offending  which  is  one  is  30 
 
months  imprisonment.  Of  that,  you  will  spend  one  half  in  custody,  after 
 
which you will be released on licence for the remainder of the sentence. If 
 
you commit any other offence during that period of licence you are likely to 
 
be returned to custody. The time you have spent in custody on remand will 
 
 
count towards that sentence.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MRS JUSTICE SHARP
 

 
Many tears have been shed in this court. But the only tears that anyone should shed are
 
 
 
 
 
for Catherine Wells-Burr and her family: her mother Jayne, her father Philip and her
 
 
 
 
sister Leanne. 
  
 
 
  
For many weeks now, the evidence against these three defendants, Rafal Nowak, Anna
 
 
 
Lagwinowicz, and Tadeusz Dmytryszyn, has been presented, tested and scrutinised with
conspicuous care. 
  
 
 
 
Now they have been convicted of Catherine’s murder, our first thoughts, and my first 
 
 
 
words will be about her. 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
Catherine was 23 years old when she was murdered. She was a beloved daughter and
 
sister:  beautiful, bright and hardworking. 
  
 
 
 
Catherine’s parents worked at the Numatics Factory in Chard. Her family had every
 
  
 
 
 
reason – and still have every reason -to be proud of her. With their support, Catherine
 
 
 
 
went to Bath Spa University where she excelled. She obtained a first class honours
 
 
degree in business administration, and in 2011 joined Numatics as a graduate trainee. 
  
On 12th September last year, her badly burned remains were found in her car at Ashill,
 
 
 
 
 
 
in a quiet lane by the main road between Taunton and Chard – a cold blooded murder
 
 
 
 
 
 
by these defendants – which had been carefully planned over a considerable period of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
time. 
  
Catherine worked on the production line at Numatics in her university vacation. It was
 
 
 
 
 
 
there, in 2010, that she met Nowak; their relationship began, and he left his then
 
 
 
 
 
 
girlfriend, Lagwinowicz. 
 
I suspect even then, Catherine’s family had their reservations. By the time of her death,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jayne, with a mother’s instinct certainly did. But because they are decent and kind
 
 
 
 
 
people and because they loved their daughter, they opened their hearts and their home
 
 
 
 
to the man she loved, who they treated like a son.
--------
What they could never have known was that behind the mask of a loving partner Nowak
 
presented to them, was a man without scruple or decency, prepared to murder their
 
 
 
 
 
daughter for money and to blacken her name after her death. 
    
Lagwinowicz never accepted the new relationship and in the months after it began, did
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
everything she could to undermine it. 
  
She planted items in the flat Catherine and Nowak shared – designed to give the
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
impression that Catherine was being unfaithful to the Nowak. On Catherine’s graduation
day in 2011, Lagwinowicz sent a text to Catherine, telling her Nowak was in her bed, as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
he was, though he claimed he had been lured there by Lagwinowicz and drugged. 
  
Catherine then left Nowak. But she soon took him back, because, as Leanne was to say in
 
 
 
evidence, she loved him. 
  
 
Within months, Catherine and Nowak had bought a house together with the help of her
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
parents: a small neat house in Willow Way in Chard. 
  
 
By the end of March 2012 life insurance was in place to cover the mortgage of £123,000
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if either died. 
  
A matter of weeks later, Nowak and Lagwinowicz were back together, but in secret:
 
 
 
 
 
 
hours on the phone together, regular meetings, sometimes twice a day and sex. All this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can be seen from the evidence, painstakingly, and meticulously put together by the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
police after Catherine’s death. 
   
By May 2012, I cannot be sure that Nowak and Lagwinowicz had yet formulated the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plan to kill Catherine which they later carried out. I am sure however that by then, the
 
  
 
 
 
 
green shoots of such a plan were beginning to emerge: Lagwinowicz and Nowak both
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
made trips to solicitors – not in Chard, where the Wells Burr family, and Catherine
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
might find out about it – but in Taunton, where they asked questions about the nature of
 
 
Nowak’s rights over his joint share in the house. Nowak made inquiries of their life
 
 
 
 
 
 
insurance company, though he was later to claim, falsely, to the police he did not know
 
 
 
 
 
 
Catherine’s life was covered. 
 
At the same time, Lagwinowicz did things her own counsel described to the jury as
 
 
 
 
 
despicable. She set up numerous fake email accounts which she used to send offensive
 
 
messages to Catherine, purporting to be from men interested in her sexually. She 
 
 
 
 
 
 
created fake profiles for Catherine on pornographic dating websites, putting her lovely
 
 
 
 
 
face next to revolting pornographic images, pretending to be of her, taken from the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
internet. 
  
One of those profiles was accessed by Dmytryszyn the day after Lagwinowicz created it. 
  
Nowak himself spied on Catherine in her own home in a horrible way, using his phone
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and a recording device supplied by Lagwinowicz to do so. 
  
Nowak denied he knew what Lagwinowicz was up to, but the evidence satisfies me, that
 
 
 
 
 
the two of them were complicit in this deeply unpleasant behaviour. 
   
Whatever lay behind it, by the end of July 2012 I am sure that between them, Nowak
 
 
 
 
and Lagwinowicz had hatched a plan to kill Catherine – and to kill her for the money the
--------
insurance would pay out for the mortgage if she was dead; and for her half share in the
 
 
 
 
 
house in Willow Way. 
  
It was all about money. Nowak and Catherine had no ties: they were not married -there
 
 
 
 
  
 
were no children. The murder of Catherine was motivated by money, selfishness and
 
 
 
 
 
greed, and, in the case of Lagwinowicz by a twisted jealousy and a desire for revenge. 
  
From then on, Nowak and Lagwinowicz went to great lengths to cover their tracks. They
  
communicated via her library email account, and on new sim cards bought especially for
that purpose. They planned to lay a false trail after Catherine’s death, which would lead
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the police to believe Catherine had a mystery lover who had killed her. The plan to kill
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Catherine needed a trusted third person, and Dmytryszyn – like a brother to 
 
 
 
 
Lagwinowicz - was that man. 
 
  
There was a failed attempt to put the plan into effect in the early hours of the morning
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the 10th September, frustrated by a wrong number call to Catherine in the middle of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
the night, which probably woke her up. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was no such failure two days later. In the early hours of the morning of the 12th 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
September Catherine was killed in her home by Nowak. It is likely that she was
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
smothered in her bed, killed while she slept, a noiseless bloodless killing, though the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
state of her body after death was such that the exact cause of death could not be
  
ascertained. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Her body was removed from her home. Two cars -one of them Catherine’s -were then 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
driven to Ashill. While the cars were on the move, fake lovers’ texts were sent using
  
Catherine’s phone to give the impression she had left home to meet her mystery lover. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At some point, her skull was fractured by a heavy blow to mislead the police into
 
 
  
thinking the mystery lover had killed her. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At Ashill, Catherine’s body was placed in the driver’s seat of her car, and the car was set
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
alight. I am sure from all the evidence in this case, that the fire was set using petrol
  
Lagwinowicz and Dmytryszyn had bought days earlier for that purpose. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The defendants knew the fire would quickly be seen; it was started as Nowak arrived
   
for work, to give him a fake alibi whilst the others made good their escape. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What the defendants did not know was the speed with which the police would act.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nowak was arrested then Lagwinowicz. In her car they found the carefully concealed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sim card from which the fake lovers’ texts had been sent, a vital clue which, with the
 
 
 
 
 
 
many pieces of evidence discovered by the police, ultimately linked all three defendants
  
to Catherine’s death. 
 
In a conversation secretly recorded by police after their arrest, Nowak and Lagwinowicz
 
 
 
 
 
 
said they loved each other. But as their story unravelled, and cornered by the evidence
   
against them, they resorted to blaming each other. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In one last twist, a few days before this trial began, Lagwinowicz wrote a fake letter to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the prosecuting authorities which she gave to a fellow prisoner to post outside jail. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
letter pretended to be from a Polish hit man. It gave some distressing details, whether
--------
true or not, of what was said to have happened. It said that Lagwinowicz and her uncle
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
had nothing to do with Catherine’s death, and blamed Nowak alone for the murder. 
  
Catherine’s parents and her sister have endured the unimaginable, listening with quiet
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dignity in this court to the harrowing details of what befell her. They now speak very
 
 
 
movingly of the pain – their grief - their suffering. 
  
 
 
 
… Will the defendants please stand. 
  
 
Rafal Nowak, Anna Lagwinowicz, Tadeusz Dmytryszyn. 
   
This was a dreadful, pitiless crime, committed in cold blood in grotesque breach of trust,
 
 
 
 
 
 
in which each of you played your full part. You murdered a fine young woman with
 
 
 
It involved a significant degree of planning, the
everything to live for, for money. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
destruction of her body which was charred beyond recognition, and an attempt to
 
 
 
 
 
destroy her reputation after her death. 
  
 
 
 
 
Rafal Nowak, the images of you leading Catherine round by the hand the evening before
 
 
 
her death – buying items for what you knew would be her last meal – are utterly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chilling. You are unscrupulous, cold hearted and ruthless. Your only emotion has been
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for yourself. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anna Lagwinowicz, you suffer from a long term medical condition which is your
 
misfortune. I have carefully considered the information about it which has been
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided to me, but there is nothing in it which affects my view of the sentence that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be passed. Your conduct has been deceitful, manipulative and cruel. You played
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
your full part in this wicked crime. 
  
So did you Tadeusz Dmytryszyn. You were a willing recruit. You knew what the plan
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was, I am sure you knew why the plan was made, and you took your full part in carrying
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it out. I reject the submission made on your behalf that the sentence which must be
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
passed on those who commit murder for gain should not apply to you. 
  
Lagwinowicz, and Dmytryszyn, you have no other convictions recorded against you, but
 
 
 
 
 
given the gravity of this crime, and the planning that led up to it, that carries no weight
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in my view. 
  
You are each sentenced to life imprisonment. 
   
I must set the minimum period which, less the time you have each spent on remand in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
custody, you must serve before the Parole Board can consider whether it is safe to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release you. Even if, and I emphasise the word if, that occurs, you will remain on licence
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
for the rest of your lives and will be liable to recall by the Secretary of State. In 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
considering what that period should be, the starting point for each of you is that this
 
 
 
 
 
 
was a murder in the expectation of gain. There was, in addition, significant aggravation, 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
and no mitigation. In the circumstances, I am not persuaded there is any reason to
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
distinguish between you. 
  
The minimum term for each of you is set at 32 years.",2013-06-10 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

OMAR KHAN AND OTHERS
 
 

 

 

10 JUNE 2013 
  

 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE HILLIARD Q C.
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
1.	 

Each Defendant has pleaded guilty to an offence of engaging in conduct in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preparation for committing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 5 of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Terrorism Act 2006.  Terrorism in this case means the use of action involving 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious violence against the person for the purpose of advancing a religious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or ideological cause.  Each of you planned an attack which was to take place 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 30th June 2012.  Your intended victims were those attending a rally of the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

English Defence League in Dewsbury town centre.  Your motive was, to use 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  own  words,  “retaliation  for  your  blasphemy  of  ALLAH  and  HIS 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Messenger  Muhammad.” 

   

 

The  means  you  chose  were  an  improvised 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explosive  device  containing  359  nails  and  93  ball  bearings;  2  sawn‐off
--------
shotguns and 9 rounds of  ammunition; 2 machetes, 2 swords and 6 knives. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Efforts had been made to sharpen some of these last items.  Your ages range 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between 22 and 28 years. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 
2.	 

 

 
3.	 

How was it that you became involved in a crime of this gravity?  At least part 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  answer  to  that  question  must  lie  in  the  tide  of  apparently  freely 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available extremist material in which  most of you had immersed yourselves. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  my  judgment,  this  aspect  of  the  case  has  a  continuing  significance. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It 
 

demonstrates,  in  the  words  of  the  prosecution,  a  close  and  committed 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in extreme Islamist ideology with an emphasis on jihad and violent 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retribution.  The extent and degree of that commitment, as evidenced by the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts of this case, are such that in my judgment it will be a long time before 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  truly  free  from  it,  assuming  that  that  is  your  desire.  I  am  satisfied 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  its  nature  that  it  extends  well  beyond  a  preoccupation  with  the  EDL, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although it was their profile which made them the object of your plans. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  material  concerned  was  discovered  in  the  course  of  a  thorough  and

for  present  purposes.  At  your  home,  Omar  Khan,  in  relation  to  digital 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material,  police  officers recovered 317 relevant  files  spread  across  an  MP3 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

player and a number of CDs.  15 contained extreme ideological material.  An 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

audio lecture was to the effect that whoever insults the Prophet Mohammed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be killed.

On  Jewel  Uddin’s  mobile  telephone  were  a  number  of  files  containing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ideological material, including one where the speaker said that it was right to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wage  war  against  the  unbeliever. 

   

 

 

 

 

The  kind  of  war  is  illustrated  by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivational chants which were also recovered and which were interspersed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the sounds of gunfire. You collected some basic component parts of a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pipe  bomb,  having  seen  instructions  in  Inspire  magazine,  edition  1,  online, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but did not complete its manufacture. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

859  files  recovered  from  Mohammed  Hasseen’s  home  address  contained 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extreme ideological material including an invitation to young people to fight 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the West or join their brothers in the fronts of jihad ‐ Afghanistan, Iraq and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Somalia.  A digital copy of Inspire magazine  contained  the instructions I have 
 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred  to  for  making  a  pipe  bomb.  Video  film  showed  a  bomb  factory, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapons being fired, improvised explosive devices being prepared and a man 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently putting on a suicide vest. You say that you were holding some of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the devices which contained this material for other people. Your possession 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Inspire magazine is reflected in Count 2 which charges an offence contrary 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Section 58 (1) (b) of the Terrorism Act 2000 and to which you have pleaded 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guilty. 
 

At  Mohammed  Saud’s  home  were  75  files  containing  extreme  ideological

in the background. You told the author of your pre‐sentence report that you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had viewed Inspire magazine online. 
 

 

 

 

 

Zohaib  Ahmed  was  in  possession  of  203  files  containing  extreme  material, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including lectures to the effect that non ‐ Muslims who refused to submit to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Islam should be killed, and guidelines for a would‐be terrorist as to how to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  and  prepare  an  attack.  A  video  file  showed  hooded  figures  placing  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

roadside IED. 
 

 

In Anzal Hussain’s home was a pamphlet entitled “In defence of the Prophet”, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  title  as  was  chosen  for  the  document  in  which  the  Defendants 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to publicise the motivation behind events on the 30th  June.  A CD 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contained chants and the sound of automatic gunfire. You had a fraction of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  material  some  others  had.  I  am  sure  nonetheless  that  you  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivated by the same considerations as your co‐accused.  That is why you 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  these  preparations  and  allied  yourself  with  others  who  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

steeped in this material which extends, as I have said, far beyond a concern 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply with the EDL. 
 

 

 

 

Extreme material of this kind is not  difficult either to obtain or to share.  In 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  it  can  only  have  served  to  reinforce  the  defendants’  resolve  to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behave in the hideous way that was  planned.

The evidence reveals that preparatory steps were taken for at least 8 weeks. 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At  any  time,  any  one  of  you  could  have  thought  better  of  it,  but  it  is  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure of your commitment that none of you did so. Mohammed Saud says 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  plans  were  only  revealed  to  him  on  3rd  June.  Even  so,  there  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ample opportunity to relent if he had wanted to. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On  3rd  May  2012,  Zohaib  Ahmed  viewed  the  website  of  a  company  which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stocked a brand of firework which was adapted to make the viable IED which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  taken  to  Dewsbury.  I  am  sure  that  this  was  an  incident  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preparations  which  were  to  lead  to  Dewsbury  on  30th  June.  On  11th  June 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2012, your computer searched under the term “ Fireworks”. I draw the same 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference. No other has been suggested. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Later  in  May,  Omar  Khan  applied  for  financial  loans. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  a  notepad  at  his 
 

 

 

 

 

address  was  written  “Next  month  get  a  loan  and  then  do  Act  ASAP.”  In 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general terms, money was of course needed to finance the preparations and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the aftermath of these events if the Defendants escaped capture. You did 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not intend to martyr yourselves.

Jewel Uddin had in his possession a document which gave advice on making 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent loan applications. 
 

 

 

On  1st  June  2012,  the  Renault  Laguna  which  was  used  to  transport  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapons on 30th  June was purchased by a man calling himself Mohammed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Habibullah but giving Mohammed Hasseen’s telephone number.  The vehicle 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was then registered in a false name and insured on two occasions.  First, on 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9th  June 2012 for 24 hours. On 9th  June an EDL rally was held in Rochdale. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whether any of you did in fact travel to Rochdale on that day is not known 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  am  sure  that  the  group  did  at  least  contemplate  going  there  for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconnaissance  purposes.  The  vehicle  was  also  insured  on  29th  June  for  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short period.  Mohammed Hasseen accepts that he  paid for the insurance on 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each occasion using Mohammed Saud’s details .  The certificate for 9th  June 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  found  at  Jewel  Uddin’s  home  address.  For  the  second  period  of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  ,  the  contact  e‐mail  address  provided  was  the  same  one  as 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohammed Hasseen had used in applying for a loan on the 29th  May.  On 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29th  June, one numeral in the registration number was inputted incorrectly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the result that the Renault Laguna was not in fact insured. As sometimes 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens, such a small mistake was to lead to the defendants’ detection. The 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other vehicle involved on 30th  June, a Rover 25, was purchased on 29th  June 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  Mohammed  Hasseen.  Omar  Khan  and  Jewel  Uddin  were  seen  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicle minutes after  its purchase .

On  the  12th  June,  Jewel  Uddin  and  Mohammed  Hasseen  had  travelled  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dewsbury.  The visit was  for the purpose of reconnaissance in advance of the 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30th June EDL rally. 
 

 

 

 

The computer found at Zohaib Ahmed’s address  conducted internet searches 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the EDL, Rochdale and Dewsbury on 11th  June.  YouTube videos showing 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the EDL Rochdale demonstration on 9th June were viewed on 11th June on the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  computer.  On  the  11th  June  Mohammed  Hasseen  also  viewed  web 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages relating to the EDL. The computer found at Mohammed Saud’s home 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had been used on 30th June in searches for the EDL, Dewsbury Town Hall and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for success in battle and jihad . The evidence demonstrates that the 5 who 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went to Dewsbury  were all at the address at the time. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Khan  and  Uddin  accept  making  the  viable  IED.  This  was  a  very  significant 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility.  On  the  25th  June,  they  bought  pairs  of  gloves  and  a  set  of 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knives  which  were  recovered  in  due  course  from  the  boot  of  the  Renault

On 30th June, the 5 Defendants who travelled from Birmingham to Dewsbury 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discarded their mobile telephones to avoid their movements being tracked . 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Renault Laguna and the Rover 25 travelled in convoy to Dewsbury.  They 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were seen in the town centre at 4:16 pm. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  due  course  when  the  Renault  was  examined,  there  was  a  CD  in  the  CD 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

player entitled “The dust will never settle.” Jewel Uddin’s fingerprints were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  it.  It  included  a  lecture  exhorting  murderous  retribution  against  those 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perceived to have insulted the Prophet Mohammed. Other CDs in the vehicle 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contained equally extreme material. 
 

 

 

 

At 4:25 pm. on 30th June, the Rover was seen at the railway station car park. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That was the assembly point for the demonstration as advertised by the EDL 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on their website.  In fact, it had ended earlier than anticipated and the crowd 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had dispersed by about 2:30 pm.  Providentially, the Defendants had arrived 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too late to put their plan into effect. There is, however, no reason to suppose 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a further attempt would not have been made at some time in the future 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had the defendants not been apprehended.  I regard it as inconceivable that 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your resolve would have evaporated. 
 

 

 

 

 

After visits to a mosque and a fish and chip shop, the two vehicles returned 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

towards Birmingham.  Shortly after 6 pm., the Renault was stopped by police. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The occupants were Omar Khan and Jewel Uddin.  The vehicle was showing

as uninsured on the police national computer.  At first, Khan gave his name as 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohammed  Habibullah,  the  name  which  had  been  used  to  purchase  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicle.  Later he did give his true name but the police decided to impound 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the vehicle.  Khan and Uddin bought train tickets to Birmingham.  Khan  was 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen to have large bundles of cash.  The Rover arrived back in Birmingham 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later the same evening.

The impounded Renault was searched the next day.  In the boot was found 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the weaponry I have already described.  In addition, there were 10 copies of 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the document entitled “Operation: In defence of the Prophet Muhammad.” 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zohaib Ahmed wrote this document. It was printed at Mohammed Hasseen’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address.  One  paragraph  was  addressed  to  the,  and  I  quote,  “EDL  (English

Had you managed to put your plan into effect, I am sure that  that is how you 
  

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all viewed it at the time and how you would have sought to publicise it. The 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extravagant  language  reflects  your  misguided  views.  When  you  were 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested in early July 2012, each of you made no comment when interviewed. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsequently, in defence statements submitted in February 2013, you were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  claim  that  what  you  did  amounted  to  lawful  preparation  for  action  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  self‐defence  or  defence  of  others  and  Not  Guilty  pleas  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered on 22nd  February 2013.  More recently, you have accepted by your 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleas  of  Guilty  that  that  cannot  be  the  case.  Those  pleas  of  Guilty  were 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered on the 30th April 2013. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

The principal and only viable IED consisted of a cardboard firework tube with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  cone. 
 
   

It  contained  the  explosive  content  of  at  least  2  fireworks  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significantly, 359 nails and 93 ball bearings.  An expert concluded that if the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fuse  had  been  lit,  and  the  device  had  exploded,  hot  shrapnel  would  have 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been projected at high velocity.  The expert could only think of one reason for 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the addition of the nails and ball bearings, namely to increase the likelihood 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of serious injury being caused.  No other has been suggested. Whatever the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for abandoning the preparations for a pipe bomb, its substitute was a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

horrible weapon.  There was no question, the expert concluded, but that if 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the device had been ignited an explosion would have occurred.  The effective 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

range was anticipated to be in the  order of perhaps a few tens of metres, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe less.  If initiated in a crowded, confined space, serious, possibly fatal,

injuries  were  to  be  expected.  I  accept  the  impossibility  of  predicting  its 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise  point  of  explosion  with  accuracy  but  that  only  underlines  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indiscriminate nature of such a device. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

In the boot were also the component parts of a pipe bomb  along the lines of

information likely to have been useful to a person preparing or committing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an act of terrorism. On 22nd  June 2012, he had been released on bail by the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

magistrates court when his case was sent to the Crown Court . 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Inspire  1  contains  a  shocking  mixture  of  extreme  ideological  material  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  instruction,  including  how  to  make  an  explosive  device. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It 
 

emphasises  the  importance  of  including  shrapnel  and  says  that  the  device 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be placed in a crowded area. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Although in less than perfect condition, both shotguns were in working order 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ammunition  was  suitable  for  use  in  them.  One  of  the  shotguns 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required lubrication to function when it was examined 7 months or so later. I

I  ordered  pre‐sentence  reports  in the  case  of  each Defendant  to  assist  me 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the question of the future risk which each of you may pose.  Each of you 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is presently assessed as posing a high level of risk to the general public. As it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens, the reports  also provided an indication which had never been given 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before of the roles which each of you played. But in addition, in a case such 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as this, reports  provide a Judge with direct access to what a Defendant is 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying about their attitude to what they have done. And it is right to record 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that each of you does not now  seek to justify what you  did and expresses 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remorse for it – that is very  important. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

There were indications of a failure by some of you, even at the stage when 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reports  were  prepared,  to  acknowledge  the  full  extent  of  what  you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended, claiming instead that you intended only to instil fear or to cause 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor harm.  I must of course examine what you said for the purposes of the 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 12 -

pre‐sentence reports with care. I cannot always take it at face value as this 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example demonstrates. But that stance has not been maintained during this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  hearing.  I  sentence  you  in  accordance  with  the  earlier  written 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis of plea that your intention was to engage in a violent confrontation with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those attending the EDL rally and to use the weapons and the IED to cause 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious injuries, and  that you anticipated that some victims may have died. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That must follow from the nature of the dreadful collection of material with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  you  were  armed.  Each  of  you  accepted  in  your  defence  statements 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you were aware of what was being taken to Dewsbury.

Consistent with the random nature of a terrorist attack of this kind, those at

rally but would have included police officers who were watching over it and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  other  members  of  the  public  who  happened  to  be  in  the  area  for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different reasons at the time.  You did of course come close to putting your 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan into effect. 
 

 

 

This offence is further aggravated by the duration and extent of the planning 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  went  into  it  and  by  your  adherence  to  the  extreme  ideology  which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prompted it. I do not regard the totality of the preparations in this case as 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being amateurish. They were wide‐ranging and determined.

Apart  from  the  immediate  consequences  and  the  terror  you  would  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caused, an attack of this kind risks starting a spiral of tit‐for‐tat violence‐ the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  action  and  reaction  that  you  spoke  of.  That  is  a  particularly  serious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect of this case.  That simply cannot be a feature of life in a society where 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the overwhelming majority choose to live in peace and harmony with their 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fellow men and women, whether they share the same religious beliefs or not. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have seen, read and heard material about the EDL and about what you and 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others felt about them and their activities. As a matter of generality, unlawful 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence of any kind , and foul  and inflammatory insults of a racial nature or 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directed  towards  a  particular  religious  group  deserve  at  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least 
  

unequivocal condemnation, whoever or  whatever the source.  I acknowledge 
 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  unrest  and  enormous  distress  such  behaviour  gives  rise  to.  But  as  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response,  more unlawful violence is not on the list of options. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Had the prosecution advanced their case upon the basis that your intention 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to kill and if you fell to be sentenced on that basis, then in my judgment 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a life sentence would have come to the fore. Even now, I have given anxious 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration as to whether it is the right course to take. In the event, by a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow margin, I can deal with you in another way. But the fact that you all 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anticipated that fatalities could result makes this a very serious case and is a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant matter when assessing the danger that each of you poses in the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future.

In the case of each of you, I take account of your age. You are all young men. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is an age span of 6 years but I cannot discern any difference in maturity 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between you. Khan and Uddin have no previous convictions at all . Hasseen, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Saud  and Hussein have nothing recorded against them  that would prevent 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me giving them the same credit.  I do so.  Although you, Zohaib Ahmed, now 
 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  convictions  in  September  2012  for  possessing  material  likely  to be  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  to someone  preparing or  committing  acts of  terrorism,  on  the  facts  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case I do not regard that as a basis for making a distinction between you 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and your co‐accused.  Certain it is that in the course of  preparations for this 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended attack, others had had access to material of  the same  kind. It is, 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however,  plainly an aggravating feature in your case that you were on bail 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you committed this offence.  I regard it as another indication of your 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commitment  and  determination.  Unlike  the  others,  some  of  the  time  you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have spent in custody awaiting sentence will not count towards it because 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  been  serving  a  sentence  for  the  earlier  offences.  I  accept  Mr 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Munyard’s submission that aside from that, the sentence in your case should 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be longer than in the case of any co‐accused by virtue of the convictions 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone. 
 

As to your respective involvement, save in the case of Mohammed Hasseen, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  defendant  has  sought  to  make  any  distinction.  I  have  considered  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  for  myself.  As  a  matter  of  commonsense,  not  everyone  can  be 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  in  every  act  of  preparation.  Each  of  you  was  involved  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 15 -
--------
preparations  to  a  significant  degree.  In  your  pre‐sentence  reports,  each  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  described  your  role  and  said  that  the  idea  and  enthusiasm  for  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offence  was  equally  shared.  Although  you,  Mohammed  Hasseen  ,  did  not 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

travel on the mission to Dewsbury, your fingerprints are quite literally all over 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant items. In your case, I have read a letter from your wife who is the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mother of your 3 young children. You attended a wedding on 30 June. But I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

am  sure that it also suited your purposes to stay behind so as to be  certain 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that one member of this group would not be captured at the scene and so 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in due course  you could assist any other or others who escaped. Given 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  interest in  matters of  an  extreme  kind and  the  overall  extent  of your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involvement, no other conclusion is possible. I reach it  without regard to the 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contents of your pre‐sentence report. Nonetheless, I accept the submission 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Mr Friedman QC that some distinction is appropriate. The prosecution do 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not dissent from that. Your hand would not have been on any of the weapons 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time when they were intended  to be used. Aside from that, after very 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

careful  consideration  of  everything  that  I  have  read  and  heard,  I  assess 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohammed Saud and Anzal Hussain as having been to a degree less involved 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the preparations than the others who went to Dewsbury. I shall make an 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowance for that.

I  take  account  of  all  the  points  that  have  been  helpfully  and  persuasively 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made 
   

in  mitigation. 
   

 

In  particular,  I  bear  in  mind  of  course  that  by  good 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fortune alone this attack did not in fact take place.

41.	 

 

I  have  read  carefully  a  file  of  documents  which  speak  about  each  of  you. 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They include a letter from Mr Khan’s father, a letter from Mr Uddin’s brother, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the letter from Mr Hasseen’s wife,  evidence of kindnesses done by Mr Saud, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of difficulties Mr Ahmed has which served to isolate him to some extent , and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the help Mr Hussain gave his mother in difficult circumstances.  I have read 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  psychological  report  for  Mr  Khan.  Although  he  has  moderate  learning 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulties, I have to record that he was able to take part in constructing a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viable IED.  You all have family members who will suffer continuing  distress 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  what  you  have  brought  upon  yourselves  .  Others  would  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffered  if  you  had  succeeded in your  plans.  As to the  potential  for  better 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influences to bear upon you,  the fact is that you chose to ignore them and 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were able to keep hidden  from them what you were planning. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42.	  My attention has been drawn to a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and to sentences passed in other cases at first instance.  In Martin [1999] 1 Cr 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

App  R  (S)  497,  the  Court  of  Appeal  reiterated  the  significance  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between cases where an explosive device was intended to cause 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury to the person rather than damage to property. The Court said that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bracket for offences which involved causing or planning  terrorist explosions 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was wider in each direction  than 20 – 35 years. In Barot [2007] EWCA Crim 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1119 and Jalil [2008] EWCA Crim 2910, the Court of Appeal referred to the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that terrorist offences have become graver in recent times. Of course, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 17 -

aside  from  the  IED,  any  group  which  possessed  only  the  remainder  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapons  in  this  case  with  criminal  intent  would  commit  a  very  serious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offence. In the final analysis, the sentences I pass must be determined by the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular facts of this case. Inevitably, they must include an element which is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed to deter others from behaving in the same way. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am sure that what motivated each of you to commit this offence must have 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run very deep indeed.  It would have to have done so before anyone could 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even contemplate committing it, leave alone engage in the preparations you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  and  then  actually  set  off  to  carry  it  out.  In  my  judgment,  it  would  be 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unrealistic to suppose that detection and prosecution by themselves would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  sufficient  to  bring  about  a  lasting  change  of  heart.  The  obvious  risk  of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those things was not sufficient to deter you as you prepared for your attack. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  take  account  of  what  is  said  in  the  reports  about  your  intentions  for  the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future but it seems to me that that will be much harder to achieve than to

take place with the passage of time.

notification requirements and licence conditions to which you will be subject 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on release from custody. I have considered them very carefully. However, in 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  judgment  the  combination  of  those  requirements  and  a  substantial

specified offences.

Accordingly, there will be a custodial term and a further period for which you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be subject to a licence.  The appropriate custodial term is the one that 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be imposed apart from Section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  extension  period  will  be  for  a  period  of  such  length  as  I  consider 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary for the purpose of protecting members of the public from serious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm  occasioned  by  the  commission  by  each  of  you  of  further  specified 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offences.  In fixing the custodial term, I give you credit in accordance with the 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline for reduction in sentence for a guilty plea.  Although the pleas of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty were entered on re‐arraignment and after a trial date had been set, it is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to acknowledge that you have avoided the need for a trial of at least

until the expiry of the extension period I impose. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

On  Count  2,  the  sentence  upon  Mohammed  Hasseen  is  one  of  2  years’

of this kind, and I have to look at the offence in its context.

ITN News and Others - v - R 

 

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
  

This is an application under s.159 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (the 1988 Act), 
alternatively  an  application  under  s.46(10)  of  the  Youth  Justice  and  Criminal 
 
Evidence Act 1999 (the 1999 Act) by a number of media organisations for leave to 
appeal against an order made by Thirlwall J at Nottingham Crown Court during the 
 
course of the notorious recent trial of Michael and Mairead Philpott and Paul Mosley.   

Following the deaths of the six children of Michael and Mairead Philpott who were 
 
killed following a fire on 11 May 2012 in their home at 18 Victory Road, Derby, they 
were charged with manslaughter.  In due course they were convicted by the jury. 

One of the witnesses called by the prosecution was Lisa Willis (the mother).  She had 
five children, four of them by Philpott.  For several years she had lived at the same 
 
address,  18  Victoria  Road,  with  Michael  and  Mairead  Philpott.    Several  months 
before the fatal fire she had left that address.  When she moved away from the area a 
dispute broke out between her and Philpott about the arrangements for the children. 
Philpott’s involvement in the fatal fire stemmed from a determination to demonstrate 
that the mother was unfit to care for the children, and so, the night before the case was 
listed for a hearing, the fire was started.  The intention was that she should be blamed 
for it.  Thus she was a crucial witness at the trial. 
  

 

Long before the tragic events of May 2012, the life style of Michael Philpott and the 
women  in  his  life,  and  his  very  large  number  of  children,  had  been  the  subject  of 
extensive media coverage and public interest.  Photographs and images of the mother 
and her children appeared on television and in newspapers.  She herself had appeared 
in three television programmes speaking about her relationship with Michael Philpott 
 
and the family’s living arrangements. 

The first was the Jeremy Kyle show in 2006, entitled “Father to Fifteen … Wife and 
Girlfriend  Pregnant  Again”.    The  mother  appeared  with  Michael  and  Mairead 
Philpott,  answering  questions  about  her  relationship  and  the  living  arrangements 
before a live studio audience. 

The  second  was  “Tales  of  the  Unaccepted  –  the  Philpotts”.    This  programme  was 
broadcast  on  ITV  Central  Television  on  12  April  2007.    The  programme  followed 
births of children to both Mairead Philpott and the mother of whom Michael Philpott 
was the father.  The mother was filmed with her children.  She spoke directly to the 
camera.  The film showed the beginning of her labour at home and, after the birth of 
her baby in hospital, showed the baby handed to her immediately after the birth. 

The third was “Ann Widdecombe vs the Benefit Culture”, broadcast on ITV 1 on 22 
August 2009.  This was an hour long documentary in which Ann Widdecombe MP 
explored and challenged the attitudes of the Philpott family, and the arrangements by 
which they were all living in the context of claims for benefits.  The mother was seen

from  time  to  time  throughout  the  documentary,  and  so  were  her  children,  and 
photographs of them all were widely published. 

The  events  covered  by  the  subsequent  trial  at  Nottingham  Crown  Court  attracted 
worldwide coverage and international interest.  The coverage included images of the 
mother, which remain widely available on the internet, and on websites outside the 
jurisdiction. 

Before the start of the trial, the Crown applied for and in accordance with s.23(1) of 
 
the  1999  Act  was  permitted  the  use  of  special  measures.    This  took  the  form  of 
protective  screens  when  the  mother  gave  evidence  in  court.    The  application  was 
based on a statement from the mother herself, updated in oral submissions about her 
fearful  state  of  mind.  She  was  content  to  give  her  evidence,  but  had  a  number  of 
concerns  about  the  hearing.  She  was  worried  that  her  physical  identity  would  be 
revealed  at  court.  She  had  already  taken  measures  to  avoid  any  risk  that  anyone 
connected to Philpott should know of her whereabouts or know what she looked like. 
 
She was now living with her children in a house in an unknown location.  She had 
changed their surnames and altered her appearance.  If she gave open evidence she 
was scared “that someone will either see me and then make efforts to locate me and 
 
follow me to where I live with my children”.  She said that she would tell the court 
the whole truth about the case, and continued that it would “be a lot easier if I cannot 
see Mick Philpott and he and his family and friends cannot see me”.  She had been 
offered  a  number  of  “special  measures”,  but  she  did  not  wish  to  give  evidence  or 
answer questions by video.  She wished to give evidence in court personally, but she 
would feel “much more comfortable and be able to give my evidence more freely” if 
 
she could be behind screens.  Hence the application, supported by the Crown. 

On 12 February 2013 an order made by Thirlwall J under s.4(2) of the Contempt of 
Court Act 1981 prohibited the publications of photographs of the mother or any of her 
five children until 5 March 2013.  At the end of the day, the judge was asked whether, 
in  the  light  of  her  order,  it  was  permissible  for  newspapers  or  broadcast  media  to 
publish  photographs  of  the  mother  and  her  children  that  evening,  and  in  any  event 
before she gave evidence.  The judge gave a short ruling underlining that her concern 
was the “integrity of the criminal trial”.  It was submitted to her by the Crown that any 
 
photographs  appearing  in  the  media  just  as  she  was  about  to  give  evidence  would 
undermine the entire purpose of the order for special measures which had been made. 
 
Thirlwall J did not accept the entire breadth of the submission, but she recognised that 
the purpose of the order enabling the mother to give evidence behind a screen was 
 
that she would be able to give it away from the public gaze, and that public focus on 
 
her and her children would undermine her ability to give evidence.  The judge noted 
that the publication of any such photographs would “torpedo her attempts not to be 
recognised, reinforcing her fears for herself and her children”.  She therefore made an 
order postponing publication of any photographs of Lisa Willis or her children, and 
further  ordered  that  any  photographs  that  had  already  been  published  during  the 
course of the hearing should be withdrawn.

11.	 

 
12.	 

The judge considered the impact of the order on the entitlement of the press to report 
court proceedings fairly and accurately.  She concluded that written and verbal reports 
 
were sufficient to represent the public interest, and she could see no public interest in 
the  publication  of  a  photograph  or  photographs  or  images  of  the  mother  or  her 
children.  In  any  event  if  photographs  of  the  mother  were  published  the  children 
would be immediately identified.  

On  13  February,  after  an  opportunity  to  consider  the  relevant  statutory  provisions 
 
overnight, Thirlwall J concluded that the order under s.4(2) of the Contempt of Court 
 
Act was, as she described it, “a rather clumsy and possibly erroneous route to preserve 
the  position”.    The  proper  route  was  via  s.46  of  the  Youth  Justice  and  Criminal 
Evidence  Act  1999.    She  was  satisfied  that  the  witness  was  eligible  for  protection 
within  the  context  of  the  Act,  and  that  the  quality  of  her  evidence  would  be 
diminished by reason of fear at being identified as a witness in the proceedings.  The 
order reflected the logical consequence of the attempts being made by the mother to 
rebuild  her  life  and  without  it,  all  her  efforts  would  come  to  nothing.    The  order 
 
should therefore be made in the interests of justice. 

 
13.	 

The order made on the previous day was revoked, and replaced by an order under s.46 
of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.  The order provided that: 

“(1) no photograph, pseudo photograph or other image of 

(a)  Lisa Willis 
(b) Her children or any of them (with or without Lisa Willis)  

 
 
Shall  be  published  in  any  way  which  connects  them  or  any  of  them 
 
(whether through reports of these proceedings or otherwise howsoever) to 
the case of R v Michael Philpott, Mairead Philpott and Paul Mosley”. 

The press and media were given liberty to apply for amendment or revocation of the 
order on 24 hours notice. 

Immediately after the order was made, the mother began her evidence.  So as to avoid 
any disruption of the trial, the media postponed their application for the revocation of 
the order until the end of the evidence, after closing speeches were underway.  The 
evidence of the mother was given in open court, and was widely reported throughout 
the media.  No one has suggested that the media was unable to report her evidence in 
meticulous  detail,  or  inhibited,  let  alone  prevented  from  doing  so,  by  Thirlwall  J’s 
order. 

On 3 April the media application for revocation of the order was heard and dismissed. 
 
In her judgment next day Thirlwall J made clear that she could not, and that she did 
not  believe  that  anyone  listening  to  the  case  would,  find  it  “easy  to  understand  the 
purpose” of publication of photographs or film of the mother and her children.  After 
considering submissions on behalf of the media and the Crown which in effect were 
 
repeated before us, she concluded that the jurisdiction to make the order prohibiting

15.

ITN News and Others - v - R 

 

publication of the photographs was based on or created by s.46 of the 1999 Act, and 
that notwithstanding that an internet search would produce images of the mother on 
websites outside the jurisdiction, the order should not be revoked.  She reflected on 
the Article 8 rights of the witness and the Article 10 rights of the press, without regard 
to the Article 8 rights to the children.  She concluded that there was not “the slightest 
doubt” that such publication would have “a very damaging effect” on the mother and 
her children. 

Section 46 of the 1999 Act 

 
16.	 

Every  court  in  England  and  Wales  conducting  criminal  proceedings  may  make  a 
reporting restriction order applicable to any adult who is a witness in the proceedings 
(other than a defendant).  The protection of child witnesses is ensured by s.39 of the 
Children and Young Persons Act 1933. 

 
17.	 

Section 46(6) defines a reporting direction as: 

“A direction that no matter relating to the witness shall during 
the  witness’s  life  time  be  included  in  any  publication  if  it  is 
 
likely to lead members of the public to identify him as being a 
 
witness in the proceedings.” 

 
18.	 

Publication  of  the  name  and  address  of  the  witness,  any  educational  establishment 
attended  by  the  witness,  the  identity  of  any  place  of  work,  and  “…(e)  any  still  or 
moving picture of the witness” 

may be prevented. 

 
19.	 

The order may only be made in support of a witness eligible for statutory protection. 
The “eligibility” requires the court to be satisfied: 

 

“3(a) that the quality of evidence given by the witness, … 

is likely to be diminished by reason of fear or distress on the 
part  of  the  witness  in  connection  with  being  identified  by 
members of the public as a witness in the proceedings”. 

 
20.	 

In deciding whether any particular witness qualifies for eligibility the court must: 

“(4) … take into account, in particular 

(a) the nature and alleged circumstances of the offence to which 
the proceedings relate; 

(b) the age of the witness;
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

ITN News and Others - v - R 

 

(c) such of the following matters as appear to the court to be 
relevant namely 

(i) the social and cultural background and ethnic origins of 
the witness 

(ii)  the  domestic  and  employment  circumstances  of  the 
witness, and 
 

(iii) … 

(d) any behaviour towards the witness on the part of 

(i) the accused, 

(ii) members of the family or associates of the accused, or 

(iii)” 

In  addition  to  these  specific  matters,  the  court  must  also  “consider  any  views 
expressed by the witness”. 

 
21.	 

Provided the witness is eligible for protection and that it is appropriate for a reporting 
direction to be made, before making the order, the court must consider: 

“(8) … 

(a) whether it would be in the interest of justice to do so, and 

(b)  the  public  interest  in  avoiding  the  imposition  of  a 
 
substantial and unreasonable restriction on the reporting of the 
proceedings”. 

 
22.	 

If the eligibility test is met, the court may also impose a reporting direction which is 
subject  to  “an  excepting”  directions,  dispensing  with  restrictions  which  might 
 
otherwise be thought appropriate.  Dealing with it broadly, the effect is that the court 
 
may limit the reporting direction, as it did here, to a photograph or film of the witness.  
In short the effect of any restriction should be limited to those which are reasonable 
bearing in mind the context of the public interest in the reporting of proceedings. 

 
23.	 

The reporting restriction may be revoked by the court of trial or an appellate court, 
that is “court dealing with an appeal … arising out of the proceedings …”. (s.46(12) 

The application 

 
24.	 

The  first  issue  is  to  identify  the  basis  on  which  Thirlwall  J’s  decision  may  be 
 
considered  by  this  court.  When  she  refused  to  revoke  the  restriction  decision,  the
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

ITN News and Others - v - R 

 

main  submission  was  that  the  s.46  order  was  made  without  jurisdiction  and  that 
accordingly it should be revoked under s.46(10). There is no doubt that a reporting 
 
restriction  may  be  revoked  by  the  appellate  court  in  any  “proceedings”  before  this 
court.  However, the present application, of course, is confined to the restriction order.  
The court is not otherwise concerned with any proceedings between any of the three 
defendants at trial and the Crown, or indeed any issue arising from it. 

 
25.	 

Section 159(1)(a) and (b) of the 1988 Act enable an applicant to apply to this court for 
 
leave  against  a  reporting  restriction  order  made  in  relation  to  a  trial  or  indictment 
under s.4 or s.11 of the 1981 Act and s.58(7) and s.58(8) of the Criminal Procedure 
and Investigations Act 1996.  Section 159 goes on to provide that the application may 
also extend to: 

“… 

(b) any order restricting the access of the public to the whole or 
any part of a trial on indictment or to any proceedings ancillary 
to such a trial; and 

(c)  any  order  restricting  the  publication  of  any  report  of  the 
whole  or  any  part  of  the  trial  on  indictment  or  any  such 
ancillary proceedings …” 
 

 
26.	 

 
27.	 

These  provisions  are  designed  to  enable  the  media  or  any  member  of  the  public 
aggrieved by an order restricting access to a trial in the Crown Court to invite this 
 
court to interfere with, amend or revoke the order.  Given the importance attached to 
the principle that criminal justice should, so far as possible, be exercised in public, it 
 
should  therefore  be  given  the  widest  possible  construction.    In  our  judgment  a 
reporting restriction within s.46 of the 1999 Act falls within the ambit of S.159(1)(c) 
of the 1988 Act, and does so even when the restriction on reporting is confined, as this 
order was, to photographs or film.  If the order should not have been made, and in 
particular  if  there  was  no  jurisdiction  enabling  the  order  to  be  made,  it  should  be 
revoked whether or not any other proceedings are before this court. 

In the event of an appeal against conviction or sentence (or indeed a Reference by the 
Attorney General) then, in accordance with s.46(12) of the 1999 Act the jurisdiction 
of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  revoke  any  restriction  or  “excepting”  order  would  be 
immediately engaged without the need for further reference to s.159 of the 1988 Act. 
 
However  where  there  is  no  such  appeal,  but  the  media  remains  aggrieved  by  the 
restriction order, s.159 provides the route to a remedy.   

 
28.	 

The issues raised on behalf of the media merit attention in this court, and accordingly 
 
leave to appeal under s.159(1)(c) is granted.

The decision 
 

Stripped to essentials, the submission by Ms Heather Rogers QC is that the meaning 
given to reporting direction in s.46(6) did not extend to the order made by Thirlwall J, 
 
notwithstanding that the order itself was very limited in its scope, confined as it was 
to any photograph, pseudo photograph or other image of the mother and her children. 
 
Naturally enough, Ms Rogers began her submissions by underlining the importance of 
the principle of open justice.  We agree, and need no anxious repetition of the many 
statements  of  principle  to  demonstrate  the  reasons  why  we  do  agree.    Her  next 
submission  was  that  the  Crown  Court  had  no  powers  at  common  law  to  make  any 
such order.  The power to do so was contained in statute.  We agree.  She submitted 
that an order for special measures did not of itself justify the reporting direction, and 
that  the  reporting  direction  should  not  automatically  follow  any  special  measures 
order.  Again, we agree.  Section 46 provides a distinct power which may be exercised 
alongside  a  special  measures  direction,  but  also,  separately  from  it.    Eligibility  for 
such a reporting restriction does not automatically follow from the need for special 
measures.    It  requires  a  distinct  fact  finding  decision.    Yet  again,  we  agree.  She 
suggested that the protection of the children of the adult witness did not arise in the 
context  of  s.46.  These  were  issues  better  addressed,  and  more  important,  properly 
addressed, in family courts.  Dealing with it generally, we immediately recognise the 
force  of  the  submission  that  in  relation  to  the  identification  of  children  (taken 
 
separately from that of their parent) the Family Division is normally the appropriate 
venue. Nevertheless the criminal courts must control their own processes, and the fact 
that the family court may protect the identity of the children, is not sufficient on its 
own  to  deprive  the  Crown  Court  of  the  jurisdiction  under  s.46.  The  eligibility 
conditions may be established as here, where publication of the photographs of her 
children  would  be  likely  to  lead  to  the  identification  of  the  mother,  and  the  risks 
 
would  be  likely  to  impact  on  the  quality  of  the  mother’s  evidence  at  trial.    As  Mr 
 
David Farrer QC for the Crown observed, the order offered “reassurance to a witness 
 
to preserve the integrity of his or her evidence”.  In our view reference in the order to 
 
the children was integral to the eligibility test as it applied to their mother. 

The crucial difficulty is at the last stage of Ms Rogers’ submission.  She submitted 
that  the  mother  has  already  been  identified  by  previous  publications,  television 
programmes, and the internet.  Indeed the name of Lisa Willis, and her identification 
 
as  the  mother  of  children  of  whom  Philpott  is  the  father  is  effectively  common 
knowledge.  She gave her evidence as Lisa Willis.  In that sense she was and is fully 
 
identified as a witness. 

 

The difficulty with this submission arises from the reality that in the overwhelming 
 
majority of cases the “identity” of every witness is known.  If the jurisdiction to make 
 
an  s.46  order  were  restricted  in  the  way  suggested,  the  “eligibility”  test  would  be 
virtually confined to the rare case of the anonymous witness.  Anonymity, however, is 
an entirely distinct and extreme form of special measure for which a separate statutory 
 
system is in place.  Without repeating s.46(7) it seems clear that it extends beyond the 
bare naming, that is the identifying, of the witness.  Thus a still or moving picture of 
the witness may be prohibited if the “eligibility” test is satisfied, whether or not the 
name and identity of the witness is otherwise known.  This approach is reinforced by

analysis  of  the  wide  ranging  “excepting”  direction  in  s.46(9).  This  sub-section 
anticipates  that  the  ambit  of  the  reporting  restriction  may  be  much  wider  than  the 
mere naming of the witness.  It anticipates that the reporting restriction may impose 
substantial  restrictions  on  reporting  which, in  the  context  of  the  public  interest,  are 
unreasonable.  If Ms Rogers were right neither the provisions in s.46(7) nor those in 
s.46(9) would be necessary.  As it is they demonstrate that the ambit of the reporting 
direction  is  much  wider  than  she  suggested,  but  s.46(9)  also  underlines  that  even 
when  a  reporting  restriction  is  appropriate,  it  should  be  no  wider  than  necessary  to 
avoid any diminution in the quality of the evidence to be given by the witness.

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
  

This is an application under s.159 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (the 1988 Act), 
alternatively  an  application  under  s.46(10)  of  the  Youth  Justice  and  Criminal 
 
Evidence Act 1999 (the 1999 Act) by a number of media organisations for leave to 
appeal against an order made by Thirlwall J at Nottingham Crown Court during the 
 
course of the notorious recent trial of Michael and Mairead Philpott and Paul Mosley.   

Following the deaths of the six children of Michael and Mairead Philpott who were 
 
killed following a fire on 11 May 2012 in their home at 18 Victory Road, Derby, they 
were charged with manslaughter.  In due course they were convicted by the jury. 

One of the witnesses called by the prosecution was Lisa Willis (the mother).  She had 
five children, four of them by Philpott.  For several years she had lived at the same 
 
address,  18  Victoria  Road,  with  Michael  and  Mairead  Philpott.    Several  months 
before the fatal fire she had left that address.  When she moved away from the area a 
dispute broke out between her and Philpott about the arrangements for the children. 
Philpott’s involvement in the fatal fire stemmed from a determination to demonstrate 
that the mother was unfit to care for the children, and so, the night before the case was 
listed for a hearing, the fire was started.  The intention was that she should be blamed 
for it.  Thus she was a crucial witness at the trial. 
  

 

Long before the tragic events of May 2012, the life style of Michael Philpott and the 
women  in  his  life,  and  his  very  large  number  of  children,  had  been  the  subject  of 
extensive media coverage and public interest.  Photographs and images of the mother 
and her children appeared on television and in newspapers.  She herself had appeared 
in three television programmes speaking about her relationship with Michael Philpott 
 
and the family’s living arrangements. 

The first was the Jeremy Kyle show in 2006, entitled “Father to Fifteen … Wife and 
Girlfriend  Pregnant  Again”.    The  mother  appeared  with  Michael  and  Mairead 
Philpott,  answering  questions  about  her  relationship  and  the  living  arrangements 
before a live studio audience. 

The  second  was  “Tales  of  the  Unaccepted  –  the  Philpotts”.    This  programme  was 
broadcast  on  ITV  Central  Television  on  12  April  2007.    The  programme  followed 
births of children to both Mairead Philpott and the mother of whom Michael Philpott 
was the father.  The mother was filmed with her children.  She spoke directly to the 
camera.  The film showed the beginning of her labour at home and, after the birth of 
her baby in hospital, showed the baby handed to her immediately after the birth. 

The third was “Ann Widdecombe vs the Benefit Culture”, broadcast on ITV 1 on 22 
August 2009.  This was an hour long documentary in which Ann Widdecombe MP 
explored and challenged the attitudes of the Philpott family, and the arrangements by 
which they were all living in the context of claims for benefits.  The mother was seen

from  time  to  time  throughout  the  documentary,  and  so  were  her  children,  and 
photographs of them all were widely published. 

The  events  covered  by  the  subsequent  trial  at  Nottingham  Crown  Court  attracted 
worldwide coverage and international interest.  The coverage included images of the 
mother, which remain widely available on the internet, and on websites outside the 
jurisdiction. 

Before the start of the trial, the Crown applied for and in accordance with s.23(1) of 
 
the  1999  Act  was  permitted  the  use  of  special  measures.    This  took  the  form  of 
protective  screens  when  the  mother  gave  evidence  in  court.    The  application  was 
based on a statement from the mother herself, updated in oral submissions about her 
fearful  state  of  mind.  She  was  content  to  give  her  evidence,  but  had  a  number  of 
concerns  about  the  hearing.  She  was  worried  that  her  physical  identity  would  be 
revealed  at  court.  She  had  already  taken  measures  to  avoid  any  risk  that  anyone 
connected to Philpott should know of her whereabouts or know what she looked like. 
 
She was now living with her children in a house in an unknown location.  She had 
changed their surnames and altered her appearance.  If she gave open evidence she 
was scared “that someone will either see me and then make efforts to locate me and 
 
follow me to where I live with my children”.  She said that she would tell the court 
the whole truth about the case, and continued that it would “be a lot easier if I cannot 
see Mick Philpott and he and his family and friends cannot see me”.  She had been 
offered  a  number  of  “special  measures”,  but  she  did  not  wish  to  give  evidence  or 
answer questions by video.  She wished to give evidence in court personally, but she 
would feel “much more comfortable and be able to give my evidence more freely” if 
 
she could be behind screens.  Hence the application, supported by the Crown. 

On 12 February 2013 an order made by Thirlwall J under s.4(2) of the Contempt of 
Court Act 1981 prohibited the publications of photographs of the mother or any of her 
five children until 5 March 2013.  At the end of the day, the judge was asked whether, 
in  the  light  of  her  order,  it  was  permissible  for  newspapers  or  broadcast  media  to 
publish  photographs  of  the  mother  and  her  children  that  evening,  and  in  any  event 
before she gave evidence.  The judge gave a short ruling underlining that her concern 
was the “integrity of the criminal trial”.  It was submitted to her by the Crown that any 
 
photographs  appearing  in  the  media  just  as  she  was  about  to  give  evidence  would 
undermine the entire purpose of the order for special measures which had been made. 
 
Thirlwall J did not accept the entire breadth of the submission, but she recognised that 
the purpose of the order enabling the mother to give evidence behind a screen was 
 
that she would be able to give it away from the public gaze, and that public focus on 
 
her and her children would undermine her ability to give evidence.  The judge noted 
that the publication of any such photographs would “torpedo her attempts not to be 
recognised, reinforcing her fears for herself and her children”.  She therefore made an 
order postponing publication of any photographs of Lisa Willis or her children, and 
further  ordered  that  any  photographs  that  had  already  been  published  during  the 
course of the hearing should be withdrawn.

11.	 

 
12.	 

The judge considered the impact of the order on the entitlement of the press to report 
court proceedings fairly and accurately.  She concluded that written and verbal reports 
 
were sufficient to represent the public interest, and she could see no public interest in 
the  publication  of  a  photograph  or  photographs  or  images  of  the  mother  or  her 
children.  In  any  event  if  photographs  of  the  mother  were  published  the  children 
would be immediately identified.  

On  13  February,  after  an  opportunity  to  consider  the  relevant  statutory  provisions 
 
overnight, Thirlwall J concluded that the order under s.4(2) of the Contempt of Court 
 
Act was, as she described it, “a rather clumsy and possibly erroneous route to preserve 
the  position”.    The  proper  route  was  via  s.46  of  the  Youth  Justice  and  Criminal 
Evidence  Act  1999.    She  was  satisfied  that  the  witness  was  eligible  for  protection 
within  the  context  of  the  Act,  and  that  the  quality  of  her  evidence  would  be 
diminished by reason of fear at being identified as a witness in the proceedings.  The 
order reflected the logical consequence of the attempts being made by the mother to 
rebuild  her  life  and  without  it,  all  her  efforts  would  come  to  nothing.    The  order 
 
should therefore be made in the interests of justice. 

 
13.	 

The order made on the previous day was revoked, and replaced by an order under s.46 
of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.  The order provided that: 

“(1) no photograph, pseudo photograph or other image of 

(a)  Lisa Willis 
(b) Her children or any of them (with or without Lisa Willis)  

 
 
Shall  be  published  in  any  way  which  connects  them  or  any  of  them 
 
(whether through reports of these proceedings or otherwise howsoever) to 
the case of R v Michael Philpott, Mairead Philpott and Paul Mosley”. 

The press and media were given liberty to apply for amendment or revocation of the 
order on 24 hours notice. 

Immediately after the order was made, the mother began her evidence.  So as to avoid 
any disruption of the trial, the media postponed their application for the revocation of 
the order until the end of the evidence, after closing speeches were underway.  The 
evidence of the mother was given in open court, and was widely reported throughout 
the media.  No one has suggested that the media was unable to report her evidence in 
meticulous  detail,  or  inhibited,  let  alone  prevented  from  doing  so,  by  Thirlwall  J’s 
order. 

On 3 April the media application for revocation of the order was heard and dismissed. 
 
In her judgment next day Thirlwall J made clear that she could not, and that she did 
not  believe  that  anyone  listening  to  the  case  would,  find  it  “easy  to  understand  the 
purpose” of publication of photographs or film of the mother and her children.  After 
considering submissions on behalf of the media and the Crown which in effect were 
 
repeated before us, she concluded that the jurisdiction to make the order prohibiting

15.

ITN News and Others - v - R 

 

publication of the photographs was based on or created by s.46 of the 1999 Act, and 
that notwithstanding that an internet search would produce images of the mother on 
websites outside the jurisdiction, the order should not be revoked.  She reflected on 
the Article 8 rights of the witness and the Article 10 rights of the press, without regard 
to the Article 8 rights to the children.  She concluded that there was not “the slightest 
doubt” that such publication would have “a very damaging effect” on the mother and 
her children. 

Section 46 of the 1999 Act 

 
16.	 

Every  court  in  England  and  Wales  conducting  criminal  proceedings  may  make  a 
reporting restriction order applicable to any adult who is a witness in the proceedings 
(other than a defendant).  The protection of child witnesses is ensured by s.39 of the 
Children and Young Persons Act 1933. 

 
17.	 

Section 46(6) defines a reporting direction as: 

“A direction that no matter relating to the witness shall during 
the  witness’s  life  time  be  included  in  any  publication  if  it  is 
 
likely to lead members of the public to identify him as being a 
 
witness in the proceedings.” 

 
18.	 

Publication  of  the  name  and  address  of  the  witness,  any  educational  establishment 
attended  by  the  witness,  the  identity  of  any  place  of  work,  and  “…(e)  any  still  or 
moving picture of the witness” 

may be prevented. 

 
19.	 

The order may only be made in support of a witness eligible for statutory protection. 
The “eligibility” requires the court to be satisfied: 

 

“3(a) that the quality of evidence given by the witness, … 

is likely to be diminished by reason of fear or distress on the 
part  of  the  witness  in  connection  with  being  identified  by 
members of the public as a witness in the proceedings”. 

 
20.	 

In deciding whether any particular witness qualifies for eligibility the court must: 

“(4) … take into account, in particular 

(a) the nature and alleged circumstances of the offence to which 
the proceedings relate; 

(b) the age of the witness;
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

ITN News and Others - v - R 

 

(c) such of the following matters as appear to the court to be 
relevant namely 

(i) the social and cultural background and ethnic origins of 
the witness 

(ii)  the  domestic  and  employment  circumstances  of  the 
witness, and 
 

(iii) … 

(d) any behaviour towards the witness on the part of 

(i) the accused, 

(ii) members of the family or associates of the accused, or 

(iii)” 

In  addition  to  these  specific  matters,  the  court  must  also  “consider  any  views 
expressed by the witness”. 

 
21.	 

Provided the witness is eligible for protection and that it is appropriate for a reporting 
direction to be made, before making the order, the court must consider: 

“(8) … 

(a) whether it would be in the interest of justice to do so, and 

(b)  the  public  interest  in  avoiding  the  imposition  of  a 
 
substantial and unreasonable restriction on the reporting of the 
proceedings”. 

 
22.	 

If the eligibility test is met, the court may also impose a reporting direction which is 
subject  to  “an  excepting”  directions,  dispensing  with  restrictions  which  might 
 
otherwise be thought appropriate.  Dealing with it broadly, the effect is that the court 
 
may limit the reporting direction, as it did here, to a photograph or film of the witness.  
In short the effect of any restriction should be limited to those which are reasonable 
bearing in mind the context of the public interest in the reporting of proceedings. 

 
23.	 

The reporting restriction may be revoked by the court of trial or an appellate court, 
that is “court dealing with an appeal … arising out of the proceedings …”. (s.46(12) 

The application 

 
24.	 

The  first  issue  is  to  identify  the  basis  on  which  Thirlwall  J’s  decision  may  be 
 
considered  by  this  court.  When  she  refused  to  revoke  the  restriction  decision,  the
--------

ITN News and Others - v - R 

 

main  submission  was  that  the  s.46  order  was  made  without  jurisdiction  and  that 
accordingly it should be revoked under s.46(10). There is no doubt that a reporting 
 
restriction  may  be  revoked  by  the  appellate  court  in  any  “proceedings”  before  this 
court.  However, the present application, of course, is confined to the restriction order.  
The court is not otherwise concerned with any proceedings between any of the three 
defendants at trial and the Crown, or indeed any issue arising from it. 

 
25.	 

Section 159(1)(a) and (b) of the 1988 Act enable an applicant to apply to this court for 
 
leave  against  a  reporting  restriction  order  made  in  relation  to  a  trial  or  indictment 
under s.4 or s.11 of the 1981 Act and s.58(7) and s.58(8) of the Criminal Procedure 
and Investigations Act 1996.  Section 159 goes on to provide that the application may 
also extend to: 

“… 

(b) any order restricting the access of the public to the whole or 
any part of a trial on indictment or to any proceedings ancillary 
to such a trial; and 

(c)  any  order  restricting  the  publication  of  any  report  of  the 
whole  or  any  part  of  the  trial  on  indictment  or  any  such 
ancillary proceedings …” 
 

 
26.	 

 
27.	 

These  provisions  are  designed  to  enable  the  media  or  any  member  of  the  public 
aggrieved by an order restricting access to a trial in the Crown Court to invite this 
 
court to interfere with, amend or revoke the order.  Given the importance attached to 
the principle that criminal justice should, so far as possible, be exercised in public, it 
 
should  therefore  be  given  the  widest  possible  construction.    In  our  judgment  a 
reporting restriction within s.46 of the 1999 Act falls within the ambit of S.159(1)(c) 
of the 1988 Act, and does so even when the restriction on reporting is confined, as this 
order was, to photographs or film.  If the order should not have been made, and in 
particular  if  there  was  no  jurisdiction  enabling  the  order  to  be  made,  it  should  be 
revoked whether or not any other proceedings are before this court. 

In the event of an appeal against conviction or sentence (or indeed a Reference by the 
Attorney General) then, in accordance with s.46(12) of the 1999 Act the jurisdiction 
of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  revoke  any  restriction  or  “excepting”  order  would  be 
immediately engaged without the need for further reference to s.159 of the 1988 Act. 
 
However  where  there  is  no  such  appeal,  but  the  media  remains  aggrieved  by  the 
restriction order, s.159 provides the route to a remedy.   

 
28.	 

The issues raised on behalf of the media merit attention in this court, and accordingly 
 
leave to appeal under s.159(1)(c) is granted.

The decision 
 

Stripped to essentials, the submission by Ms Heather Rogers QC is that the meaning 
given to reporting direction in s.46(6) did not extend to the order made by Thirlwall J, 
 
notwithstanding that the order itself was very limited in its scope, confined as it was 
to any photograph, pseudo photograph or other image of the mother and her children. 
 
Naturally enough, Ms Rogers began her submissions by underlining the importance of 
the principle of open justice.  We agree, and need no anxious repetition of the many 
statements  of  principle  to  demonstrate  the  reasons  why  we  do  agree.    Her  next 
submission  was  that  the  Crown  Court  had  no  powers  at  common  law  to  make  any 
such order.  The power to do so was contained in statute.  We agree.  She submitted 
that an order for special measures did not of itself justify the reporting direction, and 
that  the  reporting  direction  should  not  automatically  follow  any  special  measures 
order.  Again, we agree.  Section 46 provides a distinct power which may be exercised 
alongside  a  special  measures  direction,  but  also,  separately  from  it.    Eligibility  for 
such a reporting restriction does not automatically follow from the need for special 
measures.    It  requires  a  distinct  fact  finding  decision.    Yet  again,  we  agree.  She 
suggested that the protection of the children of the adult witness did not arise in the 
context  of  s.46.  These  were  issues  better  addressed,  and  more  important,  properly 
addressed, in family courts.  Dealing with it generally, we immediately recognise the 
force  of  the  submission  that  in  relation  to  the  identification  of  children  (taken 
 
separately from that of their parent) the Family Division is normally the appropriate 
venue. Nevertheless the criminal courts must control their own processes, and the fact 
that the family court may protect the identity of the children, is not sufficient on its 
own  to  deprive  the  Crown  Court  of  the  jurisdiction  under  s.46.  The  eligibility 
conditions may be established as here, where publication of the photographs of her 
children  would  be  likely  to  lead  to  the  identification  of  the  mother,  and  the  risks 
 
would  be  likely  to  impact  on  the  quality  of  the  mother’s  evidence  at  trial.    As  Mr 
 
David Farrer QC for the Crown observed, the order offered “reassurance to a witness 
 
to preserve the integrity of his or her evidence”.  In our view reference in the order to 
 
the children was integral to the eligibility test as it applied to their mother. 

The crucial difficulty is at the last stage of Ms Rogers’ submission.  She submitted 
that  the  mother  has  already  been  identified  by  previous  publications,  television 
programmes, and the internet.  Indeed the name of Lisa Willis, and her identification 
 
as  the  mother  of  children  of  whom  Philpott  is  the  father  is  effectively  common 
knowledge.  She gave her evidence as Lisa Willis.  In that sense she was and is fully 
 
identified as a witness. 

 

The difficulty with this submission arises from the reality that in the overwhelming 
 
majority of cases the “identity” of every witness is known.  If the jurisdiction to make 
 
an  s.46  order  were  restricted  in  the  way  suggested,  the  “eligibility”  test  would  be 
virtually confined to the rare case of the anonymous witness.  Anonymity, however, is 
an entirely distinct and extreme form of special measure for which a separate statutory 
 
system is in place.  Without repeating s.46(7) it seems clear that it extends beyond the 
bare naming, that is the identifying, of the witness.  Thus a still or moving picture of 
the witness may be prohibited if the “eligibility” test is satisfied, whether or not the 
name and identity of the witness is otherwise known.  This approach is reinforced by

analysis  of  the  wide  ranging  “excepting”  direction  in  s.46(9).  This  sub-section 
anticipates  that  the  ambit  of  the  reporting  restriction  may  be  much  wider  than  the 
mere naming of the witness.  It anticipates that the reporting restriction may impose 
substantial  restrictions  on  reporting  which, in  the  context  of  the  public  interest,  are 
unreasonable.  If Ms Rogers were right neither the provisions in s.46(7) nor those in 
s.46(9) would be necessary.  As it is they demonstrate that the ambit of the reporting 
direction  is  much  wider  than  she  suggested,  but  s.46(9)  also  underlines  that  even 
when  a  reporting  restriction  is  appropriate,  it  should  be  no  wider  than  necessary  to 
avoid any diminution in the quality of the evidence to be given by the witness.

Sentencing Remarks
th
14 May 2013
Mr Justice Nicol
You may remain seated for the time being
Stuart Hazell, You have pleaded guilty to the murder of Tia Sharp. Tia was 12 years old when she
died. She was the grandchild of Christine, your partner. You had known her for many years. Christine
says she idolised you. She was certainly happy to spend much time in your company and it was she
who asked to come and visit you on that Thursday in August of last year. She was a sparky girl who
was full of life, but you took that life from her. All that lay ahead of her — a career, loves and family of
her own — will new never be. And the loss of her has been devastating for her mother, her father and
all of her relatives and friends. The tragedy of their loss and her death is because of your act in
murdering Tia Sharp. You are responsible.
The scientists have not been able to say for certain how Tia died, but the likelihood is that she was
smothered or otherwise prevented from breathing.
There is only one sentence for murder. It is life imprisonment.
But the law requires me to fix the period which must pass before you are eligible for release on
licence, or to decide that you should never be released.
The latter kind of order is sometimes called a whole life tariff and may be made if the seriousness of
the murder is exceptionally high. One way that test can be met is if the murder is of a child and it
involved sexual motivation.
There is no doubt that you had developed a sexual interest in Tia. The records of your internet
searching on your mobile phone make abundantly clear that you were looking out for pornographic
pictures of pre—teen girls, which Tia was; pornographic pictures of girls who wore glasses, which Tia
did; even pictures involving incest. Tia was not your blood relation, but there was the bond between
you because of your relationship with Christine and, from time to time, you referred to yourself as
--------
Tia's grandfather. You took pictures of Tia while she was asleep. In other contexts, they would have
been of no interest, but your internet activity included searches for pornographic pictures of young
girls sleeping.
And then there was the photograph of the naked young girl with her bottom towards the camera.
Her face is not visible, but it must be Tia. She is lying on Tia's bed and for reasons which the
prosecution have explained and your counsel does not challenge, the picture must have been taken
early in the morning of Friday 3rd August. Blood can be seen on the genitalia and on the bed. Blood
was found on the bedding in Tia’s room and it was her blood. Semen was found on the bedding as
well. It was your semen. A dildo was found in the drawer of a bedside table in your room. It had Tia's
blood and Tia's DNA on it. Your counsel accepts that the only sensible conclusion which I can draw is
that there was sexual conduct of some kind between you and Tia at some point over the night 2""d
and S'd August.
But I have had to decide whether the murder of Tia involved sexual motivation. The prosecution say
that I can draw that conclusion, not only from the facts which I have mentioned but because of the
evidence that the photograph of Tia was taken after her death. Dr Fegan—Earl, who carried out the
post mortem on Tia, said that the mottling which can be seen on parts of the body in the picture was
highly suggestive of hypostasis, a condition which only arises after death. Dr Deborah Hodes, a
consultant paediatrician, agreed that the skin changes were compatible with changes one would
expect to see after death. The prosecution also point to the timing of the photograph, which was
some time after 6.26am on Friday 3rd August and several hours after Tia can be last seen to have
been used her mobile phone at 12.42am that day.
I think it is more likely than not that the doctors are right. However, in a criminal case that is not
good enough. The criminal standard of proof is applicable. I have to be sure. It is a truism that a
photograph is a product of light, camera quality and other matters. I cannot exclude the possibility
that the mottling on which the doctors rely is a product of these features, and possibly natural
colouration, rather than hypostasis. The interval since Tia last used her phone could be alternatively
explained by her simply being asleep.
In the photograph the anus and the vagina appear dilated. That can happen after death. It does not
necessarily represent sexual assault. When he examined Tia’s body, Dr Fegan—Earl found no tearing
or injuries in Tia’s anus, rectum or vagina. No semen was found in those areas. There was, therefore,
no pathological evidence that Tia had been sexually assaulted, but it could not excluded. The dildo,
with Tia's blood and DNA, points to another explanation for the condition of her body. So I cannot be
sure from these features either that the photograph was taken after Tia had died.
I come back to the question of whether I can be sure that sexual motivation was involved in Tia's
murder. I have decided that I cannot. Sexual activity and conduct took place not long before her
death, but in order for sexual motivation to be involved in her murder, there would need to be a
closer connection than that. Shame and fear of what might happen if Tia talked are just two of the
alternative possible motives behind her killing.
Sol have concluded that this is not a case where a whole life tariff should be imposed.
But this is plainly a murder which involved sexual conduct. Its seriousness, therefore, is particularly
high. That means the starting point for calculating the minimum term is 30 years.
The minimum term which I will impose should not be confused with a determinate sentence of the
same length. Because a determinate prisoner is released at the halfway point in his sentence, a life
sentence with a minimum term is the equivalent of a determinate sentence of double that length. So
Page 2 of4
--------
for instance, a 30 year minimum term is the equivalent of a determinate sentence of 60 years. And
there are two further important differences. A determinate prisoner knows that he will be released
at the halfway point. Someone sentenced to life imprisonment, as you will be, will have no
guarantee of release once the minimum term has passed. It will be for the Parole Board at that stage
to say if it will be safe for you to be set free. And even then, freedom will be relative. You will remain
on licence for the rest of your life. If you commit another offence or otherwise breach your licence,
you may be re—detained.
But 30 years is just the starting point. I have to consider as well the aggravating and mitigating
circumstances. Here the aggravating features are notable and serious. I have already commented on
Tia's age. It is an aggravating feature that your victim was so young. So, too, is your gross abuse of
trust. Tia’s mother allowed her to come and stay with you because she trusted you to look after her.
Christine was at work that night. She trusted you to look after her. By first sexually assaulting and
then killing Tia you betrayed that trust in the most grievous way possible. And that breach of trust
reverberates still. Tia's mother has spoken of how she now finds it hard to trust other people in many
other ways. I have said that I cannot be sure that the photograph of Tia was taken after her death,
but, whenever the picture was taken, it shows that, beyond the sexual assault itself, you further
degraded that young girl by photographing her in such a dreadful position.
And then there was the concealment ofTia’s body in the loft of your house. Because of this her
family had to suffer the agony of uncertainty as to what had happened to her. And time after time,
you spun the wholly false story that Tia had left home on the Friday morning and just disappeared.
You have a number of previous convictions. They include supplying cocaine for which you were sent
to prison for 34 months in 2003 and possessing a machete for which you were sent to prison for a
year in 2010. I accept, though, that none of the convictions was for a sexual offence. You have a
caution for causing grievous bodily harm in 2006. lam told that was for punching someone in the
street. I accept that none of your convictions were for serious violence.
In mitigation, you had an unhappy childhood. You had very little contact with your mother and you
were placed in care when you were very young. You have a psychiatric history of depression, self—
harm and suicide attempts. A consultant psychiatrist considers that you fulfil the criteria for
Unsocialised Conduct Disorder. Your poor coping strategies led you to drugs and alcohol. None of
these matters is an excuse for what you did to Tia, but they are matters which I can, and do, take into
account in fixing the minimum term. I accept as well that there is no evidence that Tia’s murder was
premeditated.
There is finally your plea of guilty. It has come very late: on day five of the trial and the day before
the prosecution was due to close its case. Your counsel says that you wished to avoid causing further
distress to Tia's family. That is very commendable, but they have had to endure 4 days of a very
public trial. Although much of the evidence has been by way of Agreed Facts and statements which
could be read to the jury, the prosecution had to deal with the account of Tia’s death which you gave
to prison officers and your father — a wholly fictitious account of Tia falling down stairs and dying as a
result of an accident. And so it was necessary for the prosecution to lay out for thejury your sexual
interest in Tia and for thejury to see the photograph of Tia naked. Your plea of guilty has spared the
family none of that. It may be the first act of remorse, as your counsel says, but, because it comes so
late, lam afraid it will earn you only the most modest of credit.
I have taken account of all these circumstances in reaching a final view on the appropriate minimum
term.

From that minimum term, the time you have spent on remand will be deducted. lam told it is 272
days, but if that is wrong it can be corrected administratively.
Stuart Hazell stand up
For the murder of Tia Sharp you are sentenced to life imprisonment. The minimum term will be 38
years.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE WILKIE 

 
 
Introduction 
 
 
 
On 1st March 2013 at a Plea and Case Management Hearing (PCMH) each of 
1. 
 
the  four  defendants,  Zahid  Iqbal,  Mohammed  Sharfaraz  Ahmed,  Umar  Arshad  and 
 
Syed  Farhan  Hussain,  pleaded  guilty  to  Count  1  of  a  14  count  indictment.  Count  1 
 
charged each of them with engaging in conduct  in preparation for acts of terrorism 
contrary  to  Section  5(1)  of  the  Terrorism  Act  2006.  The  particulars  of  the  offence 
were that : 
 

 

“On divers days between 1st January 2011 and 25th April 2012 (each of the 
defendants) with the intention of committing acts of terrorism or assisting 
 
others  to  commit  such  acts,  engaged  in  conduct  in  preparation  for  giving 
effect to that intention, namely 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

(i) 
 
(ii) 
 

 facilitating, planning and encouraging travel overseas  

organising, encouraging and participating in physical training 

(iii) 
 

purchasing survival equipment  

(iv) 
 
 

downloading, researching and discussing electronic files 
containing practical instruction for a terrorist attack 

 

(v) 
 

discussing methods materials and targets for a terrorist attack 
including firearms and improvised explosive devices 

 

 

collecting and supplying funds for terrorist purposes overseas 
 

(vi) 

 
 
contrary to Section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006.” 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

1
--------
The  facts  comprising  counts  2-14  have  been  subsumed  within  the  

 
2. 
The remaining 13 counts on the indictment charge the individual defendants 
 
with  possession  of  information  contrary  to  Section  58(1)(b)  of  the  Terrorism  Act 
2000. Iqbal faced 2 such counts, Ahmed faced 3, Arshad faced 4 and Hussain faced 4. 
Each  of  these  13  counts  were  said  to  have  been  committed  on  2  September  2011,  a  
 
date when the defendants’ home premises were searched but on which date none of 
 
them were arrested; their arrests not occurring until 24th April 2012. 
 
 
3. 
 
Prosecution’s  opening  in  respect  of  count  1  and  my  sentence  in  respect  of  count  1 
takes  full  account  of  the  facts  underpinning  counts  2-14,  notwithstanding  the  fact 
 
that  no  formal  plea  of  guilty  has  been  entered  in  respect  of  any  of  them.  In  those  
 
circumstances, those counts will lie on the file on the usual terms. 
 
 
 
4. 
The  pleas  of  guilty  were  entered  following  applications  by  each  of  the  
 
defendants  for  a  Goodyear  indication  which  I  heard  on  1st  March  2013.  Those 
 
applications were supported by the prosecution which indicated that, in its view, this 
was  an  appropriate  case  for  a  Goodyear  indication  to  be  given.  In  the  event  I  did 
 
not give a full Goodyear indication but I did indicate the approach I would take, as 
a  matter  of  principle,  to  sentencing  the  individual  defendants.  I  also  indicated  the 
areas  upon  which  I  would  require  further  information  and  upon  which  I  should  be 
 
addressed both by the prosecution and the defence when considering sentence. As an 
 
aid to that process I have received pre-sentence reports on Iqbal and Ahmed; neither 
of the other defendants requested a pre-sentence report. 
 
 
5. 
Each of the pleas of guilty was entered on the basis of a written basis of plea 
which have not been contested by the Crown, but the Crown reserved its right to open 
 
the case fully which it has. I will return to those written bases of plea in due course. 
 
 
6. 
In  addition  to  the  length  of  the  sentences,  I  have  to  address  the  following 
specific  issues.  In  relation  to  Iqbal  and  Ahmed  I  have  to  consider  the  question  of 
 
dangerousness, as well as the appropriate form of sentence in the event that I were to 
 
conclude that either of them was dangerous in the statutory sense. The Crown, on 1st 
 
March,  did  not  seek  to  persuade  me  that  this  was  a  case  which,  in  the  event  of  a 
finding  of  dangerousness,  would  call  for  a  life  sentence.  As  the  law  is  presently 
 
constructed,  therefore,  if  I  were  to  find  either  of  them  dangerous,  I  would  have  to 
 
consider whether to impose a determinate sentence or an extended sentence. In the 
cases of Arshad and Hussain, having heard argument, I concluded, for reasons I will 
 
give  in  due  course,  that  in  neither  case  was  dangerousness  established  and, 
 
accordingly, in their cases, I will be passing determinate sentences. 
   
 
 
7. 
I also have to consider the question of the appropriate discount for a plea of 
 
guilty entered at the PCMH on 1 March 2013 having regard to the definitive guideline 
 
issued  by  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  in  July  2007,  and  a  recent  guideline 
case, Caley and others [2012] EWCA Crim 2821. 
 
 
 
The Prosecution Case summarised. 
 
 
 
8. 
The  defendants,  at  the  time  covered  by  the  indictment,  were  like  minded 
individuals each living in Luton. Individual defendants interacted with certain of the 
others in circumstances which amounted to the commission of the Section 5 offence. 
Their admitted terrorist activities had a number of facets reflected in the particulars 
of the offence. Each of them was of previous good character.

Facilitating, planning and encouraging travel overseas 
 
 
 
9. 
Iqbal  had  a  contact  in  Pakistan  who  was  thought  to  have  contact  with 
 
insurgents on the border with Afghanistan. He was used as a contact for the purpose 
of  assisting  Iqbal  in  placing  Ahmed  for  terrorist  training.  Iqbal  was  repeatedly  in 
contact with that person by phone. He arranged with that contact for Ahmed to travel 
to Pakistan for the purposes of obtaining terrorist training. Though, to some extent, 
sceptical  whether  Ahmed  would  be  accepted  for  training  in  Pakistan  at  that  time, 
 
Iqbal nonetheless discussed it with Ahmed and provided him with advice on how he 
 
might  successfully  travel  to  Pakistan  for  that  purpose  and  to  make  contact  with 
Iqbal’s contact in Pakistan in such a way as to avoid detection by the authorities. 
 
 
That plan was carried into effect; Ahmed travelled to Pakistan on 9th March 
10. 
2011 booked to return on the 25 March but in fact returned, earlier than expected, on 
 
the 15th March 2011. 
 
 
Arshad  provided  assistance  to  Ahmed  in  his  preparations  for  that  trip  by 
11. 
 
providing  Pakistani  sim  cards,  one  of  which  Ahmed  used  to  be  in  touch  with  Iqbal  
 
and  Arshad  whilst  in  Pakistan.  Arshad  also  coached  him  with  a  cover  story  and 
 
provided verbal encouragement. Arshad was aware that Ahmed was carrying money 
 
for the purposes of terrorism and gave him £100 for that purpose. He told him to be 
brave and to go and not return. Both Iqbal and Arshad had telephone communication 
 
with Ahmed whilst he was in Pakistan. 
 
 
12. 
Iqbal  and  Ahmed  discussed  the  practicalities  of  Ahmed’s  travel  to  Pakistan 
 
 
for  terrorist  purposes  in  detail,  in  particular,  how  to  ensure  that  his  travel  for  that 
 
purpose  could  be  successfully  achieved  without  drawing  attention  of  the  security 
 
services  or  even  his  family.  Iqbal  also  discussed  with  his  Pakistani  contact  the 
arrangements  for  Ahmed’s  travel  to  Pakistan  and  his  reception  in  Pakistan  for  the 
purposes of terrorist training. 
 
 
13. 
The level of detail of these discussions included what Ahmed should wear and 
 
pack  for  his  trip  and  what  telephone  numbers  they  would  use  during  the  period  he 
 
was  in  Pakistan.  Iqbal  also  provided  Ahmed  with  £850  to  be  passed  on  for  use  for 
terrorist purposes.  
 
 
The  foreshortening  of  the  trip  was  said  by  Ahmed  to  be  due  to  his  lack  of 
14. 
 
facility in Pashtu and Arabic as well as the enhanced security situation in that part of 
 
Pakistan. 
 
 
 
15. 
Iqbal  himself  planned  to  travel  to  Pakistan  for  terrorist  purposes.  He 
discussed  it  with  Ahmed.  He  had  close  to  £10,000  to  give  to  the  insurgents.  They 
 
discussed  the  logistics  of  his  travelling  with  his  family.  They  discussed  the  physical 
and  weapons  training  in  the  mountains  which  he  would  hope  to  receive  and  they 
spoke of him taking some £1,000 to give to the terrorists. They discussed how best he 
might assist the terrorist cause in conjunction with those in Pakistan.  Arrangements 
 
had been made for him to travel to Pakistan on 4th September and for his wife and 
child to travel there as well. 
 
 
16. 
Ahmed  and  Iqbal  also  discussed  the  possibility  of  Hussain  travelling  in  the 
cause  of  Jihad.  Ahmed  discussed  several  times  with  Hussain  the  desirability  of  his 
travelling  abroad  for  terrorist  training  and,  thereafter,  participation  in  fighting 
though the discussions never got beyond the aspirational stage. However Ahmed was 
 
encouraging  of  Hussain’s  aspiration  to  travel  and  obtain  military  training.  On  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
Iqbal  claimed  to  have  joined  a  gym  in  March  2011  and  he  and  Ahmed 

occasion  in  June  2011  Ahmed  and  Iqbal  discussed  facilitating  Hussain’s  travel 
 
overseas. Hussain was believed to have some £15,000 available to contribute to the 
terrorist cause overseas and was awaiting a call to leave home. 
 
 
Thereafter  Ahmed  and  Hussain  continued  to  discuss  Hussain’s  going  to 
17. 
 
Pakistan  or  the  Yemen  for  training  purposes  though,  again,  not  beyond  the 
aspirational stage.   
 
 
Physical training 
 
 
 
18. 
Ahmed,  on  numerous  occasions,  attended  a  gym  for  training  and  went  on 
 
trips  to  mountainous  regions  with  a  view  to  becoming  physically  fit  for  purposes 
 
connected with terrorism. Snowdon was favoured as it bore most resemblance to the 
 
mountainous  regions  of  Pakistan.  He  was  instrumental  in  encouraging  and 
transporting  others  to  undertake  such  outdoor  military  style  physical  training. 
Ahmed  went  to  Snowdonia  shortly  before  he  left  for  Pakistan  in  March  and  on  a 
 
number of occasions throughout April and July. Arshad was with Ahmed on some of 
these trips and Hussain was with him on one of them. 
 
 
19. 
discussed training for military purposes, so too did Ahmed and Hussain. 
 
20.  When  Arshad’s  home  address  was  searched  he  had  a  typed  list  of  items  to 
take  on  a  trip  and  had  received  parcels  from  companies  providing  outdoor 
equipment. 
 
 
Discussing electronic files containing practical instructions and guidance 
for terrorist attacks 
 
 
 
21. 
Each  of  the  defendants  had  access  to  and  did  access  many  documents 
espousing  violent  jihad  as  an  essential  part  of  the  obligation  of  a  fundamental 
 
Islamist.  Included  in  those  documents  which  each  of  them  downloaded  was  a 
 
publication  known  as  Inspire,  a  periodical  magazine  produced  by  Al  Quaeda  from 
2010. This is a magazine one of whose purposes is to inspire fundamentalist Islamists 
to  undertake  activities,  including  terrorist  activities,  in  their  own  countries  and,  in 
certain  articles,  provides  practical  instruction  and  guidance.  This  constituted,  and 
 
was recognised by Iqbal and Ahmed as constituting, a change  of direction enabling 
people such as themselves to take terrorist action in their home country without the 
 
need  to  travel  abroad  and  attend  training  camps  before  embarking  on  domestic 
 
terrorist activities.. 
 
 
 
22. 
Iqbal  and  Ahmed  were  in  discussions  on  two  recorded  occasions,  taking 
 
direction  from  Inspire,  in  relation  to  assembling  and  deploying  one  or  more 
 
improvised  explosive  devices.  They  discussed  a  particular  article  describing 
 
assembling  an  IED  from  readily  available  items  and  ingredients.  They  spoke  of 
modifying  what  was  described  in  the  article  with  a  view  to  attacking  a  potential 
 
target,  a  Territorial  Army  centre  in  Luton.  Those  discussions  occurred  in  April  and 
 
May  2011.  The  evidence  available  to  the  prosecution  is  that  the  device  described  in 
that Inspire article is viable, though with the modifications discussed it would not be. 
 
This  was  a  detailed  and  serious  discussion  even  though  it  did  not  get  beyond  that 
stage. 
 
 
On 2nd September 2011, when each of their homes was raided and searched, 
 
23. 
the  items  covered  by  counts  2-14  were  found,  for  the  most  part  downloaded  onto 
various  computers  at  their  home  addresses.  The  nature  of  the  publications,

--------
In  April  2011  Ahmed  had  a  conversation  about  acquisition  of  firearms  and 
 

particularly  the  Inspire  magazines,  illustrate  the  degree  to  which  each  of  them 
exposed themselves to fundamentalist beliefs, including the desirability of advancing 
 
those  beliefs  by  terrorist  activities,  including  home  grown  terrorist  activities  as 
advocated by Inspire. 
 
 
Discussing procurement of firearms. 
 
 
 
24. 
During  February  2011  Iqbal  was  discussing  acquiring  firearms  and 
ammunition, in veiled terms on the phone, and, on the 21st  February, he met a third 
party at which meeting they discussed more explicitly the procurement of a firearm 
with ammunition and referred in those conversations to articles in Inspire. 
 
 
25. 
ammunition with 2 other people in his car. 
 
 
26. 
In addition, in May 2011, Ahmed was discussing the possibility of obtaining 
firearms  in  conversation  with  Hussain.   Ahmed  was  minded  to  buy  a  gun  and 
Hussain  was  putting  forward  possible  sources  of  which  he  was  aware.  These 
discussions preceded a meeting on the 25th May 2011 between Ahmed and two other 
 
males  in  his  car  in  which  the  purchase  of  a  firearm  was  discussed,  as  well  as 
ammunition and associated equipment. 
 
 
27. 
There is no evidence that any of these expressed intentions ever got beyond 
 
the  discussion  stage  but  they  were  serious  conversations  about  possible  courses  of 
 
action. 
 
 
Collecting and Supplying funds 
 
 
On 2nd September 2011, £13,400 was seized from Iqbal’s home address. The 
28. 
prosecution say, and it is not disputed, that this cash was to be used in whole or in 
part for purposes connected with terrorism. 
 
 
On  the  same  date  £2,500  in  cash  was  found  in  Ahmed’s  bedroom;  the 
29. 
prosecution  say  that  based  on  the  probe  material,  this  was  money  which  had  been 
 
collected by him for the purposes of contributing to terrorist funds. This is disputed 
 
by Ahmed. In light of his acceptance that he had taken just under £1000 to Pakistan 
 
to fund terrorism I do not have to resolve this issue at this stage. 
 
 
 
30. 
From  the  probe  material  the  prosecution  say  that  Arshad  was  engaged  in 
 
sending money to Pakistan for use for terrorist purposes and that Hussain intended 
to  collect  funds  to  provide  for  terrorist  purposes.  He  hoped  it  would  give  him 
credibility in his aspiration to travel abroad for terrorist training.  
 
 
31. 
The prosecution also point out that many different mobile phones were found 
at  their  addresses  showing  significant  contact  between  each  of  them  and  certain  of 
 
the  others.  In  particular,  Iqbal  used  a  particular  phone  to  contact  his  contact  in 
 
Pakistan and to contact Ahmed when he was there and the phone used by Ahmed in 
 
Pakistan  to  contact  that  person  and  to  contact  Iqbal  and  Arshad  was  the  sim  card 
 
provided  by  Arshad.  Iqbal  had  Cyberscrub  software  which  is  a  security  device 
enabling data to be deleted from a computer and reducing the possibility of its being 
recovered

including  the 

The Defendants 
 
 
 
32. 
Each of the defendants is of previous good character. Iqbal was 29 years old, 
 
now 31 and has a wife and family. Ahmed is 25 years old of previous good character, 
 
he is now married. He lived at home with his family. Arshad is 24 years old, he too 
lived at home. He is married with a young child. Hussain is 21 years old and lived at 
 
home.  
 
 
Although the homes of each of the defendants was searched in their presence 
33. 
 
on  the  2nd  September  2011  none  of  them  was  arrested  on  that  date.  They  were 
 
arrested on the 24th April 2012 on which occasion their homes were searched again. 
 
 
 
At  Iqbal’s  home,  further  relevant  material  was  recovered  on  24  April, 
34. 
 
including “39 ways to support Jihad” which had been downloaded since September 
 
2011.  There  were  concealed  Press  cuttings  relating  to  drone  attacks  in  Waziristan. 
 
Additional mobile phones were seized, the number for one of which was stored in one 
 
of Ahmed’s phones. In addition, a DVD for an Arab language course, a rucksack, the 
 
contents of which included a GPS Navigator, torches and a compass were seized on 
 
that occasion. 
 
 
When Ahmed’s home was searched again on 24th April, on his computer was 
35. 
 
found  a  complete  set  of  Inspire  magazines 
latest  which 
commemorated  the  10th  anniversary  of  the  9/11  attacks.  All  of  these  had  been 
downloaded since the searches in September 2011. In addition, from another car not 
 
searched before, additional survival equipment, including a head torch, and maps of 
 
Snowdonia, was recovered.  
 
 
Arshad’s home was further searched on the 24th April 2012 as was Hussain’s.

In  neither  of  their  houses  was  anything  found  upon  which  the  prosecution  rely  in

The written bases of plea and mitigation 
 
Zahid Iqbal 
 
 
37. 
Iqbal  accepts  he  is  an  Islamist  who  sympathised  with  the  insurgency  in 
 
Afghanistan. He knew his contact, but not well. He believed him to have contacts with 
 
insurgents in the border area of Pakistan/Afghanistan. He lost contact with him after 
 
Ahmed’s  return  in  March  2011. He  relies  on  the  decision  of  the  police  not  to  arrest 
 
him  between  September  and  April  as  reflecting  their  view  of  his  lack  of  imminent  
 
dangerousness.   
 
 
38. 
His  terrorist  intent  was  generalised,  ill  formed  and  never  settled.  His 
discussions were embryonic. Although he contemplated the possibility of committing 
an act of terrorism in the UK, he did not form a specific intent to do so. He was most 
 
likely to have travelled abroad. 
 
 
 
39. 
He  assisted  Ahmed  to  travel  to  Pakistan  in  March  2011.  He  discussed 
 
methods  of  avoiding  detection  He  put  him  in  touch  with  his  contact  in  Pakistan  by 
 
providing a contact number and arranging by telephone for them to meet in Pakistan. 
 
He was unclear whether his contact would be able to use Ahmed and thought it was 
 
likely  he  would  not  and  would  be  sent  home.  He  played  no  role  in  planning  or 
organising his travel arrangements.

--------
He  accepts  downloading,  researching  and  discussing  electronic  files 

 
40. 
containing practical instructions for terrorist attacks.  
 
 
 
41. 
He  accepts  discussing  methods,  materials  and  targets  for  a  terrorist  attack 
including  the  possibility  of  constructing  an  improvised  explosive  device  (IED).  He 
 
accepts  he  made  enquiries  with  a  friend  from  London  about  the  feasibility  of 
 
purchasing  a  firearm,  but  that  contact  discouraged  him  and  he  ceased  the  enquiry. 
He had no plans about what to do with a gun if he had managed to obtain one and 
never  did  acquire  a  firearm.  He  last  discussed  it  on  the  21st  February  2011.  He  did 
consider  the  possibility  of  constructing  an  IED  and  looked  at  and  discussed  the 
method  described  in  Inspire,  but  he  did  not  pursue  it  beyond  consideration.  No 
 
materials  were  obtained.  He  accepts  that  his  intention  was  to  travel  to  Pakistan  in 
 
early September with his wife and child. He accepts he gave £850 to Ahmed to pass 
 
on  to  his  Pakistani  contact  and  that  he  had  saved  and  collected  approximately 
 
£10,000  by  September  2011  which  he  intended  to  take  to  Pakistan.  His  Counsel  in 
 
oral argument on 1 March 2013 conceded that to some extent that was to be used for 
 
terrorist purposes. 
 
 
42. 
By way of mitigation, he is now 31, of previous good character is married with 
2 young children and was employed prior to his arrest. He has been in custody since 
24th April 2012. It is said in mitigation, and accepted by the crown, that there is no 
 
evidence of further contemplation of terrorist action in the UK or abroad since the 2nd 
 
September 2011, though I must consider this assertion, and its impact on the issue of 
dangerousness, in the light of what was found at his home on 24 April 2012 and what 
 
it may show about the continuation of the mindset which informed the activities to 
 
which he has pleaded guilty. He says there is no distinction to be drawn between his 
 
role and that of Ahmed. He did not know Hussain and had never met him, nor did he 
 
have any telephone or internet contact with him. He only briefly met Arshad on one 
 
or two occasions and had no telephone or internet contact with him. 
 
 
43. 
The  pre  sentence  report  records  him  as  claiming  that,  even  before  the 
September police raid, he was having misgivings about his activities. However it also 
 
states that it is difficult to believe the picture he paints of a naïve person unaware that 
 
his  activities  were  illegal  given  the  amount  of  equipment  including  cyberscub 
 
software, and numerous mobile phones in different names. 
 
 
In mitigation his counsel argued that this was a case about conversations he 
44. 
had had which never remotely came to fruition and that the extent to which there was 
 
action on his part was limited. At no stag, in respect of discussions about activity in 
 
the  UK,  was  there  any  plan  and  nothing  which  caused  the  authorities  to  intervene 
because  they  believed  a  terrorist  act  was  imminent,  such  as  occurred  in  the  case  of 
 
Chowdhury and others to which I will return. 
 
Mohammed Ahmed 
 
 
45. 
He  is  of  previous  good  character  and  is  now  married.  He  accepts  that, 
between the 1st January and 2nd September 2011, he sought to travel to Pakistan for 
 
military  training  and  sought  to  achieve  physical  fitness  and  to  acquire  outdoor 
 
survival  equipment  to  take  with  him  to  Pakistan.  He  travelled  to  Pakistan  but  was 
 
rejected for training and returned within 4 days. He provided under £1,000 to those 
purporting  to  offer  training;  those  funds  to  be  deployed  for  a  terrorist  purpose 
overseas. On his return he maintained an aspiration to travel to Pakistan for training 
 
but was unsuccessful. He sought to travel to other countries to learn Arabic, again he 
was unsuccessful. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7
--------
On  12th  May  he  discussed  obtaining  firearms.  That  was  a  highly  speculative 
46. 
discussion. On the 25th  May he had another discussion about sourcing a firearm. The 
 
context  is  said  to  have  been  an  escalation  of  violence  between  Muslim  groups  in  
 
Luton. Thereafter he neither obtained nor attempted to obtain a firearm. 
 
 
 
On  22nd  April  2011  he  discussed  the  possibility  of  engaging  in  a  terrorist 
47. 
action in the UK. That was in the context of having read Inspire. It was speculative 
and no plans were formed and he did not form a specific intent to do so. His focus 
between  January  and  September  2011  was  to  seek  to  travel  abroad,  to  learn  Arabic 
 
and to reach a facility in Pakistan which would provide him with military training.  
 
 
48. 
He also accepts that he encouraged Hussain to travel to Pakistan in general 
terms.  He  was  involved  in  the  organisation  of,  and  participated  in,  mountain  walks 
and  physical  exercise  with  others,  one  of  the  purposes  of  which  was  to  prepare 
 
himself for the rigours of a training camp. He purchased survival equipment for use 
in  Pakistan  as  well  as  for  exercising  in  the  UK.  He  downloaded  and  read  Inspire, 
 
principally  to  access  the  ideological  content,  but  made  no  attempt  to  construct  the 
IED depicted in the magazine. He accepts that he discussed firearms and an IED in 
 
the way already described. He also received funds from others and provided funds to 
those whom he believed were engaged in terrorist activities overseas.  
 
 
He says that in the period following the 2nd September there is no evidence 
49. 
 
that he pursued any ambition to leave the  UK for training, a contention with which 
the prosecution does not take issue. He married a woman chosen by his family and 
 
says that he withdrew from the conduct the subject of the indictment. He remained at 
home with his family caring for his father, who is physically unwell, his mother and 
his older brother. who suffer from mental illness. He too relies on the fact that he was 
 
at large between September 2011 and April 2012 as reflecting the authorities’ view of 
 
his imminent dangerousness. 
 
  
 
50. 
The  pre  sentence  report  expresses  the  view  that  in  his  conversations  with 
others  he  exaggerated  the  extent  of  his  experiences  in  Pakistan,  and  what  he  was 
 
willing to undertake to boost his image with his peers. 
 
 
51. 
He claims that, after the raid in September, he was distancing himself from 
 
radical  Islamist  ideology  though  he  accepts  that  he  bought  a  new  computer  and 
downloaded an Islamist torrent.  He too presents a picture of someone who was naïve 
 
about  what  he  could  and  could  not  legally  read.  As  in  the  case  of  Iqbal,  I  must  
 
consider  what  the  outcome  of  the  search  on  24th  April  evidences  about  the 
continuation or otherwise of the mindset which informed his offending. 
  
 
52. 
His counsel has emphasised that his basis of plea reflects the evidence that, 
 
as far as terrorism in the UK is concerned, none of his discussions came to anything 
 
and  could  not  properly  be  described  as  attack  planning  He  relies  on  a  letter  of 
 
support from his elder sister who describes him as being sorry about how his actions 
 
have  affected  his  family  and  that  he  has  moved  on  from  his  involvement  with 
terrorism. He also relies on the assessment of the authors of the pre sentence report 
 
that  “he  has  naturally  disengaged  from  radical  Islamist  ideology  independently. 
 
There does not appear to be any current attachment to violent jihad or desire to be 
 
involved with further extreme preachers’ or views” and that this reflects a reduction 
 
in risk.

Umar Arshad  
 
 
 
53. 
He  became  aware  that  Ahmed  intended  to  travel  to  Pakistan  for  military 
 
training  only  shortly  before  his  departure.  He  was  aware  that  Ahmed  had  gone  to 
Pakistan  and  had  come  back  shortly  afterwards.  He  provided  Ahmed  with  limited 
 
practical  assistance,  the  provision  of  sim  cards  and  advice  about  preparation  of  a 
 
cover story and how to blend in when in Pakistan. The sim cards were left over from 
his trip to Pakistan the previous year for his marriage. That assistance was limited to 
the 8th and 9th March. 
 
 
54. 
He  participated  in  physical  training  and  undertook  a  number  of  trips  with 
Ahmed and others to Snowdonia and elsewhere. He had no intention of travelling to 
 
Pakistan.  He  downloaded  a  number  of  electronic  editions  of  Inspire  principally  for 
 
their ideological content but accepts that some editions contained information likely 
 
to be useful for a person preparing an act of terrorism. He was aware in general terms 
of the nature of their contents. He provided £100 to Ahmed before Ahmed’s trip to 
Pakistan;  those  funds  were  to  be  passed  on  to  others  to  be  deployed  for  terrorist 
 
purposes  overseas.    He  never  engaged  in  discussions  about  the  construction  or 
deployment of an IED in the UK or about the procurement of firearms. 
 
 
 
He is a man of previous good character with a young family. His brother Raja 
55. 
Imran Shehzad has written a letter in support of his younger brother in which he has 
 
described  the  impact  of  his  actions  upon  the  rest  of  his  family  and  his  remorse  for 
 
having  brought  this  upon  them.  His  counsel  has  relied  on  the  fact  that  some  of  his  
actions  are  concentrated  on  a  few  days,  immediately  before  March  9th,  and  in  mid 
 
August  when  the  files  were  downloaded  on  to  his  computer.  He  also  suggests  that 
when he went on the training sessions it was with his friend Ahmed and in support of 
 
Ahmed’s  terrorist  ambitions  rather  evidencing  any  intention  of  his  to  train  to  be  a 
 
terrorist. 
 
Syed Hussain 
  
 
 
He  accepts  that  between  mid-  May  and  early  July  2011  he  discussed  with 
56. 
 
Ahmed,  and  was  encouraged  by  him,  in  general  terms,  to  travel  to  Pakistan  for 
 
training. He expressed a desire to travel for this purpose but did not make any plans 
 
to do so. He accepts that on the 14th July 2011 he went on a walking trip to Snowdonia 
with  Ahmed  and  others.  One  of  the  purposes  was  preparation  for  training  in 
Pakistan. 
 
 
57. 
He accepts that he downloaded electronic editions of Inspire to access their 
ideological content but he was aware that they also included information likely to be 
 
useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. He did not have any 
 
discussions about IEDs nor was he aware that others had engaged in such discussion. 
He  accepts  that  on  the  12th  and  25th  May  he  had  discussions  with  Ahmed  about 
 
sourcing a firearm but he never obtained or attempted to obtain a firearm and never 
 
formed  a  specific  intent  to  commit  an  act  of  terrorism.  Although  he  intended  to 
 
provide  funds  to  others  which  he  believed  would  be  sent  to  those  engaged  in  
 
terrorism in Pakistan, he did not in fact do so. 
 
 
58. 
His counsel relies on a letter of support from his father which describes the 
 
family’s  shock  at  his  son’s  activities  and  the  hardships  and  upset  he  has  caused  for 
 
which his son has repeatedly expressed his remorse. As a family they will support him 
through the sentence which he must serve. His counsel draws attention to the doubts 
 
and  fears  he  expressed  even  when  expressing  a  desire  to  travel  to  obtain  terrorist

training.  His  offer  to  source  a  firearm  for  Ahmed  was  not  acted  on  nor  was  his 
 
accepted intention to provide funds to support terrorism abroad.  
 
 
Discount for plea of guilty at the PCMH 
 
 
 
59. 
The  history  of  these  proceedings  is  not  straightforward.  Each  of  the 
defendants  was  arrested  on  the  24th  April  2011  and  interviewed  on  a  number  of 
 
occasions  between  then  and  the  29th  April.  Iqbal,  Ahmed  and  Arshad  made  no 
 
comment at all throughout those interviews; Hussain largely made no comment but 
confirmed he was shown in surveillance photographs and denied having seen a USB 
stick seized from his address. 
 
 
 
There was a preliminary hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court on the 11th May 
60. 
2012.  Mr  Justice  Fulford,  on  the  31st  May  2012,  allowed  Ahmed  to  change  his 
 
solicitors  and,  thereafter,  his  representation  by  counsel  and  solicitors  has  remained 
 
the same. 
 
 
61. 
Iqbal  has  been  represented  throughout  by  the  same  leading  and  junior 
counsel and by the same solicitors. On 3/4th October 2012 an application was made 
 
by him to change his solicitors but that was refused. 
 
 
Arshad  and  Hussain  applied  on  the  3/4th    October  2012  to  change  both 
62. 
counsel and solicitors. By that date there had been 88 visits by solicitors, 600 hours 
 
of  preparation  had  been  conducted.  Arshad  had  had  3  consultations  with  leading 
 
counsel and Hussain had had 1 consultation. Counsel had provided written advices. 
The suggestion that a transfer was sought was first raised with the court on the 20th 
 
September 2012.  Mr Justice Fulford refused that application. 
 
 
Following  that  refusal  the  PCMH  was  adjourned  to  be  fixed  before  the  trial 
63. 
Judge  before  the  end  of  November  2012,  however,  both  Arshad  and  Hussain 
 
maintained their position of dissatisfaction with their legal representatives and little, 
 
if any, preparation took place involving those legal representatives until on the 14th 
 
December  2012  I  granted  a  transfer  to  different  solicitors,  who  had  also  been 
 
representing Ahmed since the end of May 2011.  This transfer was carried into effect 
 
shortly afterwards on 19 December. 
 
 
On 18th January 2013 there was a further hearing at which it was ordered that 
64. 
 
the PCMH, including arraignment, would take place on the 1st March. The trial had, 
since an early stage, been fixed to start on the 10th April. 
 
 
The  basis  of  plea  for  Iqbal  was  drafted  on  or  about  the  24th  February  2013, 
65. 
that of Ahmed on or about the 27th February 2013, that of Arshad on or about the 26th 
 
February  2013,  and  that  of  Hussain  on  or  about  the  28th  February  2013.  However, 
there were, formal discussions between the defence teams and the prosecution which 
began on or about  29 January 2013. 
  
 
66. 
The definitive guideline of the Sentencing Guidelines Council indicates that a 
reduction in sentence of about one third is to be accorded to defendants who indicate 
their plea of guilty at the “first reasonable opportunity”. Thereafter the reduction in 
 
discount diminishes. A plea of guilty at the door of the court will normally be likely to 
attract  a  discount  of  the  order  of  one  tenth.    In  the  case  of  Caley,  the  CACD 
considered,  amongst  other  things,  the  question  whether  the  first  reasonable 
opportunity  generally  arises  at  arraignment,  which  normally  takes  place  at  the 
PCMH, or at an earlier stage. In that case the court expressed the view in paragraph 
 
18: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10
--------
“All this leads us to the clear conclusion that, absent particular considerations 
 
individual to the case, the first reasonable opportunity for the defendant to  
indicate (not necessarily enter) his plea of guilty, if that is his mind, is not the 
PCMH,  …  The  first  reasonable  opportunity  is  normally  either  at  the 
Magistrates' Court or immediately on arrival in the Crown Court – whether at a 
preliminary hearing or by way of a locally-approved system for indicating plea 
through his solicitors.”  

 

 
 
67. 
In  Caley  the  court  was  concerned  to  distinguish  between  (i)  the  first 
 
reasonable opportunity for the defendant to indicate his guilt and (ii) the opportunity 
 
for his lawyers to assess the strength of the case against him and to advise him on it 
 
(see paragraph 14). Subject to special cases, for example where the defendant might 
 
not know whether he is guilty or not of a particular offence and needs advice and/or 
 
the  sight  of  the  evidence  in  order  to  decide,  the  court  concluded  that,  generally 
 
speaking, the defendant did not require advice from his lawyers on the strength of the 
evidence against him in order for him to know whether he was guilty or not. He only 
required such advice in order to assess the prospects of conviction or acquittal, which 
 
is a different matter. The court said… 
 

 

 

 

 
“Moreover, even though a defendant may need advice on which charge he ought 
 
to  plead  guilty  to,  there  is  often  no  reason  why  uncertainty  about  this  should 
 
inhibit him from admitting, if it is true, what acts he did. If he does so, normally 
  
the public benefits to which we have referred will flow …” (para 14). 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
68. 
In  Caley,  the  Court  of  Appeal  emphasised  that  there  was  an  element  of 
residual  flexibility  where  the  Judge  may  treat  an  individual  case  individually.  One 
example given was an exceptionally long and complex trial where the possibility was 
 
left  open  that,  in  some  cases,  considerable  benefits  may  well  ensue  from  a  plea  of 
guilty, even at a late stage. However, the court issued cautionary words, that such an 
 
approach  should  not  become  routine  as  the  incentive  to  focus  on  plea  at  an  early 
stage  would  be  lost  and  often  there  is  no  real  obstacle,  even  in  complex  case,  to  a 
defendant, who admits his guilt, doing so at an early stage. (see paragraph 28) 
 
 
 
69. 
In  the  present  case  it  is  argued  that  the  defendants  should  receive  full 
 
discount or, at least,  more than 25% discount for their pleas of guilty at the PCMH. It 
is  said,  in  the  cases  of  Arshad  and  Hussain,  that  the  late  change  in  representation 
means that the 1st March was the first reasonable opportunity for them to indicate a 
 
plea of guilty. It is also argued on their behalf, as well as by Iqbal and Ahmed, that it 
 
was important for the precise basis of plea of all of them to be formulated before the 
 
first reasonable opportunity to indicate a plea of guilty could be said to have arisen 
for any of them or, alternatively, that the complex factual and evidential basis of the 
prosecution case means that this is a case where considerable benefits may well ensue 
from a plea of guilty at the PCMH resulting in a trial, scheduled for 3 months, being 
 
completed in 3 days.  
 
 
70. 
In  my  judgment,  none  of  these  defendants  pleaded  guilty  or  indicated  an 
 
intention to plead guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. In each case, as they have 
now admitted, they well knew what they had done and did not need any sophisticated 
 
legal  advice  to  inform  them  that  what  they  had  done  amounted  to  the  Section  5 
 
offence. In the case of Iqbal he well knew that he had arranged, through his contact, 
for Ahmed to travel to Pakistan for terrorist training and had advised him in respect 
 
of  that  venture.  He  had  discussed  with  Ahmed  constructing  and  deploying  an  IED 
 
with a specific target in mind. He had discussed acquiring a firearm and ammunition 
 
and had planned to go to Pakistan for terrorist purposes and to contribute money for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11
--------
that purpose   He has had the benefit of continuous legal advice from solicitors and 
 
counsel from the outset, a matter of some 10 months or so before his plea of guilty.  
 
 
71. 
In  the  case  of  Ahmed,  he  knew  he  had  travelled  abroad  for  the  purpose  of 
 
obtaining  terrorist  training  and  continued  to  harbour  that  ambition  and  undertook 
fitness training for that purpose. He knew he had discussed the IED with Iqbal and a 
 
firearm  and  ammunition  with    Hussain  and  others  and  had  provided  finance  for 
terrorism. He has had continuity of legal representation, both counsel and solicitors, 
since the end of May, some 9 months before his plea of guilty at the PCMH. 
 
 
 
 
72. 
For  each  of  Iqbal  and  Ahmed  there  was  an  opportunity  to  plead  guilty  or 
indicate  an  intention  to  plead  guilty  on  26th  September  2012,  when  the  first  PCMH 
 
was scheduled to take place, and on the 18th January 2013 even if, at that stage, the 
precise  terms  of  the  basis  of  plea  had  not  been  finalised  or  agreed  with  the 
prosecution. 
 
 
 
In the case of Arshad he knew he had provided sim cards for use by Ahmed 
73. 
when in Pakistan for terrorist training and had given him advice and had encouraged 
him to go and not return. He had undertaken physical and military style training for 
 
the purpose of making himself fit for terrorist activity. Hussain, knew he had offered 
 
to source a firearm to Ahmed, a person whom he knew was an aspiring terrorist. He 
 
knew they had discussed, on a number of occasions, his ambition to travel abroad for 
 
terrorist  training  and  he  had  gone  for  military  style  training  on  one  occasion  with 
 
him.  They  each  had  the  benefit  of  representation  by  counsel  and  solicitors,  at  least 
until the 20th September when, for the first time, the question of a change of solicitor 
was  canvassed.  As  I  have  indicated,  a  very  substantial  amount  of  work  had  been  
 
undertaken  by  their  then  solicitors  and  they  had  the  benefit  of  one  or  more 
consultations with leading counsel. Furthermore, from the 19th December 2012 , they 
 
had  the  benefit  of  representation  by  the  same  solicitors  as  had  been  representing 
 
Ahmed  from  the  end  of  May.  Against  that  background,  in  my  judgment,  it  is  not 
 
realistic to suggest that the 1st March was the first reasonable opportunity for a plea of 
 
guilty to be either entered or indicated. 
 
 
74. 
Furthermore,  although  the  evidence  is  multifaceted  and  substantial,  the 
 
question whether they were guilty, or not guilty, of the Section 5 offence, given what 
 
they  knew  they  had  done,  was  by  no  means  complex  or  difficult  nor  is  this  one  of 
 
those  cases  where,  in  my  judgment,  a  wholly  exceptional  course  should  be  taken  of 
giving more than the standard discount for a plea of guilty at the PCMH which had 
 
been postponed until a date just over a month before the trial date. 
 
 
Accordingly,  I  will  give  each  of  the  defendants  a  discount  of  25%  from  the 
75. 
 
sentence which would have been passed had the count to which he has pleaded guilty 
been contested and a conviction resulted. 
 
 
Dangerousness/Extended Sentence 
 
 
76. 
Section  226(A)  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  applies  where  a  person  is 
 
convicted of a specified offence (of which the offence to which these defendants have 
 
pleaded  guilty  is  one)  and  where  the  court  considers  there  is  a  significant  risk  to 
 
members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission of the offender 
 
of  further  specified  offences,  and,  (3)  the  relevant  condition  (Condition  B)  is 
 
satisfied.- that if the court where to impose an extended sentence of imprisonment, 
the term that it would specify as the appropriate custodial term would be at least 4 
years.  In  those  circumstances  (4)  the  court  may  impose  an  extended  sentence  of 
imprisonment on the offender. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12
--------
77. 
An  extended  sentence  is  a  sentence  which  is  equal  to  the  aggregate  of  the 
appropriate custodial term and a further period (the extension period) for which the 
offender is to be subject to a licence. In a case of a specified violent offence, of which 
 
this is one, the extension period must not exceed 5 years.

The  test  of  dangerousness  thus  established,  which  has  to  be  assessed  in 
accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Section  229  of  the  2003  Act,  is  unchanged  by 
 
the  recent  changes  to  the  sentencing  regime  for  dangerous  offenders,  In  particular, 
the  guidance  given  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Lang  [2006]  1WLR  2509  applies 
 
thus “ the risk identified must  be significant which is a higher threshold than  mere 
possibility of an occurrence and can be taken to mean “noteworthy, of considerable 
amount  ...  or  importance”  The  court  must  take  into  account  the  nature    and 
circumstances of the current offence, the offender’s history of offending or its absence 
and all other relevant information. 
 
 
 
If the criterion for dangerousness is met, the court has a discretion whether 
79. 
or  not  to  pass  an  extended  sentence.  One  of  the  factors,  it  is  submitted  by  the 
defendants,  which  is  to  be  taken  into  account  in  exercising  that  discretion  is  the 
 
recent change in the regime providing for the eligibility of parole and release prior to 
 
the expiration of the custodial element of an extended sentence. This is now provided 
 
for by Section 246A of the 2003 Act. The effect of that section is that the offender is 
not  eligible  for  release  until  he  has  served  at  least  two  thirds  of  the  appropriate 
custodial term (known as the requisite custodial period). Only at that point must the 
 
Secretary  of  State  refer  the  offender’s  case  to  the  Parole  Board.  The  duty  of  the 
 
Secretary of State to release the offender on licence does not arise unless or until the 
 
Parole Board has directed the offender’s release. The Parole Board must not give such 
a direction unless it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the 
 
public that the offender should be confined. Absent such a direction, the offender is 
 
not  entitled  to  be  released  until  the  full  appropriate  custodial  sentence  has  been 
served.  
 
 
 
This  provision  contrasts  with  the  position  where  a  determinate  sentence  is 
80. 
 
passed. The offender is then entitled to be released on licence upon serving half of the 
 
determinate sentence and is subject to licence for the remainder of the determinate 
term.  
 
 
 
81. 
It  is  urged  upon  me,  having  regard  to  the  more  onerous  release  provisions  
 
which now operate in respect of extended sentences, that I should not impose such a 
 
sentence  even  were  I  to  be  of  the  view  that  the  dangerousness  condition  has  been 
 
satisfied.  There  is  no  guidance  of  which  I  am  aware  on  whether  this  is  a  material 
 
factor to be taken into account in the exercise my discretion in this respect, but I can 
 
see its force and I will do so. However, I do not accede to the invitation to consider 
 
whether an IPP would have been appropriate under the old regime. The new regime 
 
replaces it and its provisions should be applied in their own right and not parasitic on 
a regime which no longer exists 
 
 
Arshad and Hussain 
 
 
82. 
I have already indicated my view in respect of each of these two defendants 
that,  having  regard  to  the  extent  of  their  participation  in  the  preparatory  acts,  and 
having  regard  to  the  absence  of  any  evidence,  between  September  2011  and  April 
2012,  of  any  involvement  in  terrorist  related  activities  or  a  continuation  of  the 
 
mindset  which  led  to  their  committing  these  offences,    I  am  unable  now  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13
--------
satisfied  that  either  of  them  presents  a  significant  risk  to  members  of  the  public  of 
 
serious harm occasioned by the commission of further specified offences. 
 
 
83. 
In  my  judgment,  on  the  prosecution  case,  Hussain  was  quite  a  distance 
 
removed from doing anything which could properly be described as, or adjacent to an 
act of terrorism. He participated in a series of discussions, particularly with Ahmed, 
 
during  which  he  was  encouraged  to,  and  expressed  the  desire  to,  travel  to  Pakistan 
 
for training and he did, on one occasion, go to Snowdonia to engage in appropriate 
 
training. He had exposed himself to a violent fundamentalist Islamist ideology and he 
was engaged in conversation with Ahmed about sourcing a firearm. By the time of the 
initial intervention by the security services and the police in September 2011, he had 
 
not done anything practical to advance any of these suggestions. He had not even got 
round to providing funds for the support of terrorism abroad.. 
 
 
 
84. 
Furthermore, once his house had been searched in September 2011, there is 
no evidence that he engaged in any terrorist related activity or discussions and there 
 
was  nothing  found  at  his  address  which  indicated  any  continuation  of  the  mindset 
which had informed the course of conduct in which he had been engaged prior to that 
search. 
 
 
 
For  those  reasons,  in  my  judgment,  it  would  be  wrong  to  conclude  that  the  
85. 
requirement  of  dangerousness,  as  of  now,  is  satisfied  in  his  case  and  accordingly  I 
 
will pass a determinate sentence. 
 
 
In the case of Arshad, his involvement with Ahmed’s journey to Pakistan was 
86. 
 
more  direct,  though  it  did  not  involve  Arshad  being  directly  involved  in  acts  of 
 
terrorism. He supplied Ahmed with sim cards to use when Ahmed went to Pakistan 
 
and  there  was  telephone  contact  between  them  when  Ahmed  was  in  Pakistan. 
 
Furthermore,  he  and  Ahmed  discussed,  and  Arshad  gave  advice  about,  the 
preparation of a cover story and how to blend in when in Pakistan and he was strong 
 
in his support for Ahmed in going to Pakistan and he urged him to be brave and not 
 
return.  He  too  underwent  forms  of  physical  training  in  the  UK,  on  a  number  of 
occasions, but there is no evidence that this resulted in any active steps on his part to 
 
make plans  to travel to  Pakistan, or elsewhere abroad, for the purposes of training. 
 
He  too  exposed  himself  to  literature  supporting  the  use  of  terrorism  to  advance  a 
fundamentalist  Islamist  agenda.  He  supplied  money,  £100,  for  Ahmed  to  take  to 
 
Pakistan  for  terrorist  purposes  overseas.    However,  he  was  not  engaged  in  any 
discussions  about  assembling  or  deploying  IEDs,  nor  about  sourcing  or  obtaining 
firearms, and there is no evidence that, after the search conducted at his home on the 
2nd September 2011, he engaged in any similar activity, or maintained that mindset, 
before his arrest on 24th April 2012. 
 
 
87. 
Accordingly, in my judgment,  it would be wrong to conclude that, as of now, 
 
the dangerousness conditions are satisfied in respect of Arshad. I will therefore pass a 
 
determinate sentence in his case. 
 
 
Iqbal 
 
 
 
In my judgment, Iqbal’s involvement is of a different order to that of Arshad 
88. 
and Hussain. He is significantly older than they are. He was instrumentally involved 
 
in  facilitating  and  arranging  for  Ahmed  to  go  to  Pakistan  with  a  view  to  obtaining 
 
terrorist training, carrying with him a significant sum of money to be passed on for 
use  in  terrorist  activity  overseas.  He  it  was  who  had  and  who  utilised  the  contact 
which  enabled  Ahmed  to  go  to  Pakistan  for  that  purpose.  He  arranged  it  through 
telephone conversations with that contact and, in effect, Iqbal got his contact to agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14
--------
that Ahmed should go to see him. He and Ahmed had detailed conversations about 
 
how Ahmed was to make his journey in a way which would keep its true purpose from 
 
the security services and Ahmed’s family and, whilst Ahmed was away, Iqbal was in 
telephone communication with him. 
 
89.  When Ahmed’s visit proved unsuccessful, Iqbal and Ahmed discussed making 
 
arrangements  for  Iqbal  to  travel  to  Pakistan  for  similar  purposes.  Not  only  was  to 
take a large sum of money to give to the insurgents but he had in mind to stay there, 
 
even  after  his  family  may  have  returned  to  the  UK,  to  discuss  with  the  insurgents 
 
whatever they might wish him to do. Arrangements for this were well in hand when 
the searches occurred on 2nd September 2011. In addition, there was discussion with 
 
Ahmed about Ahmed’s preparing himself to be accepted for such training in Pakistan 
 
by learning languages such as Arabic which would enable Ahmed to fit in better. 
 
 
90. 
Iqbal  and  Ahmed  had  purposive  conversations  about  engaging  in  terrorist 
 
 
activities  in  this  country  involving  the  assembly  of  one  or  more  IEDs  deployment 
 
against a specific potential local target. I am in no doubt that these discussions were 
serious  even  though,  by  the  time  of  the  search  on  September  2011,  there  is  no 
 
evidence that any practical steps had been taken to carry it into effect. 
  
 
 
Iqbal also discussed obtaining a firearm and ammunition which, even in the 
91. 
context of responding to the English Defence League, was sufficiently serious that it 
 
resulted in a meeting with a third party on the 21st February at which those matters 
 
were further discussed. There is no evidence that these discussions had proceeded by 
 
the time the authorities intervened. Iqbal was aware of, and discussed the change of 
 
direction which   the “Inspire” magazine intended to achieve - to nurture home grown 
 
terrorist activity not requiring training abroad and, when his house was searched in 
 
September 2011, there was a substantial amount of cash ready to be taken to Pakistan 
 
to be deployed, at least part of it, for terrorist purposes. 
 
 
Despite the search on 2nd September 2011, on 24th April  there was evidence 
92. 
 
 
that he continued to have the same views as had informed his earlier activity. He had 
 
downloaded,  since  September  2011,  “39  ways  to  support  Jihad”.  He  had  concealed 
 
press cuttings relating to drone attacks in Waziristan. He had mobile phones, one of 
 
which  evidenced  a  continuing  connection  with  Ahmed.  Also  found  were  items 
capable  of  use  in  terrorist  related  activities  or  training  for  it  such  as  torches,  a  
 
rucksack with GPS navigator and compass. I have been told by counsel that these are 
 
innocently possessed in connection with his work as a lorry driver and to enable him 
 
to pray facing Mecca. In addition there was found a DVD said by him to be an Arabic 
 
Koranic language course which relates to his religious observances. Whatever may be 
 
the truth of that, I regard the downloading of the 39 ways, as significant . 
 
 
93. 
The  author  of  the  pre  sentence  report  has  interpreted  this  as  supporting  a 
 
view that Iqbal is naïve and susceptible to the views and influence of others. I agree 
 
that it evidences a degree of naivety about the extent to which he would continue to 
 
be  under  surveillance.  But  it  does  support  an  assessment  that,  despite  his 
protestations to the contrary, his mindset had not changed. 
 
 
 
The  assessment  in  the  pre  sentence  report  is  that  “The  National  Offender 
94. 
 
Management  Service  assessment  tool  indicate(sic)  Mr  Iqbal  to  be  at  low  risk  of  
 
reoffending. However, given the seriousness of the offences, he is assessed as being 
 
of high  risk of harm to the wider  public”.  This is not expressed in the terms of the 
statutory  test.  Taking  it  in  the  round,  however,  in  my  judgment,  it  is  capable  of  
 
supporting an assessment that Iqbal does satisfy the dangerousness criterion 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15
--------
In my judgment, the nature, persistence and the extent of his involvement in 
95. 
a series of different types of possible terrorist activity described above coupled with 
 
the  evidence  that  he  continued  after  September  2011  with  the  mindset  which 
 
informed  those  actions  satisfies  me  that  he  continues  to  be  a  person  who  poses  a 
significant  risk  to  members  of  the  public  of  serious  harm  occasioned  by  the 
 
commission  by  him  of  further  specified  offences.  I  do,  therefore  find  him  to  be 
dangerous. 
 
 
Ahmed 
 
 
96. 
As with Iqbal, his involvement in, or espousal of, potential terrorist activities 
 
is  both  direct,  repeated,  persistent  and  maintained.  He  travelled  to  Pakistan  with  a 
view to obtaining terrorist training and passed on a significant sum of money for use 
 
in terrorist purposes. When that proved unsuccessful, because, he said, of his lack of 
 
Arabic  and  the  circumstances  on  the  ground,  he  did  not  give  up  that  ambition  but 
 
continued  to  conduct  his  physical  training  programme,  both  in  the  gym  and  in  
remote areas where military style training was undertaken. He also continued to seek 
 
to  travel  to  various  other  countries  in  order  to  learn  Arabic,  with  a  view  to  making 
himself more acceptable as a potential terrorist trainee.  
 
 
In addition, he was involved in significant discussions, using an article in the 
97. 
 
Inspire magazine, about assembling and deploying one or more IEDs and to do so in 
respect  of  a  specific  identified  local  target.  On  more  than  one  occasion  he  had 
 
discussions about the acquisition of firearms, both with other individuals in his car, 
and  involving  Hussain.  In  all  of  this  he  was  informed  by  and  influenced  by  the 
 
material which he downloaded and accessed, notably Inspire magazine.  He too was, 
by his admission, a collector of funds to be sent abroad for the purposes of funding 
 
terrorism.  he  took  just  under  a  £1000  when  he  went  to  Pakistan  and  he  discussed 
fundraising  with  Hussain,  whom  he  sought  to  influence  and  did  influence  in  his 
 
ambition  to  travel  abroad  for  terrorist  training.  He  was  also  involved  in  organising 
military style training both in the gym and outdoors in remote parts of the country. 
 
 
He  downloaded  Inspire  magazine  after  the  search  of  2nd  September,  in 
98. 
October,  and  did  not  thereafter  delete.  Nor  did  he  divest  himself  of  a  quantity 
survival  equipment  and  maps  of  Snowdonia  he  had  previously  accumulated  which 
had  not  been  found  in  the  September  search.  These  actions  are  not  consistent  with 
 
the claim that, after the 2nd September, he withdrew from such conduct and focussed 
 
himself  on  his  private  life.  It  is  said,  on  his  behalf,  that  it  reflects  a  slow  but 
determined move away from a terrorist supporting ideology. 
 
 
As  with  Iqbal,  whilst  what  was  found  on  24  April  2012  may  be  said  to 
99. 
 
evidence a naivety about his position after the September search, it supports the view 
 
that  his  mindset  had  not  changed.  In  the  pre  sentence  report,  part  of  the 
dangerousness assessment is couched in virtually identical terms to Iqbal. However it 
also  describes  the  disengagement  from  radical  Islamist  ideology  to  which  I  have 
already  referred.  This  is  based  on  what  he  has  said  to  the  authors  of  the  report  in 
 
interviews lasting 5 hours.  
 
 
Although his is younger than Iqbal, I do not regard that as a significant factor 
100. 
 
in assessing Ahmed’s dangerousness nor in comparing their culpability. In Ahmed’s 
 
case,  having  regard  to  the  nature,  intensity  and  persistence  of  his  preparatory 
activities  prior  to  the  2nd  September  and  having  regard  to  the  evidence  of  his 
 
continuing  in  the  same  mindset  thereafter  and  until  the  second  search  on  24  April 
2012, I am satisfied that, as of that date, he was a person who posed a significant risk 
 
to  members  of  the  public  of  serious  harm  occasioned  by  the  commission  of  further 

 
 

 

 

 

 

16
--------
specified  offences.  Whilst  I  have  regard  to  the  assessment  of  the  authors  of  the  pre 
 
sentence report and their expertise in such matters, I am of the view that the effect of 
 
the material up to the 24th April is not overborne by subsequent assertions by him of 
 
a change of heart since his remand into custody to the extent necessary to avoid my 
 
coming to the conclusion that he still satisfies the dangerousness condition.. 
 
 
 
101. 
In each of their cases, having concluded that they satisfy the dangerousness 
condition,  I  have  to  consider  whether  to  exercise  my  discretion  to  impose  an 
extended  sentence.  I  have  regard  to  the  fact  that  the  imposition  of  an  extended 
sentence has consequences, not just for the extended period during which they would 
 
be on licence, having been released, but also on the date when they are released, and 
 
that  this  is  potentially  a  significant  consequence.  It  will    result  in  them  serving  in  
 
prison two thirds of the custodial element and may result in them serving double the 
time that they would serve were they subject of a  determinate sentence from which 
 
they  would  have  to  be  released  after  serving  one  half  of  the  sentence.  I  also  have 
regard to the onerous nature to the licence conditions to which they would be subject 
for  the  balance  of  a  determinate  sentence  and  to  the  terrorism  notification 
requirements to which they will, in any event, be subject for many years  
 
 
102. 
In my judgment, however, in each of their cases, their persistent commitment 
to terrorist  activity, in  a number of different ways, over a significant period of time 
 
and, in each case, their willingness to take practical steps to obtain terrorist training 
 
abroad,  marks them out as particularly dangerous.  This, coupled with the fact  that, 
 
after  their  houses  had  been  searched,  and  they  were  obviously  under  serious 
suspicion, they nonetheless continued to access material consistent with the mindset 
 
which  informed  their  previous  preparatory  activities,  persuades  me  that  they 
continue to be “dangerous” to such a degree that I should exercise my discretion to 
 
pass  an  extended  sentence.    It  is,  in  my  judgment,  appropriate  for  the  public  to  be 
 
protected by requiring a direction from the Parole Board that they be released, before 
 
they are released prior to the expiration of the custodial term. That direction will be 
given, or not, in the light of the circumstances which exist after they have served two 
thirds  of  the  appropriate  custodial  sentence  and  only  on  the  basis  that  the  Parole 
Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary  for the protection of the public  that 
 
the offender should be confined. Accordingly, I will impose on Iqbal and Ahmed an 
extended sentence.  
 
  
The length of sentences 
 
 
 
103. 
I have regard to all personal mitigation though it has little impact in a case 
 
such  as  this.  I  been  reminded  of  a  number  of  relevant  authorities  and  I  have 
 
considered all of them.  I have considered the case of  Iqbal [2010] EWCA Crim 
 
3215 and F [2007] EWCA Crim 243 in which the fact that the main thrust of the 
terrorist  related  to  activities  abroad  rather  than  within  the  UK  is  said  not  to  be  a 
relevant factor in determining the seriousness of the offending.  
 
 
104. 
I  have  also  had  regard  to  the  sentencing  authorities,  at  appellate  and  first 
 
 
instance  level,  of  cases  under  Section  5  of  the  Terrorism  Act  2006  to  which  I  have 
 
been referred. It is well recognised that Section 5 covers a wide range of activities and 
 
sentencing  is  very  fact  specific.  At  one  end  of  the  spectrum  there  is  the  case  of 
 
Qureshi (AG Ref 7/2008) [2008 EWCA Crim 1053], at the other end is Rajib 
 
Karim [2012] 1CR App R(S) 85. I have also had regard to the sentences passed by 
myself in the case of Chowdhury and Ors and the judgment of the CACD on the 
 
appeals  by  certain  of  offenders  in  that  case  which  was  handed  down  this  week 
 
(Usman  Khan  and  others[2013]  EWCA  Crim  468)  I  note,  particularly,  that, 
although the imposition of an IPP for some of those offenders has been overturned, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17
--------
the  underlying  determinate  sentence  levels  for  these  who  pleaded  guilty  to  the 
Section 5 offence have all been upheld. 
 
 
At  the  hearing  on  the  1st  March  I  expressed  the  view  that,  in  terms  of 
 
105. 
seriousness,  I  viewed  these  offences  as  being  at  a  lower  level  of  seriousness  to 
 
Chowdhury  and  ors,  and  I  have  not  changed  that  view.  It  is  urged  on  me  that 
 
these  cases  are  significantly  less  serious  than  the  activities  the  subject  of 
Chowdhury. 
 
 
 
I have also been referred to the cases of Walid Ali, Mohamed Shakil and 
106. 
 
Sadeer Saleem (2009), Hassan Tabbakh (2008), Ian and Nicky Davison 
(2010) and Abdulla Ahmed Ali and others [2011 EWCA Crim 1260, in the 
last, particularly concerning Nabeel Hussain. I have had regard to them all bearing in 
 
 
mind  the  wide  range  of  activities  encompassed  in  the  section  5  offence  and  the 
absence of any guideline cases or other definitive guidance. 
 
 
 
I consider that Iqbal and Ahmed are in their different ways the most serious 
107. 
of  these  offenders  and  I  do  not  distinguish  between  them  in  terms  of  length  of 
sentence as, in my judgment, in their different ways, their culpability is equal. Iqbal 
 
not only actively facilitated, through his contact, the travelling by Ahmed to Pakistan 
for terrorist training,  but he had virtually  completed the practical arrangements for 
 
himself to go to Pakistan for a similar purpose, taking with him a very significant sum 
of  money  for  use,  at  least  as  to  part,  for  supporting  terrorist  activity  abroad.  In 
 
addition he had seriously discussed with  Ahmed the assembling and deployment of 
an IED with a specific target in mind and had discussed with others the acquisition of 
a firearm and ammunition. 
 
 
108. 
Ahmed, travelled to Pakistan for training and took funds to support terrorism 
abroad.  He  persisted  in  his  wish  to  do  so,  envisaging  obtaining  the  necessary 
 
language skills by travelling, if need be, to obtain them. He was actively involved in 
undertaking and encouraging and organising relevant training in the UK for himself 
 
and  others,  including  Arshad  and  Hussain.  He  joined  with  Iqbal  in  serious 
discussions  about  assembling  and  deploying  one  or  more  IEDs  possibly  targeting  a 
territorial army base, taking a steer from the change of direction envisaged in Inspire 
magazine. He investigated obtaining a firearm and ammunition.  
 
 
In the case of Chowdhury and ors there were two focuses of activity; first, 
109. 
 
 
the establishment of a terrorist training camp abroad and recruitment of trainees to 
attend  it,  coupled  with  consideration  of  the  commission  of  terrorist  acts  at  home 
 
second  the  active  discussion  of  the  construction  of  an  IED,  based  on  the  article  in  
 
Inspire, with a view to such a device being exploded in the London Stock Exchange. 
 
The starting point for the determinate sentences in respect of these two elements, for 
 
persons  of  full  age  with  no  previous  convictions  who  were  at  the  heart  of  those 
 
aspects of the case were, respectively, 20  and 18 years. 
 
 
110. 
In my judgment and having regard to that case and the others to which I have 
referred, the appropriate custodial sentence for Iqbal and Ahmed after a fight would 
have been 15 years. Giving each a 25% discount for his plea of guilty, the appropriate 
custodial sentence is one of 11 years 3 months.  The extension period for which Iqbal 
 
and  Ahmed  will  be  subject  to  licence  beyond  the  expiration  of  the  appropriate 
 
custodial  term  of  11  years  and  3  months  will  be  5  years.  Thus,  I  pass  on  Iqbal  and 
 
Ahmed an extended sentence totalling 16 years and 3 months, of which 11 years and 3 
 
months  will  be  the  appropriate  custodial  term  and  5  years  will  be  the  extension 
 
period. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18
--------
111. 
In the case of Arshad, his offending is at lower level than that of either Iqbal 
 
or  Ahmed.  He  is  not,  however,  someone  who  falls  to  be  sentenced  at  the  level  for  
 
which was thought to be appropriate in Qureshi. He is no “Walter Mitty” character 
but  was  a  serious  minded  person  who  actively  participated  in  assisting  and 
encouraging Ahmed to go to Pakistan for terrorist training, by providing him with a 
sim  card,  supplying  him  with  advice  and  support  and  giving  money  to  support 
terrorism  abroad.  Thereafter,  he  was  sufficiently  serious  in  his  commitment  to 
 
undertake, repeatedly, training in mountainous and other terrain in preparation for 
 
terrorism.  He  too  exposed  himself  to  the  influence  of  Inspire  and  other  texts  of 
 
radical Islamist ideology. In my judgment, the appropriate sentence upon him after a 
trial  would  have  been  one  of  9  years  imprisonment.  He  too  is  entitled  to  a  25% 
 
discount. The sentence I pass on him is one of 6 years 9 months. He will be released 
on  licence  after  he  has  served  one  half  of  that term  less  the  number  of  days  he  has 
 
been remanded in custody for this offence. That is a matter which will be determined 
 
administratively. Once released, and for the balance of the 6 years and 9 months, he 
will be subject to licence and liable to be recalled at any time during that period if he 
 
is in breach of his licence. 
 
 
112. 
In the case of Hussain, in my judgment his offending is less serious than that 
of  Arshad.  He  is  also  younger  than  the  rest.  He  discussed  a  variety  of  types  of 
 
terrorist  activity  and  expressed  a  willingness  and  ambition  to  travel  for  training,  to 
 
provide funding for terrorist purposes and to source a firearm for Ahmed, but it never 
 
got beyond that, save for one attendance on a trip organised by Ahmed for military 
style  training  in  a  remote  country  area.  He  too  accessed  the  literature  advocating  a 
violent fundamentalist Islamist ideology over a period of months before the search of 
2 September. The extent and range of his offending makes it serious, though not, in 
 
the context, as serious as that of the others. In my judgment the appropriate sentence 
for him after a trial would have been one of 7 years imprisonment. Giving him a 25% 
 
discount for a plea of guilty, the sentence I pass on him is one of 5 years 3 months. He 
 
too will be released after serving one half of that term less the number of days he has 
 
been  remanded  in  custody  for  this  offence.  That  will  be  calculated  as  an 
 
administrative  act.  Thereafter  he  will,  for  the  remainder  of  the  term,  be  subject  to 
 
licence and liable to recall to prison if he were to break the terms of that licence. 
 
 
Consequential matters 
 
 
 
113. 
In  respect  of  each  of  these  offenders,  Part  4  of  the  Terrorism  Act  2008 
applies so that each of them will be subject to a notification requirement pursuant to 
 
Section  40  (1)  of  that  Act.  By  virtue  of  Section  47  of  that  Act,  they  will  each  be  
 
required  to  provide  detailed  information  to  the  police  and,  by  Section  48,  to  notify 
any change to this information. Any breach of these requirements is itself a criminal 
offence. In the case of Iqbal and Ahmed, who have been sentenced to sentences of 10 
years  imprisonment  or  more,  the  notification  requirements  remain  in  force  for  30 
 
years.  In  the  case  of  Arshad  and  Hussain  the  notification  requirements  remain  in 
force for 15 years. 
 
 
 
114. 
In addition I will make a deprivation order pursuant to s143 of the Powers of 
 
the  Criminal  Courts  (Sentencing)  Act  2000  in  respect  of  the  items  on  the  schedule 
 
produced to me save for (i) item AJP/39 where no such order is now sought and (ii) 
 
in respect of items AJP/5,AJP/37, SMR/26,42,43 and 44, and DMC/13 and 14 where 
I  will  adjourn  consideration  to  be  determined  by  me  on  the  basis  of  written 
 
submissions. I will invite the parties to indicate a timetable for such submissions to 
 
be made.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE FLAUX 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
  

1.	  Nathan Pick on 8 May 2013 you pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of your 7 
 
month old son James Pick who died a year ago on 9 May 2012. At the time 
 
you  lived  with  the  baby’s  mother,  your  then  partner  Hannah  Goldby  in 
 
Chaddesden, Derby.  The background to this tragic death is as follows. James 
 
was born on 5 October 2011 with a number of medical problems requiring 
 
surgical  treatment,  including  corrective  heart  surgery.  A  little  over  three 
 
months  of  his  early  life  were  spent  in  hospital.  These  medical  difficulties 
 
meant he had to be fed through a naso‐gastric tube. I accept that you helped 
 
with this task. Despite these problems once settled at home he was reported 
 
as growing well and developing normally. 
  

 
 
 
 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
2.	  Up  until  about  March  last  year  your  relationship  with  your  son  appeared 
 
normal, but around that time it changed for the worse. Whenever you went 
 
near James he would become distressed and scream or cry. As soon as his 
 
mother  took  him  he  would  settle  down.  You  clearly  found  this  reaction  of 
 
your son frustrating and upsetting and described it to a cousin of Hannah’s in 
 
April  2012  as  breaking  your  heart.  The  problems  you  had  of  bonding  with 
 
James and the demands of caring for him put a strain on your relationship 
 
with Hannah. You told her you could not cope with the crying and wanted to 
 
give up. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.	  On Sunday 6 May 2012 Hannah left you alone for the day with James and 
 
went to her mother’s. You rang up clearly stressed saying James would not 
 
stop screaming and could Hannah come home. She said she would return in 
 
an hour but you asked her to come straight away such was the stress. When 
 
she  walked into the  house  he  stopped  crying and  you  said  “thank  fuck for 
 
that”. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.	  On Tuesday 8 May 2012 in the afternoon the three of you went into Derby 
 
city  centre.  On  arrival  you  went  off  on  your  own  to  chill  out  with  friends 
 
whilst Hannah and James went shopping then went home where she fed him.

--------
You  got  home  about  5.30.  Hannah’s  mother  came  round  with  some 
 
medication for the baby shortly before 6.15. You and Hannah decided to have 
 
fish and chips and her mother drove her to the local fish bar to buy the food. 
 
At the time she left James was asleep in his swing chair. Almost on arrival 
 
inside the shop at about 6.26 so only some ten minutes after she had left you 
 
alone with the baby, she had a telephone call from you asking her to come 
 
back quickly, saying he’s fitting and I think he’s dead. She came back having 
 
told  you  to  dial  999  which  you  did.  The  ambulance  came  and  James  was 
 
taken initially to Royal Derby Hospital then to the QMC here in Nottingham. A 
 
CT  scan  and  subsequent  MRI  scan  revealed  extensive  brain  injury  with 
 
haemorrhaging,  brain  swelling  and  bleeding  into  the  spinal  cord  and 
 
examination by an eye specialist revealed extensive injuries to the backs of 
 
the eyes including haemorrhages and retinal detachment. It became clear to 
 
all the treating doctors that further intensive care was futile and James was 
 
taken off life support and died at 10.26pm on 9 May 2012. 
  

   
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
5.	  The  post  mortem  examinations  by  Dr  Stuart  Hamilton  and  other  specialist 
 
pathologists  found  numerous  head  injuries  and  extensive  brain  injury  and 
 
catastrophic  bleeding  to  the  eyes  and  retina  all  indicative  of  severe  blunt 
 
trauma and inconsistent with an accident or with accidental impact with the 
 
baby’s swing chair which is what you were suggesting had happened. Despite 
 
the weight of that medical evidence pointing to deliberate infliction of these 
 
injuries  upon  the  baby,  until  your  plea  of  guilty  two  days  ago  you  were 
 
 
maintaining  you  were  not  responsible,  that  the 
injuries  had  arisen 
 
 
accidentally or that James’ mother was in some way to blame. 
 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

6.	  As you now accept by your plea of guilty to manslaughter, you had caused 
 
those injuries which led to James’ death. When Hannah went out to fetch fish 
 
and chips, as always happened when the baby was left alone with you, he 
 
started screaming. The stress and frustration that generated in you caused 
 
you  to  snap  and  in  momentary  anger  you  hit  James with  the  back of  your 
 
hand so that he hit his head on the chair. You did not intend to kill him or 
 
cause him serious physical injury, but again, as your guilty plea demonstrates, 
 
you  now  accept  that  this  blow  was  an  unlawful  act  which  any  reasonable 
 
person  would  have  realised  would  cause  James  some  physical  harm.  How 
 
could it be otherwise with a small vulnerable baby? 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

7.	  This is a tragic case in which a moment of anger and frustration caused the 
 
death of your baby son, a senseless act of violence with the consequences of 
 
which you will have to live for the rest of your life. It has ruined the life of 
 
your ex‐partner Hannah who had already previously lost another baby Zoe in 
 
a cot death and it has devastated her family. I have considered the moving 
 
 
impact statement from Hannah. Inevitably as people do in such situations she 
 
asks herself over and over what she could have done to stop you and blames 
 
herself, when the stark reality is that only you are to blame for the death of 
 
your son. I have also borne in mind in sentencing you the effect on your other 
 
 
child, your 12 year old son.

8.	  Manslaughter  is  a  serious  offence  for  the  purposes  of  the  dangerousness 
 
provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 but I am satisfied that you are not 
 
dangerous within the meaning of those provisions. Nonetheless the case is of 
 
such  seriousness  that  it  passes  the  custody  threshold  and  clearly  only  a 
 
substantial custodial sentence would be appropriate to meet the seriousness 
 
of the offence you have admitted. 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

9.	  The authorities on sentencing for manslaughter since the enactment of the 
 
Criminal Justice Act 2003 have emphasised that whilst there is no express link 
 
between the guidance in Schedule 21 to that Act as it applies to murder and 
 
sentencing for manslaughter, the Act has increased the punitive element in 
 
the sentence for murder and the intention of Parliament is clear that other 
 
crimes which result in death such as manslaughter should be treated more 
 
seriously  and  dealt  with  more  severely  than  before.  That  point  was  made 
 
expressly  in  the  context  of  diminished  responsibility  manslaughter  by  Lord 
 
Judge CJ in R v Wood [2010] 1 Cr App R(S) 2 at [23]. Precisely the same point 
 
was  made  by  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  in  the  context  of  unlawful  act 
 
manslaughter arising out of street disorder in  Appleby [2010] 2 Cr App R(S) 
 
46 at [22]. 
  
 
 
10. In	  R  v  Burridge  [2010]  EWCA  Crim  2847  at  [137]  to  [139]  Leveson  LJ 
 
considered  those  authorities  and  concluded  the  principles  set  out  in  those 
 
authorities  applied  equally  to  unlawful  act  manslaughter  of  babies  and 
 
children.  In that case the defendant was convicted of the murder of his baby 
 
son, but on appeal the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the grounds of 
 
fresh  evidence  and  substituted  a  verdict  of  manslaughter.  In  those 
 
circumstances the defendant fell to be sentenced by the Court of Appeal for 
 
manslaughter.  The  Court  of  Appeal  substituted  a  sentence  of  10  years 
 
imprisonment for the original sentence for murder of life imprisonment with 
 
a minimum term of 13 years. 
 
 
 
 
11. Your counsel Mr Smith QC relies upon the subsequent decision of the Court 
 
of  Appeal  in  Draper  [2011]  EWCA  Crim  640  as  setting  Burridge  in  context. 
 
That was an Attorney General’s Reference in respect of a sentence of three 
 
and  a  half  years  imprisonment  in  fact  by  the  same  trial  judge  as  Burridge 
 
where, as in this case, the defendant had killed his baby son and had been 
 
originally  charged  with  murder  but  a  plea  of  manslaughter  was  eventually 
 
accepted by the prosecution. The Court of Appeal found the sentence was 
 
too lenient and substituted one of 5 years imprisonment. It is to be  noted 
 
that in his judgment the Lord Chief Justice endorsed the conclusion by the 
 
 
Court in Burridge that the principles in Wood and Appleby applied equally to 
 
 
cases of unlawful act manslaughter of babies and children. 
 
 
 
12. In Draper the Court of Appeal imposed a lesser sentence than in Burridge in 
 
part because  as Mr  Smith  emphasised  some  of  the  aggravating features in 
 
Burridge  were  absent  in  that  case,  specifically  that,  in  Burridge,  the

--------
defendant’s intention fell just short of what would be the requisite intent for 
 
murder,  that  in  that  case  the  defendant  had  committed  previous  proven 
 
violent  acts  against  the  child,  that  he  had  been  warned  previously  to  seek 
 
help about his bad temper and that he lied to the authorities about his care 
 
of the child. With the possible exception that in this case you have lied about 
 
your  responsibility  until  this  week  I  agree  with  Mr  Smith  that  those 
 
 
aggravating features in Burridge are equally absent in your case. 
  
 
 
13. However,  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  made  clear  in  Draper  the  sentence  of  5 
 
years  imprisonment  was  substituted  on  the  basis  that  the  defendant  was 
 
entitled  to  a  full  one  third  credit  for  his  plea  of  guilty  so  that  sentence 
 
equated to one of 7 and a half years after a full trial. Furthermore, as with all 
 
Attorney General’s references one has to recognise that where the Court of 
 
Appeal increases the sentence it has in mind the principle of double jeopardy 
 
and  imposes  a  lower  sentence  than  would  have  been  imposed  at  trial. 
 
Applying that principle it seems to me Draper should be approached on the 
 
basis that the appropriate sentence by the sentencing judge would have been 
 
8 and a half years following a trial. 
 
 
 
 
14. Whilst I agree with Mr Smith that the aggravating features identified by the 
 
Court  of  Appeal  in  Burridge  are  absent  here  as  they  were  in  Draper, 
 
nonetheless there are aggravating features. As in Draper this is not a case of 
 
a parent driven to the end of his tether by the child. You were alone with 
 
 
James for no more than ten minutes and so it is difficult to see how that kind 
 
of  end  of  your  tether  situation  could  have  developed  in  that  short  a  time 
 
frame. The reality is that for whatever reason your baby son would not bond 
 
with you and cried whenever he came near you. No doubt that was upsetting 
 
and frustrating but it could hardly be said to be something for which a seven 
 
month old baby could be to blame and Hannah had urged you to be patient 
 
and to persevere, which clearly you did not do. 
 
 
 
15. Equally, as in Draper, until the moment earlier this week when you pleaded 
 
guilty  to  manslaughter,  you  have  lied  about  your  responsibility  for  what 
 
happened to your baby son, even to the extent of seeking to attribute to his 
 
mother  the  violence  you  inflicted  on  the  child.  On  any  view  that  is  an 
 
aggravating feature justifying a greater sentence than you would otherwise 
 
receive. Furthermore, although in Draper the defendant sought to explain the 
 
baby’s injuries as attributable to some accident in the baby bouncer as you 
 
have done here, he did not seek to blame the baby’s mother as you did, with 
 
all the agonising consequences for Hannah in this case. That accusation albeit 
 
no  longer  pursued  is  an  additional  aggravating  feature  absent  in  Draper. 
  
Having said that, I accept that this is not a case in which, as in Draper, there 
 
was  some  prior  warning  of  what  might  happen  if  the  child’s  head  hit  the 
 
chair. 
 
 
16. In sentencing you I take into account everything Mr Smith has said on your 
 
behalf in mitigation, including the genuine remorse you have shown together

with  your  previous  good  character,  from  which  I  conclude  that  as  the 
 
prosecution fairly accepts, you are not a bad or violent man. I accept also that 
 
this is not a case of an unwanted child but of a child you wanted and loved 
 
and that you had never previously shown violence towards James or towards 
 
your other son. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
17. Nonetheless	  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  decisions  to  which  I  have  referred 
 
emphasise the court has to focus on the fact that a victim, here a defenceless 
 
and vulnerable baby who was your own child, has died as a consequence of 
 
your unlawful act. In my judgment if this matter had gone to a trial and the 
 
jury had convicted you of manslaughter the appropriate sentence would have 
 
been one of 8 and a half years imprisonment. 
  
 
 
18. Unlike in Draper there is no question of your being entitled to a full credit for 
 
your plea of guilty. In the light of the overwhelming medical evidence that 
 
the injuries suffered by baby James were deliberate and not accidental you 
 
could and should have pleaded guilty at a much earlier stage. You did not in 
 
fact do so until 8 May 2013 the day when the trial was due to start although 
 
ultimately  some  week  and  a  bit  before  the  actual  trial  date.  However, 
 
   
exceptionally  I  take  into  account  that  the  plea  you  have  entered  has  been 
 
 
 
In  the 
under  consideration  with  Mr  Smith  QC  for  about  a  month. 
 
   
circumstances you are entitled to more credit than the one tenth you would 
 
 
 
normally get for a guilty plea just before the trial. The sentence is one of 7 
 
 
years imprisonment, so a credit of just under 20 per cent. 
  
 
 
19. Of that sentence, you will spend one half in custody, after which you will be 
 
released on licence for the remainder of the sentence. If, during your licence 
 
period  you  commit  any  other  offence  you  are  likely  to  be  returned  to 
 
custody.  The  days  spent  on  remand  will  count  towards  the  sentence.  The 
 
statutory surcharge provisions will apply.

AT THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
 

7 JUNE 2013
 
  

 
SENTENCING REMARKS BY MR JUSTICE SINGH
 

 

 

Opemipo Jaji, you were convicted by the jury on 18 April this year of the 

 

rape of an 11 year old girl in Jubilee Park in Edmonton, north London, on 

23 November 2012. Your victim was a little girl whom I will give the 

anonymous initials AB. 

AB was on her way home from school and at around 4:30pm took a bus 

with her friend.  She got off the bus and said goodbye to her friend.  You 

got off the bus at the same stop as her and you then followed her. You 

dragged her into Jubilee Park and subjected her to a horrific ordeal for the 

next 3 hours. Not only did you rape her at least twice. You stuffed one of 

her gloves in her mouth.  You threatened her and said that you had a knife 
 

although you did not in fact produce one. You told her not to tell anyone 
 

about what had happened because you would stab her.  Even the risk of 

 

being seen by a member of the public did not deter you from carrying on 
 

with your vicious attack on your lonely and vulnerable victim: when a 

 

passer-by walking his dog was nearby, you told her to curl up and keep 

quiet so that she would not be noticed.  At one point you even told her that 
 

the incident was being filmed and that you would send the video to her 
 

 

school where people would laugh at her. You left AB with injuries which 

meant that she had to go to hospital where she had to be examined under 

 

anaesthetic and needed stitches. Perhaps even worse, you have left her 
 

with terrible emotional scars. One can only hope that, with the courage 

that she has already shown in giving evidence at this trial, and with the 

support of her family and friends, she can begin the process of recovery.  I 

1
--------
am grateful to AB’s father for the personal impact statement which he has 

 

provided, which your counsel has seen but which, for reasons of privacy, I 

 

will not read out in court. 
 

 
3.	 

Until recently you have shown no remorse for the terrible offence which 

you committed.  Since your conviction you now accept that you did 

 

commit this offence.  As Dr Ian Cumming says in his psychiatric report, at 

 

para. 43, there has been a small insight into your offence but this does 

provide a platform for you to work within a sexual offenders treatment 

programme.  However, I approach the degree of your apparent remorse 
 

with some caution.  I had the opportunity to observe you when you gave 

evidence at your trial.  It is clear to me that you are well capable of lying 
 

 

and of manipulating others around you to suit your own interests. 
 

 
4.	 

The principal mitigating factor in your case is your relatively young age. 
  

You are 18 years old. You are an intelligent young man who had potential. 

You were doing an apprenticeship with a view to becoming a chef and 
 

have an interest in music, which you hoped to develop professionally. I 

bear in mind that a younger person is more likely to be capable of change 

 

and achieving a greater level of maturity; and that a lengthy sentence is 
 

likely to have greater impact on a younger person. 

 
5.	 

But it is also clear that you have an unhealthy interest in little girls. You 

 

have previous convictions.  The first was for robbery and sexual assault on 
 

a 12 year old girl, which again was a stranger attack in a public place, for 

which you received a 10 month Detention and Training Order at Wood 

Green Crown Court on 16 September 2011.  The second conviction was for 

making indecent images of children, for which you received a Youth 

Rehabilitation Order at the North London Youth Court on 5 September 

 

2012. Furthermore, you committed the present offence while you were 

subject to a supervision requirement under that order.  Indeed, one of the 

disturbing features of this case is that you had just been to an 
 

appointment with your probation officer when you got on the same bus as 
 

AB on 23 November.   

 
6.	 

 
7.	 

There is this further feature of this case.  You have told both the probation 

officer, who prepared the Pre-sentence Report, and Dr Cumming that you 

had been planning to rape a girl for about 2 months before your offence, 

although the offence against AB itself was committed on impulse. 

I must follow any relevant sentencing guidelines unless it would be 
 

 

contrary to the interests of justice to do so.  The definitive guideline on 
 

2
--------
sexual offences was issued by the former Sentencing Guidelines Council in 
 

April 2007. The offence of rape is dealt with at pages 24 to 26. It seems to 
 

me (and this was common ground before me) that your offence falls 

within the second category on page 25: in the case of a victim under 13 the 

 

starting point after trial for a person of previous good character would be 

13 years custody. The sentencing range would be 11-17 years custody. You, 

of course, are not a person of previous good character.  I must also bear in 

 

 

 
8.	 

 
9.	 

mind the aggravating factors which I have mentioned.  Nevertheless I 

have to bear in mind your relative youth and the other mitigating factors 

 

which I have outlined.  In my judgement, the appropriate determinate 

term in this case would be 16 years. 

However I also have to consider the question of whether you are a 

 

dangerous offender and the appropriate sentences for such an offender: 

either an extended sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice 

 

Act 2003, as amended by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of 

Offenders Act 2012, or a discretionary life sentence. 

I have considered the decisions of the Court of Appeal which have been 

 

drawn to my attention, in particular Attorney General’s Reference (No. 32 

 

of 1996) (Whittaker) [1997] 1 Cr App R (S) 261.  As was made clear by 

Lord Bingham CJ in that case at p.264, there are two main conditions 

before a discretionary life sentence can be imposed.  The first condition is 
 

 

that the offence is a very serious one.  That is clearly satisfied in your case.  

The second condition is that there are good grounds for believing that the 

 

offender may remain a serious danger to the public for a period which 

 

cannot be reliably estimated at the date of sentence.  By “serious danger” 

the Court had in mind particularly serious offences of violence and serious 

sexual offences.  Although the reason for this will often be related to the 

 

mental condition of an offender, the crucial question is whether on all the 

facts it appears that an offender is likely to represent a serious danger to 

the public for an indeterminate time. 

 
10.	 

In the present case, I am satisfied that the second condition is also 
 

satisfied.  In his report for this Court Dr Cumming makes clear, at paras. 
 

39-42, that: 

(1) 	

(2) 

There is no evidence of a mental illness. 

You have demonstrated an evolution of predatory sexual 

behaviour towards young pre-pubescent girls. 

3
--------
11.	 

 
12.	 

(3) 

It seems very likely that the offence would have been repeated 

again if you had not been caught. 

 

(4) 

You can only be considered to pose a high risk of future 

offending. 

I also base myself on the assessment of dangerousness in the Pre-sentence 

 

Report, in particular at sections 4 and 5.   

Indeed it was not disputed by counsel on your behalf that you do meet the 

test of dangerousness by reference to those two reports.  Counsel focussed 

her plea in mitigation on the submission that an extended sentence would 

afford adequate protection to the public in this case.  She submitted that 

an appropriate custodial period together with an extension period perhaps 

as long as the maximum permitted by law (8 years) would mean that you 

 

would be likely to be subject either to custody or intensive supervision 

 

under licence until you were perhaps in your early 40s. 
 

 
13.	 

I have given careful consideration to the question whether adequate 
 

protection can be given to the public in this case by imposing a lesser 

sentence, for example a determinate sentence combined with a Sexual 

Offences Prevention Order or an extended sentence.  I have given anxious 

 

 

consideration to that question, in particular because of your relatively 

young age, although you are as a matter of law an adult.  However, in all 

the circumstances of this case,  I do not believe that the public would be 

 

adequately protected from you if you were the subject of any sentence 
 

other than a life sentence.  The fundamental difficulty, in my view, lies in 
 

the answer to the question that counsel accepted has to be posed in 
 

accordance with the test in Whittaker: is the period that you are likely to 
 

 

be dangerous capable of reliable estimation as of today?  I have come to 

the conclusion that it is not.  In this context I note what the Pre-sentence 
 

 

Report says, at p.14, in considering the possibility of an extended 

sentence: “a potential concern is that Mr Jaji could be automatically 

 

released without having undertaken the necessary treatment or work to 

reduce his risk.  Even though he would be subject to a lengthy licence 

period there may be further concerns about the management of his risk in 

the community.” 

 
14.	 

In imposing a life sentence I must set the minimum term that you must 

 

 

serve before you can be considered for release on licence, which should be 
 

 

half of the appropriate determinate sentence.  It is important to emphasise 

that this is not the actual term that you will serve in custody.  It is the 

4
--------
15.	 

 
16.	 

 
17.	 
 
18.	 

 
19.	 

 

minimum term that you must serve before you can be considered for 

release by the Parole Board.  The time that you actually spend in custody 

may well be longer.  The Parole Board will only direct your release on 

licence if it is satisfied that you are no longer a danger to members of the 
 

public.  Even if you are released you will remain on licence for the rest of 
 

your life and will be liable to recall by the Secretary of State. 

The sentence of the court therefore is custody for life.  The minimum term 

 

that you will serve is 8 years, less the time that you  have already spent on 

remand. 

In addition you will be subject to the sex offender notification rules for the 
 

rest of your life.  You will be disqualified from working with children and 
 

you will be placed on the barring list under the Safeguarding of Vulnerable 
 

 

 

Groups Act 2006. 

The earlier order of the Youth Court is revoked. 
 

The statutory surcharge provisions apply to this case and an appropriate 

 

order will be drawn up accordingly. 

Finally I would like to pay tribute to the victim AB and her family in this 

 

case for the courageous way in which they have approached this case 
 

 

 

throughout.  I would also like to pay tribute to the police officers who 

 

investigated this case: they were very quick to get to Jubilee Park, to 

secure the scene of the crime, and were able to apprehend this serious 
 

offender within days. They also dealt sensitively with this very difficult 

case, concerning as it did a young victim.  I would also like to thank all 

counsel for the way in which they have presented the case and the 
 

assistance they have given the Court.

 JAMES MCCORMICK
 

 

 
CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
 

 

2 MAY 2013 


 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE  HONE  QC
 

 

 

 

This is a most serious case.  You are the driving force and sole director of ATSC Ltd and 

  

 

you, with a small number of agents employed by you, sold over 7000 ADE devices to the 

 

Iraqi Government and other international agencies for prices varying between $30,000 
 

 

and a low point of $2,500 per unit.  One composite invoice shows total sales in excess of 

 

$38m to Iraq over nearly three years. You sold in lesser quantities to other countries and 

in your evidence you acknowledged sales exceeding $50m.  The cost of the ADE devices, 
 

 

 

modelled  on  failed  American  manufactured  Golf  Ball  Detectors,  was  below  $50  a  unit. 
 

 

The device was useless, the profit outrageous and your culpability as a fraudster has to be 
 

 

placed  in  the  highest  category.    The  principal  aggravating  feature  is  that  although  it 
 

 

 

 

 

cannot be proved that the use of the device caused a specific death or loss of limb – and I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  that  at  Iraqi  checkpoints  other  detection  devices  were  used  –  yet  what  you 

 

 

 

perpetrated was a callous confidence trick.  The jury found that you knew the devices did 

  

 

not  work,  yet  the  soldiers  in  Iraq  and  elsewhere  believed  in  them,  in  part  due  to  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

powers of salesmanship and in part the extravagant and fraudulent claims made in your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

promotional material.  After a six week trial, I am wholly satisfied that your fraudulent 

 

 

conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted a false 

sense of security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury 
 

to innocent individuals.  It is this exceptional feature which distinguishes your case from 
 

 

 

 

the usual case of fraud.  Although I have paid attention to the Sentencing Guideline, your 
 

  

 

 

 

case  is  far  outside  any  of  parameters  set  out  and  neither  the  starting  points  nor  the 

 

 

 

1
--------
sentencing ranges are adequate for your case. Although you have been convicted of three 

 

 
counts because you produced three devices, it seems to me the three devices were very 

 

 
similar and there was one course of conduct. In terms of culpability and harm,  I have 

  

 

  
been unable to imagine a more serious case of its kind.  There are five relevant matters. 

  

 

 

 

 

First, well over 7000 devices were sold in Iraq and elsewhere; second, they were sold and 

used for a period of nearly three years and indeed in some arenas they remain in use as a 

 

 

 

 
continuing potential danger to life; third, soldiers, police forces, border customs officers, 

 

 

 

hotel security staff and many other users trusted their lives to the overpriced devices sold 

 

 

 
by you, which were no more than crude plastic components with a disconnected antenna 

 

 

 
and  a  capability  of  detecting  explosives  no  better  than  random  chance;  fourth,  your 

 

 

 

profits were obscene, funding grand houses, a greedy and extravagant lifestyle and even 

 

 

 

a yacht;  fifth, you have neither insight, shame or any sense of remorse.  Even now you 

 

 

insist  they  work,  in  a  vain  effort  to  minimise  your  culpability.  There  is  no  significant 

 

 
personal mitigation. You fought the case in the teeth of overwhelming evidence.  In a last 

desperate gamble, you rolled the dice with the jury and you lost. 

 

 

 

 
As I have said, it is difficult to think of a more serious case.  It is possible that other cases 

 

 

 

may  equal  what  you  did  and  some  may  conceivably  involve  more  money,  but  I  am 

 

 

  
confident that no other case can be significantly worse in terms of culpability and harm. 

 
In  addition,  a  maximum  sentence  in  your  case  can  be  justified  to  deter  others  from 

 

 
committing  similar  offences.    The  five  points  I  have  mentioned,  in  particular  your 

 

 

 
cavalier disregard of the potentially fatal consequences of your fraudulent activity, have 

 

convinced me that the appropriate sentence in your case is the rare step of passing the 

 

 

 
maximum that section 7 of the Fraud Act 2006 allows.  The sentence of the court is that 

 

 

 

 

 

you  must  serve  the  maximum  term  of  10  years  imprisonment  on  each  count 

 

 

concurrently. 

 

You will serve half that term in custody and you will then be released on licence.  If you 

 

 

commit  any  further  offence  or  breach  the  terms  of  your  licence  you  will  surely  be 

 

 

 
returned to custody.  Confiscation proceedings will follow.  That concludes the sentence 

 
in your case.

The jury have convicted this Defendant of the murder of Roxie Archer. She was just under two years 
 
of age at the time that he killed her.  It was an appalling crime which involved a grown and powerful 
 
man inflicting a number of hard blows on a toddler which were sufficiently forceful to cause 
 
devastating brain damage from which she died. The Defendant was not the father of Roxie. He was 
 
 
living with Roxie’s mother at the time and had been entrusted with the care of Roxie for 24 hours 
 
 
 
while her mother was away. 
 
  
It had previously been arranged that Roxie would be looked after by her grandmother. I am satisfied 
 
that that arrangement was changed to the Defendant having her for a day at the insistence of the 
 
 
Defendant rather than at Sophie’s request as he said. 
 
  
At about 5 pm the Defendant told Roxie’s grandmother on the phone that Roxie had suffered an 
 
injury by walking into a door at McDonald’s. He later posted the same story on Facebook. He has 
 
admitted that that account was a lie. I do not believe his explanation for that lie. I am satisfied that 
 
he lied to cover up an injury that he had caused to Roxie by that time. That was not the only injury 
 
inflicted. How the Defendant caused any of the injuries to Roxie is not clear but the jury have clearly 
 
 
rejected the Defendant’s account that they were caused by an accidental fall down the stairs. 
 
  
I have read a victim impact statement from Roxie's mother. The extent of the suffering that this has 
 
 
caused to Roxie’s family and in particular to Roxie’s mother cannot be fully appreciated by any of us 
 
 
who have not gone through it. Roxie was a much loved only child who was the centre of her mother’s 
 
 
existence. I have no doubt that she will never completely get over her loss. 
 
 
By law the sentence is one of life imprisonment for the offence of murder and that is the sentence 
 
that I will pass but in addition I have to fix the minimum period that the Defendant must serve before 
 
 
he can be considered for parole. It is important that the public understand what that means. It 
 
means that fixes the time at which the Parole Board can first consider his release. It does not mean 
 
that he will be released at that time or will ever be released. That is a decision for the parole board 
 
depending on their view of the danger that he presents to the public and in particular to young 
 
children. Even if released, he will remain on licence for the rest of his life subject to being recalled to 
 
 
prison if he breaches that licence. 
 
  
In fixing the minimum term I have in mind the provisions as to starting points and aggravating and 
 
mitigating factors set out in Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It is agreed by counsel and I 
 
   
accept that the starting point is 15 years. The aggravating factors are that Roxie was particularly 
 
vulnerable because of her age and that at the time of the offence the Defendant was entrusted with 
 
 
the sole care of Roxie. Those are agreed. The Prosecution contend that in addition I should conclude 
 
that Roxie suffered pain and suffering before her death. While I am satisfied that at least one injury 
 
was inflicted on Roxie by the Defendant before 5 pm which caused the McDonald’s lie, I cannot be 
 
 
sure that that was a serious injury indeed I think it is likely that it was not. Further injuries were
--------
inflicted by a number of blows at a later stage. There is no evidence that they were not all inflicted at 
 
 
the same time and I cannot be sure that they weren’t.  I only give limited effect to that aggravating 
 
factor. The mitigating factors are that this was an unpremeditated attack although it may not have 
 
been limited to one assault. The Defendant is a man of good character. While I accept that Roxie may 
 
not have been easy to look after that day as she was not well and the Defendant had limited 
 
parenting experience, I do not consider that to be of great significance when he only had to look 
 
 
 
after her for one day and it was at his insistence that he had the care of her. 
 
  
I will give some but limited weight as a mitigating factor to the Defendant’s age. He was 20 at the 
 
 
 
time of the offence. 
 
 
Aggravating and mitigating factors do not have the same weight when considering the appropriate 
 
sentence. In this case Roxie’s age and the breach of trust are particularly significant. 
 
  
Ben Raftery I sentence you to life imprisonment. The minimum period that you will have to serve 
 
before you are eligible for parole is 18 years.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE WYN WILLIAMS
 

 
 

Matthew  Tvrdon  you  have  pleaded  guilty  to  one  offence  of  manslaughter, 
 

seven offences of attempted murder, two offences of causing grievous bodily 
 

harm  with  intent,  two  offences  of  attempting  to  cause  grievous  bodily  harm 

with  intent,  five  offences  of  assault  occasioning  actual  bodily  harm,  one 

offence of common assault and one offence of dangerous driving.  Those pleas 

have been accepted by the prosecution, quite rightly in my view.  The plea to 
 

manslaughter  was  tendered  in  respect  of  a  count  alleging  that  you  had 

murdered a young woman named Karina Menzies.  You pleaded not guilty to 

 

 

murder  but  guilty  to  manslaughter  on  the  grounds  of  diminished 
 

responsibility;  that  means  that  at  the  time  you  committed  the  offence  of 
 

killing  Ms  Menzies  you  were  suffering  from  an  abnormality  of  mental 
 

functioning brought about by a recognised mental illness which substantially 
 

impaired your ability to form a rational judgment in relation to what you were 
 

doing. 

 
2.	 

 

The  events  giving  rise  to  these  pleas  took  place  on  Friday  afternoon  19 

October 2012 over the space of approximately 30 minutes between about 3.30 

and  4.00pm.    During  the  course  of  his  comprehensive  opening  Mr  Murphy 

QC  provided  graphic  detail  of  what  you  did.

   

  No  useful  purpose  would  be  
 

 

 

served  by  me  repeating  in  detail  what  Mr  Murphy  said;  the  people  in  this 
 

packed court and the wider public through the media are now well acquainted 
 

with your actions.  In summary, however, during that half an hour you used 
 

your van as a weapon.  You used it to kill Karina Menzies.  You ran her over 
 

  

quite  deliberately  while  she  and  her  two  children  were  walking  on  the
--------
forecourt of Ely Fire Station.  There is compelling evidence that you ran over 
 

her  not  once  but  twice.    She  died  from  multiple  injuries  caused  by  your 

deliberate  actions.    You  caused  serious  bodily  injury  to  her  child  Tiana 

intending to do so and attempted to cause such injury, intending to do so, to 
 

her  child  Ellie.    The  children  were  then  aged  3  and  8  respectively.    You 

attempted  to  kill  Mandy  Morgan  while  she  was  walking  along  the  pavement 
 

with  her  two  children.    They  were  walking  along  Crossways  Road  in  the 

 

vicinity  of  Ely  Police  Station.    You  drove  onto  the  pavement  and  struck  Ms 
 

 

Morgan.  You intended to kill her and you caused her very significant injuries. 

You  also  caused  serious  injuries  to  her  child  Deeroy  intending  to  do  so  and 

attempted to cause such injuries to her child Kieanoh, again intending to do 

so.  At  the  time  these  children  were  aged  9  and  8.    Anastasia  Jones  was 
 

walking along Cowbridge Road West in the vicinity of the Reptile Centre when 
 

you  deliberately  drove  into  her  intending  to  kill  her.    She  suffered  very 

significant injuries.  She was walking with her partner Adam Lewis and their 
 

baby Amelia was in a pram. Miraculously, no significant injury was suffered 

by  Mr  Lewis  or  the  baby  although  you  have  pleaded  guilty  to  assaulting  the 

 

baby  causing  her  actual  bodily  harm  and  common  assault  upon  Mr  Lewis. 
  

Renee Selio and her two children, Jada Selio and Shaielle Selio were crossing 

the road on a pedestrian crossing in Grand Avenue in Ely when, quite literally, 
 

 

you drove straight at them.  You have pleaded guilty to attempting to murder 
 

all  three.  Each  of  them  was  lucky  to  survive  and  Shaielle  was  even  more 

 

 

fortunate  in  that  her  physical  injuries  were  very  minor.   Jada  was  10  at  the  
 

 

 

time  of  this  incident  and  Shaielle  was  12.    From  Ely  you  drove  to  the  petrol 

filling station at Leckwith Retail Park.  You became involve in an altercation 
 

 

 

with three people Lisa Carpin, Shah Kamruzzan and Awtar Singh.  You struck 
 

each of them with a crook look and caused each of them some injury.  What 
 

 

followed next was captured in pictures shown in this court. Gill White stood in 
 

front  of  your  van  to  confront  you  because  you  had  struck  her  car.  After  no 
 

more than a few moments hesitation you mowed her down by driving the van 
 

directly at her.  She was dragged some distance under the van.  Her daughter 

Rebecca  White was  nearby  and  she  ran  after you and  got  to the front of the 

 

 

van.  You then drove straight over her.  By your plea you have accepted that 
 

 

you intended to kill both those women.  Both suffered very serious injuries. 

 

 
3.	 

None of the victims knew you and the reality is that you did not know any of 
 

your  victims  although  as  I  shall  explain  I  accept  that  you  probably  believed 
 

that you did know the adults.
--------
4.	 

Your  trail  of  destruction  was  brought  to  an  end  only  as  a  consequence  of 
 

determined  action  on  the  part  of  the  police.    The  police  chase  and  the 
 

measures  taken  to  force  you  to  stop  your  van  were  captured  on  camera  and 
 

shown  in  court.  I  shall  not  attempt  to  describe  what  happened  in  words.  I 

should  record  however,  that  during  the  course  of  your  arrest  you  became 

violent and struck PC Brien with the crook lock causing him some injury.  You 
 

were overpowered only after you had been sprayed with CS gas.  

 
5.	 

 
6.	 

 
7.	 

Mr  Murphy  introduced  this  case  by  telling  me  that  it  concerned  a  series  of  
 

 

 

deliberate and horrific incidents.  Having heard his detailed opening and seen 
 

CCTV  footage  and  photographs  I  agree  with  that  assessment.    On  any  view 

you have committed  a large number of grave  crimes.  In total there were 18 
 

people directly affected by your actions but I have little doubt that they have 

impacted  profoundly  on  many  more.  You  have  caused  incalculable  harm  to 
 

 

many people. 

There has been an extensive investigation in order to ascertain why it was that 

you behaved as you did.  It is urged upon me by Mr Keleher QC, your leading 

 

 

 

 

counsel, that a clear answer has emerged.  It is submitted on your behalf that 
 

  

 

 

at the time you committed these crimes you were in the grip of a very serious 

mental illness and that your actions are wholly explicable by that illness.  It is 
 

to this issue that I turn next. 

You  have  been  the  subject  of  very  detailed  psychiatric  analysis.    Two 
 

comprehensive  written  reports  have  been  obtained  on  your  behalf  from  Dr  
 

Frank  Farnham,  a  consultant  forensic  psychiatrist  of  very  significant 

experience.  The  reports  are  dated  18  February  2013and  3  April  2013.  The 

prosecution  has  commissioned  a  report  dated  9  May  2013  from  Dr  Philip 

Joseph.  He, too, is a very experienced consultant forensic psychiatrist.  I have 

heard oral evidence from Dr John Crosby.  Dr Crosby is a consultant forensic 
 

 

psychiatrist  who  works  at  Ashworth  Maximum  Security  Hospital  near 

Liverpool.  He has been responsible for your care at that institution since your 

transfer from prison in January of this year.  Each of those three agree that at 
 

the time you committed these offences you were suffering from a very severe 
 

 

mental  illness  known  as  paranoid  schizophrenia.    Their  view  is  that  you 
 

suffered  a  variety  of  symptoms  as  a  consequence  of  this  illness  but  in 

particular paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations.  In plain language 

the paranoid delusions from which you suffered made you believe that there 
 

people  conspiring  against  you  to  do  harm  to  you  and  the  auditory 
 

hallucinations  were  voices  which  at  least  possibly  were  commanding  you  to
--------
act against the persons who you believed were persecuting you.  In his report 

 

of 3 April 2013 Dr Farnham puts it in this way:- 

“In  my  opinion  Mr  Tvrdon  was,  by  virtue  of  a  schizophrenic 

illness  –  a  psychotic  disorder  with  symptoms  including 

paranoid delusional beliefs and auditory hallucinations, which 

were  possibly  commanding  in  nature,  suffering  from  an 
 

abnormality  of  mental  functioning,  which  arose  from  a 

recognised  medical condition, paranoid schizophrenia.  In my 

opinion his mental functioning was abnormal by virtue of both 
 

 

a  general  lack  of  contact  with  reality  and  specific  paranoid 

delusions  and  possible  command  hallucinations. 

His 
 

delusional  beliefs were that a group of people, some of whom 
 

work  with  him  at  HMRC  had  been  “gaslighting”  or  otherwise  
 

psychologically  bullying  him  over  a  period  of  12  years  and  he 

felt compelled to act against them and to demonstrate physical 

aggression to prove that he was not a “pushover”.” 

 

It  is  apparent,  too,  that  on  19  October  2012  you  probably  believed  that  the  
 

 

adults whom you attacked were in some way connected to the group of people 
 

 

 

 
8.	 

 
9.	 

who were conspiring to do you harm.   

In  the  light  of  the  views  expressed  by  Dr  Farnham  and  Dr  Joseph  I  am 
 

prepared to accept that your mental illness provides the explanation for your 
 

acts  on  that  Friday  afternoon.    Without  your  serious  mental  illness  I  am 
 

satisfied that you would not have behaved as you did.  

 

During  the  course  of  his  opening  I  asked  Mr  Murphy  QC  whether  he  was 

prepared to offer a view upon your culpability for your crimes given that you 

were  suffering  from  a  serious  mental  illness  when  you  committed  them.  Mr 
 

Murphy’s  response  was  to  submit  that  your  culpability  was  high.  He  relied 

upon the terrible harm  which you caused, the period of time over which the 

 

offences were committed and the fact that you had pleaded guilty to offences 
 

of  attempted  murder  –  offences  which  can  be  proved  only  if  an  intention  to 

kill is established. 

 
10.	 

Neither Dr Farnham nor Dr Crosby has offered a view about your culpability 

 

for  your  crimes.    However,  this  issue  has  been  addressed,  in  terms,  in  an  e-

mail  dated  30  May  2013  from  Dr  Joseph  to  the  prosecuting  authorities.    In 
 

that email he expresses the clear view that your culpability should be regarded 
 

as low in the light of your very severe mental illness at the relevant time and 
 

the lack any evidence to suggest that you are aggressive when you are well.
--------
11.	 

I  have  reflected  anxiously  and  with  care  upon  Dr  Joseph’s  opinion.    Having 

 

done  so  I  am  prepared  to  accept  that  he  is  correct  in  his  assessment.  There 

 

 

can be no doubt about the diagnosis of severe mental illness in this case.  As 

long ago as 2003 you were diagnosed as suffering from paranoia and the view 

 

was  then  expressed  that  you  probably  had  a  schizophrenic  illness  with 

depressive  symptoms. 

   

In  2007  a  similar  diagnosis  was  made.  As  I 

 

 

understand  it  throughout  the  period  2003  to  2011  you  were  treated  with 

 

appropriate medication for such an illness. 

    

 
12.	 

In  October  2011  your  condition  was  reviewed  in  outpatients.    You  were 
 

apparently advised to phase out your medication over a period of about a year.  

It  is  not  entirely  clear  what  you  did  but  there  is  no  reason  to  suppose  other 
 

than that you accepted the advice then given.  That means that in the period 
 

of about one year preceding October 2012 you were gradually taking less and 
 

less  anti-psychotic  medication.  In  judging  your  culpability  I  accept  that  it 

   

 

would  not  be  appropriate  to  proceed  on  the  basis  that  you  failed  to  take 
 

medication  made  available  to  you.    Rather,  it  seems  at  least  likely  that  you 

 

 

ceased to take appropriate medication simply because you were advised so to 

do. There can be no doubt that the absence of medication during the period 

leading to October 2012 had a significant effect upon your health but I do not 

 

consider it appropriate to attach any blameworthiness to you for that state of 
 

affairs . 

 
13.	 

 
14.	 

There is a substantial body of evidence from those who knew you well which 

demonstrates  that  in  the  days  prior  to  19  October  2012  you  were  behaving 

oddly and irrationally.  That reinforces my view that on 19 October you were 
 

in the thrall of a serious illness. 
 

 

You had no convictions of any kind recorded against you prior to the events of 
 

19 October 2012. All the factual information supplied to me from those who 
 

know you suggests that when you are well you are non-violent and no threat 
 

 

to anyone. 

15.	  With respect to Mr Murphy QC I do not consider that the incalculable harm 
 

 

you caused can be used to show that your culpability for your crimes must be 

high.  In  the  sentencing  guidelines  which  have  been  issued  in  respect  of 
 

offences of violence a clear distinction is always drawn between culpability on 

the  one  hand  and  harm  on  the  other.    Further,  I  am  not  persuaded  in  the 

context  of  this  case,  at  least,  that  the  fact  that  you  admit  intending  to  kill  a 
 

number of people is a sure guide to your culpability.  That intent was formed 
 

 

while  you  were  in  the  grip  of  the  illness  which  I  have  described.    There  is
--------
nothing before me to suggest that you were capable of forming that intent in 

the absence of such an illness. 

 
16.	 

To repeat, therefore, I am prepared to accept the view of Dr Joseph as to your 
 

culpability.    That  said  I  should  make  two  things  crystal  clear.  First  your 
 

 

medical records have shown that you are capable of masking your illness.  It is 

important for those who may treat you hereafter to appreciate that from the 

outset.  Second  I  have  no  doubt  that  the  tragic  events  of  19  October 
 

demonstrate that when you are in the grip of your illness you are capable of 
 

extreme violence; when your symptoms are severe you are a very significant 

danger to the public.    

       

 
17.	 

In the light of these conclusions what is the correct disposal in this case?  The 

 

reality is that there are three alternatives.  The first option is the imposition of 
 

an  indeterminate  sentence  of  imprisonment.    The  second  option  is  the 

imposition of such a term but coupled with a direction under section 45A of 

the  Mental  Health  Act  1983.    The  third  option  is  a  hospital  order  under 
 

 

section 37 of that Act together with a restriction order under section 41. 

 

18.	  Mr Keleher QC, on your behalf, submits that this is a clear case for a hospital 

 

order  under  section  37  Mental  Health  Act  1983  coupled  with  a  restriction 
 

 

under  section  41.  He  submits  that  there  are  powerful  reasons  why  such  an 

   

 

order  should  be  made.  First,  none  of  these  offences  would  have  been 
 

 

committed but for your very serious mental illness.  Second, you are a serious 
 

risk to the public only by virtue of your mental illness.  Third your risk can be 
 

best  managed  in  the  setting  of  a  secure  hospital  where  you  will  be  provided 
 

with appropriate medical treatment.  While the nature of your illness is such 

that you may suffer relapses it is not suggested that the illness is incapable of 
 

treatment.  Fourth,  decisions  about  whether  you  should  ever  be  released  are 
 

 

best made by a Tribunal which is expert in assessing your mental state.  Fifth, 
 

 

should there come a time when it is considered appropriate that you should 
 

be  released  from  hospital  you  can  be  made  the  subject  of  appropriate 

conditions to ensure that your mental health does not deteriorate and which 

 

would  permit  your  recall  to  hospital  in  the  event  that  you  failed  to  abide  by 
 

such  conditions.    Sixth  and  very  importantly,  the  making  of  this  order  is 
 

supported unequivocally by Dr Farnham, Dr Joseph and Dr Crosby. If I make 
 

 

the order you will be detained at Ashworth. 
 

 
19.	 

I should also record that Mr Keleher submits that you have demonstrated true 

 

remorse for what you have done.  On its own in a case of this kind this feature 
 

  

 

is  of  comparatively  little  weight  in  determining  the  correct  disposal.
--------
Nonetheless it is true that as your health began to improve after your transfer 
 

to  Ashworth  you  began  more  clearly  to  appreciate  the  enormity  of  what  you 
 

had done.  That recognition caused you to have a significant relapse in your 
 

state of health and I am prepared to accept that you do have genuine remorse 

for your actions on 19 October. 

  

20.	  Having  reflected  upon  Mr  Keleher’s  submissions  overnight  and  all  the 

 

decisions of the Court of Appeal mentioned in the current edition of Archbold 

and, in particular, the decision in I.A. [2005] EWCA Crim 2077 I have reached 

the  conclusion  that  I  should  accept  what  Mr  Keleher  QC  says  and  make  a 
 

 

hospital order. 

 
21.	 

 
22.	 

 
23.	 

 
24.	 

Section  37  of  the  Mental  Health  Act  1983  permits  me  to  make  a  hospital 
 

 

 

order if the following conditions are satisfied, namely  

“ 2(a) 
 

the court is satisfied, on the written or oral evidence of 

 

two  registered  medical  practitioners,  that  the  offender  is 

suffering from mental disorder and that either – 

 

(i) the mental disorder from which the offender is suffering is 

 

of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be 

detained  in  a  hospital  for  medical  treatment  and  appropriate 

medical treatment is available for him;    

(ii) 

(b) 

…… 

the  court  is  of  the  opinion  having  regard  to  all  the 

circumstances,  including  the  nature  of  the  offence  and  the 

character  and  antecedents  of  the  offender,  and  to  the  other 

available  methods  of  dealing  with  him,  that  the  most  suitable 

 

method  of  disposing  of  a  case  is  by  means  of  an  order  under 
 

this section.” 

I  am  satisfied  that  those  statutory  criteria  are  met  in  this  case  and,  in 

particular, I am satisfied that a hospital order is the most suitable method of 

disposing of this case.  

Section 41 of 1983 Act permits me to make a restriction order if having regard 
 

 

 

to  the  nature  of  your  offences,  your  antecedents  and  the  risk  of  you 

committing  further  offences  if  set  at  large  it  is  necessary  to  make  such  an  
 

 

 

 

order to protect the public from serious harm.  I am so satisfied in this case. 

Having  reviewed  the  options  open  to  me,  to  repeat,  I  am  satisfied  that  the 

making  of  a  hospital  order  coupled  with  a  restriction  order  is  the  most 

suitable way of disposing of this case.
--------
25.	 

I should explain, shortly, what that means in practice.  I will make an order 
 

 

that you should be detained at Ashworth Maximum Security Hospital without 

restriction of time.  You will be released from that institution only if a Mental 

Health Tribunal considers it appropriate that you should be released.  Given 

 

the nature and severity of your illness and the harm which you caused when 

 

 

in  the  grip  of  that  illness  you  should  expect  that  you  will  be  detained  in  
 

hospital for a very long period of time. 

 
26.	 

 
27.	 

In respect of all the offences to which you have pleaded guilty I make hospital 

orders with a restriction order as I have described. 
 

I make the following further orders.  First, I direct the forfeiture of your Clio 

motor car and the van.  Second, I direct that you should be disqualified from 

 

driving for a period of 25 and that before you be permitted to drive again you 

should take an extended driving test. 

 

 

 
28.	 

I conclude these remarks by paying my own public tribute to three categories 
 

of persons affected by what occurred. First, I pay tribute to the stoicism and 
 

resilience  of  the  family  of  Ms  Menzies  and  all  the  other  victims  and  their 
 

families. Second, I pay tribute to all those members of the public who sought 
 

to assist in their own way as events unfolded, particularly those who afforded 
 

 

care  to  your  victims  until  the  emergency  services  were  able  to  respond. 

 

 

Finally,  I  pay  tribute  to  those  police  officers  who  did  all  that  they  could  to 

 

arrest  you  and  members  of  the  emergency  services  and  hospital  staff  who 

 

were called upon to provide emergency care in very difficult circumstances.",2013-06-06 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

The facts of this case are extraordinary and almost unique. 
 
 
At first blush, it seemed unlikely that a woman of your age, a mother of five children 
 
with no previous convictions should even contemplate setting fire to a house let 
 
alone a house with people in it. 
 
 
With the benefit of having heard the evidence, I have concluded that the root cause 
 
of your offending was probably your jealous hatred of Samantha Schofield, whom 
 
you blamed for having an affair with your partner, Steven Clarkson. That hatred, 
 
which was all the more intense because of your drink problem, took over your life 
 
but I am satisfied that the threats you made to set fire to her house were not threats 
 
you intended to carry out. I am satisfied that the burning of matches was a drunken 
 
gesture which did not amount to an attempt to set the house on fire ‐ had you 
 
intended to set fire to her house, you had every opportunity to do so. 
 
 
All the while, your relationship with Steven Clarkson continued to be an uncertain 
 
and uneasy one. 
 
  
It was in these circumstances that you took out your unhappiness and frustrations 
 
on Lee‐Anna Shiers and she became the focus of your attentions. You are a naturally 
 
very tidy person and so you resented any mess she made; the minor inconvenience 
 
of the presence of the pushchair in the hallway, the cigarette ends outside the front 
 
door and the noises from upstairs became issues which grew out of all proportion. 
 
  
On that Friday evening, all the indications were that Steven Clarkson wanted little to 
 
do with you and had gone home to sleep. The evidence of his twin brother and niece 
 
was that you still suspected him of associating with Samantha Schofield and once 
 
again you were giving vent to your hatred of her. You had been drinking, and while
--------
not drunk, you were certainly affected by alcohol. You bought a takeaway meal for 
 
yourself – the evidence was you ordered two or three starters – and went home to 
 
eat it alone while he was asleep in bed. 
 
 
My belief is that at that moment you were probably a very sad woman and it was the 
 
 
sound of Lee‐Anna and Liam’s love‐making from the flat above that overwhelmed 
 
you. Bitterly resentful of their happiness, you went outside and set fire to the push 
 
chair. It follows that you acted on impulse and so this was not a premeditated act. 
 
My belief is you did not know Bailey and Skye were there but that reduces your 
 
culpability only marginally because you were clearly indifferent to the presence of 
 
 
 
others in the flat upstairs. 
 
     
When, contrary to what you had intended, the fire spread to your flat, you escaped, 
 
probably by the back door, shouting at Steven Clarkson to get him to follow you. 
 
 
The setting fire to the push chair was an act of exceptional wickedness, almost 
 
unparalleled in its consequences. For those who had to hear the evidence of the 999 
 
calls, the horror of those moments in the flat upstairs as Lee‐Anna and Liam faced 
 
the awful inevitability of their imminent deaths will be forever etched on their 
 
memories. Understandably the knowledge of the manner of their deaths has added 
 
to the overwhelming grief of their families, all the more to those who rushed to the 
 
house in the hope they could help. I have had regard to the contents of the three 
 
victim statements. Each witness wrote eloquently of the effects upon them and their 
 
families of their losses. 
 
 
That grief will not have been mitigated by any meaningful remorse on your part. You 
 
continue to portray yourself as a victim, blinding yourself to the sufferings of the real 
 
victims in this case and failing to at least acknowledge that it was your deliberate act 
 
which started the fire. 
 
 
I agree with the submissions of Mr Murphy and Mr Riordan that the appropriate 
 
 
starting point is one of 30 years. While there is some mitigation from your previous 
 
 
good character and the fact these were not premeditated offences, that is balanced 
 
 
by the number who were murdered by you. I have had regard to your age. 
 
 
The sentence for each of the counts of murder is Life Imprisonment with a minimum 
 
term of 30 years less the days you have spent on remand in custody. There will be no 
 
separate penalty on Count 1 of the indictment.",2013-05-08 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

VP and CH in the spring of 2003 you had been married for nearly 20 years.  You had, 
between you, five children.  You each had a stellar career, which had already brought 
you considerable success and wealth. 
 
But you also had a problem. For the fourth time in just over a year you CH had been 
caught speeding (on this occasion by a camera on the M11 as you were driving home 
in your BMW), therefore a course of justice had begun by the sending of the 
necessary forms to you as the registered keeper at the family home, and thus (if you 
completed the relevant form truthfully as was your duty) you were facing the prospect 
of being disqualified from driving for at least six months. You CH were, at that time, 
involved in a contest to gain the Lib Dem nomination for the Eastleigh constituency, 
and I have no doubt that both of you were concerned that the loss of your licence CH 
(whoever drove for you during the period of disqualification) might damage your 
image, and thus your chances of success. Equally I have no doubt that, in any event, 
you were both concerned as to the inconvenience to you VP - in particular of taking 
on all the marital and parental driving duties. 
 
Thus it was that, acting together, out of the combination, I have no doubt, of a shared 
ambition as to the further success of your political career CH, and a shared desire not 
to suffer inconvenience, you decided not to tell the truth, but instead to pervert the 
course of justice by pretending that you VP had been driving CH’s car at the time of 
the offence.  To that end, the relevant form addressed to you CH was returned to the 
authorities nominating VP as the driver, and you VP signed the form that was then 
sent to you to confirm that you were the driver.  In the result, in May 2003, you VP 
were fined £60 and your licence was endorsed with three points. Hence the course of 
justice was perverted. 
 
No doubt you thought that you would get away with it.  After all, only you CH had 
been in the car at the time of the offence, it had taken place at night, the camera was 
forward facing, and you could choose who, if anyone, to share the secret with. 

 

1
--------
And you did get away with it for some eight years, achieving in the result not only 
your nomination CH, but also your eventual election as the MP for Eastleigh and your 
eventual rise to a seat in the Cabinet – all, I have no doubt, supported by you VP. 
 
Whilst ironic, it is no mitigation (beyond saving you from disqualification now) that, 
only five months after the offence, you CH were disqualified from driving for six 
months under the totting up provisions. 
 
Nor do the circumstances in which your joint offence eventually came to light reflect 
any credit on either of you. 
 
At some point you CH began an affair, and in June 2010 (when the affair was about to 
be made public) separated from VP in circumstances which, for you VP, must have 
been horrendous.  However, in November 2010, motivated (I have no doubt) by an 
implacable desire for revenge, and with little consideration of the position of your 
wider family, you decided to set about the dual objective of ruining CH whilst 
protecting your own position and reputation in the process.  Your weapon of choice 
was the revelation of his part in the offence in 2003.  But it was a dangerous weapon 
because it had, in truth, been a joint offence.  Thus you did not go to the police, 
because (as you admitted during your second trial) you appreciated the risk that you 
would both be prosecuted.  Instead you went first to The Mail on Sunday then, when 
they didn’t publish, to the Sunday Times and then, after they published, back to The 
Mail on Sunday.  Hence it was that over the period of six months from November 
2010 to May 2011 you, I have no doubt, sought to manipulate and control the Press so 
as to achieve that dual objective, hoping all the while to be able to hide behind their 
duty of source confidentiality, which you tried long and hard to do, as well as laying 
the ground, if that failed, for a false defence of marital coercion.   
 
However, after the publication of a story by the Sunday Times on 8 May 2011, to the 
effect that you VP had confirmed that CH had persuaded “someone close to him” to 
take the points, the momentum of the story led to your unmasking as the other person 
involved and to a police investigation. 
 
During that investigation you VP said nothing throughout your extensive interviews – 
hoping, I have no doubt, that the Police would not be able to obtain evidence from 
 
anyone as to your involvement. But they did. 
 
Despite your high office you CH tried to lie your way out of trouble by claiming that 
you were innocent, by repeating that lie again and again during your extensive 
interviews by the police, and by maintaining it in your Defence Case Statement to the 
Court in which it was asserted that “Mr Huhne…..can state unequivocally that he has 
never asked anyone to accept responsibility for a speeding offence and as a 
consequence take penalty points on his behalf…”. 
 
You then compounded those lies by making numerous applications, which the Court 
heard and determined in good faith, upon the basis that they were required in order for 
you to be able to pursue your defence that VP had not taken the points for you, and to 
enable you (if it proved to be the case) to mount an argument that the case should be 
stayed as an abuse of process because you could not get all the evidence to which you 

 

2
--------
were entitled to support that defence – whereas the truth, as you well knew 
throughout, was that VP had taken the points for you and you were guilty.  Indeed it 
was only after the refusal of your abuse of process and dismissal applications and the 
entering of a plea of not guilty that you finally indicated an intention to plead guilty, 
and did so on what would otherwise have been the first day of your trial. 
 
I make clear that your lies and your endeavour to manipulate the process of the court 
will not add a day to your sentence, although they are likely in due course be relevant 
to the issue of costs. 
 
In any event you must receive a discount of 10% to reflect the fact that your late plea 
took a degree of courage, saved the time and expense of a trial, and may reflect the 
beginnings of a degree of remorse – albeit that it is easy now to apologise for your 
wrongdoing. 
 
Once charged, you VP pursued your false defence of marital coercion.  In doing so, 
just as you did in your dealings with the media, you have demonstrated that there is a 
controlling manipulative and devious side to your nature.  However, ultimately, the 
good sense of the jury saw through you, and you were convicted. 
 
Having presided over your trials I have no doubt that whilst the immediate problem 
 
was CH’s, and that it was his idea that you should take his points, you were readily 
persuaded and chose to go along with it to your mutual benefit. Albeit that, to some 
 
limited extent, you regretted it afterwards – particularly when he was disqualified 
anyway and you were put to the inconvenience that you had sought to avoid in the 
first place. 
 
In your case too I make clear that the way that you have conducted your case will add 
nothing to your sentence, but (as with CH) is likely in due course be relevant to the 
issue of costs. 
  
To the extent that anything good has come out of this whole process, it is that now, 
finally, you have both been brought to justice for your joint offence.  Any element of 
tragedy is entirely your own fault. 
 
The underlying offence was speeding, the points swapping was considered and 
deliberate and done to gain joint advantage, the perversion of justice which resulted 
from it lasted for many years, and (as I have already observed) its eventual revelation 
and correction reflects no credit on either of you. 
 
Offending of this sort strikes at the heart of the criminal justice system.  As has been 
observed before, the purpose of the points system is that those who drive badly 
eventually have to be punished by way of disqualification, which serves to discourage 
bad driving and thereby to protect the public from it.  The system depends, in relation 
to those caught on camera, upon the honest completion of the relevant form or forms.  
The dishonest completion of such forms is all too easy to do, and the consequent 
points’ swapping often goes unnoticed and unchecked.   
 

 

3
--------
However, it must be clearly understood that it amounts to the serious criminal offence 
of doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice and that, save in the 
most exceptional circumstances, an immediate custodial sentence must follow. 
 
Indeed, in my view, this is the type of offence which requires the court to underline 
that deterrence is one of the purposes of sentence. 
 
There is no Definitive Guideline in relation to cases of this type, nor (given that the 
authorities to which I have been referred were each decided on their own facts) any 
guideline authority as to the appropriate length of sentence.  I must however keep the 
sentence as short as I can. 
 
CH (please stand) I propose to deal with you first, as the offence was your idea and 
thus you are somewhat, though not greatly in my view, the more culpable of the two 
of you. 
 
On the one hand you are a man of positive previous good character (about whom 
 
others have spoken extremely well) and who has given valuable public service, you 
have fallen from a great height (albeit that that is only modest mitigation given that it 
is a height that you would never have achieved if you had not hidden your 
commission of such a serious offence in the first place), and you have had to wait 
some time to be sentenced. 
 
On the other hand this was as your counsel accepts a serious offence, indeed as it 
seems to me a flagrant offence of its type, its effect lasted for many years, and I must 
give effect to all the purposes of sentence - including deterrence. 
 
There being no exceptional circumstances in your case, it is clear that an immediate 
custodial sentence must be imposed. You accept that, to some extent, you were the 
more culpable of the two of you. 
 
Having weighed all the various features, it seems to me that the least possible 
sentence after a trial in your case would have been one of 9 months’ imprisonment.   
 
From that I must deduct the 10% to reflect your late plea, which (rounded down) 
results in a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment, which is the sentence that I impose 
upon you. 
 
Unless released earlier under supervision you will serve half that sentence.  Your 
release will not, however, bring the sentence to an end.  If after your release and 
before the end of your sentence you commit any further offence you may be ordered 
to return to custody to serve the balance of the original sentence outstanding at the 
date of the new offence, as well as being punished for that offence. 
 
VP (please stand) as I have already indicated I have no doubt, having presided over 
your trials, that whilst the immediate problem was CH’s, and that it was his idea that 
you should take his points, you were readily persuaded and chose to go along with it 
to your mutual benefit. Albeit that, to some extent, you regretted it afterwards – 
particularly when he was disqualified anyway and therefore you suffered the 

 

4
--------
inconvenience that you had sought to avoid.  To repeat, he was therefore somewhat, 
though not greatly in my view, the more culpable of the two of you. 
 
 
On the one hand you are now in your early sixties and a woman of positive previous 
good character (about whom others have spoken well) who has also given valuable 
public service as well as doing other good works, and you too have fallen from a 
considerable height (albeit that again that is only modest mitigation at best given that, 
in your case too, it is an eventual height that you would not have achieved if you had 
not hidden your commission of such a serious offence in the first place).  I also take 
note of the issues raised as to your health and family problems. 
 
On the other hand this was a serious and flagrant offence of its type, its effect lasted 
for many years, and I must give effect to all the purposes of sentence - including 
deterrence.  Equally to the extent that there have been delays that has been a by-
product of your decision to contest the case. 
 
In my view the matters advanced on your behalf do not amount to exceptional 
circumstances, thus it is clear that an immediate custodial sentence must be imposed 
in your case as well. 
 
There can be no discount for a plea, nor any for genuine remorse – clearly there is 
none. 
 
Having weighed all the various features, including the fact that CH was somewhat 
more culpable than you but his sentence was discounted to reflect his plea, the 
sentence that I impose on you is also one of 8 months’ imprisonment.     
 
Unless released earlier under supervision you will serve half that sentence.  Your 
release will not, however, bring the sentence to an end.  If after your release and 
before the end of your sentence you commit any further offence you may be ordered 
to return to custody to serve the balance of the original sentence outstanding at the 
date of the new offence, as well as being punished for that offence. 
 
In both your cases I will adjourn determination of the costs issue until a date to be 
fixed.

JEWELL AND OTHERS
 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE OPENSHAW, 
  

29 APRIL 2013 
 

 
After a trial which lasted nine weeks, the defendants Anthony Jewell, Mark Thomas, 

 

Barry Burke, Ryan Holden, Kyle Smith Milson and Sam Hughes fall to be sentenced 
 

 

 

 

 

following their conviction on count 1 for conspiring to possess firearms with intent to 

endanger  life  and  on  count  3  with  conspiring  to  commit  arson  being  reckless  as  to 
 

whether  life  was  endangered.  They  also  fall  to  be  sentenced,  together  with  the 

defendant Shaun Byrne, for conspiracy to supply Class A and B drugs. I must set out 

the  facts,  at  least  in  summary;  obviously  in  the  course  of  sentencing  remarks,  I  
 

cannot review in detail the evidence in the case which took seven weeks to hear and 
 

nearly two days to sum up.  

Despite  their  denials,  all  the  defendants  are  members  of  a  criminal  gang  known  to 
 

themselves as the Croxteth Young Guns. 

As  it  seems  to  me,  they  have  no  stake  in  society  except  membership  of  the  gang, 
 

which is the only claim upon their loyalty. None of them has ever done a day’s honest 
 

 

work in their lives, or seemingly has ever aspired to do so. Their families are largely 

dysfunctional.  Each  left  school  without  any  qualifications  or  skills.  Their  days  are 

 

spent  posturing  outside  the  shops  on  Moss  Way  in  Croxteth,  dealing  drugs,  and 
 

proclaiming their claim  to that territory then  going back to  their base on Stonedale 
 

Crescent, to deal more drugs, and to smoke cannabis with each other. It is as if they 
 

 

 

belonged  to  some  separate  outlawed  tribe,  which  has  rejected  all  of  society’s  moral 

standards  and  conventions.  Their  main  efforts  and  energies  are  directed  towards 

feuding with a rival gang from the nearby area of Norris Green, the Strand gang and 
 

pursuing senseless vendettas against former associates. 

 

1
--------
Some criminal gangs use violence to defend their core criminal business, usually drug 

 

dealing, but I have formed the very clear impression that in this case the drug dealing 
 

 

 

was used not as an end in itself but was mainly used as a means of funding the gang’s 
 

principle activity of feuding. 

The  prosecution  of  the  offences  committed  by  these  defendants  has  presented  the 

police with particular problems. It is part of the gang’s  code or culture that no one 
 

 

speaks to the police or ‘grasses’, as they would put it: no one calls the police; at the 
 

 

 

 

scene no one tells the police what happened; no one makes a witness statement or if 
 

they do, they do not name names and if called upon to give evidence they resort to the 

 

unconvincing device of not remembering what were obviously memorable events. 
  

This code is ruthlessly enforced by the use of guns and firebombs, often brought to 

the scene by unregistered scrambler bikes, with the result that, despite the efforts of 
 

 

the  police,  parts  of  this  city  have  been  in  thrall  to  criminal  gangs.  Victims  and 
 

witnesses  are  reluctant  to  speak  out  and  the  absence  of  complaint  makes 
 

prosecutions rare and convictions even rarer. 
  

I  have  very  helpfully  been  provided  with  what  is  effectively  a  community  impact 

statement  from  Supt  Richardson,  the  senior  officer  of  the  Matrix  team  of  the 

Merseyside  constabulary,  responsible  for  the  police  operations  directed  towards 
 

reducing gun crime in this city.  Between October 2010 and March 2013, there were 
 

fully  266  firearms  discharges  in  this  city;  and  319  offences  of  arson  with  intent  to 
 

endanger  life.  These  are  largely  the  result  of  tit  for  tat  gangland  violence.  These 

offences have in the past resulted in a loss of confidence in  the ability of the police 

 

 

 

and the criminal justice system. In less than 1% of shootings have the victim or the 

intended victim co-operated with the police; this is a truly shocking statistic, and it 
 

has severe consequences in the communities affected.  

Despite that, in this case some witnesses – all women, I might observe - with obvious 

hesitation but with considerable courage they have spoken out, plainly weary of the 
 

conflicts  raging  round  them  and  engulfing  their  families.  I  will  not  name  these 

women, indeed I have given a direction that they should not be named in any press 
 

 

report, so as give them some further protection. 

 

I very much hope that these convictions and may encourage others to speak out.   

The firearms 
  

The incidents 

The discharge of firearms on the street, is intended to endanger those at whom the 
 

shots  are  fired  but  there  is  also  an  obvious  and  ever  present  danger  to  ordinary 
 

 

2
--------
passers  by  of  being  killed  or  injured    by  stray  bullets;  as  we  all  know,  that  has 

happened in the past in such incidents in this city and elsewhere.  

It is not uncommon for these drive by shootings not to hit the target; this seems to 

 

 
me  to  be  the  result  of  using  poor  quality  weapons,  with  poor  quality  ammunition 

combined with bad marksmanship; this does not decrease the danger to passers by, 

indeed it rather increases it. 

 
Those  who  are  parties  to  the  possession  of  firearms  to  endanger  the  lives  of  others 

 
and  in  doing  so  they  commit  grave  crimes,  which  must  be  visited  by  condign 

punishment so as to deter others. 

The  evidence  established  that  the  gang,  and  these  defendants  between  them,  were 
 

 

responsible for 6 incidents in which firearms were charged, 2 further incidents where 

firearms mis-fired, and the possession of an arsenal of firearms and ammunition; all 

 

 

these events were encompassed within the conspiracy to possess firearms with intent 
 

to endanger life. I will deal with them in turn. 

 

Shots fired on the Strand, Norris Green  

On  the  afternoon  of  19th  October  2010  on  the  Strand,  in  Norris  Green,  two 

 
motorbikes  drew  up,  each  had  a  driver  and  a  pillion  passenger;  each  was  masked, 

 

shots were fired at a group of young men, presumably they were members of the rival 

 

 

Strand gang, but no one has made a statement of complaint.  

 

 
The  ammunition  used  in  this  incident  has  a  common  source  with  the  bullets  later  

 

 

fired on Hollingbourne Road, to which I will come later and to the bullets later found 

on  the  open  land  off  Stonedale  Road,  which  was  plainly  under  the  control  of  the 

defendants. 

 
Although  I  cannot  safely  attribute  individual  responsibility  for  this  incident  it  was 

plainly committed within the scope of this conspiracy. 

Shooting of Josh Keating 

 
I  move  on  to  13th  March  2011,  when  a  former  associate  of  the  defendants  Josh 

 
Keating was shot through the knee; in what must have been some kind of punishment 

 

 

 
knee-capping. He told the police that he had been shot by a group of masked men on 

 

 

 

 

 
Maureen  Walk,  just  outside  his  home.  He  said  they  had  their  faces  masked  by 

balaclavas. Beyond that he said nothing; he gave no explanation for his shooting, still 

 

less information as to who might be responsible.   

The gun that fired that shot was later recovered from waste land off Stonedale Road, 

 
the same gun was used in the discharge on Hollingbourne Road, to which I will come 

 

3
--------
later.  Since  the  shooting  at  Hollingbourne  Road  was  plainly  to  result  of  these 
 

conspirators;  the  shooting  of  Josh  Keating  with  the  same  gun  is  obviously  also 
 

committed  by  them.  Indeed  the  flurry  of  calls  passing  between  Barry  Burke,  Ryan 
 

Holden  and  Kyle  Smith  Milson  strongly  suggests  their  direct  involvement  in  this 
 

attack. There were also calls to Sam Hughes. 

Attack on Anthony Jewell in prison 11 May 

On  6th  May  following  an  incident  of  harassment  against  a  former  associate,  the 

defendant Anthony Jewell was arrested. On 11th May, within half an hour of his being 

 
moved onto a different wing of Liverpool prison, he was assaulted by a member of the 

 

 

 

 
Strand gang, in what was plainly an incident of gang related violence. He was taken to 

 

  
hospital with a suspected fracture to his jaw. 

 
For Anthony Jewell, a gang leader, to be attacked in prison by a rival gang member 

 

 
involved, in his eyes at least, a serious loss of face or caste; he wanted his revenge on 

 
the  rival  gang  in  general  and  on  McMullen  in  particular  and,  from  prison,  he  

 

 

organised a reprisal. He must have used either an illicit phone in prison, which has 

 

 
not been traced, or used another as the messenger or go-between to deliver his orders 

and directions. 

 
Shooting at Hollingbourne Road 

 
The following evening, the 12th May, men on a motorbike fired shots at two members 

 
of the Strand gang on Hollingbourne Road. The shots missed their target but a stray 

 
bullet passed right through the front door of a completely innocent householder, who 

 

 
was at home with his partner at the time. The bullet lodged in the staircase. Plainly, 

they were exposed to risk of death or serious injury. Another shot had passed through 

the tyre of his car parked outside. Discharged cartridge cases found in the street had a 

 
common source as bullets later found on the waste land off Stonedale Road and were 

fired by the pistol later recovered from the same waste land. 

 

I have no doubt that this was in revenge for the attack on Anthony Jewell in prison 

and that it was ordered and directed by him. 

 
Sequence of Events chart page 18 plainly implicates Mark Thomas, Barry Burke and 

 
Ryan Holden in this shooting; this is one of those cases where text messages sent by 

Mark Thomas clearly demonstrate that he is going out on some criminal enterprise, 

 
indeed  he  actually  texted  that  he  was  turning  his  phone  off,  presumably  so  that  he  

  
could not be cell sited to the scene of the shooting. 

 

 

4
--------
Yet again there are calls to Sam Hughes, strongly suggestive that he was involved in 
 

some way. 
  

Shots fired at Muirhead Avenue  

In  the  early  hours  of  the  17th  May,  two  shots  from  a  shotgun  were  fired  from  a 

motorbike  at  the  house  in  Muirhead  Avenue  where  the  parents  of  Kevin  McMullen 
 

lived: one shot shattered the glass pane in front the door, and another shot struck the 

sitting  room  window,  just  above  the  settee  where  Mrs  McMullen  was  sitting.  If  she 
 

had stood up she could easily have been killed. The motorbike then raced off. Plainly 
 

this  also  was  in  revenge  for  the  attack  upon  Anthony  Jewell  by  Kevin  McMullen  in  
 

 

Liverpool prison some days before. 

The  phone  traffic  at  page  25  of  the  Sequence  of  Events  chart  strongly  suggests 
 

participation  by  Mark  Thomas,  Barry  Burke  Ryan  Holden  and  maybe  Kyle  Smith 
 

 

Milson. Again Mark Thomas texted that he was switching his phone off in advance of 
 

the shooting. 

Shots fired on Longmoor Lane 

On  23  June,  the  defendant  Sam  Hughes  was  attacked  in  his  own  home  and  quite 

seriously  beaten  up;  although  he  refused  to  make  a  witness  statement,  it  is  clear  – 

 

 

and I find as a fact – that his assailants were all members of the Strand gang, some 
 

 

travelling in a silver Ford Focus.  

On the afternoon of 14th July, shots were fired from a motorcycle at a member of the 

 
Strand gang as he drove in that silver Ford Focus on Longmoor Lane. I have no doubt 

 

 

this  was  a  revenge  for  the  attack  on  Sam  Hughes.  Two  discharged  cartridge  cases 

 
recovered  from  the  scene  were  fired  from  the  Tokarev  self  loading  pistol  later 

recovered from the waste land off Stonedale Crescent. 

 

 
Before  moving  on  from  this;  I  observe  that  texts  messages  sent  by  Mark  Thomas 

 

 
(which are in the Sequence of Events chart at page 62) make very clear that Anthony 

 

 
Jewell  had  been  speaking  to  the  Heron  brothers,  who  were  members  of  the  Strand 

 
gang, at least one of whom had been involved in the attack on Sam Hughes and as a 

 

 
result  they  were  panicking,  as  well  they  might  having  been  threatened  by  Anthony 

 

 

 

Jewell. This is clear evidence of Anthony Jewell directing operations in general, and 

this reprisal in particular from in prison.  

The  telephone  traffic  suggests  a  direct  involvement  of  Mark  Thomas,  and  Ryan 
 

Holden, with again calls made to Sam Hughes, before and after the shooting 

 

5
--------
Josh Fitzsimmons 

I  move  on  to  another  incident.  One  of  the  guns  recovered  by  the  police  was  the 

 

 

Tokarev self loading pistol, to which I have already referred. Forensic scientists found 

DNA from one Josh Fitzsimmonds on the foresight of that gun, that is to say at the 
 

barrel end. Josh Fitzsimmonds is a former associate of the defendants. 

The police asked Josh Fitzsimmonds to explain that finding when he was in custody 

in relation to other offences. I remind myself that I must be cautious before accepting 
 

 

 

his evidence, not least because he had every reason to exculpate himself. He told the 
 

police that one night, which can be dated to 17 October 2011, he had been chased by 
 

two  young  men,  with  guns.  They  were  masked,  he  said,  so  he  could  not  describe 

them. They caught up with him, and held a gun to him; that, he explained, must be 

how  his  DNA  gave  to  be  transferred  to  the  gun;  he  heard  a  metallic  click,  which 
 

 

suggested that they were trying to fire the gun but there was no discharge, whereupon 
 

he ran off. During the course of his evidence, he told the jury that this account was 
 

 

quite  true;  I  have  no  doubt  that  it  was.  He  lived  to  tell  the  tale  only  because  the 

 

 

 

weapons or the ammunition, or both, were of poor quality and the gun misfired. 

I  have  no  doubt  that  he  was  targeted  precisely  because  he  had  decided  to  leave  the 

 

gang. 

Joel Garrity 

 

A  few  days  later  on  in  the  early  hours  of  21st  Oct,  there  was  another  very  similar 
 

incident  involving  one  Joel  Garrity,  who  gave  evidence  at  the  trial.  He  came  into 

 

court with a sinister entourage of camp followers. His evidence must also be treated 
 

with  some  caution,  since  I  have  no  doubt  that  he  was  himself  an  active  drug 

trafficker,  but  I  do  not  doubt  that  his  evidence  about  this  incident  was  in  essence 

 

 

true. He said that as he left home just after midnight, someone ran up to him with a 

gun; after a chase he was caught, the gun was held to his head, the trigger was pulled 
 

but  the  gun  did  not  fire.  Again  he  was  saved  only  by  a  firearm  malfunction.  Mr 

Garrity  managed  to  pull  the  hat  from  one  of  his  assailants,  the  hat  bore  DNA  from 

Barry Burke, plainly showing a close connection between him and the gunman if not 

with the shooting itself. 

Shots fired at 6 Galemead Close  

On  the  evening  of  21  December  shots  gun  were  fired  from  a  shotgun  from  a 

motorbike at 6 Galemeade Close, where Josh Fitzsimmonds was then living, breaking 
 

 

some windows.

Seizure of weapons 

Let  me  then  turn  then  to  the  firearms  and  ammunition  which  the  police  saw  or 
 

recovered. 

On 25th March 2011 a Police Community Support Officer saw a group of young men, 
 

including  Barry  Burke  and  Sam  Hughes  hiding  an  L-shaped  package  in  the 

undergrowth of Stonedale road; she suspected it was a firearm. Since firearms were 
 

in fact found hidden nearby some months later, I do not doubt that she was right. 

 

On 10 July a loaded sawn off double barrelled shotgun was found by the police in a 

locked external bin cupboard in an unoccupied house at 11 Stonedale Crescent. Such 
 

weapons  have  no  legitimate  use;  they  are  easily  concealed,  terrifying  in  appearance 
 

and  destructive  in  effect,  particularly  at  short  range.  Text  messages  later  recovered 
 

 

(this is at Sequence of Events chart pages 69 and 70) clearly show that Mark Thomas 
 

 

believed,  wrongly  as  it  turned  out,  that  his  DNA  would  be  found  on  that  gun.  Both 
 

 

Mark Thomas and Barry Burke were living nearby at the time; they at least must have 
 

known of this weapon. 

On 22nd July, a small revolver was found hidden behind panelling in the lavatory at 
 

 
Barry  Burke’s  house  in  22  Stonedale  Crescent.  It  is  not  clear  how  long  it  had  been 

there but I have no doubt that its whereabouts was well known to Barry Burke, whose 

DNA was found upon it and possibly also to others who were in the house at time.  

 
On  the  8th  November,  on  the  waste  land  off  Stonedale  Crescent,  police  found  a 

 

 

quantity  of  firearms,  namely  (1)  a  CZ  self  loading  pistol,  with  two  bullets  in  the 

 

magazine, the gun was not in good condition but, as I have described, it had already 

been used to shoot Josh Keating and in the shooting on Hollingbourne Road; (2) A 

 

 

 
loaded Tokarev, a self loading pistol, which had been used to discharge the cartridge 

cases recovered from Longmoor Lane; this firearm also bore DNA from Barry Burke; 

(3)  a  loaded  .45  calibre  Colt  revolver;  (4)  a  loaded  .410  shot  gun  pistol  in  poor 

 
condition; (5) a twin barrelled key ring firearm, which has been successfully test fired 

 
this  is  a  weapon,  handy  no  doubt  because  it  is  easily  concealed,  (but  there  is  no 

 
evidence  that  it  was  ever  used  in  any  of  the  incidents  that  we  have  considered);  all 

this  together  with  a  quantity  of  suitable  ammunition.  This  find  in  itself  is  a  typical 

 

 
arsenal of assorted weapons from which the gang members could draw as and when 

 

 

required. 

The firebombing 

I turn then to the firebombings, the subject matter of count 3 in the indictment. The 
 

jury acquitted the defendants of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger 
 

 

7
--------
life; they convicted of the alternative conspiracy to commit arson being reckless as to 

 
whether  life  was  endangered.  Firebombing  causes  fear  and  even  terror  in  the 

communities in which it has become a favoured form of attack; conspiracy to commit 

 
arson  by  firebombing  in  the  context  of  gang  warfare  is  a  very  grave  offence.  When 

 
such a device is thrown, it is a matter of mischance whether the fire takes hold. I will 

  
describe the incidents encompassed within the conspiracy. 

Arson at 11 Otterton Road 2 April 

I start with the attack on 11 Otterton Road on 2 April, the home of a former associate, 

 

Lewis  Redgrift.  This  is  likely  to  have  been  a  revenge  attack  for  the  smashing  of  the 

windows  at  126  Hebden  Road,  Croxteth,  the  address  of  Ryan  Holden.  A  fire  bomb 
 

 

was  thrown  through  the  window;  there  was  a  separate  seat  of  fire  in  one  of  the 

bedrooms upstairs, started by an intruder who had gone upstairs. The occupiers were 
 

 

out at the time but the house was nearly burnt out, as is clear from the photographs. 

 

 

Calls  passing  between  Ryan  Holden,  Barry  Burke  and  Kyle  Smith  Milson  strongly 
 

suggest their participation in this attack. Moreover Ryan Holden in particular had an 
 

obvious motive for seeking revenge for the attack on his home. 

Arson at 7 Polperro Close  

I  move  on  to  the  firebombing  on  4  April  of  7  Polperro  Close,  Croxteth,  the  house 

address  of  Debbie  Leather  ,  who  gave  evidence  about  this.  That  afternoon  she  was 
 

standing in her living room, she saw two young men wearing masks, on a motorbike 

draw up and throw a brick through the window, followed by a firebomb in the form of 
 

a  bottle  with  a  burning  rag  on  it.  By  the  merest  good  fortune,  the  fire  did  not  take 
 

 

hold but some damage resulted. It was deeply shocking to her. 

She later told the police that she said she had been to a party the previous night, with 
 

Anthony Jewell, whom she had known for many years. She said that Anthony Jewell 

and one of her friends had had an argument; he told her that she had seen what had 

 

happened to Lewis Redgrift, who was the target of the fire bombing at Otterton Road, 

which  I  have  just  described.  He  told  her  and  she  was  going  to  get  the  same.  At  the 

trial, she said that she had not said this to the police but I find as a fact that she did 
 

 

say  it  and  it  was  true.  This  fire  was  set  as  a  direct  result  of  a  perceived  slight  to 
 

Anthony Jewell. 

Both these fires were set using fire bombs in the form of a lucozade bottle filled with 
 

accelerant, with a lighted rag. On 6 April, just such a bottle was found at 126 Hebden 

 

Road, where Ryan Holden lived. It is clear evidence of Ryan Holden’s complicity in 

these matters. 

 

8
--------
Telephone  traffic  also  strongly  suggests  the  direct  participation  of  Barry  Burke  and 

 

Kyle Smith Milson in this attack.  

Arson at 17 Standard Road  

I turn now to the arson at 17 Standard Road, on 27 May 2011; this was the home of 
 

Raymond Harrison, the grandfather of Josh Fitzsimmons, a friend of Lewis Redgrift. 

An eye witness, the grandmother of Josh Fitzsimmonds (whom I will not name) saw a 
 

 

gang  of  8  or  so  young  men  on  her  path.  She  feared  they  were  up  to  no  good;  her  
 

 

 

 

 

screams alerted the raiding party to the fact that they had been seen, so they changed 
 

targets,  they  went  across  the  road;  she  saw  them  throw  a  lighted  firebomb  through 

 

the window at Raymond Harrison’s house at 17 Standard Road, just a few yards away. 

The  raiders  then  ran  off.  Raymond  Harrison  was  not  at  home  but  the  house  did 
 

 

however suffer considerable damage, as shown in the photographs. 

Before  the  commission  of  this  offence  there  was  highly  suggestive  telephone  traffic 

passing  between  Anthony  Jewell,  Mark  Thomas,  Barry  Burke,  perhaps  also  Ryan 

Holden. Mark Thomas against texted that he was turning his phone off.  

 

It  is  significant  that  within  minutes  of  the  fire  being  set,  Josh  Fitzsimmonds  rang 
 

Ryan Holden, obviously believing that that he was at least one of those responsible. 

 

The arson at 17 Alma Close  

I come to the arson attack at 17 Alma Close on 4 November. I have no doubt that this 

 

 

 

was  prompted  by  other  two  incidents,  both  fairly  trivial  in  themselves;  one  was  a 
 

confrontation  between  Josh  Fitzsimmonds  and  Barry  Burke,  Ryan  Holden  and 
 

probably some others as well, which occurred in a school playground on 2nd October; 
 

the  other  was  another  confrontation  by  the  Moss  Lane  shops  on  3rd  November, 

involving  Barry  Burke  and  others.  Whatever  had  happened  in  those  incidents,  the 

gang decided that liberties had been taken with them and revenge was necessary. 

 
17  Alma  Close  is  a  modern  three  bed-roomed  terrace  house,  owned  by  Josh 

 
Fitzsimmons  uncle.  The  prosecution  suggest  that  the  house  was  targeted  because  it 

 
was believed that he, or at least members of his family, were living there. Unknown to 

the arsonists, the house had in fact been let to a completely innocent young woman 

 

called Carla Evans.  

On  the  night  of  the  3rd/4th  November,  she  was  sleeping  there  with  her  infant 

 
daughter,  and  an  adult  friend.    At  about  2  o’clock  in  the  morning,  they  were 

 
awakened  by  smashing  glass  and  by  the  smoke  alarm  sounding.    They  opened  the 

bedroom  door  and  they  were  met  with  clouds  of  smoke.    They  escaped  only  by 

 

9
--------
smashing the bedroom window and by climbing out onto the sloping roof below; the 

baby  was  passed  down  by  hand  and  they  then  climbed  down  by  ladder,  which  had 

 

been brought by a neighbour. 

The photographs show the extent of the devastation. The house is almost burnt out. 
 

The occupants were extraordinarily lucky to get out alive. The fire investigator found 

a stone on the floor, which must have been thrown through the window; fire had been 
 

started deliberately by throwing a fire bomb through the window. 

Although, as it turned out, this was the most serious fire, any one of these firebombs 

 

could have had this effect. 
  

 

Barry Burke himself was on a curfew at the time; I am sure he was therefore not one 
 

of the raiding party but it is quite clear from his involvement in the incidents in the 

school and at the Moss Way shops, and indeed from the telephone traffic that he was 

 

involved in planning this reprisal. 

 

Blake Brown run down 

For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  I  make  clear  that  for  the  purposes  of  sentence,  I  will 
 

ignore the further incident of violence on 25th January when a gang rival Blake Brown 
 

was run down and grievously injured by a stolen car. The incident is not covered by 

 
the  counts  on  the  indictment;  although  it  was  plainly  relevant  evidence  during  the 

trial 

The defendants as victims 

 
There was, I accept, considerable violence directed at the defendants themselves. On 

11th  May,  Anthony  Jewell  was  attacked  in  prison.  On  23  June,  Sam  Hughes  was 

 
attacked  in  his  own  home.  In  the  early  hours  of  17th  July,  intruders  burst  into  22 

 
Stonedale  Crescent,  where  Barry  Burke  lived  with  Mark  Thomas;  so  terrified  were 

they, that they jumped from their upstairs bedroom; Mark Thomas landed awkwardly 

 
and broke his neck. On 19th July, 14 Willow Way, the home of Ryan Holden’s parents 

was firebombed, causing severe damage to the kitchen. On 21 November, a shot gun 

 
was  discharged  at  1  Stonedale  Crescent,  the  home  of  Amanda  Burke.  This,  I  make 

 

clear is not mitigation, indeed it has not been suggested that it is, but these attacks 

fuelled the escalating tit for tat violence. 

The parts played by the defendants 

 

General piece 

 
Now the defendants were properly charged with conspiracy to possess firearms with 

 
intent to endanger life and conspiracy to commit arson because although each can be 

 

10
--------
proved  to  have  been  party  to  the  general  conspiracy,  fixing  responsibility  upon  any 
 

particular defendant for any particular attack is not always possible.  

Anthony Jewell 

I have no doubt that the defendant Anthony Jewell was, throughout the period of the 
 

conspiracy, the leader of this gang.  

 

When,  as  frequently  happened  in  the  text  messages  sent  by  Mark  Thomas,  and 
 

indeed also in at least one the prison letters, he called Anthony Jewell ‘Dad’, he was 

acknowledging him as the leader of the gang. 
  

I  have  no  doubt  that  he  ordered  the  firebombing  of  Debbie  Leather’s  house  at 

 

 

 

Polperro Close because he had been slighted in the club the night before. 
  

I  have  no  doubt  that  he  directed  that  retaliation  be  taken  against  the  rival  gang 
 

following the attack upon him in Liverpool prison on 11 May; he is therefore directly 
 

responsible  for  the  shootings  at    Hollingbourne  Road  on  12  May  and  at  Muirhead 
 

Avenue on 17th May. 

 
Thereafter it may be that some – but only some - of the calls made from prison by the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

illicit  phones  attributed  to  him  were  sometimes  made  by  others,  but  on  the  other 

 

hand it is equally clear that he used other illicit phones which have not been traced.  

 

 
I have already referred to the calls which followed the attack on Sam Hughes, which 

plainly demonstrated that Anthony Jewell was directing operations from prison but 

there is another significant passage at page 56 in the Sequence of Events chart when 

Mark Thomas sent a text message to the effect that ‘My Dad’ – he meant, of course, 

 

 
Anthony Jewell -  ‘could be getting out … he will just have me going wild … wild like 

 

 
showing  little  divvys  how  it  is’.  In  the  context  of  this  case,  and  over  the  7  weeks  of 

evidence one became familiar with Mark Thomas’s texting style, it is quite clear that 

 
Mark  Thomas  was  contemplating  the  attacks  which  Anthony  Jewell  would  be 

orchestrating on their rivals.  

 
From the nature and extent of the known contacts between Anthony Jewell and Mark 

Thomas and Barry Burke in particular, I am quite sure that he continued to control 

 
and direct operations from his prison cell. It is by statute an aggravating factor that a 

 
defendant is on bail, or on licence, it is clear to me that the fact that Anthony Jewell 

 
was continuing to direct these operations from prison is a seriously aggravating factor 

 

in his case. 

 

11
--------
As so often happens in these cases, few of the participants have significant previous 
 

 

 

 

 

convictions, although Anthony Jewell does have a previous conviction for possessing 
 

heroin with intent to supply.  

Involvement  in  the  commission  of  any  one  of  these  offences  would  justify  a  long 
 

 

sentence, but co-ordinating and directing conspiracies on this scale puts this case in a 

category of its own.  

To my mind someone guilty of offending on this scale, with this persistence, directing 

the  conspiracy  from  prison,  plainly  presents  a  substantial  risk  of  causing  serious 
 

harm to the public from the commission of further specified offences. I have no doubt 

that he is dangerous and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.  

I  have  considered  whether  the  commission  of  these  grave  offences  should  be 
 

denounced  by  the  imposition  of  a  life  sentence;  with  some  hesitation  I  have 

considered  that  the  public  will  be  sufficiently  be  protected  by  a  long  extended 
 

sentence. 

I accept that he has since his arrest served an 18 month sentence for another offence, 
 

 

 

 

which  will  not  count  towards  the  sentence  I  am  about  to  pass;  he  is  not,  I  think, 

entitled to a mathematical deduction but I will make some allowance for it. 
 

 

 

Accordingly,  I  shall  fix  the  extended  sentence  at  25  years:  there  will  be  a  custodial 
 

term  of  20  years  imprisonment  and  an  extension  of  5  years,  during  which  he  will 

 

remain subject to licence. He must therefore serve two thirds of the custodial terms 

and  even  then  he  will  not  be  released  until  he  has  served  the  full  term  of  20  years 
 

unless  and  until  the  Parole  Board    decide  that  he  may  safely  be  released,  and  even 
 

then he will be subject to licence.  

Curiously  it  would  seem  that  if  I  had  passed  a  life  sentence  with  a  notional 
 

determinate term of 20 years, he would be eligible for consideration for release after 
 

 

 

a minimum term of only 10 years; that is perhaps anomalous but it does not cause me 
 

to alter my sentence. 

I make clear that I have considered whether I should make some deduction from the 
 

 

custodial element of the sentence because he must serve two thirds rather than only 
 

 

one  half  which  he  would  serve  under  an  ordinary  determinate  sentence  but  this 
 

 

would  seem  to  me  to  be  contrary  to  section  226A(6)  by  which  ‘the  appropriate  
 

 

 

 

custodial  term  is  the  term  of  imprisonment  that  would,  apart  from  this  section)  be 

imposed …’. I therefore make no deduction. 
  

 

12
--------
Mark Thomas 

I turn to Mark Thomas. 

 

As I have already said, the telephone traffic and the text messages which he sent very 

clearly link him directly to a number of these incidents.  

 

Furthermore,  there  are  several  tell  tale  periods  of  phone  inactivity  in  the  period 

immediately before and after the attacks; caused by their realisation that the use of 
 

mobile phones near any incident is something that can be traced and has been used 
 

 

in other prosecutions.  

Even  after  his  arrest  he  was  writing  letters  from  prison  encouraging  the  others, 
 

admittedly in a rather vague way, to carry on the gang’s activities.  

I have no doubt that in Anthony Jewell’s absence it was Mark Thomas who was the 
 

directing  hand  of  this  gang.  I  take  account  of  the  fact  that  on  22nd  July  2011  he 

 
received a very serious injury in the course of the gang related attack upon him, about 

which  evidence  was  heard  during  the  trial;  I  have  little  doubt  that  the  comparative 

 
inactivity of the gang after that was due, at least in part, to the removal of his hand 

from the helm.  

I accept that he has had a bad start in life. He had leukaemia in childhood and he had 
 

particular problems within the family, which led to seek particular support within the 

society of the gang.  

I  know  that  he  is  only  now  19;  I  accept  that  he  was  under  the  age  of  18  when  this  
 

conspiracy started; and I must make some allowance for his comparative youth but 

the fact is that these cases of gang related violence are very commonly committed by 
 

very young men.  

I accept that he has been previously only lightly convicted but it is obvious to me, as it 
 

 

 

was to the writer of the pre-sentence report that the nature, scale and gravity of his 

offending; his attitude to the gang’s activities after his arrest plainly demonstrate the 

danger that he presents.  

 

He also must therefore be subject to an extended sentence, which in his case I fix at 
 

20 years. The custodial term will be 16 years; there will be an extension of 4 years. He 
 

 

must  therefore  serve  two  thirds  of  the  custodial  term  and  even  then  he  will  not  be 
 

released until he has served the full term of 16 years unless and until the Parole Board 
   

 

decide that he may safely be released, and even then he will be subject to licence. 
 

 

 

 

13
--------
Barry Burke 

I  turn  to  Barry  Burke.  As  I  have  already  said,  his  DNA  was  found  on  a  number  of 
 

these  firearms.  His  house  on  Stonedale  Crescent  was  the  gang’s  head  quarters.  He 
 

was  often  at  the  centre  of  the  telephone  traffic  surrounding  these  incidents.  His 
 

phone  also  was  from  time  to  time  silent  before,  during  and  after  some  of  these 

incidents. 

Furthermore  he  had  a  particular  interest  in  motorbikes,  the  provision,  repair  and 

maintenance  of  which  was  vital  to  the  gangs  business  of  delivering  gunmen  or  fire 
 

bombers to the scene. Although he does not have the intelligence or the personality to 
 

lead any criminal enterprise he was an enthusiastic member at the very heart of their 
 

activities,  I  am  sure  that  he  personally  took  a  prominent  part  in  many  of  these 
 

attacks.   

However, he is still only 19. He did not become 18 until 17 December 2011, so all but 

one of the incidents to which I referred took place whilst he was still 17. He is lightly 
 

convicted; as is the position with some of the other defendants, he has not served a 
 

custodial sentence before. 

I do not doubt that he has had a very troubled childhood; some of which is set out in a 

 

letter from his mother, which I have read with care. Whether or not he actually has 

Asperger’s syndrome, about which there is some division of expert opinion, I have no 
 

doubt  that  he  has  a  raft  of  personality  problems,  which  he  does  not  fully  accept  or 

 

understand,  which  makes  treatment  difficult  for  he  does  not  presently  co-operate. 

Whilst I accept that his condition might lower his culpability, at the same time, in my 
 

opinion, it raises his level of dangerousness. I therefore agree with the assessment in 
 

the  pre-sentence  report  that  he  poses  a  very  high  risk  of  causing  serious  harm  to 

others by reason of the commission of other specified offences, indeed in the course 
 

of his very helpful submissions, Mr Griffiths QC on his behalf has not sought to argue 

to the contrary.  

Making every allowance for his age, as I have done with the others, I will pass upon 

him an extended sentence of 16 years; being a custodial term of 12 years, of which he 
 

must  serve  two  thirds  and  even  then  he  will  not  be  released  unless  and  until  the 

 

 

 

Parole Board decide that he may safely be released, and even then he will be subject 
 

 

 

 

 

to licence. There will be an extended licence of 4 years.  

 

 

14
--------
Ryan Holden 
 

I  turn  to  Ryan  Holden.  I  have  no  doubt  that  he  personally  played  an  active  role  in 
 

setting the fire at 11 Otterton Road, which was in revenge for breaking the windows at 
 

his mother’s house on 126 Hebden Road. 

I have sought to identify some of the other incidents in which he has played a direct 

part  but  in  a  conspiracy  this  is  not  always  easy.  I  note  that  he  has  admitted  to  the 

 

Probation  Officer  that  he  did  help  to  remove  and  conceal  the  guns  used  in  the  
 

 

 

Holllingbourne  Road  and  Muirhead  Avenue  shootings;  that  may  not  be  a  full 

admission but it does show some awareness of his responsibility, which is some sort 

of a start towards rehabilitation.  

He  is  further  down  the  hierarchy  of  defendants.  Mr  McDermott  QC  has  helpfully 

reminded me of the letter that Mark Thomas send from prison (it is at page 23 in the 
 

 

 

 

bundle of the prison letters) describing Ryan Holden as a ‘dog’, being an unreliable 
 

 

person. 

He is now aged 20. He is only lightly convicted but for the reasons set out in the pre-

sentence  report,  in  my  opinion,  he  also  presents  a  very  high  risk  of  causing  serious  
 

 

harm to the public; he is plainly dangerous. 
 

I will pass upon him an extended sentence of 16 years; being a custodial term of 13 
 

years, of which he must serve fully two thirds and even then he will not be released 
 

 

unless  and  until  the  Parole  Board  decide  that  he  may  safely  be  released,  and  even 

then he will be subject to licence. There will be an extended licence of 3 years.  

 

 

Kyle Smith Milson 

I  come  to  Kyle  Smith  Milson.  The  telephone  traffic  clearly  shows  his  active 
 

 

 

participation  in  some  of  the  early  incidents.  Fortunately  for  him.  the  prosecution 

have not been able to tract a phone to him since the middle of May 2011; it cannot 

therefore  be  said  what  precise  part  he  played  thereafter;  there  is  however  no  doubt 
 

that he remained an active participant in the conspiracy as is clear from other of the 

gang’s activities and indeed from the prison letters, some of which referred to him, as 
 

a brother and a soldier. It is not, I think, right to say that he was just at the periphery 
 

of the gangs activities.  

He was present at 22 Stonedale Crescent on 22 July, when the revolver was found. 
  

During  the  trial  Mr  Berry  made  the  point,  which  I  accept,  that  he  was  not  charged 
 

with the drugs offences, which suggests that he was not a member of the inner circle 
 

of  this  gang.  He  is  only  19;  he  is  lightly  convicted;  he  may  have  a  more  supportive  
 

 

 

 

15
--------
family but he has played his part as a foot soldier in this enterprise and he must now 

pay the price. 

I accept the assessment by the writer of the pre-sentence report that having regard to 
 

his continued involvement with the other members of the gang in these conspiracies, 
 

he  also  is  dangerous,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act.  There  will  be  an  extended 
 

sentence of 15 years in his case, comprising a custodial sentence of 12 years, of which 
 

he must serve fully two thirds and even then he will not be released unless and until 

the  Parole  Board  decide  that  he  may  safely  be  released,  and  even  then  he  will  be  
 

 

 

 

 

subject to licence. There will be an extension of 3 years. 
 

 

 

 

Sam Hughes  

I  have  sought  to  identify  those  incidents  where  there  is  telephone  traffic  which 

implicated  Sam  Hughes,  or  at  least  shows  his  close  association  with  other 
 

conspirators at the time of various of these incidents.  

 

On  9th  June,  the  police  raided  17  Exford  Road,  where  Sam  Hughes  lived.  Three 
 

scrambler bikes were seized. Because each was unlicensed and unregistered, there is 
 

no direct evidence that these bikes were used in any particular one of these incidents 

but it is obvious that they were. This gives rise to the suggestion by the prosecution 
 

that Sam Hughes played the role of transport officer, providing a safe hideaway for 

 

the bikes. At one point Mr Johnson sought to suggest that the phone calls to certain 
 

taxi firms which were often made just before or just after these attacks were to allow 
 

the gunmen or fire bombers to travel to and from Sam Hughes’s house to collect the 
 

bikes. This seems to me however to be speculation; it may be right but I am unable to 
 

 

 

find as a fact that this was proved.  

I  do  not  however  doubt  his  direct  involvement  in  the  shooting  on  Longmoor  Lane, 

which  was  in  revenge  for  the  beating  up  that  he  had  received  earlier.  He  is  very 
 

young; he also is lightly convicted but he also has played his part as a foot soldier in 
 

this enterprise and he must now pay the price.  

I accept the assessment by the writer of the pre-sentence report that having regard to 
 

his involvement with the other members of the gang in these conspiracies, he also is 
 

 

 

 

dangerous, within the meaning of the Act. There will be an extended sentence of 15 

years in his case, comprising a custodial sentence of 12 years, of which he must serve 
 

fully  two  thirds  and  even  then  he  will  not  be  released  unless  and  until  the  Parole 

 

Board  decide  that  he  may  safely  be  released,  and  even  then  he  will  be  subject  to  
 

 

 

 

licence. There will be an extension of 3 years.

Drugs
 
  

That concludes my review of the arsons and I move on to the drugs.
 
 

Mark Thomas, Barry Burke on Counts 4 and 6 (old count 5) 


Mark Thomas and Barry Burke fall to be sentenced following their pleas of guilty to
 
 

count  4  of  the  original  indictment  charging  them  conspiracy  to  possess  Class  A  


controlled  drugs  with  intent  to  supply  and  on  count  6  (the  original  count  5)  with  


conspiracy  to  possess  Class  B  controlled  drugs,  namely  cannabis,  with  intent  to
 
 

supply. 


These pleas were only entered at the close of the prosecution case.  


 

On  9th  June,  the  police  searched  22  Stonedale  Crescent  and  recovered  a  scrambler
 
 

bike. It is however clear from text messages that Mark Thomas sent that as the police 


were entering the house, he hid a bag of cocaine up his back passage (‘plugged it’ as
 
 

 

he said) and that there was another bag hidden in the garden.
 
 

On  22  December  police  went  to  22  Stonedale.  Barry  Burke  and  Shaun  Byrne  were
 
 

 

asleep  upstairs.  The  premises  were  searched.  Among  the  items  found  were:  several
 
 

 

small bags of heroin plainly parcelled up for distribution, together with £40 in money
 
 

in  one  room  and  £660  in  another,  a  set  of  scales  (bearing  Mark  Thomas’s  


fingerprints) and a number of plastic bags.  


Furthermore, there were many stop and searches when they were found in possession
 
 

 

of  money  for  which  they  could  not  properly  account.  Further  on  those  days  when  


there was surveillance, it is quite clear that they were in the business of street dealing 


in heroin and cocaine. It is surely a seriously aggravating factor that the drugs were
 
 

here trafficked were to finance their gang activities. 


  

I assess this level of dealing to  be somewhere  between category 3  and  category  2;  I  


assess their role to be significant but not leading. I do not make any discount for the 


very late plea; the sentence on these defendants on count 4 is 8 years. 


The  cannabis  dealing  (as  charged  in  count  6,  the  old  count  5)  was,  I  think,  more
 
 

 

persistent;  and,  as  I  find,  on  a  considerably  larger  scale.  Again,  I  put  their  dealing
 
 

 

 

somewhere between Category 3 and Category 2; here however, I assess them both as
 
 

 

 

 

 

playing a leading role. Again, I do not make  any discount for the very late plea; the 


 

sentence on these counts is 5 years. 


 

Ryan Holden on counts 4 and 6 


I  turn  to  Ryan  Holden.  There  was  some  evidence  of  his  dealing  in  Class  A  drugs,  


being  drugs  found  at  the  house  he  shared  with  his  father  and  a  tick  list,  where  the
 
 

 

 

17
--------
debts amounting to £2000 odd strongly suggested dealing in Class A drugs. I accept 

 

that this was at a very much lower level than his cannabis dealing. This is Category 3 
 

dealing; he played a significant role. 

He  had  been  stopped  and  searched  on  several  occasions  in  possession  of  cannabis 
 

dealing  bags. Twice he had stopped in possession of sums  of money: £300 on 27th 
 

 

March; £250 on 9th June; which suggested an active street dealer in cannabis. Fully 
 

16  different  mobile  phones  were  traced  to  him  and  there  were  plainly  others  which 

 

 

have not been traced.  

One of the prison letters (it is at page 15) establishes that this course of dealing is of 
 

very  long  standing.  Ryan  Holden  told  the  jury,  truthfully  I  find,  that  he  received 
 

cannabis  on  credit  from  Anthony  Jewell  and  paid  him  by  selling  it  on.  This  is 

 

somewhere  between  category  2  and  category  3:  he  was  again  playing  a  significant 
 

role. 

He will be sentenced to 6 years on Count 4 and 4 years on count 6. 

The Altcourse ‘throw’ (Count 7) 


I turn to count 7, on 20th May police officers stopped a taxi outside Altcourse prison, 


 
among  the  passengers  were  Mark  Thomas,  Ryan  Holden  and  Sam  Hughes.  They
 

 

 

searched the taxi and recovered 2 packages, each of which contained mobile phones, 


 
a  SIM  card  and  some  cannabis.  Illicit  mobiles,  of  course,  have  a  particular  value  in
 

 

prison. By his plea of guilty, Anthony Jewell has accepted that this throw was for him.  


 

 
The  delivery  of  drugs  into  prison  is  a  particularly  aggravated  form  of  drugs 

trafficking. 

The sentence on Anthony Jewell is 4 years; on Mark Thomas, Ryan Holden and Sam 
 

Hughes it is 3 years. 

The second ‘throw’  

I turn to count 5, which charged Mark Thomas and Barry Burke with conspiring to 
 

supply a Class A controlled drug to Anthony Jewell in Walton prison.  

On  10  January,  police  officers  followed  a  taxi  along  Longmoor  Lane,  where  the  
 

 

 

occupants seemed to realise that they had been spotted, for it speeded up and turned 
 

 

into Fazakerly hospital. The police stopped the car in the grounds as they approached 
 

a couple of packages were thrown out of the car, each package had 2 mobile phones; 
 

some bush cannabis and a small amount of heroin.  

 

18
--------
Although  the  amounts  are  small,  it  is  an  aggravating  factor  that  the  supply  was 
 

intended for a serving prisoner. 

I  am  not  influenced  by  the  sentence  passed  upon  Robert  Watt  for  his  part  in  this 
 

 

 

offence; he was a mere cipher. 

 

 

On this count in this case, I take the starting point I take to be 5 years; the sentence 

on Anthony Jewell, who was convicted after a trial, will therefore be 5 years. 

Mark  Thomas  and  Barry  Burke  when  arraigned  upon  another  indictment  pleaded 

 
guilty  to  this  offence  on  17  April  2012,  they  must  have  full  credit  for  that;  I  shall 

 
reduce  the  sentence  by  one  third  to  3  years  and  4  months  on  count  1  of  that 

 

indictment,  which  charged  them  with  possessing  a  Class  A  controlled  drug  with 

 
intent to supply; on Count 2 which charged them with possessing a Class B controlled 

 
drug  with  intent  to  supply,  they  will  be  sentenced  to  2  years  (again  giving  credit  of  

 

 

 

 

  
one third for the timely plea). 

Shaun Byrne 

It is clear that was a member of the gang but he was not charged with participation in 

the  violence;  it  must,  I  think,  follow,  that  he  is  not  at  the  centre  of  the  gang’s  
 

 

activities; he did however participate in the drug dealing.  

On  a  number  of  occasions  he  was  seen  or  stopped  by  the  police  when  he  was  quite 

obviously  dealing  in  drugs.  One  such  incident,  on  3rd  Nov  was  even  captured  on  a 

 
police  surveillance  camera.  The  telephone  traffic  around  this  time  and  around 

another  police  surveillance  operation  on  7th  November  is  plainly  referable  to  Shaun 

Byrne’s dealing in drugs. 

 
He  was  present,  as  I  have  said,  on  22  December  when  several  deals  of  heroin  and  

£700 in cash were found at Barry Burke’s house. 

What  is  proved  against  him  is  persistent  street  dealing  in  heroin  and  cannabis.  I 
 

 

consider that his dealing was again between category 2 and 3. He played a significant 
 

role. 

He  is  now  aged  20.  He  has  previous  convictions  for  driving  offences  and  being  in 

possession of cannabis for personal consumption; he has no convictions for any other 
 

 

offence. He has produced impressive character references; I do not doubt that on his 

 

release from prison he may be able to lead a decent life, if he is minded to do so.  

The  sentence  on  Shaun  Byrne  on  count  4  is  6  years;  on  count  6,  the  sentence  is  4 
 

years.  

 

19
--------
I will postpone the confiscation proceedings against Mark Thomas, Barry Burke and 

Shaun Byrne, and I approve and set the timetable proposed by Mr Johnson QC. 

 
I make deprivation orders in respect of the firearms, the ammunition, the drugs and 

the phones seized.  

This is a case to which the victim surcharge applies.  

 
I  direct  that  a  transcript  of  these  sentencing  remarks  is  made  so  as  to  inform  the  

 

 

 

 
Parole  Board  in  due  course  of  my  assessment  of  their  criminality  and  of  the  risks 

 
which they now present. 

 

20",2013-04-29 00:00:00,UK Crown Court
2225538,"R v Philpott, Philpott & Mosley","As I said yesterday in the course of argument this is a unique sentencing exercise.    
You have each been convicted of 6 counts of manslaughter.  Each count represents 
the death of a child.  They ranged in age from 5 to 13.  They died as a direct result of 
the fire set in the hallway of 18 Victory Road in the early hours of the 11th May last 
year.  All 3 of you are responsible for the deliberate setting of that fire.  All 3 of you 
are responsible for those deaths. 
 
 
I have not the slightest doubt that you, Michael Philpott were the driving force behind 
this shockingly dangerous enterprise.  You Mairead Philpott, the mother of all of 
those children and you Paul Mosley, a family friend assisted him. 
 
The background to these offences has been rehearsed at length in this court and 
elsewhere but it is my duty to set it out in sufficient detail for my sentencing decisions 
properly to be understood. 
 
Michael Philpott 
 
Until February 2012 you lived in one household with your wife and her 6 children, 
and with another woman, Lisa Willis, and her 5 children, making 11 children in all.   
You were the father of 9 of the children.  You were, by that time, 55 years old.  
Mairead Philpott was 31.  Lisa Willis was 28.   Those arrangements had been in place 
for around 10 years or so.  During that period you married Mairead Philpott.  Lisa 
Willis, was a bridesmaid at your wedding.   The children were, on the evidence, well 
fed and clothed.  They attended school regularly.    
 
You were obsessed with Lisa Willis.  Indeed it was plain to me when you were giving 
 
evidence over more than 3 days in the witness box that you still are.   In the period 
before Lisa Willis left on at least 3 occasions you asked Mairead Philpott to agree to a 
divorce so that you could marry Lisa.  Apparently you expected Mairead to remain in 
the house with the children just as before.   Mairead Philpott refused.   I shall return to 
that later.   
 
In February of last year Lisa Willis left you, taking her children with her.  She did not 
dare tell you she was leaving.  She told Mairead Philpott that she was taking her 
children swimming.  She and the children left with the clothes they stood up in and 
their swimming things.  You soon realised what had happened and you set about 
trying to bring her back.  The evidence shows that you tried sweet talking her.  You 
tried cajoling and then bullying her.  Sometimes you moved between the three tactics.    
She would not come back.  You could not stand the fact that she had crossed you. 
You were determined to make sure that she came back and you began to put together 
your plan. 
 
Before I turn to what you did next it is necessary to look at the history of your 
relationships with other women.  
The first with which I am concerned was a relationship with a girl in her teens.  You 
were in your 20s.  The relationship was characterised by violence; there were 
repeated beatings.  On one occasion you broke her arm, on another you dislocated her 
knee with a sledgehammer.  You were sure that she was having affairs and would 
come back from your posting in the army to  check on her, repeatedly.  Eventually she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
summoned the courage to bring your relationship to an end.  You did not accept her 
decision. 
 
You broke into her house, armed yourself with a knife and went to her bedroom 
 
where you stabbed her repeatedly in a ferocious attack which left her with life 
threatening injuries from which she has never fully recovered.  You intended, as a 
jury were later to find, to kill her.  When her mother intervened you turned on her.  
You stabbed her repeatedly in a further vicious attack and you caused her serious 
injuries.  You were convicted of attempted murder and wounding with intent contrary 
to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act.  You have, I am rightly 
reminded, served your sentence for that but it is clear from the evidence that I 
excluded from the trial that you have repeatedly used that conviction as a means of 
controlling other women, terrifying them as to what you might do to them if they did 
not follow your will. 
 
When you came out of prison you married your first wife.   Three children were born.  
You subjected your wife to physical violence throughout your relationship.  She never 
reported anything to the police.  She was too afraid to do so.  She knew of your past. 
She believed she could not leave you.  She simply hoped that the time would come 
when you would leave her.  And that time came when you took up with a very young 
Heather Kehoe.  She was 16 when she ran away with you, you were in your 40s.  She 
spoke tellingly of life with you; sometimes you were charming, always domineering, 
always in control.  Your initial plan in the early days of your relationship was to find a 
house big enough to accommodate the children of your first marriage who were to be 
removed from their mother.  In the event they remained living with their mother.  
Heather Kehoe had 2 children.  You controlled her through physical and sexual 
violence, threats and emotional abuse.  Eventually she ran away from you.  You 
prevented her from taking the children and they remained with you for some 6 
months.  She achieved custody of them only after a protracted court battle.  Ever since 
you have subjected her to repeated allegations, seeking to undermine her relationships 
with the children.  She like the two women before her speaks of the life long damage 
she has suffered as a result of her relationship with you. 
 
You then met Mairead Philpott.  At that time she was a young single mother of one 
little boy.  She told the court that she saw you as her guardian angel and moved in 
with you. She loved you as she told the court.  She also found in that household in the 
early days of your relationship the security she craved and had not previously found.  
You then met Lisa Willis as I have described.   Mairead agreed to have her in the 
house.  She told the court she was hurt.  Of course she was.  You did not care.  You 
controlled and manipulated those women as you had controlled and manipulated their 
predecessors.  They ran the household and looked after all the children.  They went 
out to work.  Their wages and their benefits went into your account, you controlled 
how money was spent.  Your suggestion that this was a joint account and this was a 
normal family arrangement was frankly ridiculous.  These two young women were 
not even permitted to have a front door key.   You checked on Lisa Willis’s 
relationships at work.  Exactly as you had done in your earlier relationships.   I accept 
that the level of physical violence had reduced in recent years, but the level of control, 
aggression and fear most certainly did not.  Women were your chattels, there to look 
after you and your children (for that is how you describe them all).  You bark orders 

  

 

 

 

 

2
--------
and they obey.  Witness after witness described the dynamics in your household.  You 
were king pin, no one else mattered.   
 
What was plain from the earliest stage of the evidence was the importance to you of 
your children.  In addition to the 11 who formed the household in early 2012 you 
have another 7.  Having heard the evidence and having observed you carefully 
throughout your trial I am quite satisfied that for you the principal purpose of your 
many children is to reflect on you.  Their needs desires and aspirations were very low 
on your list of priorities, if indeed they featured at all.   You craved attention, you 
enjoyed the limelight.  You courted publicity.  You were and remain the centre of 
your world and it is plain that you require everyone in your life, but particularly the 
women to make sure that you remain at the centre of their world.  Your needs and 
desires took precedence over everything, everyone else, including your children. 
You so arranged your life and theirs so that everything was done for the pleasure of 
Michael Philpott. 
 
I turn back then to the events of the spring of 2012.   You wanted to achieve the return 
of Lisa Willis.  The way of achieving that, you decided, was to engineer the return of 
the children to you.  She would then surely follow.  In March on a pretext you 
engineered a confrontation with Lisa Willis and her family which ended with threats 
from her sister.   Within a very short time you had formulated the plan which would 
lead to the death of those 6 children.   You began to plant the idea that Lisa Willis and 
her family were threatening to set fire to your home.   You mentioned it to 
acquaintances and friends.   In April you persuaded Lisa Willis to meet you but she 
did not repeat the exercise.  In May you posted an entry on Facebook identifying her 
brother in law as the father of her eldest child.  This was another of your obsessions.  
Early in your relationship you had beaten her with a weapon to try and force her to 
agree with your suspicions.  She never did.  In early May in response to the Facebook 
posting she telephoned you.  You say she threatened you.  You were delighted with 
that.  You called the police immediately and demanded that she be arrested.   You 
were furious that the police refused to do that.  You demanded that there be a change 
of supervising officer, just as (I note in passing) you had done in late 2011 in respect 
of an assault where the police would not dance to your tune.  From the time she came 
back for clothing in February to the time of the fire you repeatedly sought to use the 
police to strengthen your position against Lisa Willis.  They were not drawn in.   
A court hearing was set for the 11th May in respect of the arrangements for the 
children.  You told people that you had a plan, something up your sleeve.  At trial you 
preposterously said that the plan was to ask for residence at the hearing on the 11th 
 
May.  It was obvious nonsense.  You knew perfectly well that there was no reason to 
remove those children from the care of their mother.  You had to do something 
extreme to get your own way.   And you did 
 
The means by which you were to achieve the removal of Lisa Willis from the care of 
her children were outside the comprehension of any right thinking person.  The plan, 
which you had plainly been considering for some time, was to set fire to your home 
on the night before the court hearing, making it look as though the fire had been set 
from outside.  You would then rescue the children from upstairs via an external 
ladder.  You would be the hero of the hour.  Lisa Willis would be arrested and you 
would have achieved your aim. You had even arranged for the children’s school 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
places to be held open for them for the Monday morning.     
 
 
It was a wicked and dangerous plan.  And you put it into effect with the assistance of 
your two codefendants.  You poured petrol on the floor.  Paul Mosley was responsible 
for removing the containers from your home.  You set light to it.  After a short while 
Mairead Philpott spoke to the emergency services.   It became clear that there was no 
chance of a successful rescue and the children perished.  The latter half of the 999 call 
is harrowing evidence of the unravelling of the plan.   
 
The jury were spared some of the most harrowing details of the removal of the 
children from 18 Victory Road.  Mercifully their deaths were swift and, it would 
seem, without pain.  No one could have listened to the evidence of the fire fighters 
and no be moved by what they had done and what they had seen in their efforts to 
combat the fire and save the children.   You neighbours were traumatised by what 
they saw; several of them tried to help. They risked their own safety to try and help.  
Their bravery was required as a result of your callous stupidity.  It is clear that they 
have been shattered, as has the local community generally by the knowledge that you 
and your codefendants started this fire deliberately.  Within minutes of the fire you 
were telling people that this was the responsibility of Lisa Willis and her family.  You 
blamed the police for not acting sooner.    Lisa Willis was arrested and her children 
were taken into care.  She had nothing to do with this fire, neither did her family. 
When your friends were gathering around you at the Premier Inn you were eager to 
hear that Adam Taylor, your neighbour might be responsible, even though you knew 
perfectly well as the covert tapes show that he had nothing to do with it.  You went to 
the police,  reported it and he and his wife were arrested on 6 counts of murder, as you 
plainly intended. 
   
I recognise as I must that the offences of which you have been convicted are offences 
of manslaughter and not murder.  That means that I sentence on the basis that you did 
not intend either to kill your children or to cause them really serious harm.  
 
But let me be clear; what you did intend, plainly, was to subject your children to a 
terrifying ordeal.  They were to be woken from their beds in the middle of the night 
with their home on fire so you could rescue them and be the hero.  Their terror was 
the price they were going to pay for your callous selfishness.  In fact they paid with 
their six young lives.  They had no chance of survival and I am quite sure that when 
you set that fire you were not thinking about them because you simply did not care.  
You were going to get your own way. 
 
It has been said on your behalf that you were a good father.  Lisa Willis said so as did 
 
others.  They said you loved your children.  I cannot give that description to a man 
who acted as you did. 
 
You lied to the police and you lied to the jury.  Ever since the fire your life has been a 
performance for the public and the police, and then in this court.  Your conduct has 
been punctuated by collapses and shows of distress designed to evoke sympathy 
where none is merited, designed to manipulate emotion.  
I accept you have lost 6 children.  I very much regret that everything about you 
suggests that your grief has very often been simulated for the public gaze.     
 

 

4
--------
You knew that Mairead 

You made sure that Mairead “stuck to the story”.  Checking with her at every 
opportunity that she wasn’t going to stray, as you put it.
Philpott would do almost anything for your approval, to please you, to get your 
attention, as she put it.  Without you she would never have become involved in this 
plan.  Because she failed to put her children before you she has lost all of them.  
Nothing I have seen in your conduct before and during this trial gives me any reason 
to believe that you had the slightest concern for Mairead Philpott.   She too was 
expendable. 
 
The maximum sentence for manslaughter is life imprisonment.  You are a 
disturbingly dangerous man. Your guiding principle is what Mick Philpott wants he 
gets.  You have no moral compass.     I have no hesitation in concluding that these 6 
offences are so serious and the danger you pose is so great that the only proper 
sentence is one of life imprisonment and that is the sentence I impose upon you.   
The law requires me to impose a period of years that you will serve before you are 
considered for parole.  To reach that period I must identify the determinate sentence 
you would have served had I not imposed a life sentence.  The determinate sentence 
would have been one of 30 years’ imprisonment.  I am required by parliament to 
halve that to reflect that were this a determinate sentence you would serve only half.  
The minimum period you must therefore serve before you are considered for parole is 
one of 15 years.  From that I deduct 307 days to reflect the time you have already 
served on remand to give a term of 14 years and 58 days.  Whether or not you are ever 
released will be a matter for the parole board.   
 
 
Mairead Philpott 
 
I am not going to repeat the history. Nor do I need to reiterate how serious these 
offences are. 
   
 
As a result of what you did in the early hours of 11th May 2012 all your children lost 
their lives and you have lost all of your children.   I accept that you feel their loss 
profoundly and that your grief is real. 
by Mr Smith that your children were your route to fulfilment.  You loved them and 
cared for them.  
 
I have already made clear that this was Michael Philpott’s plan.  I accept that he 
treated you as a skivvy or a slave, and you were prepared to put up with that.   As 
 
became clear during the trial you were prepared to go to any lengths, however 
humiliating, to keep him happy.  At an early stage of the trial it appeared that you 
were entirely downtrodden by Michael Philpott to the extent that it appeared that you 
felt you had no choice but to do whatever he wanted in whatever way he wanted in 
any aspect of your lives together.  But as the evidence came out it was plain that this 
was not quite the position.   This was put beyond doubt when you gave evidence. 
You pointed out that you had stood up to him in the past.   That is why when he asked 
you for a divorce on no fewer than 3 occasions you refused him.  That was a request 
you were simply not prepared to accommodate, whatever he said.    It is inescapable 
therefore that when something was important enough to you, you were capable of 
exercising a choice which was not his choice. 
 

It is clear from what has been said about you 

 

    

 

 

 

5
--------
These were your children; your first responsibility, surely, was to them.  Instead you 
joined in with his plan.   Putting his obsession with Lisa above the safety of your 
children.   The reality of the plan you went along with and helped execute was that 
your children were to be frightened out of sleep in the middle of the night and rescued 
by their father from a fire that should never have been started.  The risks were obvious 
and overwhelming and anyone who has heard the harrowing wailing from you on the 
999 call can hear your realisation that this had gone horribly wrong and your children 
were in mortal danger.   
 
But by then it was too late and you bear your responsibility for that.  You put Michael 
Philpott above your children and as a result they have died.  After the fire you threw 
your lot in with Michael Philpott.  You supported him in his quest to get residence of 
the other children.  You complied with his sexual demands to keep Paul Mosley 
onside. 
 
You lied to the police and you stuck to the story, just as he asked you to, to the police 
and to the jury. You did not, I recognise,  agree to lie about the relationship between 
Adam Taylor and Lisa Willis when Michael Philpott set about blaming him. 
     
Before these offences you had committed no criminal offences.  You now have 
convictions for 6 counts of the manslaughter of your children 
 
I am quite satisfied that a determinate sentence is appropriate in your case but it must 
reflect the magnitude of these offences.  The sentence I pass is one of 17 years 
imprisonment.  Of that you will serve one half at which point you will be released on 
licence.  If you commit any further offences during the operational period of the 
licence you will be liable to be recalled and may have to serve the balance of your 
sentence. 
 
Any time that you have spent on remand will be deducted from the period you are to 
serve.

Everything that I have said about the seriousness of these offences applies to you.  
 
Michael Philpott’s obsession with Lisa Willis was nothing to do with you.   Where 
his children lived had nothing to do with you.   You have young children of your 
own.  You must have appreciated the appalling risk to which these 6 children were to 
be exposed when this fire was started in their home.  And yet you were prepared to go 
along with the plan and to join in with it to please your then friend, Michael Philpott.  
I am quite sure that one of your tasks that night was to remove the petrol containers 
from the scene so that the attack would appear to have come from outside.    
 
You enjoyed the attention that you gained from your proximity to the fire.  You 
boasted of being arrested and bailed for 6 counts of murder.  You could not help 
telling people that this was a plan that had gone wrong.  You were going to hand 
yourself in as “it wasn’t fair that Mick was taking all the blame”, “what would you 
say if I told you we rehearsed it all 6 weeks earlier”, and so on. When your clothes

--------
were analysed it became clear that petrol additive was on your jeans, your jumper and 
on one of your shoes just as it was on the clothing of your two co-defendants.      
 
You too are responsible for the deaths of 6 children.  As a result you have lost all 
contact with your own children.  You may not see them now until they reach 
adulthood, if then.  Unsurprisingly your former partner wants nothing to do with you 
in the light of all that has become known about your conduct in the course of this trial. 
Since you were convicted of robbery as a teenager you have not been in trouble with 
the police at all but that good conduct is of little assistance when set against the 
seriousness of these offences. 
 
I see no proper basis upon which to distinguish between you and Mairead Philpott.  
Accordingly the sentence I pass is one of 17 years imprisonment.  You will serve half 
 
of that period. Thereafter you will be released on licence.  If you commit any further 
offences you will be recalled to prison and may have to serve the rest of your 
sentence.  Any time that you have spent on remand will be deducted from the period 
 
you are to serve.

WORCESTER CROWN COURT 

 

2 APRIL 2013 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE FLAUX 

 

 

 

John Taylor, you have been found guilty of the murder of your wife Alethea. Since 
her body has never been found, only you know what became of her on the night of 
18/19  January  2012  and  where  her  body  is.  However,  by  their  verdict,  the  jury 
have rejected your defence that you were not responsible for her death and do not 
 
know  what  has  become  of  her.  Despite  your  denial  in  evidence,  Alethea  was 
 
clearly  perceived  by  you  as  an  obstacle  to  your  happiness  with  Alison  Dearden. 
 
Furthermore, by 12 December 2011 Alethea had discovered that you were having 
 
an  affair  as  you  well  knew  and,  as  her  notebooks  bear  out,  you  were  concerned 
that  she  should  not  reveal  the  affair  to  other  people.  The  incident  at  Yarpole 
 
church and her extreme upset at Iris Lawson’s house on the evening of 18 January 
 
2012 followed on from earlier incidents on 24 November 2011, Boxing Day 2011 
 
and New Year’s Eve 2011, when her misery and agitation at your duplicity became 
apparent, so it must have been a matter of considerable concern to you that she 
was going to reveal the affair. It is also evident from her notebooks and from what 
 
she  said  to  Alison  Dearden  on  12  December  and  to  Tina  Powell  on  Boxing  Day, 
that there is a dark and violent side to your personality that possibly only Alethea 
saw. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
So it was that on that night of 18/19 January, when you got home, your anger and 
frustration  with  Alethea  must  have  boiled  over.  You  either  attacked  her  in  the 
bedroom  where  her  blood  was  found  on  both  sides  of  the  bedspread  and  duvet 
 
cover or attacked her elsewhere and then put her, bleeding, on the bed. It may be 
 
that  you  smothered  her  with  a  pillow.  However,  by  whatever  means,  you  killed  
her and then drove her body away in your car under cover of darkness. As a man 
 
who  has  lived  all  his  life  in  rural  Herefordshire,  you  were  well  able  to  find  an 
 
isolated  location  to  conceal  her  body,  where  even  the  extensive  searches  by  the 
police and other local people have not found her. 

 

 
The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment and that is the sentence 
of  the  Court  upon  you.  However,  under  Section  269  and  Schedule  21  of  the 
 
Criminal  Justice  Act  2003,  I  have  to  determine  the  minimum  term  you  should 
serve before you will be eligible to be considered by the Parole Board for release. 

 

I  am  satisfied  that  in  your  case  the  features  identified  in  paragraphs  4  and  5  of 
Schedule  21  are  absent.  Accordingly,  the  starting  point  is  15  years.  I  emphasise 
 
though that is only the starting point and I have to consider what aggravating and 

 

 
1.	 

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

 
 
4.
--------
mitigating factors there are in order to determine the appropriate minimum term. 
 
Paragraphs  10  and  11  of  Schedule  21  set  out  some  of  the  aggravating  and 
mitigating factors which may be relevant to the offence of murder, but neither list 
 
is  intended  to  be  exclusive  and  what  may  aggravate  or  mitigate  the  offence  will 
depend upon all the circumstances of the particular case. 

 

 
A  particularly  serious  aggravating  feature  of  this  case  is  your  concealment  of 
 
Alethea Taylor’s body. Even now, you have failed to disclose what you have done 
with her, with all the agony that causes for her family and friends. You appear to 
have  shown  no  remorse,  perhaps  because  you  continue  to  deny  that  it  was  you 
who murdered her.   

 
In  terms  of  mitigating  factors,  although  you  have  not  admitted  that  you  killed 
Alethea or vouchsafed any explanation as to how she died, I sentence you on the 
 
basis that her killing was not premeditated and that you did not intend to kill her 
but only to cause her serious bodily harm. I also take into account that you have 
 
not  been  in  trouble  with  the  police  before  and  so  there  is  no  question  of  any 
previous  convictions  of  any  kind.  Finally  your  age  and  the  likely  impact  of  the 
 
sentence upon you are matters I take into account in imposing a lower minimum 
  
term than I would have done if you had been a younger man. 

 

 

 
 

Weighing the various aggravating and mitigating features I have identified in the 
 
balance,  I  have  concluded  that  the  appropriate  minimum  term  will  be  17  years. 
 
From  that  will  be  deducted  the  290  days  you  have  spent  in  custody.  What  this 
 
means is that the minimum amount of time you will spend in prison from today 
 
before  the  Parole  Board  can  order  early  release  is  16  years  and  75  days.  If  it 
 
remains  necessary  for  the  protection  of  the  public,  you  will  continue  to  be 
 
detained after that date. If the Parole Board does decide to direct release you will 
 
remain on licence for the remainder of your life and may be recalled to prison at 
any time.

Lord Justice Leveson : 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

On  31st  January  2012,  at  the  Crown  Court  at  Woolwich  before  Mr  Justice  Wilkie, 
 
Usman Khan (then nearly 21 years of age), Abdul Bosher Mohammed Shahjahan (one 
 
month short of 28) and Nazam Hussain (26) pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in 
preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to s. 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006 (Count 
9); Omar Sharif Latif (28 years of age) pleaded guilty to a similar offence (Count 12); 
and  Mohibur  Rahman  (27)  pleaded  guilty  to  being  in  possession  of  articles  for  a 
terrorist purpose contrary to s. 57 of the 2006 Act (Count 11). On the 9th February 
2012,  Khan  was  sentenced  to  detention  for  public  protection  with  a  minimum 
custodial  term  of  8  years;  Rahman  was  sentenced  5  years  imprisonment;  Latif  was 
sentenced to an extended sentence of 15 years 4 months with a custodial term of 10 
years imprisonment and an extension period of 5 years.  Shahjahan and Hussain were 
both sentenced to imprisonment for public protection with minimum custodial terms 
 
of 8 years 10 months for Shahjahan and 8 years for Hussain. In each case, the time 
 
spent on remand was ordered to count towards the sentence and all were subject to 
terrorist  notification  periods  imposed  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Part  4  of  the 
 
Counter  Terrorism  Act  2008  of  30  years  (save  for  Rahman  whose  period  was  15 
years). With the leave of the single judge, each appeals against sentence. 

 

In order to understand the background and part of the basis for these appeals, it is also 
 
necessary to record that Mohammed Chowdhury (aged 21), Shah Mohammed Lutfar 
 
Rahman (29), Gurukanth Desai (30) and Abdul Malik Miah (25) were charged in the 
 
same indictment.  They each pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in preparation for 
 
acts of terrorism (Count 10) and were each sentenced to extended sentences of 18½ 
years,  17  years,  17  years  and  21  years  10  months  respectively,  the  custodial  terms 
being  13½  years,  12  years,  12  years  and  16  years  10  months,  in  all  cases  with  an 
extension  period  of  5  years.  Again,  time  spent  on  remand  was  ordered  to  count 
 
towards the sentence and all were subject to terrorist notification periods of 30 years. 

For  the  purposes  of  this  appeal  and  the grounds  advanced,  the  facts  alleged  by  the 
 
prosecution  and  the  contentions  of  the  appellants  require  analysis  along  with  a 
 
detailed account of the circumstances in which the guilty pleas came to be tendered. 
  
By way of introduction, at the time of the offences concerned, the appellants Khan, 
Shahjahan,  Mohibur  Rahman  and  Hussain  were  each  born  in  the  UK  although  of 
Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin and lived in Stoke; they are referred to as the Stoke 
defendants. Latif, born in London, lived in Cardiff as did his co-accused Desai and 
Miah  (the  latter  two  are  brothers,  Miah  having  been  born  in  London):  they  are 
Bangladeshi in origin and referred to as the Cardiff defendants. Chowdhury and Shah 
Rahman who are not appellants were also Bangladeshi in origin and lived in London: 
 
the London defendants. At some time, the accused each became a committed Islamic 
fundamentalist, believing in jihad, that is to say, they wished to support and commit 
 
acts of terrorism in furtherance of their religious beliefs.  They came to the attention 
of the security services who monitored them using covert surveillance techniques and 
devices and were able to effect their arrest prior to advanced steps having been taken 
to implement their plans. 
  

Although from different parts of the country, the three groups met together.  Also by 
way of overview, on the 7 November 2010, they were recorded meeting in a Cardiff 
park.  Although  limited  material  was  available  as  to  precisely  what  transpired,  the 
meeting  was  alleged  to  have  covered  ideological  discussion  and  general  ambitions

R v. Khan & ors 

concerning terrorist activity. On the 28 November 2010, the defendants from Cardiff 
and  London  met,  this  time  in  London,  where  discussions  for  targets  for  attack  and 
methodology  took  place.  On  the  28,  29  November  and  10  December,  the  brothers 
Desai and Miah were recorded discussing the construction of explosive devices. On 
the  12  and  14  December,  the  Stoke  defendants  were  recorded  discussing  jihad 
 
overseas.  Also  on  the  12,  the  three  groups  met  in  a  Welsh  country  park  where 
 
discussion  was  said  to  include  how  to  advance  plans  for  an  attack.  On  the  14 
December,  the  Stoke  defendants  were  monitored  discussing  locations  in  Stoke  that 
may  be  targeted.  On  the  15  December,  Khan  was  monitored  in  conversation  about 
how to construct a pipe bomb from a recipe referred to in the Al-Quaeda publication 
“Inspire  1”.  Finally,  on  the  19  December,  the  London  defendants  were  engaged  in 
experimentation  using  the  pipe  bomb  recipe.  It  was  this  development  that,  on  20 
December 2010, prompted the arrest of the group.  

The result was that all nine men faced an indictment the principal counts of which 
were a joint charge of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism and 
conspiracy  to  cause  an  explosion  likely  to  endanger  life  or  cause  serious  injury  to 
property  in  the  UK.  There  were  substantial  pre-trial  hearings  before  Wilkie  J  in 
September  and  December  2011  (described  by  Mr  Andrew  Edis  Q.C.,  who  led  Ms 
Morgan at the trial and prepared a detailed skeleton argument for this court, as a “long 
and abrasive disclosure battle”) with the notional trial date being fixed for 16 January 
 
2012. 
In  the  event,  the  trial  did  not  then  commence;  there  was  further  pre-trial 
argument and negotiation and a jury was not sworn until 24 January.   

 

Discussions between the Crown and the appellants then continued as the impact of 
further disclosed evidence was appreciated.  One of the issues related to a separation 
of the allegations against the Stoke defendants and the London defendants based upon 
their  different  activities,  intentions  and  aspirations.    During  the  course  of  those 
discussions, the London defendants, by their counsel, sought a Goodyear indication as 
to sentence.  On 31 January, Wilkie J acceded to the request and provided such an 
indication  (which  did  not  involve  an  indeterminate  term).    Thereafter,  all  the 
defendants  (including  those  who  had  not  sought  an  indication  of  sentence)  pleaded 
guilty  to  specific  offences  which  identified  their  involvement  as  opposed  to 
involvement in the activities of others discussed in the joint meetings. 

The  defendants  provided  bases  of  plea  which  were  not  challenged  by  the  Crown  it 
being accepted that the facts (not inconsistent with the bases of plea) would be opened 
in  full.    Those  who  had  not  received  Goodyear  indications  (i.e.  all  but  the  London 
 
defendants)  used  the  facts  which  formed  the  basis  of  the  offence  to  which  those 
defendants  pleaded  guilty  as  providing  a  template  or  fixed  tariff  against  which  to 
make  submissions  as  to  the  sentences  which  should  be  imposed  on  them  on  the 
grounds  that  their  criminality  was  less  culpable.    In  the  event,  Wilkie  J  took  the 
opposite view and imposed indeterminate sentences on the three Stoke defendants; he 
also  imposed  lengthier  determinate  terms  on  the  two  others  (not  being  the  London 
defendants)  than was submitted could be justified or extrapolated from the Goodyear 
 
indications. 

 
In the circumstances, this judgment will deal with the case under the headings of the 
underlying facts; the Goodyear indication; the general bases of plea; the opening; the 
approach of the judge; the assessment of dangerousness and the indeterminate terms;

and  the  appropriate  determinate  terms,  dealing  first  with  Khan,  Shahjahan  and 
Hussein, then Latif and, finally Mohibur Rahman. 

The Facts 

Although it is not said that any of the appellants belonged directly to Al Qaeda (AQ), 
it  was  alleged  that  they  were  inspired  by  that  ideology  which  encouraged  them  to 
carry out acts of terrorism.  This radicalisation was through the internet, inspired by 
the ideology and methodology of Anwar Al Awlaki (the now deceased Yemini based 
extremist)  and  the  AQ  magazine  “Inspire”  which  he  wrote,  copies  of  which  were 
 
found  on  computer  equipment  seized  from  the  homes  associated  with  many  of  the 
 
defendants.  This magazine was repeatedly referred to as a source of inspiration and 
 
guidance in relation to the construction of an improvised explosive device, in the form 
of  a  pipe  bomb.  Of  particular  significance  was  the  rejection  of  the  “Covenant  of 
Security” which generally protects countries where Muslims live but was said not to 
apply in Britain because the British had broken it.  A communication to this effect 
was sent by Chowdhury to Rahman, Shahjahan and Rahman on 22 and 23 November: 
it is only of interest to jihadis who are deciding whether to attack the country in which 
they  live.  A  considerable  body  of  extremist  ideological  material  (with  lectures  by 
Anwar Al Awlaki) were found in the possession of the men when they were arrested. 

 

On 7 November 2010, the men, from different parts of the country, met together in 
Roath Park, Cardiff.  This meeting was arranged Chowdury who was described by the 
Crown as the ‘linchpin’ for the organisation of the meeting but, Mr Edis emphasised, 
not the leader or most influential defendant. 

Those who attended the meeting (the appellants Latif, Khan, Shahjahan and Mohibur 
Rahman, along with Chowdhury, Miah and Desai) were subject to covert surveillance 
but were clearly alive to the possibility of such surveillance; they were careful about 
what was said near buildings and in cars; they walked around the park talking.  They 
were  observed  in  prayer  and  in  discussions  about  (particularly  in  relation  to  the 
London  defendants)  what  might  be  done.    Copies  of  Inspire  1  and  Inspire  2  were 
created  by  Chowdhury  having  been  provided  by  the  Cardiff  defendants  and,  in 
relation  to  Miah,  Inspire  1  was  opened.    The  bomb  making  recipe  in  Inspire  1 
assumed  significance  in  relation  to  the  bomb  plot  later  developed  by  the  London 
defendants. 

On  28  November,  some  of  the  London  and  Cardiff  defendants  met  to  consider 
 
potential targets and develop a plan to launch an attack with explosives in the UK. 
The following day, in Cardiff, Miah and Desai further discussed making purchases of 
equipment for use in the manufacture of an explosive device.  

 

On 4 and 5 December 2010, conversations were recorded in Stoke.  Usman Khan was 
 
heard seeking to radicalise another male (not prosecuted) making clear his intentions 
to  travel  abroad  to  a  training  camp  which  outwardly  appeared  to  be  ‘a  normal 
Madrassah’ to train to fight jihad.  The Stoke group were to fund the camp and recruit 
men for it: Khan expected only victory, martyrdom or imprisonment.  He and Hussain 
 
were to attend the camp the following month.  What was said made clear the large 
scale nature of the operation and the express contemplation of terrorist operations in 
the UK to be perpetrated by some graduates of the training camp at some future date: 
the imposition of Sharia in Kashmir was not the limit of the group’s aspirations.

On 11 December 2010, three of the Stoke defendants (Khan, Shahjahan and Hussain) 
met and Shahjahan spoke to Chowdhury on the telephone.  They needed money to 
buy weapons; they wanted people who had been radicalised.  They spoke of a meeting 
arranged for the following day, with Khan commenting that they did not want to risk 
something petty like extremist posters: they had a higher priority.  The priority was 
not dawah (the preaching of Islam) but they wanted to talk about jihad. 
 

 

That meeting took place in a large country park in Wales.  The appellants (except for 
Mohibur  Rahman)  attended  with  Chowdhury,  Miah  and  Desai.    The  case  for  the 
prosecution was that, by this time, a plan had been formed in which all defendants had 
committed themselves to acts of terrorism although the precise plan of action was not 
 
settled.  The  London  and  Cardiff  groups  wanted  to  act  quickly  to  carry  out  some 
explosive attack in London; the Stoke group were committed to undertaking training 
 
abroad and were keen to recruit men to go with them and train in terrorism abroad 
with  the  aim  of  further  acts  of  terrorism  in  the  future.    One  of  the  purposes  of  the 
meeting  (as  transpired)  was  for  the  Cardiff  and  London  defendants  to  hand  over 
 
£2,850 in cash to the Stoke appellants to assist in funding the camp.  

It  is  unnecessary  to  set  out  the  full  detail  of  what  was  discussed.    Chowdhury  and 
Miah discussed the Stockholm bomb and a ‘Mumbai-style’ attack.  Miah reported that 
the  Amer  (or  leader)  has  given  instructions  about  two  funds,  one  for  ‘here’  with 
£2,850  ‘designated:  a  matching  conversation  took  place  in  the  Stoke  car  after  the 
meeting.  The three Stoke defendants discussed ‘Abdul’s plan to use Royal Mail to 
post something’ and also the risk of surveillance.  When they met, they were observed 
praying  but  there  is  reference  to  training  and  the  mujahideen  with  Hussain  and 
Shahjahan talking about a plan to get terrorist contacts in Bangladesh, with the brother 
to teach them training. 

The  Stoke  appellants  also  discussed  a  person  who  ‘will  get  training  there;  he’s  the 
main  military  guy  here’  and  how  that  person  had  mastered  the  making  of  a  timing 
device from Inspire.  They discussed Miah and Desai (‘good at the scam’ meaning 
credit card fraud), observing that the main asset is “the Pakistani link” and assert that 
 
the  two  groups  are  to  be  linked  financially in  the  future.    Hussain  commented  that 
Shahjahan is referred to as Ameer (leader).  Shahjahan says to Khan and Hussain that 
“you  guys  probably  will  be  the  next  level  flipping  learners”,  “experts  of  experts”. 
 
There is a reference to AKs which Mr Edis submitted refers to the UK because of the 
ready availability of such weapons in Pakistan.   He also submits that the fact that the 
Cardiff and London group is funding the future operations of the Stoke group is an 
 
indication of the relative hierarchy and who was thought to be operating at the most 
significant level. 

 

On 12 December, Kahn, Shahjahan and Mohibur Rahman met and discussed targeting 
pubs and clubs in the Stoke area by leaving devices in toilets.  It is not suggested that 
this discussion was advanced to become a plan but did involve active consideration of 
using a bomb to kill and descended to the detail of who could plant the bomb and the 
need for a timer.  Khan spoke in such terms as demonstrated that he was radicalised 
and  described  kuffars  as  ‘dogs’.    Mr  Edis  submitted  that  this  discussion  was  not 
pursued because it was clear that the Stoke appellants had other, larger, plans.    

 
19. 

On 15 December, Khan was engaged in conversation with another male about the Al 
Qaeda  publication  Inspire,  discussing  the  pipe  bomb  recipe  (which  he  appeared  to
--------

have memorised) and the possibility of using the device to attack the English Defence 
League.  He  explained  how  Inspire  could  be  obtained  from  the  internet.    Four  days 
 
later, two of the London defendants also discussed how to make a pipe bomb using 
the recipe from Inspire. 

Given that it is possession of the Inspire editions 1 (Summer), 2 (Fall) and 3 (Special) 
that  form  the  basis  of  the  offence  to  which  Rahman  pleaded  guilty,  their  contents 
require some elaboration.  Suffice to say that they celebrate the activities of Al Qaeda 
in the Arabian Peninsula, celebrate the activities of a number of terrorists and their 
attacks  (including  Umar  al-Faruq  Al  Nigir  who  travelled  with  a  bomb  on  a  plane, 
attempts  with  parcel  bombs  including  a  bomb  found  in  a  printer  at  East  Midlands 
 
Airport  targeting  synagogues  in  America)  and  publicise  material  about  Osama  Bin 
Laden,  and  articles  by  Ayman  al  Zawahiri.    They  provide  information  about  bomb 
making, use of encrypted e mails, joining the jihad, use of 4x4 vehicles with guns to 
attack pedestrianised areas in the West.  All those prosecuted either possessed these 
 
publications,  were  proved  to  have  viewed  them  on  line  or  were  familiar  with  their 
 
contents. 

In  the  early  hours  of  the  morning  of  20  December,  the  nine  men  were  arrested. 
 
Dealing  with  these  appellants,  nothing  of  significance  was  found  at  the  home  of 
Nazam Hussain; extremist material and ‘Inspire’ material was found at the homes of 
Shahjahan  and  Rahman.    A  mobile  phone  seized  from  the  address  linked  to  Omar 
 
Latif  contained  material  relating  to  protests  organised  by  Al  Muhajiroun  (Anjem 
Choudhury and Omar Bakri).  At the home of Usman Khan was a document bearing 
notes on the structure, roles and responsibilities of individuals: it bore his fingerprints 
 
and those of Shahjahan.  There was strong support expressed by a handwriting expert 
for the proposition that Shahjahan had written it, placing himself (‘me’) at the top of 
the structure in charge in the UK).  There were references in the document (which set 
 
out a cell structure for security) to Chowdhury, Miah, Khan and Hussain.  Lines of 
communication were limited: it was said that this was to maximise security in relation 
 
to terrorist training. 

 

 
22.	 

Interviews at the police station were not productive of any information.  Most made 
 
no comment; those who did speak did not make comments of significance although it 
should  be  noted  that  Omar  Latif  claimed  to  have  been  asleep  in  the  car  during  the 
 
significant conversations on 12 October 2010. 

The Goodyear Indication 

During the course of the discussions prior to the commencement of the trial (albeit 
after the jury had been sworn), an approach was considered which recognised that, 
although there were common meetings and, potentially, a common purpose among all 
nine  defendants,  the  activities  of  the  London  defendants  and  the  Stoke  defendants 
were different and had different plans.  On the basis that the indictment was split to 
reflect this different criminality, Mohammed Chowdhury and Shah Rahman sought a 
Goodyear indication as to sentence.  It is important to underline that the judge had 
well in mind the observations of Hughes LJ in  Jalil [2009] 2 Cr App R (S) 40 page 
276 when he said (at para 12): 

“The  defendants  generally  had  sought  a  Goodyear  indication 
from the judge.  He declined to give one.  His principal reason 

 
23.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

was  that  in  a  multi-handed  case  in  which  each  defendant  had 
detailed submissions to make about not only his own role but 
his role in comparison with that of others, it was not possible to 
give  useful  prior  indications  of  what  his  conclusions  were 
likely to be about their relative positions.  In that, he was, if we 
 
may say so, plainly right, and the complex competing bases of 
plea advanced by the various defendants both before him and 
now only serve to confirm his position.” 

 

24.	  Wilkie J then set out the two bases of plea to a new count alleging breach of s. 5 of 
the Terrorism Act 2006 relating to the production and detonation of a live explosive 
devise to be in the Stock Exchange.  The terms of the document had been agreed with 
 
the Crown (on the basis that the prosecution would be at liberty to open all relevant 
facts not inconsistent with it). 

 
25.	 

In relation to Mohammed Chowdhury, the basis was as follows: 

“i.  That  the  section  5  offence  included  a  plan  to  place  a  lvie 
explosive device of a kind which was capable of causing death 
or  serious  injury  in  the  Stock  Exchange  in  London.  The 
intention was that it should be exploded but not that it should 
cause death or serious injury.  The intention of the defendant 
was that it should cause terror, property damage and economic 
 
damage.    It  was,  however,  a  clear  risk  that  it  would  in  fact 
cause death or serious injury. 

ii.  It  was  the  intention  of  this  defendant  this  plan  would  be 
 
carried out in the near future.  However, at the time of arrest no 
materials  had  been  obtained  with  a  view  to  constructing  an 
explosive device, nor had any firm date been set for carrying 
out what had been discussed. 

iii. The meetings and discussions on which the prosecution rely 
 
were,  in  part,  in  furtherance  of  this  plan.    The  detailed  target 
developed during the indictment period.  Various other projects 
were also considered during this time. 

iv. The role of this defendant, in particular, was: (a) He was the 
 
linchpin  of  the  group  (see  phone  schedules).  He  played  a 
significant  role  in  researching  and  selecting  the  target  and 
researching the construction of a device on 19 December 2010 
by reading Inspire 1.  (b) There were three people present at all 
relevant face to face meetings between different groups (7/11, 
28/11 and 12/12: he was one of them.” 

 

 

 
26.	 

The basis upon which Shah Rahman offered to plead guilty to the same offence was: 

“1. The defendant met with Mohammed Chowdhury and others 
on  28  November  when  there  were  early  discussions  in  which 
the  defendants  considered  acting  together  and  identified  an 
objective of causing economic damage and disruption.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

2. In due course he became party to a plan with Chowdhury to 
place a live explosive device in the Stock Exchange in London. 
 
The  intention  was  that  it  should  be  exploded  but  not  that  it 
should cause death or serious injury.  The intention was that it 
should cause terror, disruption and financial damage.  However 
 
there was a clear risk that it would in fact cause death or serious 
 
injury. 

3.  Rahman  was  Chowdhury’s  close  associate  in  Lodnon  and 
involved with him in target selection and the planning for the 
 
construction  of  a  device.  This  he  did  on  19  December  when 
 
both researched the construction of a device by reading Inspire 
1.” 

 
27.	 

The  Crown  submitted  a  note  which  identified  that  Jalil  had  been  decided  under  a 
 
different  sentencing  regime  both  in  respects  of  indeterminate  sentences  and  release 
provisions but that the proper comparison was with Jalil type cases rather than other 
s.  5  offences.  The  note  made  a  number  of  other  points  about  the  gravity  of  the 
offending.  These  included  the  use  of  explosive  devices  in  this  context  had  novel 
features;  the  significance  of  using  the  internet  to  encourage  attacks  by  ‘lone  wolf’ 
 
terrorists  and  messages  such  as  Inspire  with  methods  of  attack  that  were  easy  to 
achieve, quick to implement and capable of causing death; the necessary profile of the 
target; the difference between this offending and usual terrorist plots, spontaneity and 
practicality being part of the tactic; the risk of death in relation to a target such as the 
 
Stock  Exchange  as  to  which  consequence  the  offenders  were  indifferent.    Mr  Edis 
accepted that these two defendants did not intend to cause death: it is submitted that 
 
this  could  not  be  said  of  a  person  who  receives  training  in  the  use  of  firearms  for 
 
terrorist purposes. 

 
28.	 

In his ruling, Wilkie J made it clear that he was only focusing on these two defendants 
and, thus, the London aspect of this offending.  He was not purporting to give general 
guidance in relation to other aspects of the case.  He said: 

“It is to be observed that those two written bases of plea do not 
 
involve any dispute as between those two defendants as to their 
respective  roles.  Furthermore,  the  activities  of  those  two 
defendants upon which their agreed bases of plea are focused 
are activities which involve them and only involve others very 
tangentially, at any rate in respect of the actual preparation for 
the production and detonation of a live explosive device.” 

The same is so in relation to his consideration of dangerousness (and thus the question 
of indeterminate sentence).  Speaking only about “these two defendants … their own 
histories and their thought processes and attitudes”, he was able “to form a more or 
less definitive view on the issue of dangerousness though of course without prejudice 
to  that  issue  being  revisited  if  either  chose  to  do  so”.    Having  concluded  that,  in 
relation  to  the  indication  he  was  giving,  he  would  proceed  on  the  footing  that  the 
statutory  test  for  dangerousness  set  out  in  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  had  been 
established, he went on to say that “this is a case which is appropriate for an extended 
 
sentence rather than an indeterminate sentence” and specified minimum terms in line 
with the sentences finally passed.

The Bases of Plea 

R v. Khan & ors 

 
30.	 

Prior  to  this  indication,  the  Stoke  defendants  had  also  approached  the  prosecution 
 
with an offer to plead guilty to a substantive offence reflecting the activities which 
they admitted committing or planning.  This was incorporated into a single basis of 
 
plea reflecting the roles of Usman Khan, Mohammed Shahjahan and Nazam Hussain 
and provided: 

“The defendants plead guilty to [what became count 9] on the 
following basis: 

1.  They  were  trying  to  raise  funds  to  build  a  madrassa  by  a 
mosque that already existed in Kashmir. 

2. The long-term plan included making the madrassa available 
for men who would be struggling and fighting to bring sharia to 
the Kashmir region of Pakistan. 

3. That plan included such people, including at least one of the 
Stoke  defendants,  being  able  to  have  firearms  training  in  or 
around the madrassa for that purpose. 

4. They did not intend to participate in an act of terrorism in the 
UK in the immediate future. They contemplated that some of 
those trained might return to the UK and engage in some sort of 
terrorist  activity,  but  there  was  no  time  table,  no  targets 
identified, nor any method agreed. It may have been that their 
experiences after going to Kashmir might have meant no such 
activity, in the event, would ever actually have taken place in 
the UK”. 

 
31.	 

The  prosecution  took  the  unusual  step  of  responding  to  this  proposed  basis  of  plea 
 
(which did not form the basis of a request for a Goodyear indication and thus did not 
require the prosecution’s agreement) in some detail as follows: 

“The  3  Stoke  Defendants  concerned  (MS,  UK,  and  NH)  will 
have  to  accept  that  the  prosecution  will  open  the  case  as 
follows, and that the Crown is free to make allegations which 
are not inconsistent with the basis of plea.  The defendants are 
not  required  to  accept  all  allegations  made,  and,  since  no 
Goodyear indication is sought, the Court can resolve any issues 
 
which are material to sentence. 

The  language  in  the  Basis  of  Plea  is  not  intended  to  be 
 
comprehensive  and  it  may  be  helpful  to  set  out  the  Crown’s 
position as to what it entails. 

THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
THE PARTIES
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

The Crown will not allege that these defendants are criminally 
liable  as  participants  (either  primary  or  secondary  parties)  in 
the planned attack on the London Stock Exchange. 

The  Crown  will  not  allege  that  any  defendant  was  party  to  a 
plan to carry out any other attack in the UK in the immediate 
future. 

EXPLANATION 

However, it will be alleged that these defendants were part of a 
group of 9 people which was formed in October 2010 with a 
view to deciding how best to further the jihadist cause, which 
meant  planning  for  acts  of  terrorism.    The  meetings  of  the 
group on 7/11 and 12/12 were intended to further this enterprise 
and  were  conduct  within  section  5  of  TACT  2006.    Various 
 
different  proposals  were  considered  during  the  indictment 
period, none of which became a planned attack except that on 
the London Stock Exchange, see above. 

In the event, as a result of those meetings, two different plans 
emerged: the attack on the Stock Exchange, and the plan of the 
 
Stoke defendants identified below.  Each part of the group was 
aware of the plan of the other, and they were discussed freely 
between  them.  The  group  continued  to  function  until  the 
 
arrests as a forum for discussion of possible courses of action. 
 
This  does  not  mean  that  every  member  had  become  a 
participant in every, or any, particular plan. 

These  defendants  were  in  discussion  with  the  London/Welsh 
group in November/December 2010 in the course of which they 
became  aware  that  at  least  some  members  of  that  group 
intended  to  carry  out  attacks  in  the  UK.    The  discussions 
included  terrorist  funding,  and  terrorist  training  in  addition  to 
the plans of the London/Welsh group. 

 

THE PLAN OF ACTION OF THE STOKE GROUP 

They were funding a proposed madrasah abroad which was to 
be a place of terrorist training in that firearms training would be 
provided there.  The madrasah was in the very early stages of 
 
construction,  but 
training  was  already  possible 
(conversation of 4th/5th December). 

terrorist 

 
Mohammed  Shajahan  did  not  intend  to  travel  to  train,  but 
 
Usman  Khan  and  Nazam  Hussain  (among  others)  did. 
Mohammed  Shajahan’s  Defence  Case  Statement  correctly 
 
alleges that UK and NH were about to travel to Pakistan.  He 
does not there concede the purpose of that travel, but it is now 
clear.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

 
The purpose of attendance for the purpose of training was the 
acquisition  of  skills  to  enable  the  commission  of  acts  of 
terrorism  in  furtherance  of  the  jihad.    The  recruitment  and 
funding  of  such  activity  is  section  5  conduct  because  it  is 
intended to result in the commission of acts of terrorism. 
 

The  precise  place  where  they  would  fight  jihad  at  that  later 
stage had not been decided, but the discussions revealed by the 
evidence demonstrate that they contemplated that some of those 
trained  would  commit  their  acts  of  terrorism  abroad  but  that 
 
others  might  return  to  the  UK  and  commit  them  there.    No 
timetable, target, or method for these acts of terrorism had been 
agreed.  Their experiences after going to Kashmir might have 
meant no such activity, in the event, would actually have taken 
place in the UK”. 

 
32.	 

The Prosecution then received basis of pleas from Abdul Miah and Gurukanth Desai 
to the Count 10 allegation. In relation to Miah, this asserted that he would plead guilty 
to an offence contrary to s. 5 of the Terrorism Act on the following basis: 

“1. That he was party to a plan to place an explosive device of a 
kind  capable  of  causing  death  or  serious  injury  in  the  Stock 
Exchange in London. The intention was that it would explode 
but  not  that  it  should  cause  death  or  serious  injury.  The 
intention  of  the  defendant  was  that  it  should  cause  terror, 
property  damage  and  economic  damage.  The  defendants 
realised  that  there  was  a  risk  of  death  or  serious  injury  to 
persons. 

2.  At  the  time  of  the  formulation  of  the  plan,  it  was  the 
intention that the plan would be carried out in the near future. 
However, at the time of arrest, no material had been obtained 
with  a  view  to  constructing  an  explosive  device,  nor  had  any 
firm date been set for carrying out what had been discussed. 

3.  Abdul  Miah  was  fully  involved  in  the  plan.  His  role  was 
limited to discussing the plan and carrying out research on the 
London Stock Exchange. 

4. The meetings and discussions on which the prosecution rely 
were,  in  part,  in  furtherance  of  this  plan.  The  detailed  target 
developed during the indictment period. Various other projects 
were also considered during this time”. 

 
33.	 

The basis of plea (to an identical offence) in relation to Gurukanth Desai was in these 
 
 
terms: 

“He  was  a  party  to  a  plan  to  place  an  explosive  device  in  a 
toilet  in  the  London  Stock  Exchange  of  a  kind  capable  of 
causing death or serious injury.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

His  intention  was  to  cause  terror,  property  damage  and 
economic harm, not to cause death or serious injury. 

He realised that there was a risk that the explosion might cause 
death or serious injury. 

Although his intention was that the plan would be carried out in 
the near future, no materials had been obtained and no firm date 
had been set for carrying out the plan by the time of his arrest. 
The  preparatory  acts  were  limited  to  talk  and  research  by 
others. 

The meetings and discussions upon which the prosecution rely 
were in furtherance of the plan. The target of the London Stock 
Exchange  developed  during  the  indictment  period.  Various 
other projects were considered as well but were abandoned”. 

 
34.	 

These bases of plea were accepted by the Prosecution with the result that Miah and 
Desai sought a short Goodyear indication limited to the level of sentencing that would 
be adopted in Desai’s case, by comparison to other defendants and whether Miah’s 
previous  convictions  (which  were  numerous  but  not  of  a  terrorist  nature  or 
approaching the gravity of this offence) would lead to the possibility of a sentence of 
imprisonment for public protection, rather than an extended sentence, being imposed. 
In response, the Prosecution indicated that it considered that the role of Miah could be 
compared to that of Chowdhury, and the role of Desai could be compared to that of 
Shah Rahman. 

 

 
35.	 

The Judge declined to give any indication of sentence in the cases of Miah and Desai 
 
except to say to Miah’s counsel:-

“[Miah’s] previous record is in contradistinction to everybody 
else’s and the basis on which I have been giving indications or 
 
hints  as  to  level  of  sentence  have  been  on  the  basis  that  they 
were of previous good character.  Obviously your client cannot 
claim  that  and  in  my  judgment  it  would  properly  go  towards 
 
length of a custodial sentence rather than moving it from one 
 
category  to  the  other  because  I  agree  with  Mr.  Edis  that  the 
focal point of dangerousness and its management effectively is 
 
the terrorism offence and what pertains to him would pertain no 
more or less so to the others.” 

 

36.	  Mohibur Rahman then offered a plea to an offence under section 57 of the Terrorism 
Act 2000 in relation to his possession of Inspire 1 and 2. A short basis of plea was 
 
submitted which set out the circumstances of his possession. This was not disputed, 
although no basis of plea was tendered which set out the purpose for the defendant’s 
possession  of  the  items.  The  Prosecution  applied  to  amend  the  indictment  to  add 
Count 11 in those terms.  

Finally, a basis of plea was then received from Omar Latif then offered to plead guilty 
to  an  identical  offence  as  to  the  Stoke and  London  defendants  but  cast  in  different 
 
terms and on this basis: 

 
37.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

“He  attended  a  meeting  in  Cardiff  on  7.11.10  at  which  the 
defendants from Stoke, and Chowdhury, Miah and Desai were 
 
present.  He  arrived  late  and  left  on  a  number  of  occasions, 
returning to central Cardiff by car. He was not present for much 
of the time the others were together. 

He  attended  the  meeting  in  Cwm  Carn  on  12.12.10,  being 
driven there in the car of Abdul Miah. He attended the meeting 
aware  that  conversations  concerning  terrorist  training  activity 
were likely to take place. These conversations did in fact take 
 
place. 

Thereafter Omar Latif did not participate in the development of 
any  plans  of  a  terrorist  nature,  including  those  relating  to  the 
Stock Exchange or terrorist training in Pakistan”. 

 
38.	 

In the event, each of the defendants pleaded guilty to an offence on the basis which 
had been advanced. The prosecution did not seek to proceed in relation to any of the 
 
allegations and the jury (which had been waiting to start the trial) were discharged 
 
from returning verdicts on the remaining counts of the indictment.  

The Opening 

 

39.	  Mr  Edis  for  the  prosecution  then  opened  the  facts  of  the  case,  summarised  above. 
 
During  the  course  of  the  opening,  however,  there  was  a  discussion  about  the 
dangerousness provisions of ss. 225-227 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, relevant to 
any consideration of a sentence of imprisonment for public protection or an extended 
sentence.  Wilkie  J  read  into  the  opening  “the  Crown’s  view  ...  that  of  the  three 
 
geographical elements, the Stoke people regarded themselves and the Crown regard 
 
them as much the more serious offenders”.  There followed this exchange: 

Mr Edis: “What I think I’ve said is that we will not accept that 
they were any less serious as has been published in some press 
reports  of  the  earlier  part  of  these  proceedings;  that  they  are 
different  offences,  a  different  kind  of  offence,  the  bomb  plot 
being generated and to be carried out in a fairly short period of 
time, but involving a live device in a populated building.  The 
Stoke  offence  being  a  rather  longer  term  and  perhaps  more 
sophisticated  plan  which  involved  the  creation  also  of  a  very 
significant risk to public safety. We would certainly submit that 
that is a very serious terrorist offence.” 

Wilkie J: “Right.  I think, reading their conversations, they do 
regard  themselves  as  significantly  more  advanced,  both  in 
 
terms  of  experience,  technique,  ambition,  facility  than  the 
people from Cardiff or London, given the rather (inaudible) raw 
recruits  ...  only  one  of  them  seeming  to  pass  muster  by  their 
exacting  standards  ....  You  are  not  suggesting  that  they’re 
wrong-headed in that assessment?” 

Mr Edis: “Not at all.”
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

 
40.	 

These remarks caused concern in those representing the defendants who had clearly 
 
proceeded on the premise that the more immediate threat to the Stock Exchange was 
 
more  serious  than  what  they  contended  were  the  rather  fanciful  plans  to  build  a 
 
terrorist training camp for which there was, at that stage, no proven funding (save for 
the  £2,850  which  the  London  defendants  had  provided)  by  persons  who  had  no 
terrorist  training  themselves  in  an  area  strictly  controlled  by  Pakistani  security 
services. 

 

 
41.	 

The  following  day  (in  language  clearly  approved  by  Mr  Edis  who  was  not  himself 
then in court), his junior, Ms Morgan, made clear: 

“We  have  been  asked  overnight  to  reflect  on  and  to  indicate 
 
the Crown’s position in relation to the seriousness of Count 9 
and  Count  10  as  they  compare  to  each  other  ...  They  are,  of 
course, quite different offences in the way in which they have 
been particularised and reflect different conduct.  It is therefore 
difficult  to  draw  direct  comparison  between  them.    However, 
balancing the immediacy of the threat in Count 10 namely the 
attack  on  the  Stock  Exchange,  as  against  the  potentially  less 
 
immediate  threat  posed  by  Count  9,  however  with  potentially 
very  serious  consequences  in  the  long-term  and  involving 
calculated  activity  on  the  part  of  the  Stoke  defendants,  we 
submit that the two counts should be viewed as being equally 
serious;  in  other  words,  neither  being  more  serious  or  less 
 
serious than the other. ...  We have also been also been asked to 
clarify out position on dangerousness.  May I reiterate that we 
submit  in  this  case  that  all  nine  defendants  can  properly  be 
 
considered  to  be  dangerousness  within  the  definition  of  the 
2003 Act, principally because of the commitment that they all 
showed to the Jihadist ideology.” 

 
42.	 

These are, of course, extremely important observations from the prosecution which, as 
Ms Morgan made clear, were based on instructions from the police and the security 
services.  During the course of the hearing before this court, she confirmed that this 
remained an accurate reflection of the stance adopted by the Crown.  

Sentence 

 

43.	  When passing sentence, Wilkie J provided a thorough and extremely detailed analysis 
 
of  the  case  which  deserves  the  very  greatest  of  respect.    He  noted  that  all  of  the 
defendants were in their mid to late twenties at the relevant time, save Chowdhury 
and  Khan.  Chowdhury,  Latif,  Khan,  Mohammed  Rahman  and  Hussain  had  no 
previous  convictions.  Shah  Rahman  had  one  previous  conviction  from  during  the 
 
indictment period, Desai had minor convictions, Shahjahan had convictions and Miah 
(his  brother)  had  a  significant  history  of  offending.  He  made  it  clear  that  he  had 
considered the personal mitigation and references for all accused but concluded that 
their  influence  was  marginal  and  had  no  effect  on  the  sentences  to  any  significant 
 
degree. 

 
44.	 

He started by observing that these young men had each become actively engaged in 
the Muslim faith and had fallen under the influence of radical or extremist clerics who
--------

R v. Khan & ors 

preached an obligation to Jihad which extended to attacking civilians in the United 
Kingdom.  They then engaged actively in proselytising radical Islamism by preaching 
and knowingly came to the attention of the security services. Some of the defendants 
from  London,  Cardiff  and  Stoke  became  known  to  each  other.  There  came  a  time 
when they began to associate with each other and as far as eight of the defendants 
were concerned, their intent went beyond proselytising and they began to engage in 
preparation for terrorist violence. 

As to their respective role, he accepted that the linchpin of the different geographical 
groups  was  Chowdhury  who  was  a  self  publicist  but  was  not  the  leader  as  such. 
Rather, of the three groups, his assessment was that the Stoke group was considered to 
be pre-eminent: they had longer term views to raise funds and to establish a military 
training  establishment  overseas.  They  dismissed  immediate  action  in  the  UK  as 
 
untrained individuals and intended that Khan and Hussain should attend the training 
 
establishment  once  set  up  and  operate  initially  in  Kashmir.    He  concluded  that 
Shahjahan  was  the  leader  of  the  Stoke  defendants  with  Khan  and  Hussain  closely 
behind. 

He went on to decide that Miah was the pre-eminent force of the London and Cardiff 
groups; the Stoke group took him seriously as a potential recruit. Desai was also well 
regarded  by  the  Stoke  group  although  subordinate  to  Miah.  Shah  Rahman  was  not 
well regarded. Latif was well regarded but never participated in preparation for any 
specific action. 

 

Turning  to  the  facts,  the  events  relied  upon  by  the  Crown  included  meetings  of 
members  of  all  three  groups  in  parks  in  Cardiff  (7  November)  and  Newport  (12 
December) attended by most of the defendants. Desai and Miah visited London where 
with Chowdhury and Shah Rahman, they drove around London discussing venues for 
 
possible  terrorist  actions.  The  undisputed  allegation  was  that  the  purpose  of  these 
meetings and the subject of many monitored discussions were the possibilities, either 
in their separate geographical areas or together, of engaging in terrorist violence.  

 

The groups were clearly considering a range of possibilities including fundraising for 
the  establishment  of  a  military  training  madrassa  in  Pakistan,  where  they  would 
undertake training themselves and recruit others to do likewise, sending letter bombs 
through  the  post,  attacking  public  houses  used  by  British  racist  groups,  attacking  a 
high  profile  target  with  an  explosive  device  and  a  Mumbai-style  attack.  The  judge 
accepted  that  the  only  ideas  which  crystallized  as  intentions  were  in  respect  of  the 
madrassa (Count 9) and the placing of a pipe bomb, in a toilet in the London Stock 
Exchange (Count 10).  When, on 19 December, Chowdhury and Shah Rahman were 
overheard discussing instructions from the Inspire 1 magazine on how to construct a 
pipe-bomb  which  had  been  downloaded  on  to  Shah  Rahman’s  computer,  the 
authorities decided to act and the defendants were all arrested. 

Turning to the issue of dangerousness, none of the defendants had resiled from the 
 
views expressed in their defence case statements although Chowdhury, Shah Rahman, 
Khan, Shahjahan and Hussain had written letters of repentance and Desai had shown 
an  interest  in  attending  a  de-radicalisation  programme  while  in  custody.  The  judge 
 
also  had  regard  to  their  guilty  pleas  and  the  bases  of  plea  and  all  of  the  other 
circumstances; he was, however satisfied that each defendant who had pleaded guilty

to  a  s.  5  offence  presented  a  significant  risk  of  causing  serious  harm  and  were 
dangerous within the provisions of the 2003 Act. 

As  for  the  consequences  of  such  a  finding,  following  C  [2009]  1  WLR  2158  CA, 
Wikie J recognised that an indeterminate sentence should only be imposed should the 
public be insufficiently protected by other sentences available. He also had regard of 
the reporting requirements that were to be imposed, citing Jalil and others [2009] 2 
Cr App R (S) 40 and Karim [2011] EWCA Crim 2577 where extended sentences had 
been endorsed as appropriate. 

The judge went on to consider the risk that each defendant posed and the extent to 
which the public required protection.  In respect of the Shahjahan, Khan and Hussain, 
he  concluded  that  the  public  could  only  be  protected  by  the  imposition  of  an 
indeterminate  sentence.  Their  commitment  to  long  term  terrorist  aims  had  been 
 
different from the others. They had serious long term plans whereby they intended to 
 
send  Khan,  Hussain  and  other  British  recruits  for  training  and  terrorist  experience. 
Should they return to the UK they would do so trained and experienced in terrorism. 
They engaged with the others who were contemplating short term attacks in the UK 
 
but rightly considered themselves to be more serious jihadis than the others. He had 
also taken into consideration the relative youth of Khan.  In respect of the others, none 
had shown any long term or strategic perspective and their risk could be controlled by 
multi  agency  involvement  from  the  onerous  reporting  requirements  coupled  with 
 
stringent licence conditions. He accepted that they had been determined upon a high 
profile  and  violent  terrorist  action  but  outlined  the  weakness  perceived  in  each  of 
these defendants. He did not find that Mohibur Rahman was dangerous. 

 

52.	  Wilkie J recognized that the trial would have been complex and lengthy and that by 
pleading  guilty  the  defendants  had  exposed  themselves  to  substantial  sentences  of 
imprisonment: he decided that the appropriate discount for pleas entered at the outset 
of  trial  in  this  case  was  20%.  As  regards  length  of  sentence,  he  accepted  that 
sentencing  in  s.  5  cases  was  fact  specific  and  there  was  limited  case  guidance:  he 
 
noted  Jalil  [2008]  EWCA  Crim  2910,  [2009]  2  Cr  App  R  (S)  40,  Tabbakh  [2009] 
EWCA  Crim  464  and  the  first  instance  sentencing  remarks  of  Calvert  Smith  J  in 
Karim, 18 March 2011. 

He  found  that  Counts  9  and  10  were  of  equal  seriousness;  Count  9  involved 
attendance at operational meetings of the group. The defendants were involved in the 
larger group and the discussions had included plans for immediate terrorist action in 
the UK; it would be artificial to separate the madrassa from the gravamen of the s. 5 
 
charge.  The length of sentence should reflect the position of the offender across the 
 
groups. 

Turning to the position each defendant, in relation to Count 9, it was clear from the 
 
conversations in the group that Shahjahan was the leader not only of the Stoke group 
but of the larger group and others deferred to him as Emir. The Stoke group saw itself 
as  pre  eminent.  Shahjahan  considered  Khan  and  Hussain  as  almost  on  a  par  with 
himself.  The starting point as leader of the Stoke group which was the lead group (in 
accordance with the range of sentences above) was 22 years after trial. His previous 
 
convictions showed a disposition to commit serious crime and were relevant but not 
an aggravating feature. Applying a 20% discount for his guilty plea the starting point 
 
for the determinate part of the sentence would be 17 years and 8 months.   

 
53.

R v. Khan & ors 

Khan  and  Hussain  were  to  attend  the  madrassa  and  were  keen  to  perform  acts  of 
terrorism  in  Kashmir.  It  was  envisaged  that  when  they,  and  others  recruited,  had 
gained experience they may return to the UK. The long monitored conversations of 
Khan  show  his  serious  long  term  attitude  to  establishing,  funding  and  recruiting 
British Muslims to attend the madrassa and to then be available to commit terrorism 
abroad  and  at  home.  Added  to  this  was  the  dimension  of  their  involvement  in 
discussions in the larger group. 

Khan was marginally more central to the project and marginally below Shahjahan in 
the hierarchy. There was a small reduction to reflect his youth. The starting point for 
conviction after trial would be 20 years from which he deducted 4 years for his guilty 
plea. The determinate sentence would be 16 years. For Hussain the starting point was 
20 years after trial. Applying his discount for plea, the notional determinate sentence 
 
was 16 years. 

 

It is also appropriate to outline the judge’s reasons for the sentences passed on those 
who pleaded guilty to Count 10, notwithstanding that there is no challenge to them 
but because of the submissions to this court that the Count 9 defendants were unfairly 
treated by way of comparison.   In their cases, the judge reiterated that the intention 
was  to  plant  a  pipe  bomb  in  the  toilets  of  the  Stock  Exchange  in  the  near  future; 
preparation had commenced albeit that the intention was not to cause death or serious 
 
injury.  The  offenders  had  no  training.  Their  involvement  in  violent  terrorism  was 
seemingly  limited  to  a  few  weeks,  operating  without  direct  contact  or  logistical 
support from Al Qaeda. Their information was provided on line by Al Qaeda which 
was  designed  for  use  by  untrained  people.  A  pipe  bomb  required  no  specialist 
knowledge to construct, and could be made within hours from easily obtainable items 
 
which would draw no attention on procurement. The plan lacked the usual features of 
 
a serious terrorist plot but was part of a new tactical approach.  

He  recognized  that  the  accused  had  not  devised  a  means  of  entry  to  their  intended 
 
target and were novices; however, they were determined to embark on violent terrorist 
action and had considered a number of alternatives to do so. They had selected a high 
profile target to maximize the terrorist effect and economic impact; and were reckless 
as  to  death  or  serious  injury  resulting.  The  offence  was  not  as  serious  as  Jalil  and 
Karim but was of a different order to Tabbakh. 

In the case of each of these defendants, a determinate term would be passed (in each 
case the starting point being reduced by 20% for the guilty plea) but each sentence 
would be subject to an extension of 5 years to reflect the finding of dangerousness. 
Miah was the leader of the Cardiff group and on a par with Chowdhury. He set the 
agenda  and  applied  an  analytical  mind  to  the  projects  being  discussed.  He  had 
impressed the Stoke group and had mastered the elements of making a pipe bomb. His 
 
convictions were a significant aggravating element. The starting point was 21 years 
imprisonment.  Chowdhury  was  the  linchpin  of  the  groups  and  had  arranged  the 
 
meetings. He allowed a small discount in respect of his youth. The starting point was 
 
17  years.  Shah  Rahman  was  a  follower  and  less  prominently  involved  than 
 
Chowdhury. His starting point was 15 years.   Desai was not a leader of the Cardiff 
group.  His  convictions  were  not  an  aggravating  feature.  His  contribution  was  no 
greater than Shah Rahman and the starting point was 15 years.

Turning to Court 12, Wilkie J reiterated that Latif was present at the two meetings and 
aware that terrorist activity was likely to take place: it was important to underline that 
he  had  neither  participated  nor  taken  part  in  the  development  of  the  plans  but  his 
 
presence  encouraged  the  others  to  prepare  and  commit  the  acts  particularised.  His 
 
culpability was not as great as the others but he was trusted by the exclusive group 
and shared their intentions. Tabbakh was the only relevant authority. The gravamen of 
the offence was the membership and operation of the group. In his case also, the judge 
concluded that he was dangerous within the terms of the Criminal Justice Act 2003: 
the  starting  point  in  his  case  was  13  years  imprisonment  discounted  for  plea  and 
extended by 5 years. 

Finally, in relation to Count 11, the judge identified the particulars of the offence and 
the basis of Mohibur Rahman’s guilty plea. He accepted that Rahman’s possession of 
 
the  relevant  material  should  be  seen  in  light  of  his  attendance  at  the  November 
 
meeting, the reference to him by others at the 12 December meeting and discussions 
 
with Khan and Shahjahan about a bomb in a public house on 14 December; which 
made his possession of it more serious. In context of the activities of the group his 
 
offending was of significant seriousness.  Wilkie J rejected the argument that Rahman 
had pleaded guilty to a new offence and should have a greater discount for his plea: 
Count 11 was re-cast from the allegation already on the indictment contained within 
 
Count 8.  The starting point was a determinate term of 6½ years with a 20% discount 
 
for his plea. 

 

The Indeterminate Term 

 
62.	 

The primary ground of appeal pursued by Khan, Shahjahan and Hussain is that the 
 
judge wrongly characterised the conduct of the Stoke defendants as having a level of 
sophistication such that they were more dangerous than the London defendants and, 
thus, albeit said to be “equally serious” (to quote the prosecution) criminality, justified 
an  indeterminate  sentence  (whether  of  imprisonment  for  public  protection  or,  in 
Khan’s case, detention for public protection). 

 

63.	  Mr  Bennathan  put  the  matter  on  behalf  of  Khan  in  this  way.    At  the  time  of  the 
offence, he was a 19 year old, whose ambition was to bring Sharia law to Pakistan 
 
controlled Kashmir, his ancestral home.  The madrassa had not been built (and there 
was  no  evidence  that  there  was  any  real  funding  to  build  it);  he  had  no  access  to 
terrorist  training  and  it  was  highly  unrealistic  to  suppose  that  the  authorities  in 
Pakistan would allow a teenager from Stoke to impose Sharia law or run a training 
 
school for terrorists. 

Conversation  about  bombing  public  houses  in  Stoke  (in  any  event,  not  included 
within the allegation in the indictment) was no more than angry talk within some 4 
 
minutes of young men responding to racist incidents in Stoke, all of which was over 
 
in  a  day  and  it  would  be  speculative  to  use  snatches  of  recorded  conversation  as 
 
showing a high level of sophistication: it was equally consistent with admiration for 
the superior motivation and determination of the London defendants who, at one stage 
(as  described  by  Mr  Edis)  were  “being  held in  a  degree  of  reverence  by  the  Stoke 
defendants”.  Although Khan and other were intent on going to Pakistan the following 
month, there was no basis for concluding that they were in a position to put any plan 
(let alone terrorist training) into place.   Overheard assertions were no more than this 
 
young man ‘bigging up’ what they intended to do in the hope of recruiting assistance.

R v. Khan & ors 

 

65.	  Mr  Hall  pursued  the  same  point  on  behalf  of  Shahjahan.    He  submitted  that  an 
immediate  plan,  actively  pursued,  to  destroy  the  London  Stock  Exchange  by  the 
deployment of an explosive device (with access to a recipe for the creation of such a 
device known to work and a tested timer), carrying with it a very high risk of death 
and  personal  injury  (even  if  not  intended)  was  clearly  more  serious  than  the  Stoke 
 
plan.  The madrassa was, at best, in the very early stages of construction with very 
little, if any, cash having been raised and no decision as to where any graduate might 
fight jihad in the future.  It was argued: 

 

“No timetable, target or method for these acts of terrorism had 
been agreed.  Their experiences after going to Kashmir might 
have meant that no such activity, in any event, would actually 
 
have taken place in the UK.” 

 
66.	 

As  for  sophistication,  Mr  Hall  argued  that  financial  enquiries  pursued  by  the 
 
prosecution confirmed that there was no source of income to pursue the plan and the 
only prospect of raising money came from Abu Hassan who had agreed to teach them 
how to undertake money-making scams.  Furthermore, each of the Stoke defendants 
was well known to the authorities, publicly expressing their views in a stall in Stoke 
shopping area.  An earlier visit to Pakistan had led to Shahjahan and his associates 
 
being questioned both by British and Pakistani intelligence services so the prospect of 
 
them being able to return, unnoticed and uninterrupted, to set up a camp did not bear 
scrutiny. 

 

 

67.	  Mr  Sturman,  on  behalf  of  Nazam  Hussain,  repeated  the  argument  that  no  training 
camp had been built, no men had been recruited and only minimal funding obtained; 
there was no evidence Hussain was going to Pakistan (although, that month, he was 
due to attend a wedding in Morocco) and there were no firm details as to the plan.  He 
went further and made the point that it had been contended by leading counsel who 
appeared before Wilkie J that Hussain was not dangerous.    

 
68.	 

The prosecution challenge these submissions and, in particular, the attempt to portray 
the Stoke defendants as less dangerous than the London defendants.  In its skeleton 
argument, Mr Edis submitted:  

“The  Judge  was  required  to  decide  whether  an  extended 
sentence would adequately protect the public and decided that 
it would do for those whose involvement in terrorism appeared 
to  be  of  lesser  duration  and  lesser  sophistication,  namely  the 
 
Stock Exchange Bomb plot defendants.  They had not, so far as 
the evidence reveals, devised any plan at all for actually getting 
their device into the Stock Exchange and in reality this would 
have  presented  a  major  problem  for  them,  given  the  security 
precautions in place and the probable conspicuousness of these 
defendants.  It is quite likely that the plan would have failed at 
that stage, probably to be replaced by another plan to attack a 
 
softer  target.  However,  the  naivety  of  this  sub-group  would 
have presented an obstacle to any success being achieved.  This 
contrasts with the Stoke group who were not naive at all.  They 
themselves  appreciated  (as  evidence  by  their  conversations) 
that  they  were  dealing  with  an  inexperienced  and  hot  headed
--------

R v. Khan & ors 

group who might get them all arrested despite their own well 
developed field craft.  In this they were right. 

 

69.	  Mr Sturman counters this submission by pointing out the Crown had contended that 
the  probe  evidence  showed  that  those  involved  in  the  plot  were,  at  the  very  least, 
working  their  way  through  the  recipe  in  Inspire  and  that  one  of  their  number  had 
experimented  with  the  construction  of  some  part  of  the  electrical  circuit  and  had 
achieved some success. 

Dealing first with the question of dangerousness, at the time that these appellants were 
 
sentenced,  in  our  judgment  there  is  no  doubt  that  anyone  convicted  of  this  type  of 
offence  could  legitimately  be  considered  dangerous  within  the  meaning  of  the 
legislation: that includes Hussain and Latif to whom we refer below.  Furthermore, 
given  that  it  is  difficult  to  identify  the  extent  to  which  those  who  have  been 
radicalised (perhaps as a result of immaturity or otherwise) will have modified their 
views having served a substantial term of imprisonment and there is an argument for 
concluding  that  anyone  convicted  of  such  an  offence  should  be  incentivised  to 
demonstrate that he can safely be released;  such a decision is then better left to the 
parole board for consideration proximate in time to the date when release becomes 
possible. 

On the other hand, the extent to which the evidence demonstrated that the threat of a 
terrorist  attack  had  progressed  beyond  talk  (however  apparently  determined)  is 
relevant  to  the  risk  posed  by  the  offender  and  the  need  to  protect  the  public.    The 
judge certainly concluded that the London planning had not progressed so far as to 
demonstrate  such  a  risk  that  imprisonment  for  public  protection  was  necessary  and 
although we recognise that training terrorists in the use of firearms could only lead to 
potential  loss  of  life,  whereas  the  intention  of  the  London  defendants  did  not 
 
encompass death or serious injury (while recognising the serious risk that such would 
result),  on  any  showing,  the  fulfilment  of  that  goal  was  further  removed  and  there 
were other obstacles (not least as a consequence of the fact that their activities had 
come to the attention of the security services in Pakistan).  Furthermore, there is no 
 
suggestion that any of the Stoke defendants had, in fact, been trained, let alone that 
 
they would be in a position to activate, operate or participate within a training facility 
 
not then built, however keen they might have been to do so and however much they 
might  have  talked  up  their  prospects  between  themselves  or  to  others  whom  they 
 
sought to influence. 

Notwithstanding  the  considerable  respect  that  the  conclusion  reached  by  Wilkie  J 
merits, we have come to the conclusion that if, as he concluded, the plans of the two 
groups were “equally serious”, the risk posed to the public could not be greater from 
 
those who were very much further away from realising their apparent goal than those 
who were far closer to doing so. 

Although potentially highly relevant both to culpability and potential harm (and, thus, 
of  importance  for  the  purpose  of  fixing  the  punitive  part  of  any  sentence),  in  our 
judgment, when assessing the future risk to the public, too much weight should not be 
placed on conversations for the purpose of ascribing comparative sophistication: it is 
not  implausible  that  some  self-publicists  will  talk  ‘big’  and  other,  more  serious 
plotters,  may  be  more  careful  and  keep  their  own  counsel.    Suffice  to  say,  on  the 
question  of  comparative  risk,  we  do  not  consider  that  a  distinction  can  safely  be

drawn between the London and Stoke defendants.  In those circumstances, we quash 
the sentences of imprisonment and detention for public protection and will impose, in 
their place, determinate terms, in each case with an extension of five years.  To that 
 
extent, we place the Stoke defendants in the same position as the London defendants.  

The Determinate Term 

 
74.	 

 
75.	 

It  is  not  the  purpose  of  this  judgment  to  seek  to  set  out  guidelines  or  indicative 
sentences for terrorism which comes in many different forms.  Offences range from 
 
murder,  attempted  murder  and  conspiracy  to  murder,  through  causing  explosions 
likely  to  endanger  life  or  cause  serious  injury  to  property  (s.  2  of  the  Explosive 
Substances Act 1883), conspiracy or possession with intent to cause explosions likely 
to endanger life or cause serious injury to property (s. 3 of the 1883 Act) to engaging 
in conduct in preparation for or assisting in committing acts of terrorism contrary to s. 
5 of the Terrorism Act 2006.  This last offence is particularly wide covering acts just 
short of an attempt to conduct that only just crosses the line into criminality.   

A  number  of  principles,  however,  can  properly  be  emphasised.    First,  as  with  any 
criminal  offence,  s.  143  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  directs  the  sentence  to 
consider culpability and harm: in most cases of terrorist offences, the former will be 
extremely  high.    Second,  the  purpose  of  sentence  for  the  most  serious  terrorist 
offences  is  to  punish,  deter  and  incapacitate.    Rehabilitation  will  play  little,  if  any 
part: see Martin [1999] 1 Cr App R (S) 477.  Third, the starting point for sentence for 
an inchoate offence is the sentence that would have been imposed if the objective had 
been  achieved  with    an  attempt  to  commit  the  offence  being  more  serious  than  a 
conspiracy: see Barot [2008] 1 Cr App R(S) 31.  Fourth, sentences that can be derived 
from Martin – or, indeed, any cases before the impact or effect of Schedule 21 of the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003 identifying minimum terms for murder – are of historical 
 
interest only and do not provide any assistance as to the approach which should now 
be adopted: for the impact of Schedule 21 in uplifting determinate sentences, see AG’s 
Reference Nos 85-87 of 2007 [2008] 2 Cr App R (S) 45 and, in relation to terrorism, 
Jalil [2009] 2 Cr App R (S) 40 at paras. 22 and 24.   

 

 
76.	 

Finally, because of the enormous breadth of potential offences (and, consequently, the 
differing potential assessment of culpability and harm depending on the precise facts), 
we do not consider it appropriate to seek to provide guidelines based on these cases 
alone (or a combination of these cases and those in Jalil).  If guidelines are needed, a 
better course would be for the offences to be considered by the Sentencing Council 
for  England  and  Wales  although  we  readily  accept  that  breadth  of  s.  5  of  the 
Terrorism Act 2006 would make the task of providing guidelines extremely difficult.  

Usmar Khan, Mohammed Shahjahan and Nazam Hussain 
 

 

77.	  We take these three cases together because Wilkie J structured the sentences which he 
imposed around his assessment of the comparative responsibility of all the defendants, 
treating the Stoke defendants as guilty of “equally serious” terrorist offences as the 
London defendants.  He drew inferences from a document recovered from 4 Persia 
 
Walk  said  to  have  been  written  by  Shahjahan  which  bore  his  fingerprints  placing 
himself (“me”) at the top of the structure and was careful to seek to differentiate the 
position of each man, making allowance for age, prior character and (to a necessarily 
limited extent) personal mitigation.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v. Khan & ors 

 

78.	  We recognise that the sentences imposed on the London defendants are more readily 
 
comparable  with  other  sentencing  decisions  (whether  by  reference  to  conspiracy  to 
 
cause an explosion or otherwise): those sentences have not been the subject of appeal. 
Thus, the critical decision which the judge made, accepting the proposition advanced 
by  the  prosecution,  was  to  the  effect  that  the  position  of  the  Stoke  defendants  was 
“equally serious”.  In our judgment, bearing in mind the detailed consideration which 
he  had  given  to  the  probe  and  other  evidence,  he  was  fully  entitled  to  reach  that 
 
conclusion and its implementation in the sentencing decisions reached for these three 
men  cannot,  in  our  judgment,  be  impeached.    The  position  of  a  defendant  on  the 
indictment (to which reference was made by a number of counsel) is irrelevant. 

 
79.	 

In  the  circumstances,  we  quash  the  indeterminate  sentences  and  pass  determinate 
 
terms as follows.  In the case of Mohammed Shahjahan, the substituted sentence is an 
extended  sentence  of  22  years  8  months  of  which  the  custodial  term  is  17  years  8 
months  with  an  extension  period  of  5  years.    For  both  Usman  Khan  and  Nazam 
Hussein, the sentence is an extended sentence of 21 years of which the custodial term 
is 16 years imprisonment, in each case with an extension period of 5 years.  In all 
three  cases,  the  notification  provisions  of  the  Counter-Terrorism  Act  2008  will 
continue to apply for 30 years. 

Omar Latif 
 

 

80.	  Mr Wood Q.C., on behalf of Latif, challenged the sentence root and branch.  First, he 
 
 
argued  that  the  finding  of  dangerousness  was  not  justified:  given  the  nature  of  the 
offence  to  which  he  pleaded  guilty  and  the  reasons  set  out  above,  we  reject  that 
submission.    His  second  proposition  was  that,  even  if  dangerous,  an  extended 
sentence was not appropriate or necessary in his case, particularly bearing in mind the 
 
onerous  reporting  conditions  imposed  as  a  matter  of  law  by  the  Counter  Terrorism 
Act.  Third, he submitted both that the starting point of 13 years imprisonment was 
too long and that insufficient credit had been given for his guilty plea on the basis that 
he  was  only  offered  the  opportunity  to  plead  guilty  to  this  very  much  reduced 
formulation of a s. 5 offence during the discussions after the jury had been sworn. 

In support of the second and third submissions, Mr Wood underlined the terms of the 
 
count to which Latif pleaded guilty: he admitted attending two meetings but, unlike 
his co-defendants in the London Welsh group, had not embarked on any activity.  The 
 
conversation  about  a  Mumbai-style  attack  was  never  seriously  considered.    On  the 
 
other hand, his admission involved an admission that his attendance was preparatory 
to an act of terrorism and with the intention of assisting others to commit such an act 
of terrorism.  The seriousness of that intention can be inferred from the facts that he 
 
was  part  of  the  group  that  provided  money  to  the  Stoke  defendants,  he  was  the 
recipient of one of three SIM cards bought by Miah and, finally, he had a quantity of 
ideological material in his possession. 

In relation to the credit to which he was entitled following his guilty plea, Mr Wood 
 
explained  that  he  had  fallen  out  with  his  legal  team  and,  for  some  months  until 
November 2011.  Having said that, only when asked by Mitting J, Mr Wood admitted 
that the defence case statement had constituted a robust denial.  As was made clear in 
 
Caley  [2012]  EWCA  Crim  2821  at  para.  14,  there  is  no  reason  why  he  should  not 
have been prepared to admit, at a far earlier stage, what he was doing and why.

Latif is not affected by the decisions in relation to the Stoke defendants; his case was 
considered with the London and Welsh defendants.  References to decisions in other 
cases only go so far: there is no reason, in this case, for interfering with the sentencing 
decision which Wilkie J reached and more than adequately explained: the sentence is 
neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive and his appeal is dismissed. 

 

84.	  Mr Wood raised a further point in writing about a mobile phone said to have been 
 
found at the Latif family home; it was not in his bedroom and belonged to his brother. 
 
That  was  not  pursued  before  the  court.  What  he  did  seek  to  challenge  was  the 
 
forfeiture of a computer on which a thumbnail of the Inspire magazines appeared.  No 
 
challenge  was  made  to  an  order  for  its  forfeiture  at  the  hearing  but  Mr  Wood 
produced a receipt to demonstrate that the computer had been purchased by Latif’s 
father.  That fact does not, of course, demonstrate that the computer did not belong to 
Latif.  This court has not been given any material on which to decide this issue and 
we decline to interfere with the judge’s order simply on the basis of the receipt. 

 

Mohibur Rahman 
 

 

85.	  Mr  O’Neill  Q.C  argued  that  Mohibur  Rahman  had  pleaded  guilty  only  to  the 
possession of two editions of the Inspire magazine; his offending was at a different 
level  to  that  of  his  co-defendants.  He  was  not  one  of  the  Stoke  team  who  was 
 
destined to go to Pakistan, and, on the basis that he spent his time preaching on the 
streets  of  Stoke,  he  fell  into  the  ‘all  talk’  category.    Mr  O’Neill  explained  that 
Mohibur  Rahman  was  now  detained  in  a  standard  level  prison  undertaking  de­
radicalisation and that his continued incarceration served no purpose.  He invited the 
 
court  to  reduce  the  sentence  by  6  months  which  would  effectively  permit  his 
 
immediate release.   

 
86.	 

 
87.	 

It  is  important  to  underline  that  s.  57  of  the  Terrorism  Act  2006  criminalises 
possession of articles in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that 
their  possession  was  for  a  purpose  connected  with  the  commission,  preparation  or 
 
instigation  of  an  act  of  terrorism.    That  has  been  construed  as  if  it  read  “A  person 
commits an offence if he possesses an article in circumstances which give rise to a 
reasonable suspicion that he intends it to be used for the purpose of the commission, 
 
preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism”, see R v. Zafar and others [2008] QB 
2010, emphasis added.  

Against that background, the degree of suspicion obviously falls to be tested and the 
prosecution rely on the fact one of the magazines contains a bomb making recipe with 
further  hints  about  how  UK  resident  Muslims  should  kill  people  in  the  UK. 
 
Combined with his presence at the 7 November meeting which was characterised by 
extensive  anti-surveillance  measures  and  involved  a  long  journey  (so  that  he  was 
 
plainly  a  trusted  member  of  the  group),  the  reference  to  him  by  others  at  the  12 
December  meeting  and  discussions  with  Khan  and  Shahjahan  about  a  bomb  in  a 
public house on 14 December: all this leads to the conclusion that there is more than a 
reasonable suspicion that he intends it to be used to commit, prepare for or instigate 
terrorism.  That was the conclusion reached by the judge. 

 

88.	  Mr O’Neill Q.C relies on the sentences passed in Zafar (above) and AG’s Reference 
 
No 7 of 2008 [2008] EWCA Crim 1054, the former being sentences of between 2 and 
3  years  passed  on  four  university  students  and  a  schoolboy  and  took  the  form  of
--------

R v. Khan & ors 

ideological propaganda; the suspicion was evidenced by communications which the 
prosecution alleged showed a settled plan to receive training in Pakistan and travel to 
 
Afghanistan.  At the time, the maximum for the offence was 10 years (now 15 years). 
 
 
In  the  latter  case,  the  offender  was  arrested  at  Heathrow  with  material  providing  a 
theological  justification  for  terrorism  along  with  military  and  intelligence  guides 
downloaded from the internet, and, among other things, two battons, sleeping bags, 
 
night vision binoculars and £9,000.  For a section 5 offence, with a 25% discount for 
his  plea,  he  was  sentenced  to  4½  years  imprisonment  with  a  concurrent  term  of  3 
years for possessing an article for terrorist purposes.  The sentences were said to be 
 
lenient but not unduly so. 

 

These  are  different  offences  not  least  because  the  items  possessed  were  not, 
intrinsically,  linked  to  terrorism  at  the  same  level  as  the  magazines  although  the 
 
supporting material justifying the suspicion was equally as strong.  On the other hand, 
it is critically important only to sentence for the admitted offence and not because of 
adverse  inferences  of  wider  criminality  drawn  from  the  surrounding  circumstances. 
 
In that regard, Wilkie J did not fall into that trap: he could not have made the position 
clearer.  Furthermore,  there  is  absolutely  nothing  in  the  complaint  that  a  larger 
 
discount  should  have  been  given  because  the  offence  was  not  initially  on  the 
indictment:  as  the  judge  observed,  it  was  part  of  a  different  count  and  there  was 
nothing to prevent the appellant admitting that aspect of that offence at a very much 
earlier stage. 
 

 

Having reduced the sentence on the other Stoke defendants by removing the sentence 
of imprisonment for public protection, however, we have come to the conclusion that 
it is right to make a marginal adjustment to this sentence.  In the circumstances, we do 
accede  to  Mr  O’Neill’s  submission  that  the  sentence  be  reduced  to  4½  years, 
 
recognising that this will reduce the notification period from 15 years to 10 years.  To 
 
that extent, his appeal is also allowed.

STEPHEN SEDDON
 

 

 
MANCHESTER CROWN COURT
 

 

28 MARCH 2013 


 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE HAMBLEN
 

 

 

 

 

 
Stephen Seddon – 
 
You have been convicted of heinous crimes: first attempting to murder your parents 
 
and then, less than 4 months later, actually murdering them – a continuum of crime 
culminating in the cold blooded killing of a quiet, unassuming, elderly couple in their 
own home on 4 July 2012. 
 
The 4 July was an ordinary summer’s day in Clough Avenue, Sale.  Robert and 
 
Patricia Seddon had just had a lunch of fish and chips.  They were shortly to have 
their afternoon nap.  In a few brutal minutes they were dead – murdered at the hands 
 
of their own son. 
 
The earlier attempt to murder them was made on 20 March 2012 when you drove a 
hired BMW car into the Bridgwater Canal with your parents installed in the back 
seats of the locked car.  The jury have found that that was done deliberately and with 
 
intent to kill them. 
 
The attempt had been carefully planned.  You had hired a car rather than using your 
own.  You had taken the trouble of insuring the excess on the hire car.  You took the 
precaution of taking a crook lock with you so that you could make good your own 
escape.  You had a knife with you in case of need. 
 
On the pretence of taking your mother for a belated Mother’s Day evening meal you 
drove down a route you would not normally take.  It ran alongside the Bridgwater 
canal and was largely without barriers. You drove at speed and, at a point where the 
embankment was clear of trees and shrubbery, you deliberately drove the car into the 
dark canal. 
 
Using the crook lock you got yourself out of the car.  The plan had no doubt been to 
 
make unsuccessful efforts to save your parents.  However, a number of people were 
now at the bank side and your actions or inactions were in full view.  You decided you 
had no alternative but to be seen to try to save your passengers.  First you helped get 
your nephew Daniel, who suffers from severe learning difficulties, out of the car.  You 
sat on top of the car trying to punch out a window with your heels.  This had the
--------
predictable effect of making the car more unstable in the water.  Despite cries for you 
to get off the car you failed to do so, at least initially. 
 
By now the emergency services were at the scene.  Both the police and the fire 
services arrived with commendable speed.  You had no choice but to be seen to try to 
assist and you did help your father out of the car.  There was, however, nothing you 
could do for your panic stricken mother.  She was stuck in the back seat seemingly 
resigned to her fate until fire officers heroically rescued her.  By the time they did so 
the car was completely submerged and she was unconscious.  She was resuscitated at 
the canal side and you were all taken to hospital.  At the canal bank and at the 
hospital you manufactured a tale that you may have had a heart attack or a black out. 
Neither was true and nothing was found to be wrong with you physiologically.  Your 
attempt to take your parents’ lives had failed but in the meantime you were happy to 
take the public accolades of having bravely tried to save them. 
 
 
Your parents not only had to endure a terrifying, life threatening experience but they 
also suffered consequent sleeplessness, nightmares, depression and stress.  As time 
went on your father began to suspect that his own son had in fact tried to kill him that 
March night and he confided these suspicions to his GP the day before his murder. 
 
 
The reason for the attempted murders and the murders was greed.  You needed 
money.  You had lost your job.  You had a mortgage.  You had a family to support.  
 
You had some grand plans.  Despite the fact that your parents had always been very 
generous in supporting you, you wanted more and you wanted it now – hence the 
 
plan to kill them and get your inheritance up front. 
 
The attempt at murder having failed, you decided on a more ruthless and definitive 
 
method of killing.  You obtained a sawn off shotgun from criminal associates.  You 
 
made arrangements for your family to be away from Seaham and for you to have an 
excuse to be seemingly stuck there all day.  That excuse was provided by an electrical 
power outage planned for your area on 4 July. 
 
That day you drove to Seaham from the Fleetwood Caravan Park where you and your 
family had been staying.  You left the car in your garage knowing it would be stuck 
there when the electricity went off.  You made arrangements to borrow your brother 
in law’s car.  With your car marooned in the garage and you seemingly stuck in 
Seaham all day you took the precaution of making that known to others and also of 
 
leaving your mobile with someone who would be there during the day.  In addition 
you made sure you were seen around Seaham on CCTV during the course of the day. 
 
In fact for the middle part of that fateful day you drove across to the North West.  
There you went to your parents’ house in Sale where you shot them in cold blood and 
 
at point blank range with the sawn off shot gun.  They died instantly. 
 
Your father was shot from a range of 1 ½ metres as he sat on the sofa in the living 
 
room.  Your mother was shot as she was lying on the floor in the hallway.  The gun 
was held to her left temple and much of her face was blown away.  You then tried to 
 
make it look as if your father had killed your mother and then himself.   The gun was 
left placed across your father’s lap in a staged murder/suicide. 
 
You were in and out on your murderous business in little more than 15 minutes.  You 
then drove back to Seaham where you maintained your story of having been stuck 
 
there all day until meticulous work by the police began to unravel it.  Then and only 
then did you admit to having travelled to the North West and eventually came up
--------
with a story of having been in the Manchester area that day on a drugs run, a tale 
which the jury have disbelieved and rejected. 
 
In Greek mythology someone who killed a parent would be pursued until death by the 
Furies. 
 
 
Throughout time it has been recognised as a terrible and unnatural crime. 
 
You have killed not one parent but both of them.   
 
You have done so for gain. 
 
 
You have done so having first tried unsuccessfully to kill them by other means. 
 
You have done so by the barbaric act of shooting them at point blank range with a 
sawn off shot gun. 
 
In effect you executed your own parents.  One can only imagine the horror of your 
 
parents’ last moments in this life when they realised what a monster their own son, 
who they loved, had become.  Mercifully, their deaths were swift. 
 
I have considered the Victim Personal Statements submitted by members of Robert 
 
and Patricia Seddon’s family which speak of their loss, the impact on Daniel’s life and 
movingly describe Robert and Patricia’s lives and character.  They were devoted 
parents and grandparents. 
 
In terms of antecedents you have a number of convictions, mainly for offences of 
 
dishonesty, a number of which were committed when you were a juvenile or a young 
man.  The last significant conviction was for a major business fraud in 2000.  You 
have no convictions for violence against a person. 
 
For the crime of murder there is a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. 
However, I need to determine whether this is a case in which there should be a Whole 
Life Order, in other words a sentence which means that you will never leave prison, 
or a sentence of a minimum term in prison, in other words a sentence which means 
that there will be a minimum term which you will serve in prison before the 
possibility of parole and, if so, the length of that minimum term. 
 
Whole Life Orders are reserved for offences of exceptionally high seriousness.  Cases 
which would normally be so categorised are set out in para. 4(1) of Sched 21 to the 
CJA 2003. 
 
 
The prosecution submit that this is such a case because it involves the murder of two 
 
persons and a substantial degree of premeditation and planning.  I accept that it has 
these features.  However, the statutory provisions are not to be applied inflexibly and 
 
all the circumstances of the case need to be taken into account in order to decide 
whether a Whole Life Order is required. 
 
It is submitted on your behalf that a minimum term order would meet the justice of 
the case. 
 
The appropriate minimum term would have as its starting point that reserved for 
 
cases of particularly high seriousness, namely 30 years.
--------
That is because this is a case which has three of the features set out in para. 4(2) of
 
 
Sched 21, any one of which would normally mean that this would be categorised as a 

case of particularly high seriousness, namely: 

Murder involving use of a firearm; 

Murder for gain; 

And Murder of two people. 

 
In addition some of the statutory aggravating features are present, namely: 

 
A significant degree of planning or premeditation;
 
An element of abuse of trust;  

And an element of victim vulnerability due to their age and health. 

 
 
I accept the Defence submission that the attempt to conceal the murder by staging a
 
Murder/Suicide does not amount to concealment of the body within sub-para (g). 

 
Further this case involves not just the murder of two people but also their attempted 

murder.  If those attempts had been successful it would have been a case that came 

 
within Sched 21 paras 4 and 5 and in itself merits a determinate sentence of 20 years.
 
 
In terms of statutory mitigating factors the only one which is applicable is age.  You 

are now aged 46.  A minimum term of 30 years or more would mean that you would 

be in prison until you are at least 76.  The effect of the minimum term could therefore 

well be to sentence you to die in prison. 

 
Courts may in appropriate cases take age into account so that there is at least the 

 
possibility of light at the end of the tunnel.  On the other hand age cannot be
 
determinative.  There is not one Starting Point for young murderers and another one 

 
for old murderers.  Age is just one factor to be borne in mind as part of the sentencing
 
process; but it is not determinative of the finishing point. 

 
In mitigation, aside from your age, the main point urged is the lack of recent serious 

convictions and the absence of any convictions for violence against the person. 

 
I am satisfied that this is a case which involves offending of such seriousness that a 

 
Whole Life Order would be justifiable.  However, I recognise that such an order is 

 
very rarely made and that it remains a sentence of last resort.
 
 
On balance, having regard in particular to your antecedent history and all that is 

known about you, I have concluded that a minimum term sentence will provide 

sufficient just punishment and retribution if a long minimum term is imposed.  There 

will therefore be light at the end of the tunnel, but it will be a very faint light. 

 
This case has no less than three of the features which call for a starting point of 30 
years as well as statutory aggravating features and the need to take into account the 
attempted murders.  In all the circumstances, having full regard to your age and the 
mitigation urged on your behalf, I have concluded that the appropriate minimum 
term is one of 40 years. 
 
  
That means that it will be 40 years before the Parole Board can consider your release. 
 
If you are still alive then and the Parole Board decide that release is appropriate you 
 
will remain on license for the rest of your life and may be recalled to prison at any 
time. 
 
 
The sentence of the court on the murders is accordingly life imprisonment with a 
minimum term of 40 years, less such time as has been spent on remand.
--------
The sentence on the attempted murders is a concurrent determinate sentence of 20 
 
years.",2013-03-28 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) 

 

26 March 2013 

 

SUMMARY TO ASSIST THE MEDIA 

  
 
The Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Irwin) has today given 
judgment in three separate appeals that raised a number of different questions about victim 
personal statements, and in cases of homicide, family impact statements.  
 
The Court discusses Victim Personal Statement/Family Impact statements in paragraphs 2 – 15. 
 
Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court said: 
 
“Victim Personal Statements that is, statements by the victims of a crime or crimes, or in cases 
involving death, Family Impact Statements, by surviving members of the family of the deceased, 
were formally introduced into the criminal justice system of England and Wales in 2001.  In this 
judgment they will be referred to as the statement or statements.  They were included in the 
Practice Direction (Criminal Proceedings: Consolidation) [2002] 1 WLR 2872 and they are now found 
in Part III 28 of the Current Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction [2009] 1 WLR 1396.  Their 
purpose is to allow victims a more structured opportunity to explain how they have been affected by 
the crime or crimes of which they were victims. They provide a practical way of ensuring that the 
sentencing court will, consider, in accordance with s.143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, “any harm 
which the offence caused”, reflecting on the evidence of the victim about the specific and personal 
impact of the offence or offences, or in the cases of homicide, on the family of the deceased.  The 
statements may, albeit incidentally to the purposes of the sentencing court, identify a need for 
additional or specific support or protection for the victims of crime, to be considered at the end of 
the sentencing process.  At the same time, the process does not create or constitute an opportunity 
for the victim of crime to suggest or discuss the type or level of sentence to be imposed.  The 
distinction is important, and is sometimes misunderstood.” (para 2) 
 
“Properly formulated statements provide real assistance for the sentencer.  An example of how 
seriously they are taken by the court is that they are one of the few documents which are always 
specially flagged in the papers prepared for the judges of this court, considering an appeal against 
sentence or an application by the Attorney General to refer an unduly lenient sentence to the court.” 
(para 10) 
 
“In the context of appeals, just as the sentencing decision cannot be influenced by the views of the 
victim about the level and range of sentence, perhaps we should note that the views of the victim 
cannot provide a basis for this court to conclude that the appeal is or is not well founded.  … 
 

 
 

1
--------
“The guidance given by this court to the victims of crime and their families in the context of appeals 
states that it “would be extremely rare for someone who has been the victim of an offence (or their 
family) to be asked to speak or give evidence to the court”.  That is an inevitable consequence of the 
jurisdiction exercised in this court, which in the context of appeals against sentence, does not 
constitute a re‐hearing.  There may, indeed, be practical difficulties, not least that the prosecution is 
often not represented on an appeal against sentence, and an appellant may waive his rights to 
attend.  Nevertheless there will, as the guidance implies, be a small handful of cases where the court 
decides that it should allow a victim to read or give evidence along the lines of a properly drafted and 
served witness statement, as in Bennett, following a very serious crime.” (para 13 – 14) 
 
The Court then considered the three individual appeals. 
 
 
Robert Perkins 

The circumstances of Mr Perkin's case are set out in paragraphs 1, 16 ‐ 35. The Court dismissed 
his appeal against sentence, save in relation to the Sexual Offences Prevention Order.  

Billy Bennett 

The circumstances of Mr Bennett's case are set out in paragraphs 1, 36 – 53. The Court heard 
the oral evidence of the victim during the appeal. The Court dismissed his appeal against 
sentence.  

Ronnie Hall 

The circumstances of Mr Hall’s case are set out in paragraphs 1, 54 – 67. The Court dismissed his 
appeal against conviction.

LORD JUDGE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND AND WALES: 
 

 
1.	 

These cases, which were heard together, raised a number of different questions about 
victim personal statements and, in cases of homicide, family impact statements, both 
now well-established parts of criminal process.   They are: 

 

 
a)	 

 
b)

Victim Personal Statements/Family Impact Statements 

Victim Personal Statements that is, statements by the victims of a crime or crimes, or 
 
in  cases  involving  death,  Family  Impact  Statements,  by  surviving  members  of  the 
 
family of the deceased, were formally introduced into the criminal justice system of 
England and Wales in 2001.  In this judgment they will be referred to as the statement 
or statements.  They were included in the Practice Direction (Criminal Proceedings: 
Consolidation)  [2002]  1  WLR  2872  and  they  are  now  found  in  Part  III  28  of  the 
Current Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction [2009] 1 WLR 1396.  Their purpose 
 
is  to  allow  victims  a  more  structured  opportunity  to  explain  how  they  have  been 
affected by the crime or crimes of which they were victims. They provide a practical 
way of ensuring that the sentencing court will, consider, in accordance with s.143 of 
the Criminal Justice Act 2003, “any harm which the offence caused”,  reflecting on 
the evidence of the victim about the specific and personal impact of the offence or 
offences, or in the cases of homicide, on the family of the deceased.  The statements 
may, albeit incidentally to the purposes of the sentencing court, identify a need for 
additional or specific support or protection for the victims of crime, to be considered 
at the end of the sentencing process.  At the same time, the process does not create or 
constitute an opportunity for the victim of crime to suggest or discuss the type or level 
 
of  sentence  to  be  imposed.    The  distinction  is  important,  and  is  sometimes 
misunderstood.  It is, however, well exemplified in Nunn [1996] 2 Cr. App. R(S) 136. 

 

This  was  a  sensitive  case  in  which  the  defendant  had  caused  the  death  of  a  close 
friend  after  driving  dangerously,  having  consumed  alcohol.    After  sentence  in  the

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

Crown Court, this court was supplied with statements from the mother and one of the 
sisters of the deceased who were seeking, indeed urging, clemency on the court, not 
merely because the sentence passed on Nunn was having a detrimental effect on him, 
but because it was adversely affecting their ability to come to terms with the loss and 
grief  which  they  had  suffered.  As  the  mother  made  clear  in  her  statement,  her 
husband, the father of the deceased and his other sister, did not agree with them.  In 
short,  victims  of  precisely  the  same  crime,  with  the  same  dreadful  consequent 
 
emotional damage, took diametrically opposed views about the sentence. 

 
4. 

The court observed: 

“…  if  the  victim  feels  utterly  merciful  towards  the  criminal, 
 
and some do, the crime has still been committed and must be 
punished  as  it  deserves. 
If  the  victim  is  obsessed  with 
vengeance,  which  can  in  reality  only  be  assuaged  by  a  very 
long sentence, as also happens, the punishment cannot be made 
longer  by  the  court  than  would  otherwise  be  appropriate. 
 
Otherwise cases with identical features would be dealt with in 
widely differing ways, leading to improper and unfair disparity, 
… If carried to its logical conclusion, the process would end up 
by  imposing  unfair  pressures  on  the  victims  of  crime  or  the 
survivors  of  crime  resulting  in  death,  to  play  a  part  in  the 
 
sentencing process which many of them would find painful and 
distasteful.  It  is  very  far  removed  from  the  court  being  kept 
properly informed of the anguish and suffering inflicted on the 
 
victims by the crime”. 

 
5. 

These principles are encapsulated in the current Practice Direction.  This reads: 

“III.28 When a police officer takes a statement from a victim, 
the victim will be told about the scheme and given the chance 
to  make  a  Victim  Personal  Statement.    The  decision  about 
whether or not to make a Victim Personal Statement is entirely 
 
a matter for the victim.  A Victim Personal Statement may be 
 
made or updated at any time prior to the disposal of the case.  It 
will  not  normally  be  appropriate  for  a  Victim  Personal 
Statement to be made after the disposal of the case; there may 
be rare occasions between sentence and appeal when an update 
to  the  Victim  Personal  Statement  may  be  necessary,  for 
example, when the victim was injured and the final prognosis 
was  not  available  at  the  date  of  sentence. 
If  the  court  is 
presented  with  a  Victim  Personal  Statement,  the  following 
approach should be adopted: 

(a) The Victim Personal Statement and any evidence in support 
should be considered and taken into account by the court prior 
to passing sentence.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	
 

 

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

(b)  Evidence  of  the  effects  of  an  offence  on  the  victim 
contained in the Victim Personal Statement or other statement, 
must be in proper form, that is a witness statement made under 
s.9 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 or an expert’s report; and 
served upon the defendant’s solicitor or the defendant if he is 
not represented, prior to sentence.  Except where inferences can 
 
properly  be  drawn  from  the  nature  of  or  circumstances 
 
the  offence,  a  sentencer  must  not  make 
surrounding 
 
assumptions  unsupported  by  evidence  about  the  effects  of  an 
offence on the victim. 

(c)  The  court  must  pass  what  it  judges  to  be  the  appropriate 
sentence having regard to the circumstances of the offence and 
of  the  offender,  taking  into  account,  so  far  as  the  court 
considers it appropriate, the impact on the victim.  The opinions 
of  the  victim  or  the  victim’s  close  relatives  as  to  what  the 
 
sentence  should  be  are  therefore  not  relevant,  unlike  the 
consequences  of  the  offence  on  them.    Victims  should  be 
advised of this.  If, despite the advice, opinions as to sentence 
are included in the statement, the court should pay no attention 
to them. 

(d)  The  court  should  consider  whether  it  is  desirable  in  its 
sentencing remarks to refer to the evidence provided on behalf 
 
of the victim. …” 

 
6.	 

We shall return to a number of features of the Practice Direction, after we have noted 
three  further  current  sources  of  information.    In  2006  a  pilot  scheme  known  as  the 
Victims’ Advocate Pilot Scheme allowed the families of victims in homicide cases to 
make a Family Impact Statement in open court.  The statement was directed to the 
effect of the crime on them.  The pilot scheme was run at the Central Criminal Court 
and  four  other  major  courts.    On  3  May  2006  an  appropriate  protocol  was  issued. 
 
Dealing with it broadly, the principles which are now contained in the current Practice 
Direction  were  applied.  In  particular,  whether  presented  orally  or  in  writing,  the 
 
statement  was  formal  evidence,  and  if  the  family  member  chose  to  give  evidence 
orally, the process would be the same as if he or she were giving evidence in chief, 
and liable to be cross-examined on the defendant’s behalf, and the defendant was to 
be  notified  in  good  time  of  the  contents  of  any  such  evidence,  so  as  to  enable 
appropriate forensic decisions to be made.   

 
7.	 

The  relevant  Guide  for  Police  Officers,  Investigators  and  Criminal  Practitioners  is 
entirely consistent with the Practice Direction.  It records: 

“The VPS is the victim’s chance to: 

 
	  Explain in their own words how the crime has affected 
them,  either  physically,  emotionally,  financially  or  in 
any other way
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	
 

 

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

 
	  Express legitimate concerns, such as feeling vulnerable, 
the  alleged 

intimidated  or  worried  about 

fearful, 
offender being granted bail 

 
	  Say if they intend to seek compensation … 

 
	  Request referral to Victim Support or to other agencies 

who might help them. 

The VPS must not include the victim’s offender about how 
the offender should be punished.  That is for the magistrate 
or judge to decide.” 

The Guide continues by indicating that the victim can make a statement at the same 
 
time  as  they  make  their  main  witness  statement,  at  a  later  date,  or  both,  and 
importantly adds: 

“Remember, some victims may not want to make a VPS about 
 
how the crime has affected them.  This is perfectly acceptable 
and you should not draw any conclusions if they don’t.” 

 
8.	 

The recent Report for the Commissioner for Victims and Witnesses in England and 
Wales  (Robert  &  Manikis,  Oxford,  2011)  concluded  that  victims  were  generally 
favourable to the scheme.  Although only a minority of victims submit a statement, of 
those  who  do,  most  appeared  to  benefit  from  the  experience.    Victims  of  serious 
 
crimes of violence were more likely to submit statements, and those who did appeared 
more satisfied with the sentencing process than those who did not. 

 
9.	 

Without suggesting any amendments or additions to the current Practice Direction, a 
number of its aspects need emphasis. 

 
a)	 

The decision whether to make a statement must be made by the victims 
 
personally.  They must be provided with information which makes it 
clear  that  they  are  entitled  to  make  a  statement,  but,  as  the  Guide  to 
 
Police  Officers  and  Investigators  underlines,  no  pressure,  either  way, 
should be brought to bear on their decision.  They are entitled to make 
statements, and they are equally entitled not to do so.  They should be 
informed  of  their  right,  and  allowed  to  exercise  it  as  they  wish:    in 
particular the perception should not be allowed to emerge that if they 
chose not to do so the court may misunderstand or minimise the harm 
 
caused by the crime. 

 

b)	  When the decision whether or not to make a statement is being made, it 
should be clearly understood that the victim’s opinion about the type 
and  level  of  sentence  should  not  be  included.    Again  that  is  entirely 
consistent  with  the  Guide  to  Police  Officers  and  Investigators.    If 
 
necessary,  victims  must  be  assisted  to  appreciate  that  the  court  is

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

required to pass the appropriate sentence, in accordance with decisions 
of  this  court,  and  definitive  guidelines  issued  by  the  Sentencing 
 
Guidelines  Council  or  the  Sentencing  Council,  and  make  a  judgment 
 
based on all the facts of the case, including both the aggravating and 
the mitigating features. 

 
c)	 

 
d)	 

 
e)	 

   

The  statement  constitutes  evidence.  That  is  the  basis  on  which  it  is 
 
admitted.    It  must  therefore  be  treated  as  evidence.    It  must  be  in  a 
formal  witness  statement,  served  on  the  defendant’s  legal  advisors  in 
 
time for the defendant’s instructions to be taken, and for any objection 
to the use of the statement, or part of it, if necessary, to be prepared. In 
Perkins, the statement was handed over far too late in the process, and 
 
indeed we are concerned that some of the submissions from counsel in 
these cases suggest that a somewhat haphazard and slovenly approach 
to the time when the statement is served may have developed, at any 
 
rate in some parts of the country.  

 

Just because the statement is intended to inform the sentencing court of 
specific  features  of  the  consequences  of  the  offence  on  the  victim, 
responsibility  for  presenting  admissible  evidence  remains  with  the 
prosecution. 

It follows that the statement may be challenged, in cross-examination, 
and it may give rise to disclosure obligations, and indeed as the case of 
Hall underlines, may be used, after conviction, to deploy an argument 
that the credibility of the victim is open to question.   

Properly formulated statements provide real assistance for the sentencer.  An example 
of how seriously they are taken by the court is that they are one of the few documents 
 
which are always specially flagged in the papers prepared for the judges of this court, 
considering an appeal against sentence or an application by the Attorney General to 
refer an unduly lenient sentence to the court. 

Experience has shown that in the overwhelming majority of cases, after a statement 
 
has  been  prepared,  it  is  put  before  the  sentencing  court  in  the  usual  way,  and  then 
summarised,  or  sometimes  in  whole  or  in  part  read  aloud  in  open  court  by  the 
 
prosecuting  advocate.  The  judge  will  always  have  read  the  statement  himself,  and 
may sometimes choose not only to indicate that it has been taken into account, but to 
quote any relevant passages in court. Of course, in the selection of any passages for 
quotation  or  indeed  summary,  the  advocate  and  indeed  the  judge  must  be  very 
 
sensitive  to  the  position  of  the  victim,  and  on  occasions  the  need  to  respect  the 
victim’s privacy. The application of these principles means that it will be very rare for 
the victim to read out his or her statement, but the process is sufficiently flexible for 
the judge to permit it in an appropriate case.

It will seldom be appropriate for a statement to be introduced at a sentencing appeal if 
it  was  not  before  the  sentencing  court.    Obviously  there  will  be  occasion  when  an 
update  to  the  statement  is  appropriate.    If  so  the  formalities  must  continue  to  be 
 
observed.  In this court the purpose of the statement is unchanged.  It keeps the court 
informed about the continuing impact and further developments relevant to the impact 
of the offence.  It cannot be used for the purposes of arguing that the sentence was 
 
excessive  or  lenient.    (See,  for  example,  Perks  [2001]  Cr.  App.  R(S)  19  and  AG’s 
Reference No. 59 of 2006 [2006] EWCA Crim. 2096.)  Just because of the need for 
flexibility, there will be occasions when, as in the Crown Court, the court will permit 
the victim of the crime to give evidence in the form of reading a properly prepared 
and timeously served further statement.  This step was permitted exceptionally in the 
 
appeal against sentence by Bennett because we were satisfied from our pre-reading of 
the statement that this was essential to our understanding of the impact of the crime 
 
on the victim. 

In the context of appeals, just as the sentencing decision cannot be influenced by the 
views of the victim about the level and range of sentence, perhaps we should note that 
the  views  of  the  victim  cannot  provide  a  basis  for  this  court  to  conclude  that  the 
appeal is or is not well founded.  If, applying ordinary principles, the sentence appears 
to this court to be excessive or wrong in principle, it must be reduced, irrespective of 
the views of the victim.   

The  guidance  given  by  this  court  to  the  victims  of  crime  and  their  families  in  the 
context of appeals states that it “would be extremely rare for someone who has been 
the victim of an offence (or their family) to be asked to speak or give evidence to the 
 
court”.  That is an inevitable consequence of the jurisdiction exercised in this court, 
 
which  in  the  context  of  appeals  against  sentence,  does  not  constitute  a  re-hearing. 
 
There may, indeed, be practical difficulties, not least that the prosecution is often not 
 
represented on an appeal against sentence, and an appellant may waive his rights to 
attend.  Nevertheless there will, as the guidance implies, be a small handful of cases 
where the court decides that it should allow a victim to read or give evidence along 
the lines of a properly drafted and served witness statement, as in Bennett, following a 
 
very serious crime. 

15.	  With these considerations in mind we shall address these appeals. 

 

Robert Perkins 

This application for leave to appeal against sentence has been referred to the full court 
by the Registrar of Criminal Appeals.  For technical reasons we grant leave.  Robert 
Perkins is 66 years old, and the offences to which he pleaded guilty on 17 February 
 
2012 in the Crown Court at Bradford were historic sexual offences committed against 
three  young  girls,  twins  with  a  younger  sister,  between  1986  and  1991.    The 
unsatisfactory course of these proceedings of itself requires leave to be granted.

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

On  27  March  2012  before  His  Honour  Judge  Durham  Hall  QC,  the  appellant  was 
sentenced, according to the transcript of the sentencing remarks, to a total of 17 years 
imprisonment.  The  sentences  were  not  accurately  recorded  by  the  Crown  Court, 
where the total sentence was noted at 16 years imprisonment.  Counts 1-8 involved 
the first of the twins KD, counts 10-17 involved the second twin SD, and counts 18-
25 involved the third sister, RD.  In relation to counts 1-3 and 5-8 the total sentence 
was 5 years imprisonment.  In relation to counts 10-11, 15 and 17, the total sentence 
was 7 years imprisonment, to run consecutively to the sentences imposed in relation 
to the offences against KD.  In relation to counts 18-25 the total sentence was 5 years 
imprisonment, again to run consecutively to the sentences for the offences of which 
KD and SD were the victims.  Counts 4-5, indecent assault on KD, and counts 9 and 
12-14 indecent assaults on SD, and count 16, rape of SD, were ordered to remain on 
the file on the usual terms. 

A sexual offences prevention order was made, for life, pursuant to s.104 of the 2003 
Sexual Offences Act.  The order prohibited the appellant from approaching, seeking 
to approach or communicating by whatever means, directly or indirectly any of the 
 
three victims. It is agreed by counsel for the Crown and the appellant that this order 
was neither appropriate nor necessary.  We agree.  Accordingly it will be quashed. 
 
Notification orders and orders under the Safeguarding of Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 
were also made. 

 

On 27 April 2012 Judge Durham Hall reopened the sentence in accordance with s.155 
 
of the Power of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.  He varied the sentence in 
respect  of  the  offences  against  KD  and  ordered  that  the  sentences  on  counts  1-8 
should run concurrently rather than consecutively. On the basis that the original total 
sentence for the offences involving this child was 4 years imprisonment, rather than 
the  5  years  shown  on  the  sentencing  transcript,  the  overall  total  was  16  years 
imprisonment, this produced a total sentence of 12 years imprisonment.  It is this total 
sentence which is now the subject of the appeal. 

The facts of this case are sadly familiar.  These were historic sexual offences against 
 
three  female  siblings,  which  dated  back  to  1986  to  1991.    The  girls  were  aged 
between 9 and 13 when they were seriously abused by the appellant.  He was a family 
friend of the children’s parents, and he babysat for them when the parents were out. 
 
He groomed them by giving them sweets and money, and allowing them to plait his 
long hair, and he would tickle them and touch them, apparently innocently, before he 
began to touch them indecently.  The charges involving KD alleged touching of her 
breasts and digital penetration of her vagina.  With SD there was digital penetration of 
the vagina, and a specific count of rape, when she was 12 years old, involving the 
 
insertion  of  the  tip  of  his  penis  into  her  vagina,  causing  her  pain  and  to  bleed 
afterwards. With RD the offences involved touching her vagina with his fingers and 
rubbing his penis against her vagina, and one occasion when he inserted his penis into 
her mouth.  This incident caused RD to be physically sick.  It is an aggravating feature 
of these offences that the abuse on one child was often perpetrated in the presence of 
the others.  The children were silenced by threats to kill them if they told their parents.

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

In fact we know that one of the children wrote letters at the time. Just a few words 
from one of them is sufficient to convey some idea of what the child, as she still was, 
was suffering.  “I don’t know what to do.  I just want it to STOP or for someone to 
make  it  stop.    If  anyone  reads  this  can  you  please  do  something  about  this”.    The 
children were all too young to do anything themselves, and, because of the threats, 
they were all too frightened to tell anyone else. 

There is no doubting the seriousness of these offences.  As a result of his threats, no 
complaint was made by any of the girls to their parents.  They came to light some 20 
years or so later, in 2009, when KD happened to see the appellant and reported what 
 
had happened to the police. 

The appellant was arrested.  He made admissions of the offences involving KD and 
RD, and went on to admit the offences committed against SD.  Thereafter she was 
 
interviewed  by  the  police  and  gave  her  own  account  of  what  had  happened  to  her. 
 
The  appellant  expressed  remorse  for  his  offending,  telling  the  writer  of  the  Pre-
sentence  Report,  “it  was  wrong  what  I  did,  it  was  an  evil  act  I  did”.    He  pleaded 
 
guilty. 

The  appellant  was  not  a  man  of  good  character,  but  his  last  prison  sentence  was 
imposed as long ago as 1978.  Now 66 years old, he is in poor health.  He suffers 
  
Type II diabetes and hyper-tension.  In 2008 he suffered a heart attack.  His mobility 
is affected by arthritis.  In the Pre-sentence Report he was said to represent a “low” 
risk of re-offending, and the Crown accepted that he had not offended for many years. 

Passing sentence on 27 March 2012, the judge reflected that the offences represented 
a campaign of “degrading abuse” of children who were groomed by the appellant, and 
assaulted  for  his  own  self  gratification.  He  was  a  trusted  member  of  the  family, 
treated as an uncle.  The judge was aware and attached importance to the appellant’s 
 
frankness when interviewed, and credit was to be given to him for revealing the full 
 
extent of his offending as well as sparing the victims the ordeal of giving evidence. 
 
The judge also recognised what he described as a “degree of infirmity”.   

The  judge  carefully  reflected  on  the  victim  impact  statements  of  RD  and  KD. 
 
Significantly,  in  the  context  of  the  issues  which  arise  in  these  appeals,  SD  did  not 
wish to provide a victim impact statement because she found the whole process far 
 
too emotional and disturbing.  The two statements which are available explain why. 
 
In essence, both victims describe the dreadful impact of the years of abuse on their 
entire  life.  It  is  unnecessary  to  set  out  the  details,  but  one  example  of  the  kind  of 
impact which might otherwise be overlooked is the description by one of the victims 
 
that, because of what happened to them all, the three sisters drifted apart, each of them 
trying  to  deal  with  what  had  happened  in  her  own  way.    The  other  feature  of  the 
statements is how, even after the offences came to light, they have been kept hidden 
from other members of the family.  The judge was entitled to describe the damage 
done to the children as festering over the years, causing life long damage to them.

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

After  concluding  his  remarks  the  judge  expressed  himself  concerned  that  the 
sentencing regime which applied to sentences imposed for offences committed under 
what he described as ‘the old regime’ were different to those which would obtain to 
crimes committed more recently. 

At the variation hearing on 27 April the judge explained that he was concerned that he 
 
had  imposed  a  sentence  that  might  leave  the  impression  that  he  had  not  given  the 
appellant full or sufficient credit for his plea.  He had made an insufficient allowance 
for  the  totality  principle.    He  was  not  however  reducing  the  sentence  to  reflect  the 
differences in the regime’s governing release from imprisonment.  The total sentence 
should be 12 years imprisonment. 

 

The  submission  is  that  this  sentence  was  manifestly  excessive.    It  failed  to  allow 
sufficiently for the appellant’s immediate admissions and voluntary disclosure to the 
 
police  of  some  of  his  offences,  and  his  subsequent  early  pleas.    Insufficient 
 
recognition was paid to the medical condition of the appellant, the age of the offences 
 
and  the  absence  of  evidence  of  any  sexual  offending  in  the  interim.    Setting  these 
matters of mitigation against the offences committed by the appellant, even with the 
significant features of aggravation, a starting point of 18 years imprisonment before 
 
the  guilty  plea  and  remorseful  co-operation  with  the  police  was  excessive,  and  this 
resulted in an excessive sentence. 

Before addressing the appropriate level of sentence, there are two separate features of 
the process which we must consider. 

The first troublesome area of process is that the variation hearing took place on a day 
when  the  judge  ordered  the  case  to  be  heard,  without  formal  listing,  when, 
coincidently,  both  counsel  in  the  case  happened  to  be  appearing  before  him  in  a 
different  case.  Neither  of  them  had  their  original  papers.    The  judge  obtained  the 
court  file  and  proceeded  with  his  decision,  notwithstanding  submissions  that  the 
proposed variation should not take place in the absence of the defendant, whether in 
court or by video link, unless he had waived his right to be present.  The judge did not 
invite  submissions  from  either  counsel,  observing  that  to  require  the  defendant  to 
travel  to  court  would  be  detrimental  to  his  health  and  he  proceeded  to  order  the 
 
variation. 

S.155  of  the  2000  Act  provides  a  valuable  safety  net  in  the  sentencing  process, 
enabling  the  judge  to  reflect  on  the  sentencing  decision  and  if  so  minded,  within  a 
statutory period, to amend it.  It is however no more and no less than a further hearing 
in the original case.  As such it should be listed so that all the interested parties, not 
only the defendant, but the victims, and the public and the media may be present if 
they wish.  This variation hearing undoubtedly took place in open court, but if no one 
with a direct interest in the case had any idea that it was to be listed, for those most 
closely  concerned  the  hearing  was  effectively  a  private  hearing.    That  should  not 
happen.

The  second  is  a  complaint  that  the  victim  personal  statement  was  not  received  by 
counsel for the defendant until the morning when he was due to be sentenced.  Indeed 
this part of the process did not take place until after the case had been called on.  Mr 
Wood on behalf of the applicant is critical of what happened in the present case, and 
suggests  that  it  provides  a  good  example  of  an  inappropriate  practice  that  has  now 
developed  and  become  wide-spread.  Unless  there  was  some  breakdown  in 
communication,  late  service  of  the  statements  is  wholly  inappropriate  and,  as  we 
explained earlier in the judgment, wrong in principle.  It must stop. 

 

34.	  We  have  reflected  on  Mr  Wood’s  careful  submissions  about  sentence.    This  is  a 
lamentable case.  Three children abused, suffering life long consequences as a result, 
and seriously abused, with one child raped vaginally, and another raped orally, by a 
man who was in a position of trust, and whose threats enabled him to escape detection 
and condemned them to pitiful silence.  Looked at as a total, this sentence was not 
 
manifestly excessive. 

 
35.	 

Accordingly, save in relation to the Sexual Offences Prevention Order, the appeal will 
be dismissed. 

Billy Bennett 

Billy Bennett, now aged 22, is a young man of positive good character, on 1 August 
 
2012 in the Crown Court at Chelmsford pleaded guilty to three counts of rape, one 
count of kidnapping and one count of assault by penetration.  The offences took place 
on the same date and involved the same victim.  On 17 September 2012 before Mr 
Recorder Dodd QC for the rape offences he was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment 
on  the  rape  count,  for  kidnapping  to  4  years  imprisonment,  and  for  assault  by 
penetration, to 6 years imprisonment, all the sentences to run concurrently.  The total 
sentence  was  9  years  imprisonment,  together  with  an  order  for  forfeiture  of  a  Ford 
Focus  motor  car  and  an  appropriate  order  requiring  indefinite  compliance  with  the 
notification provisions. 

 

 

These offences occurred on 19 May 2012, and the victim was a young woman, 26 
 
years old, who had enjoyed a sober night out with friends in Chelmsford town centre. 
  
She started to walk the short distance home.  As she did so a car came by which, she 
 
noticed, did a U-turn and then drove back down the road, apparently driving away.  In 
fact it turned into a side road. 

She  carried  on  walking,  and  close  to  where  she  had  seen  the  car  apparently  drive 
away, she saw the appellant walking directly towards her.  He had his arm up and was 
holding something in his hand and, threatening to stab her if she failed to comply. He 
ordered her to “suck his dick”.  She begged him not to hurt her and he told her that if 
she did as he said she would not be hurt.  He then repeated what he said.  He undid his 
trousers and forced her head down onto his penis and said “suck my cock”.  While he 
 
did this he was holding an object in his hand, and she was terrified.  He made her

crouch down and forced his penis into her mouth.  After a short while he told her to 
get up, and ordered her into his car which was parked close by. 

 
39.	 

 
40.

She was extremely frightened and she asked him to let her go.  He ordered her, “Do as 
I say, I am not going to hurt you”.  She repeatedly begged him not to hurt her.  His 
 
response was that if she didn’t do as he said, and get into his car, he would stab her. 
 
So she entered her vehicle, which he then drove away. 

At that stage she believed that her life was in danger, and as the car drove away she 
kept apologising to the appellant saying, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry”. 

The appellant knew exactly where he was going.  He took a short direct route to the 
entrance of a disused hospital where he would not be interrupted.  Once there, while 
still in the vehicle, the appellant undid his trousers and pushed her head down onto his 
penis.  He removed his penis from her mouth and after that began forcibly to kiss her, 
forcing  his  tongue  into  her  mouth,  and  then  pulling  or  trying  to  pull  her  leggings 
down.  Her overriding and overwhelming sense at the time was that she was going to 
die.  He then pushed her head back onto his penis, this time for a number of minutes, 
and then managed to pull down her leggings. 

She was sat in the passenger seat.  He leaned over and forcibly pushed his fingers into 
her vagina.  It hurt a great deal.  After this digital penetration, the appellant climbed 
over from the driver’s seat, ordered her to take her leggings off and then tried to insert 
his penis into her vagina.  To begin with he was unable to do so. As she describes it, 
this appeared to make him “more wound up”.  He ordered her to get herself wet, put 
his penis back into her mouth briefly, but long enough and with such force that she 
 
felt that she was choking.  He put his fingers back into her vagina and ordered her not 
to try and get out of the car.  Then he walked around to the passenger door while she 
was still inside the vehicle, he picked up a bottle of water from within the car, and 
poured water over the victim and himself apparently to provide some lubrication.  He 
then raped her, telling her that she must not worry, she would not catch anything from 
him.  After a while he ejaculated inside her. 

 
43.	 

Once this incident was over, he asked her for some identification.  She showed him 
some cards.  Eventually she asked if she could go, and he said that she could.  She 
 
sorted out her clothing, put her shoes on and ran away the short distance to her home. 
 
The appellant drove his vehicle away.  Notwithstanding the dreadful experience, the 
victim  took  in  details  about  the  vehicle,  including  its  make,  its  model  and  its 
 
registration number. 

 

44.	  When she reached home, she telephoned the police.  Quite apart from her description 
 
of the incident, she was able to provide the police with ample material to enable them 
 
to trace the defendant to his mother’s home address by the afternoon of 20 May.

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

The appellant was not at home on that occasion, but the police made it clear that they 
intended to speak to him.  At 6.25 that evening he went to Brentwood Police Station, 
where  he  was  arrested  and  interviewed.    The  interview  involved  a  mixture  of 
comment  and  no  comment,  but  he  was  clearly  apologising  to  the  victim,  saying  it 
wasn’t right, and that he had handed himself in because he had a guilty conscience 
and that what he had done was wrong.  He explained that he did not really know what 
 
he had been doing because he had taken drugs in the form of cocaine.  The apology 
was repeated, and in due course he pleaded guilty. 

The victim was to tell the police that the appellant had been forceful, menacing and 
controlled, behaving as if he had “formulated a plan”.  In the immediate aftermath of 
the offence, she was extremely concerned about the possibility that he had transmitted 
a sexual disease to her.  On the day of the sentencing decision, that is approaching 
five months after the rape, appropriate tests demonstrated that there had been no such 
 
transmission. 

The victim impact statement read by the judge led him to observe that she had been 
“very badly affected” by what had happened to her and that the events would remain 
 
with her for a very long time. 

The  judge  concluded  that  an  indeterminate  sentence  would  not  be  appropriate. 
Counsel  for  the  prosecution  suggested  that  the  rape  offence  fell  within  the  second 
category  identified  in  the  Definitive  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council,  with  an 
indicative  range  of  six  to  eleven  years  where  a  person  of  good  character  was 
 
convicted  after  a  trial.    It  is,  however  clear,  that  counsel  was  limiting  this 
categorisation to the count of rape alone, for he added that “consideration, of course, 
has to be had, as regards to assault by penetration” and the count of “kidnap”. 

 

The  judge  addressed  the  incident  as  a  whole,  which  he  rightly  described  as  a 
 
“horrifying  experience”,  noting  that  because  the  victim  had  been  able  to  give  the 
police a clear account of what had happened and the details of the appellant’s car, the 
appellant had surrendered to the police, admitting what he had done and apologising 
for  his  behaviour.  His  only  explanation  was  that  he  had  taken  cocaine,  which  the 
judge suggested did not excuse or mitigate his behaviour.  This was a sustained attack, 
 
which lasted over half an hour, involved the element of kidnap or detention, repeated 
threats to use a weapon, which the victim believed was a knife, and ended when he 
 
ejaculated inside her without attempting to use any form of contraceptive.  The judge 
also  believed  that  the  decision  to  drive  to the  deserted  hospital  site  to  continue  the 
sexual assaults suggested a “modest degree” of planning. 

After considering the victim impact statement, which set out in unequivocal language 
the impact of the offence on the victim, he passed the sentence which is the subject of 
the  present  appeal.  As  we  have  already  indicated,  we  considered  an  application, 
 
supported by Mr Little on behalf of the prosecution, and without objection from Mr 
 
Panayi,  that  we  should  allow  the  victim  to  give  evidence  in  accordance  with  the

 Perkins; Bennett; Hall -v- R 

properly prepared statement. We did so, and we heard her evidence. The grave nature 
of this crime and its continuing severe impact on this particular young woman is clear.  

 
51.	 

 
52.	 

 
In a well structured submission Mr Panayi submitted that the sentence was manifestly 
excessive.    The  appropriate  category  within  the  current  guideline  was  the  middle 
category, with a range of 6-11 years custody after a trial, and that although there were 
a number of serious features of this crime, care should be taken not to double count, in 
particular the element of abduction or detention which was already included within 
the  aggravated  features  of  the  offence.
  He  suggested  that  the  only  additional 
aggravating features, legitimately to be considered  in  the  sentencing  decision,  were 
the fact that the attack lasted some half an hour, and was therefore sustained, that the 
use of a weapon was threatened, and that the appellant ejaculated within the victim 
without  using  a  condom.  These  were  not  sufficient  to  take  the  offences  into  the 
higher category.  They were rightly placed in the middle category, even if higher up 
that range.  As against these features, he underlined the appellant’s youth and positive 
 
good character, and his obvious remorse and positive assistance to the investigation, 
which ultimately culminated in his guilty plea at the earliest possible moment. 

Our decision in this appeal has not been altogether straightforward.  In some ways the 
 
discussion  focussing  on  the  question  of  the  category  of  the  offence  within  the 
 
appropriate  guideline  has  been,  as  it  sometimes  is,  something  of  a  distraction. 
 
Whether one treats the offence as a middle category offence with serious aggravating 
features, or treats the serious aggravating features, taken with the broad facts of the 
 
offence,  as  justifying  categorisation  at  the  more  serious  level,  is  in  some  ways 
academic.  This offence occurred when this young woman was close to her home (a 
feature  which  has  had  a  particular  impact  on  her)  and  she  was  orally  raped  in  the 
street, then driven away and orally raped again, and then vaginally penetrated, with 
force, by fingers and then penis in the car until the appellant ejaculated.  This was 
indeed a “quite horrifying” experience, and the impact on the victim is severe and she 
 
will  be  emotionally  scarred  for  the  rest  of  her  life.    Allowing  for  the  genuine 
mitigation, our conclusion is that the sentence was at the high end of the appropriate 
range, but not excessive so that this court should interfere with it. 

 
53.	 

Accordingly the appeal will be dismissed. 

Ronnie Hall 

Keith  Lauder  lived  at  157  Hinchcliffe,  Orton,  Peterborough.  Megan  Hall,  the 
appellant’s daughter, lived next door.  At about 8.30pm on 10 July 2011 Mr Lauder 
was disturbed by his dog barking.  He went to investigate and was confronted by a 
man who had entered through the rear kitchen door.  The man pointed a rifle at Mr 
Lauder’s  face  and  said  “take  your  top  off,  you  know  why,  you  know  what  I’m  on 
 
about”.  Mr Lauder backed away into his front room, but he was pursued by the man, 
who struck him in the jaw two or three times with the butt of the rifle, causing serious 
facial injuries.  He then managed to escape to the back of his house, making his way

to  a  nearby  shopping  centre  and  alerting  the  police.    In  the  meantime  the  intruder 
caused considerable damage inside the house. 

55.	  Mr Lauder made a witness statement on 20 July 2011.  In the course of the witness 
 

 

statement he described the individual who had attacked him: 
 

“… (I) … was immediately confronted by a male who I did not 
recognised.  He  was  about  5’7”  tall  and  of  stocky  build  with 
black hair, he was aged in his mid 40’s.  I noticed the male was 
carrying  a  single  barrelled  rifle  …  I  was  taken  aback  by  this 
and  very  shocked  …  the  man  then  shouted  at  me  in  a  deep 
Scottish accent, saying … I was confused by this.  I was asking 
what this was about, he just said, “you know what it’s about”. 
 
I’m  not  100%  sure  what  happened  next  but  I  recall  getting 
away from the male …” 

 
56.	 

A sample of the appellant’s blood was found at Mr Lauder’s home, where significant 
damage had been caused.  The appellant was arrested on 27 October 2011.  At the 
 
request of the defence, an identification procedure took place on 25 January 2012, and 
Mr Lauder did not identify the appellant as his attacker. 

 
57.	 

Before the trial, the appellant served a defence case statement, part of which reads: 
 

“The  defendant  states  that  the  victim  of  this  offence,  who  is 
 
unable to identify the offender, knows the defendant by his first 
name of Ronnie and is aware that the defendant is the father of 
his  neighbour,  Megan  Hall.  Had 
the  defendant  been 
responsible for the offence, he would have been identified by 
the victim. 

…  The defendant had visited the victim at his home address on 
a  number  of  occasions.    During  one  of  these  visits  the 
defendant  and  others  were  “messing  around”  when  he 
accidentally smashed a picture frame and cutting his finger.  He 
recalled the frame being on a wall and the picture itself was of 
a young girl”. 

In response, a further statement dated 19 January 2012 was taken from Mr Lauder. 
 
Among  other  matters,  Mr  Lauder  confirmed  that  he  had  met  “the  father  of  my  old 
next door neighbour”, but once only, that he had never been visited at home by him 
and did not really know him.  He added that he felt he would not be able to identify 
Megan’s father from the time he met him, which was more than a year before. 

The Crown relied on powerful evidence to establish that the appellant was the burglar.  
First, his blood which was found on a sideboard with broken glass on it.  The Crown 
also relied on the general presentation of Mr Lauder’s home, which was normally kept 
in a tidy fashion, to show that the blood could not have been left over from an earlier

incident.  There was an account of a witness who described a tall man with bloodied 
knuckles  was  coming  out  of  the  victim’s  house  via  the  back  garden,  carrying 
something like a shovel or a spade, and leaving the scene in a dark coloured Subaru 
vehicle, with a registration number, part of which was said to be AE52 or 53.  The 
appellant owned a black Subaru vehicle, registration number AE518WK.  The Crown 
relied  on  Mr  Lauder’s  evidence  that  his  attacker  had  a  Scottish  accent,  as  does  the 
 
appellant and on the fact that the appellant’s daughter lived next door to the scene.  In 
addition  the  appellant’s  previous  convictions  were  admitted,  and  they  were  said  to 
establish  a  propensity  to  commit  violent  offences  of  this  kind.    Finally  the  Crown 
drew attention to the appellant’s failure to mention in his police evidence important 
facts  which  subsequently  emerged  to  underline  that  his  evidence  at  trial  was  not 
credible.  

 
60.	 

At trial Mr Lauder gave evidence.  In chief, he was asked if he was able to look at the 
face of the person who was attacking him, and he replied, “not straight away, no”. 
  
After  recounting  what  had  happened  and  what  had  been  said,  and  describing  the 
 
speaker’s Scottish accent, he was asked whether at that stage he realised that this was 
 
someone he had met before.  His answer was: 

“well, I was a bit confused with what was happening, but – and 
then it came back to me that it is – I’d met him once before”. 
 

Counsel restated the question, asking whether he had recognised the man at the scene. 
  
The answer was “no”, at the time he agreed the man was “a stranger”.  No doubt with 
the  defence  case  statement  in  mind  counsel  asked  Mr  Lauder  whether  any  pictures 
 
had  been  smashed  at  his  house,  and  whether  he  had  ever  met  Megan’s  father.    He 
 
answered that he had met Megan’s father on one previous occasion at Megan’s house, 
a couple of months before the burglary.  He had only met the father briefly, the father 
had  never  been  into  his  house,  and,  none  of  the  broken  glass  shown  in  the 
 
photographs was present at the scene before the burglary.  He confirmed that he had 
not recognised the man who assaulted him at the time, having only met him on one 
brief previous occasion. 
 

 

 
61.	 

In cross-examination it was suggested to Mr Lauder that he knew Ronnie Hall well as 
the father of his neighbour and that the appellant had visited his house on a number of 
occasions.   Mr  Lauder  denied  it.    It  was  suggested  to  him  that  he  clearly  knew 
Megan’s father by sight, to which he replied: 

“When I saw him out on the street I’d recognise him but he’s 
never been to my house”. 

It was then suggested that this must mean that the person who carried out the attack 
was not Megan’s father.  Mr Lauder responded that in the course of such an attack 
“you don’t instantly know what is happening”.  He went on to say that he would not 
 
be able to identify Megan’s father, “but if I saw him walking down the road, I’d be 
able to point him out to you”.

62.	 

 
63.	 

 
64.	 

Thereafter the evidence was concluded, and after a summing up which has not been 
criticised in any way, the appellant was convicted. 

Shortly  after  the  conviction,  on  23  March  2012,  Mr  Lauder  made  a  victim  impact 
 
statement.  After describing his injuries and ill treatment, he said: 

“I don’t really know my attacker.  I’d only met him once.  I did 
know  that  he  was  the  father  of  the  girl  next  door.    I  had  no 
problem with him or his daughter”. 

As we have emphasised earlier in the judgment, a victim personal statement must be 
in  proper  evidential  form.    That  applied  here.    Of  course,  a  truly  inconsistent 
statement in such a document, whether made before or after a trial, may be introduced 
into  evidence  at  the  trial  (or  indeed  considered  as  possible  fresh  evidence  after 
conviction),  if  it  has  any  relevance  to  the  issues  before  the  jury,  or,  if  the  jury  has 
 
convicted the defendant, to the safety of the conviction.  In circumstances, it cannot 
be simply brushed aside.  

 

65.	  Mr James, on behalf of the appellant, submits that this passage in the victim personal 
statement renders the conviction unsafe.  He relies on the phrase “I did know that he 
was the father of the girl next door” to demonstrate that in his evidence at trial Mr 
Lauder  was  lying  about  the  issue  with  which  he  had  been  pressed.    This,  he  said, 
undermines Mr Lauder’s credibility.  This credibility was relevant not merely to his 
 
own evidence generally, but to the strength of the case overall, and indeed even to the 
question of the admissibility of the appellant’s previous convictions.  

 
66.	 

In response Mr Little for the Crown suggested that the issue of Mr Lauder’s previous 
 
meeting with the appellant was fully before the jury.  At that stage the defence had 
available to them Mr Lauder’s two witness statements, and the content of the victim 
personal  statement  does  not  in  reality  take  these  matters  any  further  forward.    In 
addition, Mr Little emphasises the context of the victim impact statement, which was 
made  exactly  a  week  after  the  jury  had  convicted  the  father  of  the  girl  next  door. 
 
Properly understood in context, the victim’s personal statement is not and could not 
 
reasonably be thought to be a lie.  In any event the combination of the evidence in the 
case means that the conviction is safe. 

 

67.	  We agree.  The issue as to whether Mr Lauder knew his attacker, recognised him at 
the  time,  and  for  no  apparent  reason  was  concealing  that  fact,  was  fully  ventilated 
 
before the jury.  This victim personal statement was not inconsistent with the broad 
evidence Mr Lauder had given, or with the prosecution case.  Properly understood, the 
statement  does  not  mean  “I  recognised  my  attacker  at  the  time”.    Rather  the  fair 
reading is that the witness had met the man, who by then had been convicted of the 
attack, once, as the father of the girl next door and that he did not really know him. 
  
There was ample evidence to sustain this conviction.  For these reasons the conviction 
is not unsafe and the appeal is dismissed.",2013-03-26 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

These three appeals against conviction were heard sequentially, and as they raised a 
number of connected questions arising from the loss of control defence in ss.54 and 
55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (the 2009 Act), counsel in each of the cases 
was present in court while the other cases were argued. 

(a)  On  6  November  2012  in  the  Crown  Court  at  Lewes,  before  His  Honour  Judge 
 
Richard  Brown  and  a  jury,  Mark  Dawes  was  convicted  of  the  murder  of  Graham 
Pethard  on  5  May  2012.  He  was  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment.    The  specified 
minimum term was 15 years.   

(b) On 15 December 2011 in the Crown Court at Sheffield, before His Honour Judge 
 
Goldsack  QC  and  a  jury,  Mark  Hatter  was  convicted  of  the  murder  of  Dawn 
Backhouse  at  or  around  midnight  on  23  June  2011.    He  was  sentenced  to  life 
imprisonment.  The specified minimum term was 25 years. 

(c) On 3 July 2012 in the Crown Court at Cardiff, before His Honour Judge Curran 
and a jury, Barry Bowyer was convicted of the murder of Gary Suller on 6 September 
 
2011.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment.  The specified minimum term was 30 
years. 

Mark Dawes 

At about 5.20a.m. on 5 May 2012, following a report that a man had been stabbed in 
the neck and had stopped breathing, the emergency services were called to an address 
in Brighton.  They there discovered the body of Graham Pethard, a man of 36 years of 
age, who was visiting the area. 

Mr Pethard had sustained several injuries.  There was a stab wound to the abdominal 
wall, which had not contributed directly to his death.  The fatal wound had tracked 
down from the neck into the right lung, causing its collapse.  Something like two litres 
of blood were found in the lung.  There were numerous other injuries, for example 
 
bruises, but these had not contributed to the death.  There were no defensive injuries.   

The case for the prosecution was that Dawes had attacked and killed Mr Pethard with 
a  knife,  having  discovered  him  asleep  on  the  sofa  with  Kayleigh  Chessell,  Dawes’ 
estranged wife.  The Crown’s case was that he had done so in a jealous rage which 
had been building up following arguments over the previous day, and he had come 
home unexpectedly in the early hours.  When he found her and Mr Pethard asleep on 
the sofa he lost his temper and stabbed him with a kitchen knife.  The defence case at 
trial was that Dawes had acted in self defence.  Mr Pethard had attacked him with a

bottle,  and  he  responded  by  picking  up  a  knife,  in  effect  to  defend  himself.    Mr 
Pethard was stabbed by the applicant when he, Mr Pethard, refused to back off.

There was little dispute about the background. Kayleigh Chessell and Dawes married 
in 2007.  The marriage was volatile, he behaving quite differently when he was drunk 
than  when  he  was  sober.  She  began  a  friendship  with  Mr  Pethard.    Her  accounts 
 
about whether there was a sexual relationship between them were inconsistent.  In her 
evidence at trial, she did accept that they had had sexual intercourse.  On 3 May she 
did  not  return  to  their  flat,  staying  overnight  with  a  friend.  She  spent  part  of  the 
evening  with  others,  including  Mr  Pethard.  While  she  was  out  she  received  some 
 
aggressive  text  messages  from  Dawes,  including  a  threat  to  give  whoever  she  was 
 
with  a  “good  hiding”.  When  she  returned  home  on  the  following  afternoon,  she 
 
discovered  that  Dawes  had  damaged  some  of  her  belongings  and  broken  the 
wardrobe. Some disturbance then took place between them, but he did not assault her. 
She  fell  asleep  on  the  sofa.  When  she  awoke  he  had  left.    Although  he  said  he 
 
intended returning that night, it was his invariable practice never to do so when he left 
 
home in the sort of mood he was then in.  So she did not expect him back that night.   

 

She started to text Mr Pethard.  At her invitation Mr Pethard arrived at the flat at just 
 
after  1.03a.m.  They  drank  vodka  and  fell  asleep  on  the  sofa.  According  to  her 
account,  nothing  romantic  or  sexual  occurred  between  them.    At  about  5.15a.m. 
Dawes  returned  home  and  found  the  couple  on  the  sofa,  dressed,  with  their  legs 
entwined.  Her next memory was of being woken.  Her face was wet, and she saw 
Dawes standing over her, holding a bottle of vodka.  He started shouting asking who 
Mr Pethard was, and she told him, adding that nothing had happened between them. 

With that Dawes began hitting Mr Pethard with his fists and then with the bottle.  Mr 
Pethard  woke  up,  holding  out  his  hands  in  self  protection,  and  got  up  and  began 
looking for his shoes.  By now Dawes was very angry and shouted at him to “get the 
fuck out of my flat”.  He then went into the kitchen and armed himself with a knife. 
 
When he returned Mr Pethard tried to reason with him and asked him not to use the 
knife.  Kayleigh Chessell stepped between them.  Dawes moved his arm around her 
and tried to stab at Mr Pethard.  He transferred his knife into his other hand, and then 
made  a  stabbing  movement  with  the  knife  beside  her  neck.    She  did  not  see  what 
 
happened, but she heard Mr Pethard say that he had been stabbed in the neck.  She 
had never seen Dawes look so angry.  He was pacing up and down saying “look what 
you fucking made me do”.  He told her he was leaving, insulted her, and threatened to 
 
“do”  her  father.  She  said  that  she  did  not  hear  Mr  Pethard  issue  any  threats  or  do 
anything aggressive or violent to Dawes.  This account was supported by the evidence 
of a child who heard the appellant say “I’m going to stab you”, and saw him take the 
knife from a knife rack.  He heard another man say “please don’t, please don’t” some 
 
eight or nine times.  When the police arrived at the flat, Kayleigh Chessell told them 
that “Peth had been stabbed by Dawes with a kitchen knife”.  In the meantime Mr 
Pethard, holding his neck, tried but failed to make his way to the front door.  He slid 
to the floor, fatally injured, and died shortly afterwards.

10.	 

In  his  evidence  to  the  jury  he  said  that  throughout  the  marriage  there  had  been 
 
numerous arguments.  He had not been working since Christmas, and was somewhat 
depressed.  However he had found a job which was due to start on 4 May.  He agreed 
he sent Miss Chessell threatening text messages but they were empty threats.  Because 
she had lied he damaged her wardrobe when she failed to return home.  He decided 
that he was leaving her and packed his bags.  He woke her and told her he was going 
out.  Over the course of the evening he drank about 8 bottles of Stella Artois, not an 
unusual amount for him, and one leaving him sober but merry.  He changed his mind 
about leaving her, and sent her a text saying he would be coming home and had his 
key.  He set out for home in a good mood. 

 

 

11.	  When  he  reached  the  flat  he  saw  her  lying  on  the  sofa  with  Mr  Pethard  their  legs 
 
entwined and was “gutted”.  She awoke and said “It ain’t what you think”. Mr Pethard 
started to wake so Dawes punched him in the face, told him to get out of the “fucking 
flat”, picked up a vodka bottle from the floor and threw it at him.  Seconds later Mr 
Pethard, holding the bottle by the neck, swung it at Dawes who therefore punched him 
twice in the face.  That appeared to have no effect and Mr Pethard came at him again. 
Dawes therefore went into the kitchen and picked up a knife to deter him.  Mr Pethard 
backed off.  Miss Chessell moved between them so he pushed her to one side and the 
fire  door  began  to  fall  onto  her.  Mr  Pethard  again  came  at  him  with  the  bottle. 
 
Because of a previous occasion when he had been hit by a bottle he was afraid.  He 
moved out of the way and caught Mr Pethard with the knife.  He did not know that he 
 
had  caught  him  with  the  first  stabbing  action  and  he  never  intended  to  kill  him  or 
cause him serious harm. 

 

It was only when Miss Chessell said “What have you done?” and he saw blood that he 
realised he had stabbed Mr Pethard.  He panicked, left the flat, put the knife down a 
 
drain, and “got off his nut” using alcohol and cocaine.  He denied that upon seeing her 
 
with another man he had ‘flipped’.  He was more shocked than angry and was trying 
to work out what was going on.  He knew prison telephone calls were recorded, and in 
a remark to her when she visited him in prison he had used the word ‘rage’ because 
 
she  was  winding  him  up.  However  he  had  not  killed  in  a  rage  and  did  not  want 
seriously to harm Mr Pethard, he simply wanted him out of the flat.  His explanation 
for the downward track of the knife used on a man who was taller than him was that 
he had been lunging at him in a rugby tackle when Miss Chessell was not standing 
between them.  The child had not seen anything, and was imagining things when he 
said he heard, “Please don’t, please don’t”. 

The  defence  at  trial  was  self  defence.    Nevertheless,  although  not  advanced  by  the 
 
defendant in his evidence, if self defence was rejected, the judge was invited to leave 
 
loss  of  control  as  an  alternative.  Judge  Brown  accepted  that  whether  or  not  the 
defence sought to advance loss of control, he should leave any possible defence to the 
jury.  He decided that the evidence showed that the defendant had incited the violence 
 
offered to him by Mr Pethard, and accordingly no qualifying trigger was available. 
  
He noted an observation in Clinton that: 

“13. The process of objective evaluation in each individual case 
 
is  hugely  complicated  by  the  prohibitions  in  s.55(6)  which 

 
12.	 

 
13.
--------

Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer -v- R 

identifies  a  number  of  features  which  are  expressly  excluded 
from consideration as qualifying triggers.  Thus the defendant, 
who,  looking  for  trouble  to  the  extent  of  inciting  or  exciting 
violence  loses  his  control,  does  not  qualify.    In  effect  self-
induced loss of control will not run.  The most critical problem, 
however, which lies at the heart of the Clinton appeal is sub.s. 
6(c), “sexual infidelity”.” 

 

14.	  Mr  Burton  QC  submitted  that  this  conclusion  was  wrong.    The  observations  in 
Clinton were addressing loss of control in the context of sexual infidelity.  Johnson 
 
[1989] 1 WLR 740 decided on the former law of provocation, remained good law. 
 
S.55(6)(a)  and  (b)  only  serve  to  disapply  the  qualifying  trigger  if  the  defendant 
inciting violence had the specific purpose of providing himself with an excuse to use 
it.  The jury concluded that the violence used by the appellant was excessive.  That 
 
did not preclude “loss of control”.  Therefore the defence should have been left to the 
jury. 

Mark Hatter 

Shortly after midnight on 23 June 2011 Dawn Backhouse was stabbed in the kitchen 
of her home in Sheffield.  She suffered a fatal horizontal stab wound to the left side of 
her chest and a further penetrating wound through her left wrist. 

The background is a little complicated but can be briefly summarised.  Mark Hatter 
had had a partner for 20 years.  They had no children.  The deceased had been married 
and divorced three times.  She had two children.  A relationship started between her 
and  Hatter  about  a  year  before  her  death.  He  was  older  and  more  prosperous,  and 
generous to her and her children.  There was talk that she would have her sterilisation 
operation reversed so that she could have a child with Hatter, who would pay for the 
operation. 

Dawn  Backhouse  decided  to  leave  Sheffield  and  return  to  her  home  in  Maidstone, 
 
where  she  spent  substantial  periods.    During  this  time  she  met  a  man  called  Dave 
 
Brunger.  From about May 2011 a sexual relationship developed between them.  The 
appellant was aware of Mr Brunger’s existence, and that Mr Brunger had offered the 
deceased and her children a home.  He told various witnesses that he was not clear 
whether he would live with the deceased in Maidstone, or at all, and he told another 
 
witness that he considered his relationship with her to be over.  With others he said 
that he was not sure where he stood. 

The prosecution case was that the deceased was the victim of a premeditated killing. 
 
The appellant’s case was that her death was a dreadful accident.   

The appellant went to her home, carrying a sharp cook’s knife, and at about midnight 
he entered her home through an upstairs window.  A neighbour saw him climbing up

Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer -v- R 

to the window, and entering the house, pulling the net curtain back into place.  He 
made it look easy.  The neighbour told his mother and they decided to send a text to 
the deceased, timed at 23.58 asking her to come to the window, to ensure that she was 
 
all right.  He then watched the house.  The back door was open and the light was on in 
the kitchen.  He could hear the appellant and the deceased talking.  At first everything 
 
appeared in order, but he then heard the appellant say, “You are not going.  I’m not 
letting you go.”  He heard him on the phone speaking aggressively, telling whoever 
was there to do himself a favour and, “fuck off”.  Thereafter he heard the appellant 
say “look what you’ve made me do”.   

Another neighbour heard the same argument, which was taking place in the kitchen. 
 
She  heard  the  appellant  ask,  “Have  you  shagged  Dave?”  and  the  deceased  replied, 
“No, I’ve only kissed him”.  At this stage the appellant was shouting, but although the 
voice  of  the  deceased  was  raised,  she  was  not  angry.    After  a  while  she  heard  the 
deceased’s bloodcurdling scream, “No, no, no, no, no”.  She twice heard the appellant 
saying, “Look what you’ve made me do”.  She ran down the garden, shouting out to 
the  deceased  to  see  if  she  was  all  right,  and  the  appellant  said,  “she’s  fine,  just  go 
away”.  She  again  shouted  to  the  deceased  who  responded,  “he  stabbed  me.  He 
 
stabbed me. I can’t breath. I don’t want to die”.   

There was a good deal of evidence to much the same effect, but no further summary 
of it is needed.  As to the appellant, before the police arrived, he positioned himself 
near to her and stabbed himself in the chest.  The prosecution case was that this was 
 
done in an attempt to suggest an attempted suicide, whereas the appellant’s case was 
that he did indeed intend to kill himself when he realised that the deceased was dying. 
The self-inflicted wound required life-saving treatment in hospital.  When the police 
arrived the officer found the appellant hugging a distressed female, who said that she 
had been stabbed in the chest by him. 

 

An examination of the scene showed that all relevant events had taken place in the 
kitchen, and, apart from blood, there was indeed no evidence of any struggle.  It was 
not  possible  to  establish  whether  the  deceased  was  standing  or  sitting  when  she 
suffered  her  wounds.  The  wound  to  the  wrist  was  likely  to  have  been  a  defence 
 
injury; so far as the wound to the chest was concerned, the pathologist had never seen 
such a self-inflicted injury.   

In his evidence Hatter told the jury that he was in love with the deceased, they had 
discussed having a child, he idolised her two daughters and lavished presents on them 
and  paid  most  household  bills.  The  deceased  had  never  told  him  that  their 
relationship  was  over  or  about  her  new  man.    He  had  heard  the  name  Dave,  but 
although  he  was  seeing  less  of  her  himself,  he  never  suspected  an  intimate 
relationship between them.  On 22 June he had taken a knife to her house to take up 
the  carpets.    He  had  been  a  chef  and  kept  his  knives  regularly  sharpened  and  he 
simply picked up a knife that was lying on the kitchen table.

That evening she had asked him to pop round.  He had a key.  They had a cuddle. 
They raised their voices when discussing finances.  When he suggested she contribute 
to  the  cost  of  her  sterilization  reversal  she  said,  “Do  you  want  blood?”    He  asked 
whether she had “shagged Dave”, a private joke.  When the phone rang she asked him 
to tell the caller to bugger off and he did.  She made a ‘violin motion’ with the knife. 
 
He thought she was messing about.  Then he heard something suggesting that she was 
 
in pain, so he spun on his heels, turned around and seized hold of her hand.  Their 
combined momentum, with him holding her hand and her holding the knife led to her 
being stabbed in the chest.  “It all happened in a split second”.  He went on that Mrs 
Backhouse said, “I think I’m dying”, and he replied “Do you want me to come with 
you.  I’ll  not  leave  you”.  She  said,  “Yeah.    I  don’t  want  to  go  on  my  own”.    He 
 
stabbed himself in the chest.  He said, “I wasn’t thinking straight what had happened, 
I was drugged up to the back teeth.  I didn’t even realise the knife had gone into her 
chest”. 

He denied being possessive.  He had never told Fiona Spencer that the deceased had 
 
said the relationship was over.  Had she wanted it he would have walked away.  He 
 
had not heard her cry out and say “No, no, no” or “Please don’t hurt me”. 

The defence was accident.  The judge was nevertheless invited to leave loss of control 
to the jury.  He declined to do so.  In  a detailed, carefully structured ruling, Judge 
Goldsack  decided  that  loss  of  control  should  not  be  left  to  the  jury  for  three  main 
reasons.  First,  there  was  simply  no  evidence  from  any  witness,  including  the 
defendant,  that  he  had  or  might  have  lost  his  self  control.    Second,  there  was  no 
evidential basis for a reasonable inference to be drawn that the defendant lost his self 
control in the brief period between the telephone call from the deceased and her death. 
  
There was certainly no indication from the actual nature of the killing that it was done 
by a man out of control.  Alternatively, if he had lost his control as a result of what he 
heard/realised  in  the  phone  call,  that  related  to  sexual  infidelity  and  it  would  have 
been necessary to direct the jury to disregard it.  Third, even if there was evidence of, 
or from which the jury could infer, loss of control the things said and or done did not 
come  anywhere  near  constituting  “circumstances  of  an  extremely  grave  character”, 
nor  could  they  cause  the  defendant  to  have  a  “justified  sense  of  being  seriously 
wrong”.  To  suggest  that  the  fact  of  a  break-  up  of  a  relationship  could  amount  to 
circumstances of an extremely grave character or that it would entitle the aggrieved 
party  to  feel  a  justifiable  sense  of  being  seriously  wronged  would  be  to  ignore  the 
normal meaning of these words.  It would also result in the defence of loss of control 
being left to the jury in almost every case where one partner to a relationship kills the 
other, which was clearly not Parliament’s intention. 

The  single  ground  of  appeal  arises  from  the  judge’s  decision  that  loss  of  control 
should not be left to the jury.  There was, it is suggested, evidence available which 
was sufficient to raise this as an issue.  This evidence arose from the long term “slow 
burn” factors coupled with matters which were immediately proximate to the killing. 
 
The argument did not permit of any excessive elaboration but granting leave, among 
other considerations the single judge thought it arguable that there was some evidence 
 
of loss of control arising from a combination of factors, including a sense of grievance 
in the appellant who had invested a great deal both financially and emotionally in the

victim, and was left with a feeling of abandonment and anxiety for the future.  The 
 
single judge was also unsure whether the judge should have proceeded on the basis 
 
that  there  is  any  particular  category  of  situations,  like  “the  breakdown  of  a 
relationship” that cannot be treated as providing circumstances of an extremely grave 
character,  giving  rise  to  a  justified  sense  of  being  wronged”.    These  considerations 
were advanced on behalf of the appellant.

At 3.35p.m. on 6 September 2011 Gary Suller’s body was discovered at his home in 
Harold Street, Pontnewydd.  He was lying face down on the floor, and his hands and 
 
feet had been tied with electric cables.  He was badly injured and unconscious, and 
there was a significant amount of blood around his head area.  A paramedic arrived at 
the  home  at  4.30p.m.  and  Mr  Suller  was  pronounced  dead  at  the  scene  soon 
afterwards.  He had been killed by the appellant. 

At the time of the killing both men were in a relationship with a woman known as 
Katie Whitbread or Katie Gilmore, who was working part-time as a prostitute.  Each 
 
man was aware of her relationship with the other.   

The prosecution case was that the appellant went to Mr Suller’s home to carry out a 
carefully  planned  burglary  on  the  morning  of  6  September  2011.  When  Mr  Suller 
returned home, he was subjected to a prolonged beating by the appellant who tied him 
up and, who after stealing some of his property, made away from the scene in his car. 
Thereafter he sold Mr Suller’s stolen property and used the proceeds to buy heroin.  In 
short he had used violence on Mr Suller as part of a burglary. 

 

 

The defence case was that the appellant had used fatal force due to a loss of control. 
  
When Mr Suller returned home he had rushed at the appellant, and a fight had taken 
place.  The appellant’s loss of control was brought about by fear of serious violence at 
Mr Suller’s hands, which was accompanied by some provocative comments he made 
about Katie Gilmore. 

There was a good deal of background evidence about the relationship between Katie 
Gilmore and Mr Suller and Katie Gilmore and the appellant, and indeed Mr Suller and 
the appellant.  From this evidence it appeared clear that the appellant was determined 
to intimidate Mr Suller.  For example, during one incident at Mr Suller’s home, the 
appellant had broken the window of Mr Suller’s car while he was inside the house 
 
with his daughters.  On another occasion he had run past the house and slammed a 
brick against a wall.  Mr Suller was obviously very frightened of the appellant.  On 
another occasion Suller had shown a police officer a text message which he believed 
he had received from the appellant, which read, “I’ll kill you”.   

 
33. 

Katie  Gilmore’s  evidence  at  trial  was  less  favourable  to  the  prosecution  case  than 
anticipated on the basis of her written statements.  She said that Mr Suller had told her
--------

Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer -v- R 

 
that the appellant had threatened him during a telephone conversation, but she did not 
believe him.  She was addicted to drugs, yet although Mr Suller wanted her to stop 
taking them, he would provide her with money to enable her to buy them.  She had 
told lies to both men, and the appellant was being manipulated, so that his head was 
“totally screwed up”.  The appellant had treated her “brilliantly” and got her clean of 
heroin and Mr Suller was trying to split them up.  When cross-examined, she agreed 
that Mr Suller wanted to change her life as a prostitute because he thought she would 
end up being killed.  He had never encouraged her to sell herself as a prostitute.  He 
 
wanted her to go to college.  He was never violent to her. 

The  evidence  from  the  post  mortem  showed  a  very  widespread  pattern  of  severe 
injury.  Mr Suller had suffered a fracture of the upper eye socket, indentation to the 
front  of  the  skull,  and  his  cheek  bone  had  broken  loose  at  one  end.  There  were 
fractures to the upper jaw bone.  There were so many injuries to the head that it was 
impossible to describe them all, but there was widespread bruising and bleeding under 
the surface of the scalp and a split in the connected tissue which covers the skull and 
the  scalp.  There  was  subdural  bleeding  and  a  subarachnoid  haemorrhage,  with 
bruising and contusions on both sides of the brain.  In addition there was blunt force 
trauma caused by something hard and firm coming into contact with the skin, with 
pieces  of  broken  heavy  glass  in  the  area  where  the  body  was  found.    The  facial 
injuries  could  have  been  caused  by  heavy  impact  with  a  glass-strewn  floor.    There 
were numerous abrasions, lacerations, multi-directional scratches and bruises over his 
body.  There were fractures of six of his ribs.  There was an area of parchmented skin, 
appearing to follow from a chemical bleach burn in his hip area.  The cause of death 
was blunt force injury to the head, neck and abdomen, complicated by the inhalation 
of gastric matter caused by breathing problems, associated with him lying on his side, 
with his arms and legs bound behind his back.  The evidence suggested that he had 
been  tied  up  while  still  alive.  Evidence  from  a  forensic  scientist  about  blood 
distribution suggested that the deceased had been beaten in at least six different areas 
 
downstairs. 

 

The  appellant  was  arrested  on  7  September  2011.    In  his  first  three  interviews  he 
denied that he had been to Mr Suller’s house.  It was not until the further interviews 
conducted the following day, after he had been shown CCTV images from the store 
where he sold Mr Suller’s property, that he admitted burgling the house and assaulting 
 
him.  He told officers that it was his intention to return to the house to release him, but 
when he drove back, there was activity at the house and for fear that the police had 
been called he did not go in. 

The  prosecution  also  drew  attention  to  the  contents  of  the  defence  case  statement. 
This suggested that the appellant feared serious violence at the hands of Mr Suller, but 
 
made no reference to any inflammatory comments about Katie Gilmore. 

 

In  his  evidence  the  appellant  described  a  history  of  mental  health  problems  and 
psychiatric treatment.   He had been diagnosed as bipolar and suffered from social 
phobia,  anxiety  and  depression.  He  had  an  extensive  criminal  record  and  was 
 
addicted to heroin.

Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer -v- R 

On 6 September 2011 he went to Gary Suller’s house to commit burglary.  He knew 
that Gary had stuff to sell, whereas he and Katie had nothing: no electricity, gas or 
food.  He wore two sets of clothing and a camouflage hat.  He also used rubber gloves 
 
so as not to leave any evidence.  He had no intention of confronting Gary.  He knew 
 
the house was empty as the car was not there. He gained entry through a window. 
After entering he bolted the front door and once inside he was looking for anything 
saleable.  He heard a noise; and went downstairs and saw Gary walking through the 
back door.  He panicked and threw a chair at him.  The chair missed, and he rushed at 
him.  They started to fight and ended up in the living room.  He threw punches and 
kicks, and Gary did the same. 

 

At one point Gary grabbed him round the waist, and the appellant hit him on the head 
with a glass decanter which broke on the second blow.  They began rolling around 
 
fighting and the glass got on Gary as they were rolling about.  Gary fell down and 
tried to get up again, so the appellant punched him twice in the face.  The appellant 
 
then  asked  Gary  why  he  would  not  leave  them  alone.    Gary  said  to  him,  “Chewy 
 
fucked  up,  leaving  you  alive”.  The  appellant  assumed  this  was  a  reference  to 
someone who had recently beaten him up.  Gary also said to him “Katie’s a prostitute, 
she’s always going to be a prostitute  and she’s going to be my number one earner”. 
 
The appellant had no idea Katie was a prostitute and felt sick at hearing this.  He also 
became  very  angry  at  the  comment  about  her  becoming  Gary’s  number  one  earner 
and hit him again repeatedly with his fists.  They began rolling around again fighting; 
and, when Gary was lying on his back, he turned him over, and to avoid him raising 
the alarm, grabbed some leads and tied him up. He left him trussed.  His intention was 
to finish bagging up the DVDs and sell them to buy heroin before Gary had a chance 
to report the matter to the police. 

 

He had no intention of killing him and at the time just snapped.  Gary kept saying, 
“Don’t hurt me”; and he had said, “I won’t. I’ll be back to set you free”.  However, he 
 
continued to hit him every time he mentioned Katie’s name.  To avoid any scientific 
traces,  before  leaving  the  house  he  used  bleach  on  the  window  sill  and  on  Gary’s 
hands. 

In cross-examination he accepted that he had lied in the first three interviews.  It was 
 
because  he  was  afraid  and  did  not  realise  how  badly  injured  Gary  Suller  was.    He 
accepted that his own injuries were fairly minimal. 

The defence was loss of control, the appellant using force on Mr Suller because he 
was in fear of serious violence at his hands and he also made hurtful remarks about 
Katie  Gilmore  which  were  immensely  provocative  to  the  defendant.    Judge  Curran 
left the defence to the jury.  After the jury had retired they asked the judge if he would 
clarify “qualifying trigger”?  “Is this related to things said and or done by the victim 
during the attack or should we consider things said and or done during the months 
 
leading up to the attack?”  The judge directed that they should consider things said 
and or done both on the day of the incident and in the period before hand.

The argument on appeal is that the judge had failed to direct the jury fully as to the 
“loss of control” defence or to summarise the evidence relating to it adequately, and 
that the summing up failed to deal with both sides fairly. 

In  a  written  route  to  verdict  the  judge  addressed  the  loss  of  control  defence. 
 
Assuming that the use of unlawful force might have resulted from the defendant’s loss 
of control the text continued: 

“Question 6. 

Was the loss of control due either to a fear of serious violence 
from Gary Suller or to things done and or said by Gary Suller 
which  constituted  circumstances  of  an  extremely  grave 
character and which caused the defendant to have a justifiable 
 
sense of being seriously wronged or to a combination of those 
two  triggers?    If  answer,  no,  then  he  is  guilty  of  murder:  if 
 
answer, yes, then go to question 7. 

Question 7. 

Might a person of the defendant’s age and sex with a normal 
degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances 
of the defendant have reacted in the same or a similar way to 
the defendant.  For this purpose the reference to the defendant’s 
circumstances is a reference to all his circumstances other than 
those whose only relevance to his conduct is that they bear on 
his  general  capacity  for  tolerance  or  self-restraint.    In  other 
words that he may have taken or had taken drugs or was or may 
have  suffered  withdrawal  symptoms  is  to  be  ignored. 
If 
answer,  yes,  he  is  not  guilty  of  murder:  if  answer,  no,  he  is 
guilty of murder.” 

 

 
45.	 

On  the  day  before  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  we  invited  Mr  David  Aubrey  QC  on 
behalf of the appellant to be prepared to address the question whether there was any 
evidence of loss of control sufficient to be left to the jury.  At the hearing he advanced 
detailed submissions in support of the proposition that there was such evidence, and 
he maintained the criticisms of the summing up in his written submissions.

Section 54 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (the 2009 Act) provides: 

“(1) where a person (D) kills or is a party to a killing of another 
(V), D is not to be convicted of murder if – 

(a) D’s acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the 
killing resulted from D’s loss of self-control
--------

(b) the loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger, and 

(c)  a  person  of  D’s  sex  and  age,  with  a  normal  degree  of 
tolerance  and  self  restraint  and  in  the  circumstances  of  D, 
might have reacted in the same or a similar way to D. 

(2)  for  the  purposes  of  sub-section  (1)(a),  it  does  not  matter 
 
whether or not the loss of control was sudden. 

(3) in sub-section (1)(c) the reference to “the circumstances of D” 
is a reference to all of D’s circumstances other than those whose 
only  relevance  to  D’s  conduct  is  that  they  bear  on  D’s  general 
capacity for tolerance or self-restraint. 

(4) sub-section (1) does not apply if, in doing or being a part of the 
killing, D acted in a considered desire for revenge. 

(5) on a charge of murder, if sufficient evidence is adduced to raise 
an issue with respect to the defence under sub-section (1), the jury 
must  assume  that  the  defence  is  satisfied  unless  the  prosecution 
 
proves beyond reasonable doubt that it is not. 

(6)  for  the  purposes  of  sub-section  (5),  sufficient  evidence  is 
adduced to raise an issue with respect to the defence if evidence is 
adduced  on  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  trial  judge,  a  jury, 
properly  directed,  could  reasonably  conclude  that  the  defence 
might apply. …” 

 
47. 

Section 55 provides: 

“(1) this section applies for the purposes of s.54. 

(2) a loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger if sub-section 
(3), (4) or (5) applies. 

(3)  this  sub-section  applies  if  D’s  loss  of  self-control  was 
attributable to D’s fear of serious violence from V against D or 
 
another identified person. 

(4)  this  sub-section  applies  of  D’s  loss  of  self-control  was 
attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which – 

(a)  constituted  circumstances  of  an  extremely  grave 
character, and 

(b)  caused  D  to  have  a  justifiable  sense  of  being  seriously 
 
wronged. 

(5)  this  sub-section  applies  if  D’s  loss  of  self-control  was 
attributable  to  a  combination  of  the  matters  mentioned  in  sub-
sections (3) and (4).

(6) in determining whether a loss of self-control had a qualifying 

   
trigger – 

(a)  D’s  fear  of  serious  violence  is  to  be  disregarded  to  the 
 
extent  that  it  was  caused  by  a  thing  which  D  incited  to  be 
done or said for the purposes of providing an excuse to use 
violence; 

(b)  a  sense  of  being  seriously  wronged  by  a  thing  done  or 
said is not justifiable if D incited the thing to be done or said 
for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence; 

(c)  the  fact  that  a  thing  done  or  said  constituted  sexual 
infidelity is to be disregarded. … ”. 

 
48.	 

This  legislation  replaced  the  former  provocation  defence.    As  suggested  in  Clinton 
 
[2012] 1 Cr. App R 26, where its application in the context of sexual infidelity was 
 
addressed,  the  circumstances  in  which  it  applies  do  not  exactly  leap  from  the 
legislative page.  We must now consider its application to the issues raised in these 
 
appeals,  and  in  particular  in  the  context  of  violence  offered  to  or  feared  by  the 
defendant.  The  considerations  bearing  on  this  problem  are  found  in  different  sub-
sections, and it may be convenient to their proper examination if we reassemble ss.54 
and  55  of  the  2009  Act,  so  that  all  the  relevant  considerations  found  in  the  sub-
sections can be seen in their context within the statutory framework. 

 

49.	  When a person kills or is party to the killing of another person, unless he has acted in 
a  considered  desire  for  revenge,  he  is  not  to  be  convicted  of  murder,  but  of 
manslaughter, if each of three distinct ingredients which comprise the defence may be 
 
present.  If evidence sufficient to raise an issue in relation to all three ingredients is 
adduced,  the  prosecution  must  disprove  the  defence.    But  the  evidence  is  not 
sufficient  for  this  purpose  unless,  in  the  opinion  of  the  trial  judge,  a  jury,  properly 
directed, could reasonably conclude that the defence might apply.  If so the defence 
 
must be left to the jury and the prosecution must disprove it.  This judgment proceeds 
on  the  basis  that  the  fundamental  principles  relating  to  the  burden  of  proof  are 
unchanged. 

 

50.	  Whether  the  issue  of  loss  of  control  arises  because  the  defendant  has  positively 
advanced it for consideration, or because the judge is contemplating whether to leave 
 
the  defence  to  the  jury  when  for  forensic  reasons  it  has  not  been  advanced,  the 
 
approach to the decision must be identical.  In Clinton, at paras 45 and 46, the court 
summarised the task of the judge: 

“This requires a commonsense judgment based on an analysis 
of all the evidence.  To the extent that the evidence may be in 
dispute,  the  judge  has  to  recognise  that  the  jury  may  accept 
evidence which is most favourable to the defendant, and reject 
that which is most favourable to the prosecution, and so tailor 
the ruling accordingly.  That is merely another way of saying
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer -v- R 

that  in  discharging  this  responsibility  the  judge  should  not 
reject  disputed  evidence  which  the  jury  might  choose  to 
believe.” 

 
51.	 

 
52.	 

 
53.	 

The evidence may of course come from the defendant himself, and it is trite law that 
the credibility of the defendant is a matter for the jury. There was debate whether the 
assessment of the gravity of the circumstances and whether the defendant was caused 
a  justifiable  sense  of  being  seriously  wronged  are  subjective,  that  is,  whether  it  is 
 
enough  for  the  defendant  to  assert  that  he  himself  believed  that  the  circumstances 
were sufficiently grave and that his sense of being seriously wronged was justified. 
 
As  we  shall  see,  irrespective  of  any  credibility  issue,  the  bare  assertion  of  these 
 
matters will not always be sufficient for these purposes. 

“Opinion”, as used in s.54(6), is commonly used to mean the judgment of the court. 
 
This is exemplified in the procedures for the Case Stated, and indeed in relation to the 
 
use of video recordings, in s.103 of the 2009 Act itself.  In short, “opinion” for these 
 
purposes is not used in the sense that different judges may reasonably form different 
 
opinions about the way in which discretion should be exercised: what is required is a 
judgment, which may be right or wrong.  As in any appeal to this court, the challenge 
will not succeed unless we decide, bearing in mind the advantages that the judge will 
 
have had from having heard the evidence, that the defence should have been left to the 
jury.  If so, and it was not, the judgment was wrong, and the defence should have been 
left to the jury, the defendant was deprived of his entitlement to the jury’s verdict. 
  
The conviction would be quashed and in most cases of this kind, a new trial would 
almost certainly be ordered.   

Provided the evidence is sufficient for the purposes of s.54(6) it must be left to the 
jury, whatever forensic tactical decisions may have been made by or on behalf of the 
defendant.  In this respect, long standing principles are unchanged, and no wearisome 
recital of the many decided cases which confirm them is needed.  Similarly, however, 
whether the prosecution has raised the question or not, at the end of the evidence the 
judge should examine and decide whether, indeed, sufficient evidence relating to all 
the ingredients of the defence has been raised. 

 

54.	  We can now turn to the first requirement, that is that the defendant’s acts or omissions 
 
in  doing,  or  in  being  a  part  of,  the  killing  resulted  from  his  loss  of  self  control. 
 
Provided there was a loss of control, it does not matter whether the loss was sudden or 
not.  A  reaction  to  circumstances  of  extreme  gravity  may  be  delayed.    Different 
individuals in different situations do not react identically, nor respond immediately. 
Thus for the purposes of the new defence, the loss of control may follow from the 
 
cumulative  impact  of  earlier  events.    For  the  purposes  of  this  first  ingredient,  the 
 
response  to  what  used  to  be  described  as  “cumulative  provocation”  requires 
consideration  in  the  same  way  as  it  does  in  relation  to  cases  in  which  the  loss  of 
control is said to have arisen suddenly.  Given the changed description of this defence, 
perhaps “cumulative impact” is the better phrase to describe this particular feature of 
the first requirement.
--------

Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer -v- R 

For present purposes, we can deal briefly with the third ingredient of the defence, that 
a person of D’s sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and 
in the circumstances of D, that is all of his circumstances other than those bearing on 
 
his general capacity for tolerance or self-restraint, might have reacted or behaved in 
the same or a similar way.  In this judgment, no further elaboration is appropriate. 

The crucial questions in the present appeals involve an examination of the qualifying 
triggers defined in s.54(1)(b) as elaborated in s.55, that is the second ingredient of the 
defence. To the extent explained in Clinton, sexual infidelity is to be disregarded.  By 
contrast, if the loss of self control is attributable to D’s fear of serious violence from 
the victim against him or some other identified person, the qualifying trigger may be 
 
present.  A further qualifying trigger applies if the loss of self control is attributed to a 
 
thing or things done or said, or both, which constituted circumstances of an extremely 
grave character, and causes the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously 
wronged.  As the legislation recognises in s.55(5) there are unlikely to be many cases 
where the only feature of the evidence relating to the qualifying trigger in the context 
of fear of violence will arise in total isolation from things done or said within s.55(4). 
 
In most cases the qualifying trigger based on a fear of violence will almost inevitably 
to  include  consideration  of  things  said  and  done,  in  short,  a  combination  of  the 
features identified in s.55(3) and (4). 
   

Neither qualifying trigger in s.55(6)(a) and (b) is available to the defendant who has 
deliberately sought to provide himself with an excuse to use violence by inciting, or 
 
encouraging or manufacturing a situation for this purpose.   

There was some debate about the continuing authority, if any, of Johnson [1989] 89 
Cr. App. R 148, decided in the context of the former provocation defence.  In that 
case the court rejected the submission “that the mere fact that a defendant caused a 
reaction in others, which in turn led him to lose his self-control, should result in the 
issue of provocation being outside a jury’s consideration”.  In our judgment, for the 
 
purposes of the loss of control defence, the impact of Johnson is now diminished, but 
not wholly extinguished by the new statutory provisions.  One may wonder (and the 
judge would have to consider) how often a defendant who is out to incite violence 
could be said to “fear” serious violence; often he may be welcoming it.  Similarly, one 
 
may  wonder  how  such  a  defendant  may  have  a  justifiable  sense  of  being  seriously 
wronged if he successfully incites someone else to use violence towards him.  Those 
 
are legitimate issues for consideration, but as a matter of statutory construction, the 
mere fact that in some general way the defendant was behaving badly and looking for 
and provoking trouble does not of itself lead to the disapplication of the qualifying 
triggers based on s.55(3)(4) and (5) unless his actions were intended to provide him 
with the excuse or opportunity to use violence.  As Johnson no longer fully reflects 
the  appropriate  principle,  further  reference  to  it  is  inappropriate.    The  relevant 
 
principle is identified in the present judgment. 

The  loss  of  control  defence  is  not  self-defence,  but  there  will  often  be  a  factual 
overlap between them.  It will be argued on the defendant’s behalf that the violence 
 
which  resulted  in  the  death  of  the  deceased  was,  on  grounds  of  self-defence,  not

unlawful.  This  defence  is  now  governed  by  s.76  of  the  Criminal  Justice  and 
Immigration  Act  2008.    In  the  context  of  violence  used  by  the  defendant  there  are 
obvious differences between the two defences and they should not be elided.  These 
 
are summarised in Smith and Hogan, 13th Edition, at p 135.  The circumstances in 
 
 
which  the  defendant,  who  has  lost  control  of  himself,  will  nevertheless  be  able  to 
argue that he used reasonable force in response to the violence he feared, or to which 
he was subjected, are likely to be limited.  But even if the defendant may have lost his 
self-control, provided his violent response in self-defence was not unreasonable in the 
circumstances,  he  would  be  entitled  to  rely  on  self  defence  as  a  complete  defence. 
 
S.55(3)  is  focussed  on  the  defendant’s  fear  of  serious  violence.  We  underline  the 
distinction between the terms of the qualifying trigger in the context of loss of control 
with  self-defence,  which  is  concerned  with  the  threat  of  violence  in  any  form. 
 
Obviously, if the defendant genuinely fears serious violence then, in the context of 
self-defence, his own response may legitimately be more extreme.  Weighing these 
considerations, it is likely that in the forensic process those acting for the defendant 
will  advance  self-defence  as  a  complete  answer  to  the  murder  charge,  and  on 
 
occasions, make little or nothing of the defendant’s response in the context of the loss 
of  control  defence.  As  we  have  already  indicated,  the  decision  taken  on  forensic 
 
grounds (whether the judge believes it to be wise or not) is not binding on the judge 
and, provided the statutory conditions obtain, loss of control should be left to the jury. 
 
Almost always, we suggest, the practical course, if the defence is to be left, is to leave 
it for the consideration of the jury after it has rejected self-defence. 

 
60.	 

As noted in Clinton, viewed overall, the eventual legislation which found its way into 
ss.54 and 55 of the 2009 Act did not closely follow the overall recommendations of 
the Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide (Law Commission No. 309).  Nevertheless, 
as the Law Commission noted, in the context of the former defence of provocation, 
the judge was bound to leave the defence if there was evidence that the defendant was 
 
provoked to lose self-control, however improbable the defence may have appeared. 
In the view of the Law Commission 5.15: 

 

“The  current  position  does  not  serve  the  interests  of  justice 
because  the  need  to  put  the  defence  to  the  jury  in  these 
circumstances  increases  the  likelihood  that  an  unmeritorious 
claim may succeed”. 

At  5.16  it  was  proposed  that  the  trial  judge  should  have  the  task  of  “filtering  out 
purely speculative and wholly unmeritorious claims”.  We see a direct link between 
this recommendation and the legislative provisions in s.55(3),(4) and (5).  Their effect 
is  that  the  circumstances  in  which  the  qualifying  triggers  will  arise  is  much  more 
limited than the equivalent provisions in the former provocation defence.  The result 
 
is that some of the more absurd trivia which nevertheless required the judge to leave 
the  provocation  defence  to  the  jury  will  no  longer  fall  within  the  ambit  of  the 
 
qualifying  triggers  defined  in  the  new  defence.    This  is  unsurprising.  For  the 
 
individual  with  normal  capacity  of  self-restraint  and 
the 
circumstances are extremely grave, normal irritation, and even serious anger do not 
 
often cross the threshold into loss of control. 

tolerance,  unless

61.	 

The presence, or otherwise, of a qualifying trigger is not defined or decided by the 
defendant and any assertions he may make in evidence, or any account given in the 
investigative  process.  S.55(3)  directly  engages  the  defendant’s  fear  of  serious 
violence.  As we have explained, in this type of case s.55(4) will almost inevitably 
 
arise for consideration.  Unless the defendant has a sense of being seriously wronged 
s.55(4)  has  no  application.  Even  if  it  does,  there  are  two  distinctive  further 
requirements.  The circumstances must be extremely grave and the defendant’s sense 
 
of  being  seriously  wronged  by  them  must  be  justifiable. 
In  our  judgment  these 
matters require objective assessment by the judge at the end of the evidence and, if the 
 
defence  is  left,  by  the  jury  considering  their  verdict.    If  it  were  otherwise  it  would 
mean  that  a  qualifying  trigger  would  be  present  if  the  defendant  were  to  give  an 
account to the effect that, “the circumstances were extremely grave to me and caused 
me to have what I believed was a justifiable sense that I had been seriously wronged”. 
 
If so, when it is clear that the availability of a defence based on the  loss of control has 
been significantly narrowed, one would have to question the purpose of s.55(3)(4) and 
(5). 

Conclusion 

62.	  With these broad considerations in mind, we can now address the individual appeals. 

 

R v Dawes 

Judge Brown’s approach to the question whether the loss of control defence should be 
left to the jury when only self defence was advanced for it to consider by the defence 
was  correct.    He  would  have  left  the  loss  of  control  defence  to  the  jury  if  in  his 
judgment there was any evidence relating to the qualifying trigger which did not fall 
within the ambit of s.54(6) of the Act.  For the reasons already given, Johnson should 
not have been treated as overruled by the prohibition against reliance by the defendant 
on  the  manufacture  of  a  violent  situation incited  by  the  defendant  to  which  he  had 
responded.  There was no sufficient evidence that this was the defendant’s purpose.   

In our judgment, however, the decision that the loss of control should not be left to the 
jury was fully justified.  There was no sufficient evidence that the appellant ever lost 
 
his self-control.  His own evidence was that he had not killed Mr Pethard in a rage. 
 
He was shocked rather than angry.  He simply wanted him out of the flat.  He had 
acted in self-defence.  For what we may describe as obvious reasons the jury rejected 
 
this  defence.  However  although  for  the  purposes  of  self-defence  the  extent  of  his 
 
violence was wholly unreasonable, it did not follow that his actions were consequent 
on any loss of self control.  In our judgment there was no evidence sufficient to leave 
the  first  ingredient  of  this  defence  to  the  jury.    Accordingly,  although  the  judge 
understandably misread the impact of the new legislative provisions of Johnson, his 
decision that the defence should not be left to the jury was correct.

R v Hatter 

Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer -v- R 

 

65.	  We agree with Judge Goldsack’s decision.  The defence was accident.  Once again, 
 
 
for entirely understandable reasons, the jury rejected the defence.  It did not follow 
from  the  rejection  of  the  defence  that  the  loss  of  control  defence  might  then  arise. 
 
Dealing with it generally, we agree that the fact of the break up of a relationship, of 
itself, will not normally constitute circumstances of an extremely grave character and 
entitle  the  aggrieved  party  to  feel  a  justifiable  sense  of  being  seriously  wronged. 
 
However  we  also  appreciate  that  circumstances  vary,  and  just  as  issues  relating  to 
 
sexual  infidelity  have  to  be  examined  in  their  overall  circumstances,  so  the  events 
surrounding the circumstances in the breakdown of a relationship will often but not 
always fall to be disqualified by s.55(6).  In the present case, however, we agree with 
 
Judge Goldsack that the reality of this case was that the death of the deceased was a 
direct consequence of the appellant’s response to the breakdown of the relationship, 
and that there was no particular feature of the evidence to suggest any justifiable sense 
 
in the appellant of being seriously wronged.  If the jury was sure about the main thrust 
of  the  Crown’s  case,  this  was  premeditated  murder.    If  the  jury  concluded  that  the 
defendant’s  account  of  events  may  have  been  correct,  but  nevertheless  rejected 
accident,  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  fatal  injuries  were  inflicted  by  him  in 
consequence of loss of control. 

R v Bowyer 
 

If  we  have  any  criticism  of  one  of  the  outstanding  judges  of  his  generation  on  the 
 
former Wales and Chester circuit, now the Wales circuit, it is that the loss of control 
defence was left to the jury at all.  The appellant was a self -confessed burglar.  He 
 
deliberately entered the home of the deceased in order to steal property, to sell it to 
 
feed  his  drug  habit.  He  deliberately  targeted  the  house,  taking  every  precaution  to 
avoid detection.  At the very best, he suggests that he just snapped when, following 
the householder’s return, he, the householder, reacted violently to the presence of the 
burglar  in  his  home  and  used  deliberately  insulting  remarks  about  the  appellant’s 
 
girlfriend. To that the somewhat colloquial answer is, “So what”?  If either of these 
 
men was justified in losing his self control, it was the deceased.  The deceased was 
entitled  to  say  and  do  anything  reasonable,  including  the  use  of  force,  to  eject  the 
burglar from his home.  Even taking the appellant’s evidence at face value (and we 
bear in mind that the jury must have rejected it) it is absurd to suggest that the entirely 
understandable response of the deceased to finding a burglar in his home provided the 
appellant  with  the  remotest  beginnings  of  a  basis  for  suggesting  that  he  had  any 
justifiable sense of being wronged, let alone seriously wronged.  On that basis alone, 
one  essential  ingredient  of  this  defence  was  entirely  absent.    Furthermore,  we  can 
detect no evidence of loss of control.  The tragic events which occurred in the home 
of  the  deceased  bore  all  the  hallmarks  of  appalling  violence  administered  in  cold 
blood. 

The remaining criticisms of the judge are not sustained.  The loss of control defence 
was accurately summarised.  Given the facts of this case a fair summing up would 
inevitably present a very powerful case against the appellant.  It is perhaps salutary to 
 

 
66.	 

 
67.

Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer -v- R 

remember that a fair summing up should reflect the evidence presented to the jury.  If 
the evidence for the prosecution is very powerful, the summing up should not, as a 
 
matter of general fairness, seek to diminish its impact, anymore than a strong case for 
 
the  defendant  should,  in  the  interests  of  fairness  to  the  prosecution  be  similarly 
diminished.  A fair summing up means no more and no less than that it should fairly 
reflect the evidence available for the consideration of the jury.  This summing up had 
that proper effect.",2013-03-26 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Lady Justice Rafferty and Mr Justice Simon) has today 
 
provided its first interpretation of the legislation that generated the new partial defence to 
 
murder, ‘loss of control’ where fear of violence has been argued, and offered guidance as to its 
 
application. 
  
 
Today’s judgment in the appeals of three men against their convictions for murder follows  one from 
 
January 2012 where the Court examined the full extent of the prohibition against ‘sexual infidelity’ as 
 
a qualifying trigger for the purposes of the loss of control defence. 
 
 
 
The Court examines the loss of control defence in cases where fear of violence is asserted in 
 
 
paragraphs 46 – 62. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court said: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

“As noted in Clinton, viewed overall, the eventual legislation which found its way into ss.54 and 55 of 
 
 
the 2009 Act did not closely follow the overall recommendations of the Murder, Manslaughter and 
 
Infanticide (Law Commission No. 309).  Nevertheless, as the Law Commission noted, in the context of 
 
 
the former defence of provocation, the judge was bound to leave the defence if there was evidence 
 
that the defendant was provoked to lose self‐control, however improbable the defence may have 
 
appeared.  In the view of the Law Commission 5.15: 
 

 
  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“The current position does not serve the interests of justice because the 
 
need to put the defence to the jury in these circumstances increases the 
 
likelihood that an unmeritorious claim may succeed”. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

  
 

 
 
  

At 5.16 it was proposed that the trial judge should have the task of “filtering out purely speculative 
 
and wholly unmeritorious claims”.  We see a direct link between this recommendation and the 
 
legislative provisions in s.55(3),(4) and (5).  Their effect is that the circumstances in which the 
 
qualifying triggers will arise is much more limited than the equivalent provisions in the former 
 
provocation defence.  The result is that some of the more absurd trivia which nevertheless required 
 
the judge to leave the provocation defence to the jury will no longer fall within the ambit of the 
 
qualifying triggers defined in the new defence.  This is unsurprising.  For the individual with normal 
 
capacity of self‐restraint and tolerance, unless the circumstances are extremely grave, normal 
 
 
irritation, and even serious anger do not often cross the threshold into loss of control.

--------
“The presence, or otherwise, of a qualifying trigger is not defined or decided by the defendant and 
 
any assertions he may make in evidence, or any account given in the investigative process.  S.55(3) 
 
directly engages the defendant’s fear of serious violence.  As we have explained, in this type of 
 
 
case s.55(4) will almost inevitably arise for consideration.  Unless the defendant has a sense of 
 
 
being seriously wronged s.55(4) has no application.  Even if it does, there are two distinctive 
 
further requirements.  The circumstances must be extremely grave and the defendant’s sense of 
 
being seriously wronged by them must be justifiable.  In our judgment these matters require 
 
objective assessment by the judge at the end of the evidence and, if the defence is left, by the jury 
 
 
considering their verdict.  If it were otherwise it would mean that a qualifying trigger would be 
 
 
present if the defendant were to give an account to the effect that, “the circumstances were 
 
extremely grave to me and caused me to have what I believed was a justifiable sense that I had 
 
been seriously wronged”.  If so, when it is clear that the availability of a defence based on the loss 
 
of control has been significantly narrowed, one would have to question the purpose of s.55(3)(4) 
 
and (5).” (paras 60‐ 61)

In giving judgment on behalf of the Court, Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice said: 
 
 
“If we have any criticism of one of the outstanding judges of his generation on the former Wales 
 
and Chester circuit, now the Wales circuit, it is that the loss of control defence was left to the jury 
 
at all.  The appellant was a self‐confessed burglar.  He deliberately entered the home of the 
 
deceased in order to steal property, to sell it to feed his drug habit.  He deliberately targeted the 
 
 
house, taking every precaution to avoid detection.  At the very best, he suggests that he just 
 
snapped when, following the householder’s return, he, the householder, reacted violently to the 
 
 
presence of the burglar in his home and used deliberately insulting remarks about the appellant’s 
 
girlfriend. To that the somewhat colloquial answer is, “So what”?  If either of these men was 
 
justified in losing his self control, it was the deceased.  The deceased was entitled to say and do 
 
 
anything reasonable, including the use of force, to eject the burglar from his home.  Even taking 
 
the appellant’s evidence at face value (and we bear in mind that the jury must have rejected it) it is 
 
 
absurd to suggest that the entirely understandable response of the deceased to finding a burglar in 
 
his home provided the appellant with the remotest beginnings of a basis for suggesting that he had 
 
any justifiable sense of being wronged, let alone seriously wronged.  On that basis alone, one 
 
essential ingredient of this defence was entirely absent.  Furthermore, we can detect no evidence 
 
of loss of control.  The tragic events which occurred in the home of the deceased bore all the 
 
hallmarks of appalling violence administered in cold blood.” (para 66)

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE SIMON TONKING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

I sentence you for two offences, both arising out of two incidents of violence, 
 
 

 
 
separated by about 40 minutes, which occurred in the very early hours of the 
 
morning of Friday 13th January of last year, in the street immediately outside the 
 
 
 
Newtown public house in City Road, Fenton. 
  
 
The first incident gives rise to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily 
 
 
harm, the second to an offence of manslaughter and, whilst it is the second offence 
 
 
which is the more serious, I will outline each offence in chronological order. 
  
 
Assault occasioning actual bodily harm 
 
 
It has never been in dispute that at about ten to one in the morning of Friday 
 
 
13th  January  of  last  year,  you  followed  Mr.  David  Heath  as  he  left  the  Newtown 
 
public house in City Road, Fenton and, once outside, within moments you attacked 
 
him by knocking his baseball cap off, headbutting him, punching him to the ground 
 
and then kicking him a number of times. 
  
 
Almost  all  of  this  you  admitted  when  you  were  interviewed  by  the  police 
 
 
later the same day – the exception being that you did not admit the full extent of the 
 
 
kicking which you gave to Mr. Heath, which is clear from the CCTV footage. 
 
 
This  was  a  brutal  and  vicious  attack  on  a  man  who,  once  he  was  on  the 
 
 
ground,  was completely  defenceless. As a  result  of  your  attack Mr. Heath did  not 
 
 
suffer any serious injury, the medical evidence being inconclusive as to whether his 
 
broken nose occurred at this time or when he went to the ground in the incident 
 
which  occurred  40  minutes  later;  and  accordingly  the  only  injuries  attributable  to 
 
this assault are a small cut to the top of the nose and swollen lips. 
  
 
It is plain that this attack did not happen out of the blue and, as you have 
 
 
always maintained, I am prepared to accept that Mr. Heath had been taunting you 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

1
--------
You have been found guilty by the jury of the offence of manslaughter, which 
 

and, as he went to leave, turned to you and voiced some final insult. That however 
 
cannot possibly explain, let alone excuse, what you did. 
  
 
Putting this assault in the context of the Sentencing Council Guideline, this 
 
 
was a sustained attack involving the use of both your head and your foot as weapons 
 
and, whilst the provocation does serve to reduce its seriousness, I am satisfied that it 
 
 
falls into the most serious category of assaults occasioning actual bodily harm. 
  
 
I  will  deal  with  other  aggravating  and  mitigating  features,  which  are 
 
 
 
applicable to both offences, after I have outlined the factual basis on which I pass 
 
sentence for manslaughter, to which I now turn. 
  
 
 
Manslaughter 
 
 
 
arises out of the fact that having assaulted Mr. David Heath in the second incident, 
 
he died on 5th February of last year from the injuries which you caused. 
  
 
This offence was committed in very different circumstances from those which 
 
 
obtained in the first incident. On this occasion you did not go to Mr. Heath but he 
 
came to you. He did so having gone home by taxi, told his daughter and Mr. Rogers 
 
that he had been beaten up by three men, had his cut cleaned and telephoned Mr. 
 
Lee Platt, who was still at the Newtown, twice. He then returned to the Newtown, 
 
driven by Mr. Rogers, in Mr. Rogers’ car. 
  
 
His  motive  for  doing  so  is  far  from  clear.  Mr.  Rogers  gave  evidence  that 
 
 
initially, angered by what he had seen and heard, he wanted to go to the Newtown 
 
 
alone in order to find out who was responsible and then call the police, but that Mr. 
 
 
Heath  had  said  he  would  go  with  him.  Mr.  Rogers  also  gave  evidence  that  when 
 
asked, after the second incident, by Miss Smith why he had brought Mr. Heath back 
 
he told her “for his friend Lee”. He denied that he and Mr. Heath had been intent on 
 
revenge. 
  
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

I am far from sure that these reasons are true: 
 
 
Firstly, as he conceded, Mr. Rogers did not have any information from which 
 
he could have identified anyone; 
  
Secondly, in the second phone call between Mr. Heath and Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee 
 
had made it clear that he was leaving the Newtown and would not be there if 
 
Mr. Heath returned – so they could not have been going back for him; and 
  
Thirdly, the evidence of the taxi driver who took Mr. Heath home, which was 
 
 
read by agreement, is that Mr. Heath told him that it wasn’t the last of it and 
 
 
he was going to go back to the pub with a couple of friends.

Furthermore it is clear from the CCTV footage, despite the lack of clear focus 
 
and the fact that not everything is shown, that the second incident began with Mr. 
 
 
Rogers,  followed  by  Mr.  Heath,  walking  purposefully  across  the  road,  Mr.  Heath

--------
pointing you out and there then being some kind of altercation in which you moved 
 
backwards, towards a pillar, in what was a plain attempt to avoid Mr. Rogers and Mr. 
 
Heath. After that, Mr. Heath was involved in a scuffle with Miss Smith and then went 
 
 
(off camera) back to the place where you and Mr. Rogers were. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
This shows, with sufficient clarity, that at the start of this incident it was Mr. 
 
Rogers and Mr. Heath were not simply asking you why you acted as you did in the 
 
 
first  incident,  but  they  were  themselves  acting  with  some  aggression  and  your 
 
actions were in response to that. Your response, as the jury have decided, was not 
 
defensive  but  aggressive  and,  when  Mr.  Heath  came  back  into  the  path  of  the 
 
camera, you and Miss Smith were facing up to him and it was at this point that you 
 
struck him the single blow which, as the jury have found, caused him to go to the 
 
ground  and  sustain  the  injuries  from  which  he  ultimately  died.  In  short  you  met 
 
 
aggression with aggression, with consequences which turned out to be fatal. 
  
 
As a result of this offence you have deprived a family of their son, brother, 
 
 
father and grandfather, and his many friends of their good friend – and the stress, 
 
anxiety and sheer desolation which this has caused cannot adequately be put into 
 
words, despite the very moving Victim Personal Statements that I have read. Their 
 
loss is indescribable – though several of them try to describe in terms of a massive 
 
 
void ‐ and their lives have been changed for ever. . 
    
 
That  serves  to  underline  the  seriousness  of  your  offence:  you  caused  the 
 
 
death of another man by an unlawful act of aggression. Having said that this is to be 
 
 
mitigated by the fact that this was very far from being either an unprovoked attack 
 
or one of any intensity, such as the attack which you launched on him in the earlier 
 
incident. It amounted to a single blow, struck in the heat of the moment when you 
 
had been faced with unexpected aggression which included the use of some, albeit 
 
relatively minor, force. 
  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Turning to the aggravating and mitigating factors of each offence: 
  
 
Both  offences,  as  your  learned  leading  counsel  has  rightly  accepted,  stem 
 
from the fact that, you had been drinking and whilst you were not completely drunk 
 
alcohol played its part in what you did. You have previous convictions, latterly for 
 
relatively minor offences, which were also fuelled by alcohol and whilst I keep your

I turn to the sentence which I am to pass. I bear in mind that I am sentencing 
 
 
you  for  two  separate  offences,  arising  from  two  separate  incidents,  which  I  am 
 
 
satisfied I must mark by passing consecutive sentences, although I must also do no 
 
more than pass the least sentence that I can to mark the total seriousness of your 
 
 
offending. 
 
 
Both  offences  are  offences  to  which  the  provisions  relating  to  dangerous 
 
 
offenders apply but, given the relatively low level of your offending since 1999, the 
 
facts of each of these offences and what I have read about you in two psychiatric 
 
reports  ‐ I pause to make it clear I have not considered it necessary, given all the 
 
information I have, to direct the preparation of a pre‐sentence report – I am satisfied 
 
that neither offence qualifies you for such a sentence. 
  
 
In relation to the first assault I have already indicated the category into which 
 
 
this  falls,  albeit  the  sentence  I  pass  will  reflect  the  aggravating  and  mitigating 
 
 
features to which I have referred. 
  
 

 
   

   
 

 
   

   

   

 
 

   

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

In relation to your offence of manslaughter, I have considered, with counsel, 
 
the case known as Appleby [the cases of R. v. Appleby and other defendants [2009] 
 
 
EWCA Crim 2693] in which the Lord Chief Justice gave guidance as to how offences 
 
of  manslaughter  committed  without  a  weapon  should  be  considered,  including 
 
offences where death is caused by a single punch often, as in this case, resulting in 
 
the victim falling to the ground with such force and in such a way that a fatal head 
 
injury is sustained. 
  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

In  that  case  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  stressed  the  seriousness  of  any  offence 
 
which involves causing the death of another person – which, in terms of harm, is at 
 
the highest level. He also pointed to the aggravating feature of many cases in which 
 
such  death  occurs  as  a  result  of  violence  in  the  street,  with  the  resulting  impact 
 
which that has on public confidence. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

 
 
 

 
In this case, whilst the harm which you did is at that level, your culpability – 
 
your wrongdoing – is mitigated by the fact that your act was not unprovoked but a 
 
response to aggression and, I am satisfied some level of physical force. Mr. Davis QC 
 
has invited me to put the level of sentence in your case into a similar bracket as that 
 
of the cases, within Appleby, of Bryan and Roberts, not least because the man who 
 
died in that case was not wholly without blame, although, there are a number of 
 
dissimilarities to your case, some better some worse. 
  
 
In relation to the offence of Manslaughter, for which there is not credit to be 
 
 
given for plea, taking account of all of the aggravating and mitigating features and

--------
also having in mind the level of sentences which are imposed for this type of offence, 
 
I sentence you to a term of 4 years’ imprisonment. 
 
  
 
In relation to the offence of Assault I must give you credit for your plea of 
 
 
guilty, entered on 23rd August of last year – 10 ½ months ago.  Were I sentencing you 
 
after a trial for this offence on its own, taking account of all of the aggravating and 
 
mitigating factors, but not your plea of guilty, I would sentence you to a term of 2 
 
years’ imprisonment. I would reduce that to give you full credit for your plea of guilty 
 
to a term of 16 months – and since I am to impose this sentence to run consecutively 
 
to your sentence of 4 years, and mindful of the totality of your offending and of the 
 
sentence, I reduce that to a sentence of 12 months – to run consecutively – making a 
 
total of 5 years imprisonment. 
 
 
Time served in custody will count towards your sentence automatically. I also 
 
 
certify that you have spent 506 days on remand on qualifying curfew and I direct 
 
that one half of that period – namely 253 days – will count towards your sentence.

Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
 

Lewis, Fellows and Geeling -v- R 

On Friday 16 December 2011 in the Crown Court at Wolverhampton, after a very 
 
lengthy  trial  before  His  Honour  Judge  Walsh  and  a  jury,  these  appellants  were 
convicted on count 2 of conspiracy to steal.  The verdicts were majority verdicts 
(10-2).  A co-defendant, Martin Knight, was acquitted.  The jury had not agreed 
their  verdict  on  count  1,  a  count  alleging  commission  of  a  similar  offence  at 
different dates by Lewis, Geeling, Simon Gray and Stephen Page. In due course, 
on 19 December, after further consideration, the jury were unable to agree their 
verdict, and accordingly they were discharged. 

The prosecution arose from the wholesale theft of many thousands of containers 
used  in  the  brewing  industry.  The  kegs,  sometimes  made  of  stainless  steel, 
sometimes of aluminium, and casks disappeared at an alarming rate.  The industry 
suffered very large losses. 

Accordingly, the major brewers set up their own organisation, intending initially 
to  try  and  retrieve  the  missing  kegs,  and  eventually  to  identify  and  investigate 
 
theft.  On 29 February 2008 a van load of kegs was observed while it was driven 
to  the  premises  of  Lewis  Baling  Services  Limited  (LBS).    The  police  were 
notified.  Ian Lewis is the owner of LBS.  Together with Geeling, Gray and Page 
he was subsequently charged with conspiracy to steal that load of kegs as count 1. 

Three days later, the police visited M & S Alloys Limited (M & S Alloys) and 
discovered a very large number of kegs there.  Fellows and Geeling were directors 
of  the  company.    Further  investigation revealed  that  M  &  S  Alloys  had  bought 
many tons of kegs from 2004 to 2008. Together with Lewis and Knight they were 
charged  on  count  2  with  a  similar  but  more  serious  conspiracy,  which  had 
continued for a long time and involved very significant quantities of kegs received 
by M & S Alloys and LBS and baled for onward disposal by LBS. 

Civil  proceedings  were  taken  in  the  High  Court  against  these  appellants,  and 
others for conversion of the kegs and conspiracy to steal.   The  claim  form  was 
 
served on the same day as they were charged with conspiracy to steal.  Damages 
of  £95m  were  sought.  This  action  was  settled  in  March  2011.    The  brewers 
withdrew  their  allegations  of  conspiracy  to  steal,  which  were  accordingly 
dismissed. 

The criminal trial began in late summer 2011.  Although Lewis and Geeling did 
 
not give evidence at trial, in essence the defence of the appellants was that having 
traded legitimately in the purchase of kegs, for onward sale to the scrap trade, they 
had  no  reason  to  suspect  and  did  not  suspect  that  the  kegs  which  they  handled 
 
were  stolen.  Therefore  the  essential  issues  during  the  13  week  long  trial  were 
whether  the  kegs  which  came  into  the  possession  of  the  appellants  had  been 
abandoned or sold on by the breweries, as the appellants suggested, and in any 
event whether the appellants had acted dishonestly in buying them. 

On 16 December, after the jury had returned their majority verdicts on count 2, in 
due course the jury retired for the weekend.  They were due to return to court on 
Monday, 19 December, to continue their deliberations on count 1.

As  we  now  know,  on  Saturday  17  December,  a  member  of  the  jury,  Steven 
Pardon,  went  to  Lewis’  premises,  and  asked  to  speak  to  him.    We  very  much 
 
doubt that this encounter was fortuitous.  When he did so, according to Lewis, he 
 
gave an account of matters he said had arisen during the course of the trial. He 
 
asserted that extraneous material had been looked at by one juror and spoken of by 
others. He believed that the members of the jury in the majority, or some of them, 
had acted unfairly and were biased against the defendants, and they put pressure 
on one of the jurors to change her mind and convict him.  According to Lewis, 
Pardon said that he “had convinced two of the others that you are innocent, they 
then  said  that  we  would  have  to  go  10-2,  at  this  point  they  managed  to  bash  a 
woman into submission and she was in tears over it”.  He said that the jury were 
 
jealous of the defendants and their trappings of wealth, and one or more of them 
 
had  searched  for  information  on  the  internet.  They  refused  to  look  at  the 
 
substantial body of documentary evidence because some had made up their mind 
during the first week of the trial. 

Lewis stated further, that Pardon told him that as a result of internet research the 
jury  knew  that  the  “Westwoods  were  involved”,  that  they  actively  disliked  his 
wife because she parked her Range Rover between two parking spaces in the car 
park,  and  were  jealous  of  him  because  they  thought  that  he  owned  an  Aston 
 
Martin which actually belonged to his brother.  He also said that Pardon spoke of 
one of the jurors as a “thieving little bastard” with previous convictions.  Pardon 
did not confirm these matters when interviewed. 

On the Monday morning, Lewis told the solicitor of this conversation and while 
the jury (including Pardon) continued their deliberations on count 1, the solicitor 
for Lewis informed the other parties and the judge.  While the information was 
 
being communicated to and being considered by the court, the jury sent a note to 
the  judge.  The  judge  indicated  to  counsel  that  the  jury  were  unable  to  reach  a 
majority verdict on count 1 in relation to any of the four defendants.  After hearing 
submissions, the judge decided that the jury should be discharged. 

 

11.	  We do not know how the jury was divided, but it follows that in relation to count 
1,  at  least  three  of  them  must  have  been  clear  in  their  own  minds  that  the 
 
appropriate verdict was “not guilty”.  More important in the present context, they 
 
were  prepared  to  stand  by  and  return  verdicts  in  accordance  with  their 
consciences.  The same jury had, as we noted earlier, acquitted Knight on count 2. 

Thereafter, the judge sought guidance from the Court of Appeal about the correct 
approach to Pardon’s activities.  At much the same time, on 19 December, Pardon 
approached  the  workplace  of  Geeling.    On  this  occasion  there  was  no 
conversation.  He was simply turned away. 

 

On 22 December the parties were informed that there would be an investigation 
by the West Midlands Police.  On 13 January 2012 Pardon was interviewed by the 
West  Midlands  Police.  On  26  June  the  Divisional  Court  gave  the  Attorney 
 
General leave to bring committal proceedings against him for contempt of court. 
  
On 8 November in the course of the committal proceedings, Pardon accepted that 
he was in contempt of court.

In his affidavit in the contempt proceedings, Pardon did not agree that he had said 
all the things attributed to him by Lewis.  Thus he denied having claimed other 
 
jurors “managed to bash a woman into submission and she was in tears over it”, in 
deciding  that  Lewis  should  be  convicted,  but  asserted  that  this  happened  in  the 
context of the conviction of Fellows.  He denied having told Lewis that “the jury 
had  checked  on  all  the  defendants  and  knew”  this  and  that  “about  them”.    He 
denied telling Lewis that he was convicted because he had an established business 
with Jaguar, or that he was convicted “because he had not gone into the witness 
box”.  He also denied having commented to Lewis about other jurors.  What he 
 
asserted  was  that  he  had  spoken  to  Lewis  because  he  felt  that  improper 
considerations  had  informed  the  verdicts  on  count  2.    He  was  particularly 
concerned that one member of the jury had carried out research on the internet and 
had told the rest of the jury what he had discovered.  He was also concerned that a 
female  juror  had,  to  his  mind,  been  bullied  into  the  guilty  verdict.
  After 
considering  matters  raised  in  mitigation,  he  was  sentenced  to  4  months 
imprisonment. 

 
15.	 

Directly after Pardon was sentenced a directions hearing took place before the full 
Court of Appeal.  The court directed that the Criminal Cases Review Commission 
(CCRC) should be supplied with the police interview with Mr Pardon, together 
with a copy of the affidavit made by him in the course of the contempt of court 
proceedings, and asked to carry out investigations of the jury:  

 

 
a)	 

 
b)	 

to explore any extraneous material which was used and considered 
by the jury in reaching its verdict.  

to  explore  whether  any  extraneous  material  was  derived  from  the 
internet, and if so to identify it. 

 
16.	 

 
17.	 

The CCRC has now produced the report in response to the requests made by the 
court.  Given  the  sensitivities  which  surround  any  enquiry  into  or  about  or  in 
connection with the deliberations of a jury, investigations of this kind are far from 
 
straightforward.  We  are  grateful  to  the  CCRC  for  the  obvious  care  which 
characterised the investigation. 

The question which arises for decision is whether the safety of the convictions is 
undermined as a result of jury misconduct or material irregularities. In essence it 
is submitted that some of the jury may have repudiated their oaths and may have 
taken account of extraneous material in reaching their verdicts.  Leave to appeal 
on this ground was granted by the full court.  The single judge refused leave to 
appeal  on  a  number  of  remaining  grounds,  and  some  of  them  are  renewed  by 
Fellows and Geeling. 

 

18.	  We were not asked to and we did not examine whether what Pardon admittedly 
 
said to Lewis, or the contents of the interview with Pardon in the course of the 
 
contempt  proceedings,  or  his  affidavit  in  mitigation  of  the  contempt,  were 
inadmissible for the purposes of these appeals.  To that extent the normally rigid 
prohibition on disclosure of jury discussions, at any rate as admitted by Pardon in 
 
the contempt proceedings, has been circumvented.  This is an unusual situation, 
and in future contempt proceedings the possible consequences of public reference 
to any matters which come within the proper ambit of the deliberations of the jury
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

Lewis, Fellows and Geeling -v- R 

will  have  to  be  handled  with  great  circumspection.    It  does  not  take  much 
imagination  to  see  how  a  professional  criminal  might  seek  to  undermine  a  trial 
which  had  resulted  in  his  conviction.  In  the  particular  circumstances  we  have 
decided  that  the  correct  way  to  approach  the  assertions  made  by  Pardon  is  to 
examine  them  de  bene  esse,  underlining  that  nothing  decided  in  this  appeal  is 
intended, nor could it, undermine the principles identified by the House of Lords 
 
in R v Mirza; R v Connor and Rollock [2004] 1 AC 1118. 

 
19.	 

The jury questionnaire began by reciting the instructions received by the CCRC. 
 
The terms of s.8 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 were explained.  Each juror 
was told that the questions simply related to the use of “information that did not 
form part of the evidence was given to the jury”  

 
20.	 

It is unnecessary to set out all the questions.  However question 1 read: 

“(a)  Were  you  aware  of  any  juror  having  access  to  the 
internet during the course of the trial? 
 

(b)  Was  any  material  or  other  information  derived  from 
newspapers  or  the  internet  or  any  sources  other  than  the 
evidence given at the trial provided to you as a member of 
the jury by another jury or by anyone else? 

(c) Did you obtain any material or other information from 
newspapers of the internet or any other sources? 
 

(d) Was the issue or potential of accessing information from 
the  news  or  internet  or  any  other  source  discussed  by  the 
members of the jury at any time during the trial’s process? 
 

(e) Was the jury given instruction regarding accessing the 
internet, or additional information, other than that presented 
in  evidence?    What  was  your  understanding  of  those 
 
instructions?” 

 
21.	 

The results of the investigation can be briefly summarised:  

(a)  Nine  members  of  the  jury  positively  stated  that  they  did  not  obtain  any 
 
information about the case from the internet, the press or any other source, and 
 
that they were not aware of any other juror having obtained any information about 
the case from any such source. 

(b) One of these nine jurors mentioned that early in the trial, one of the female 
jurors  mentioned  that  a  florist  had  said  to  her,  when  she  said  she  was  on  jury 
service, that he knew one of the defendants who had been “getting away with it 
for years”.  The juror reporting this conversation said that as far as he could tell, 
the juror had not told the florist about the jury on which she was serving, and he 
did not believe that the remarks were intended to influence her.  Indeed whether 
 
the  florist  was  referring  to  one  of  the  present  appellants,  or  to  one  of  the  other 
defendants tried with him or indeed this trial, is open to some question.  If this

Lewis, Fellows and Geeling -v- R 

reported  conversation  had  been  of  any  significance,  it  would  presumably  have 
 
been reported by Pardon. 

(c)(i) Juror A (as described by the CCRC) said that at some point during the trial, 
 
but before the jury retired, two male jurors spoke about looking at the internet to 
see if a female relative, the daughter or wife, of one of the defendants appeared on 
it.  These  jurors  were  identified  by  her  as  Steven  Pardon  himself  and  juror  C. 
 
Interestingly  Pardon  did  not  refer  to  his  participation  in  this  conversation,  nor 
refer to the possibility that he himself had used the internet.  Juror A did not know 
whether  either  of  them  had  actually  looked  for  or  at  the  internet.    She  did  not 
remember the men saying “why they were looking or indeed whether they actually 
did so or not”. She did not suggest that she heard any conversation based on the 
internet.  She  also  recollected  that  the  two  men  had  I-phones  and  that  they 
regularly  used  the  internet  on  these  at  lunchtimes.    As  to  the  conversation  she 
described,  she  did  not  remember  whether  anyone  else  was  present  when  she 
overheard it.  She commented that Pardon was “bit of a joker … saying things that 
were untrue”. 

(ii) She ended her statement by reporting that at one stage during the deliberations, 
she had at one point become “tearful and emotional”, but added that she did not 
feel “bullied by anyone”.  She was simply “feeling the pressure of the long trial”.  

(iii) This juror observed that she had seen a news report in the Express and Star on 
the internet during the trial and saw something about a previous case, but added 
that  she  did  not  read  it.    She  said  that  they  had  been  told  that  if  they  saw  any 
reports about the case they could tell their family that they were sitting on it, but 
that they should say no more. 

(iv) We have been shown a copy of what is believed to be the relevant article in 
the Express and Star.  We have read it.  Under the headline “Twelve Sent for Trial 
 
Over  Beer  Thefts  Plot”,  it  showed  photographs  of  twelve  men  (including  these 
defendants) who were accused of stealing beer kegs in the Black Country and set 
out their identities and the charges.  It recorded that the prosecution was seeking 
trial at the Crown Court, and bail was granted to them all.   This report can have 
 
had no bearing on the issues for decision in this appeal. 

(d) Juror C was specifically questioned about the matters raised by juror A about 
 
possible  misuse  of  the  internet.    He  stated  that  he  had  not  obtained  any 
information from the internet, the press or any other source, and he was not aware 
of any other juror having done so.  He had not had any discussion about looking 
up the wife or daughter of any of the defendants on Facebook.  He had not read 
about the case on the website.  Indeed he said that “people were saying that they 
had not seen the case in the paper”.  That was one of the ladies sitting behind him, 
 
but he could not remember which of them it was.  He added that he saw Pardon 
out of court, “just by chance” and he knew that Pardon caught the tram to travel 
into court with the defendants who did not drive to court, a source of amusement 
to Pardon. 

 

Pardon refused to co-operate with the Criminal Cases Review Commission.  He 
 
has made no further statements over and above those obtained and submitted in 
the contempt proceedings.

It is also clear from his affidavit that Pardon remembered that the jury had been 
directed not to discuss the details of the case with anyone outside their number, 
nor to visit any of the sites or locations mentioned during the trial.  They were also 
directed that if they had any concerns relating to the trial “or our colleagues”, they 
 
should be drawn to the attention of the jury bailiff. 

 

Standing back, the simple reality is that Pardon disagreed with the guilty verdict. 
He was one of the dissentients.  Notwithstanding the clear directions by the judge, 
and his recollection of these directions, none of the concerns he made about his 
fellow jurors was reported by him to the judge.  He confined his comments about 
the jury to Lewis, and someone who was with Lewis at the time.  He returned to 
court  on  the  Monday  morning  to  resume  deliberations  on  count  1.    Although 
Judge  Walsh  complied  with  the  requirement  that  jurors  should  be  directed  to 
report  any  irregularities  during  the  course  of  the  trial  itself,  and  Pardon 
appreciated the meaning of his direction, even then, before the jury resumed its 
deliberations,  he  did  not  disclose  any  of  the  anxieties  said  to  be  playing  on  his 
 
conscience to the jury bailiff or to the judge. 

 

Given  the  clear  instructions  which  are  now  given  to  juries,  and  obviously  were 
given to this jury, a post verdict complaint by a member of the jury, whether it 
takes the form of a letter or a visit to the solicitors for the defendant or indeed a 
visit to the defendant himself, simply will not do. As Gage LJ remarked in R v 
Adams [2007] 1 Cr. App. R 34, “Silence as to any such irregularity will … almost 
 
certainly  mean  that  this  court  will  assume  that  none  occurred”.    In  view  of  the 
 
additional  directions  given  since  Adams  was  decided,  the  inference  that 
complaints  after  verdicts  simply  represent  a  protest  by  a  juror  at  a  verdict  with 
which he disagrees is likely to be overwhelming.  As the court observed in R v 
 
Thompson and Others [2010] 2 Cr. App. R27: 

“We  acknowledge  the  danger  that  a  juror  who  is  in  a 
minority may be disturbed at his or her failure to persuade 
the other jurors to his or her point of view, and where the 
majority  has  convicted,  to  the  sensitivity  of  a  dissenting 
juror that an injustice may have been done.  Once the juror 
is  in  that  frame  of  mind,  perfectly  ordinary  events  can  be 
perceived as suspicious.” 

 
26.	 

In this case, for example, Pardon reported in fairly dramatic terms that a female 
 
juror  had  been  bullied  into  changing  her  mind.    We  now  know  that  a  female 
member of the jury did indeed cry, but the cause was not bullying, but the stress of 
the trial, and her responsibilities as a juror.  In our view it seems clear that Pardon 
was not prepared to accept the decision conscientiously reached by ten jurors, and 
at  best,  he  persuaded  himself  that  their  decision  could  only  be  explained  by 
discreditable  conduct  by  one  or  more  of  them.  In  short,  the  entire  basis  of  this 
 
appeal depends on post trial assertions by one juror, which are unsupported in any 
material respect. 

 

27.	  We do not know which of the eleven jurors other than Pardon disagreed with the 
majority verdict on count 2, nor the jurors who were unable to agree to a guilty 
 
verdict on count 1.  We do know however that the jury as a whole acquitted one of 
the  defendants  in  count  2,  and  that  at  least  three  members  of  the  jury  were  not
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

Lewis, Fellows and Geeling -v- R 

prepared  to  convict  any  one  of  the  four  defendants  in  count  1.    Although  an 
attempt was made on behalf of the appellants to find a distinction between the two 
counts on the indictment, not least in terms of the relative gravity of count 2 when 
considered  against  count  1,  these  counts  were  tried  together,  and  however  one 
 
looks  at  it,  if  the  jury  was  improperly  biased  when  reaching  guilty  verdicts  on 
count  2,  it  is  surprising,  to  put  it  at  its  lowest,  that  one  of  the  defendants  was 
acquitted  on  that  count,  and  perhaps  more  important,  that  so  far  as  Lewis  and 
Geeling were concerned, precisely the same bias did not carry over to its verdicts 
on count 1. 

 
28.	 

 
29.	 

Finally, it is absolutely clear that whichever juror was in the minority on count 2 
and  all  those  jurors  who  were  for  acquittal  on  count  1,  none  has  made  any 
complaint or raised concerns about the conduct of other members of the jury. 

The  end  result  of  considering  all  this  material  in  the  overall  context  is  that  we 
have no reason to doubt that the appellants were properly convicted, and that this 
ground of appeal should be rejected. 

Renewed applications 

 
30.	 

Fellows and Geeling renew their applications for leave to appeal on some of the 
Grounds on which the single Judge refused leave. 

The acquittal of  Westwoods   ( Fellows Ground 2, Geeling Ground 4 ) 

 
31.	 

 
32.	 

 
33.	 

Paul Westwood and Mark Westwood were directors of Cronimet which received 
baled keg material. They had originally been Defendants in count 2. After they 
belatedly disclosed a goods in book which recorded all the baled kegs received by 
Cronimet the prosecution reviewed the case  and decided not to continue against 
them.  They formally offered no evidence and not guilty verdicts were entered. 

On  behalf  of  Fellows  and  Geeling  it  was  sought  to  adduce  evidence  of  those 
acquittals.  They  were  relevant,  first  because  the  prosecution    had,  until  their 
change of heart, maintained that the Westwoods knew that M and S Alloys  had 
been buying stolen kegs and second, because  the Westwoods were, evidentially, 
in a similar position to Fellows and Geeling.  

Those arguments have been repeated and developed before us by Mr Vickers and 
Mr Nicholls. It is apparent from paragraph 2.3 of Mr Vickers’ skeleton argument 
 
that  the  defence  were  reluctant  to  call  the  Westwoods  because  the  prosecution 
would have been “ able to cross examine them in such a way that could lead to the 
assertion  that  they  did  in  fact  know  what  was  going  on  all  along”.    The 
prosecution was invited to make it clear to the Jury that the words “ together and 
 
with others” in the particulars of the count did not refer to the Westwoods. They 
did so. 

 

 
34.	 

The single Judge in refusing leave said:  

“The Judge ruled against the admission of such evidence in 
a  ruling  given  on  3  October  2011.  The  prosecution  had 
made it clear that they no longer alleged that the applicants

the 
Westwoods,  and  that  it  was  therefore  for  the  Jury  to 
determine whether each of the applicants was involved in a 
criminal conspiracy with one or more of his co defendants 
and 
the 
Westwoods.  He  therefore  concluded  that  the  fact  that 
verdicts  of  not  guilty  had  been  recorded  in  relation  to  the 
Westwoods at his direction was not relevant to the issues to 
be determined by the Jury.” 

/  or  persons  unknown,  but  not 

including 

He concluded: 

“Neither the acquittal of the Westwoods, nor the reasons for 
their acquittal were relevant to the issues to be determined 
 
by the Jury. The evidence was properly excluded.” 

With those observations we agree.  

Settlement of civil proceedings (Fellows and Geeling Ground 3 )   

 
35.	 

 
36.	 

The  proceedings  brought  by  five  UK  brewers  against  defendants  including 
Cronimet, the Westwoods, M and S Alloys, Lewis, Fellows and Geeling included 
claims  in  conversion  and  conspiracy  to  steal.  They  were  settled  on  terms  not 
disclosed on the face of the Consent Order, but of which the Judge was informed. 
He set those out in his ruling. It was argued that the fact that the claimants had 
settled the claims against Cronimet and M and S Alloys for a small percentage of 
the sum claimed and the claimants had withdrawn the allegation of conspiracy to 
steal  were  matters  that  should  be  adduced  before  the  Jury.  In  addition  it  was 
contended  they  had  argued  against  M  and  S  Alloys  paying  any  contribution 
towards the settlement, but had been forced to agree by the Westwoods. 

The  single  Judge  said  “There  may  be  many  reasons  why  civil  proceedings  are 
compromised prior to trial, and in my judgement, the fact of settlement and the 
limited information as to the terms of settlement and the reasons for the settlement 
can provide the Jury with no assistance in determining the issues which lie at the 
heart of the criminal trial. The fact that an allegation of conspiracy to steal is not 
pursued in civil proceedings cannot be relevant or admissible as evidence in the 
 
criminal trial here”.  Once again, we agree with the reasoning of the Judge. 

Admissibility of Bowater evidence 

The  next  submission,  made  on  behalf  of  Geeling,  is  that  the  judge  erred  in 
refusing to allow the defence to call Edward Bowater to give evidence.  

Edward  Bowater  was  a  VAT  tax  specialist  employed  by  HM  Revenue  and 
Customs.  The  prosecution  had  obtained  a  witness  statement  from  him  dated  22 
September  2011.  In  it,  he  stated  that  in  2008  he  was  part  of  a  team  of  tax 
inspectors who were asked to look at the tax returns from M and S Alloys as part 
of  a  Revenue  project  looking  at  the  scrap  metal  industry  as  a  whole. 
Documentation  was  examined  for  one  quarter  ending  December  2008.  Queries 
were raised in relation to a number of companies to whom M and S Alloys had

paid  VAT.  Six  companies  were  specifically  identified.  Two  of  the  companies 
were regarded by HMRC as “missing trader” companies which, as VAT registered 
companies, had failed to complete VAT returns and enquiries had failed to locate 
the owners of the company. Two others had been dissolved in October 2006. A 
fifth had become insolvent in May 2007 and had previously been regarded as a 
“missing  trader”.  After  consideration,  a  letter  had  been  sent  to  M  and  S  Alloys 
stating that no further action would be taken in relation to transactions with these 
companies. The letter was not intended to imply that the dealings that M and S 
Alloys had had with the companies had been legitimate.  

It  is  contended  that  a  major  part  of  the  prosecution  case  involved  paperwork 
 
purporting to show purchases of scrap between 2004 and 2008 by M and S Alloys 
from eleven different companies which did not exist and the paperwork had been 
falsified to conceal an illicit trade in kegs. Evidence in the case established suspect 
features of the eleven companies relating to their trading activities including false 
 
trading addresses, the nomination of directors without their knowledge and the use 
of delivery vehicles with false registration plates. Most of the eleven companies 
could be traced to a company formation agent in Scunthorpe. Geeling submitted 
that the contents of the Bowater statement supported the defence proposition that 
the  suspect  features  were  consistent  with  a  missing  trader  fraud  rather  than  an 
involvement  in  the  count  two  conspiracy.  Upon  the  prosecution  not  calling  the 
witness, the judge ruled that the defence could not call him on the ground that it 
was inadmissible.  

In response, the prosecution explained that the Bowater statement was obtained at 
a late stage of the preparation of the case solely as a precaution to deal with an 
allegation raised in the absence of the jury by counsel for Fellows that M and S 
Alloys had been given a clean bill of health during a VAT inspection. It was the 
prosecution contention that whether or not M and S Alloys had been given a clean 
bill of health during such an inspection was irrelevant to the issues that had to be 
decided. Nonetheless, the statement was obtained to rebut evidence that might be 
 
adduced by Fellows and/or Geeling that M and S Alloys had been given a clean 
bill of health.   

Further, the prosecution dispute the contention as to how the case was presented. 
In  accordance  with  the  opening,  it  was  presented  on  the  basis  of  the  eleven 
companies  not  existing  as  viable  trading  companies  at  the  time  they  were 
allegedly selling metal to M and S Alloys. The possibility that a purpose of the 
 
eleven companies may have been solely to facilitate a missing trader fraud was 
not something suggested in Geeling’s defence statement. It was not raised in his 
evidence  because  he  chose  not  to  give  evidence.  At  its  highest,  it  was  a  theory 
raised  after  the  Bowater  statement  was  served  and  on  the  limited  information 
within  that  statement.  In  this  context,  the  Bowater  evidence  was  irrelevant  and 
 
inadmissible. 

 
42.	 

In his ruling of 30 November 2011, the judge refused to allow the defence to call 
 
Bowater on the basis that he was not satisfied that his evidence was admissible or 
relevant.  We  share  the  single  judge’s  conclusion  that  the  trial  judge’s  decision 
does not give rise to any arguable ground of appeal.  The single judge was correct. 

Disclosure of a BDO Forensic Accountancy Report
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

Lewis, Fellows and Geeling -v- R 

The next submission, on behalf of Fellows is that the judge erred in refusing to 
order disclosure by the prosecution of a forensic accountancy report prepared by 
BDO  Stoy  Hayward  in  the  civil  proceedings.  In  the  course  of  submissions,  Mr 
 
Vickers  conceded  that  this  was  not  the  strongest  of  grounds  and  presented  his 
argument on the basis that it could be considered as part of a cumulative effect 
when considering the overall safety of the conviction.   

The defence argued before the judge that BDO Stoy Hayward had been instructed 
to  prepare  a  forensic  accountancy  report  into  the  business  dealings  of  M  and  S 
Alloys and Croninet by Wragge and Co, solicitors acting for the claimants in the 
 
civil  action.  It  was  said  to  be  potentially  relevant  because  it  was  a  forensic 
accountant’s  report  into  the  defendant’s  business.  The  prosecution  should  have 
looked  at  the  report  and  should  have  made  a  decision  whether  it  contained 
anything in it that required its disclosure to the defence.  

The  response  was  that  the  report  was  not  in  the  possession  of  the  prosecution. 
Enquiries had been made of Wragge and Co and the prosecution informed that the 
report  had  been  prepared  for  the  purpose  of  assisting  with  the  drafting  of  the 
particulars of claim in the civil case, in particular the assessment of quantum. It 
 
was therefore a privileged document. It had not been prepared for the purpose of 
considering  the  business  dealings  of  and  trade  in  kegs  by  M  and  S  Alloys.  For 
these reasons, its disclosure would not be sought. If the defence wanted a copy of 
the report, a third party application could be made for its production.   

On 25 October 2011, the judge ruled that the report was not in the possession of 
the prosecution and, in any event, there were no reasonable grounds or cause for 
believing that the report contained material that either undermined the prosecution 
case  or  assisted  the  defence  case.  Accordingly,  he  dismissed  the  section  8 
 
application  made  by  the  defence.  He  added  that  it  was  of  course  open  to  the 
parties to make a third party application if they saw fit.  None was made.  

Notwithstanding the renewed oral submissions by Mr Vickers, we agree with the 
single judge’s conclusion that the judge’s ruling is unimpeachable.  

The renewed applications are refused. 

These appeals against conviction are dismissed.

The sentence for murder is Life Imprisonment but I have to decide the length of the 
 
 
minimum term you must serve. 
 
 
Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides that if the court considers the 
 
seriousness  of  the  offence  is  exceptionally  high,  the  appropriate  starting  point 
 
should be a whole life order and that the cases which would normally fall within that 
 
category include the murder of a child which involves the abduction of the child or 
 
sexual  or  sadistic  motivation.  While  I  am  satisfied  that  the  seriousness  of  your 
 
offending is exceptionally high, I must nonetheless consider whether a substantial 
 
minimum term, in excess of a starting point of 30 years, would be sufficient to reflect 
 
 
the gravity of these offences. 
 
 
For the last four weeks, the court has listened to compelling evidence of your guilt, 
 
evidence  which  has  also  demonstrated  that  you  are  a  pathological  and  glib  liar. 
 
There  is  no  doubt  in  my  mind  that  you  are  a  paedophile  who  has  for  some  time 
 
harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls, storing on your laptop not 
 
 
only  images of pre‐pubescent and pubescent girls, but foul pornography of the gross 
 
 
sexual abuse of young children. 
 
 
What prompted you on Monday 1st  October to live out one of those fantasies is a 
 
matter for speculation but it may have been the combination of the ending of one 
 
sexual relationship and your drinking. Whatever, you set out to find a little girl to 
 
abuse. I am not sure you targeted April specifically – it was probably fortuitous that 
 
she can be seen on some of the images, which you stored on your laptop, of her 
 
older sister – but you were on the prowl for a young girl. 
 
 

 
   
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
April would not have been afraid of you partly because you have some charm and 
 
she may well have seen you about the estate and probably because you let her know 
 
your  son  was  a  friend  of  her  brother  (just  as  you  had  tried  to  charm  her  sister, 
 
[redacted]* into allowing you to be her Facebook friend by mentioning your links to 
 
her parents). And so it was that innocently and trustingly, April got into your land 
 
 
rover smiling and happy. 
 
  
What followed is known only to you but this much is certain – you abducted her for a 
 
sexual  purpose  and  then  murdered  her  and  disposed  of  her  body  to  hide  the 
 
evidence of your sexual abuse of her, which probably occurred on the way from the 
 
estate to your home because there is some 60 minutes of your time which cannot be 
 
 
accounted for. 
 
 
I cannot infer from the evidence where you murdered her but if she was alive when 
 
 
you took her to the house, she died there. 
 
  
How you disposed of her body must remain a mystery. It will serve no purpose for 
 
me to speculate as to what happened but all the indications are that you burnt at 
 
least a part of her in the wood burner. 
 
  
The grief of April’s parents cannot be over‐stated. They lived with the torment of a 
 
missing  daughter,  praying that  she  would  be  found  alive  and  then,  following  your 
 
arrest, with the knowledge that you were providing the police with no assistance at 
 
all  as  to  her  whereabouts.  To  add  to  that  torment,  they  have  had  to  endure  the 
 
spectacle of your hypocritical sympathy for their loss and of your tears, flowing not 
 
because of any regret for your crimes, but because of your enduring self pity. 
 
  
Without the knowledge of what happened to April, her parents will probably never 
 
come  to  terms  with  their  grievous  loss,  described  so  eloquently  in  the  Impact 
 
Statement.  It  is  to  be  hoped,  for  their  sakes,  for  the  sakes  of  [redacted]*  and 
 
[redacted]*  and  for  the  sakes  of  all  those  who  mourn  April,  that  the  verdicts  will 
 
 
bring some measure of closure. 
   
 
Your offences were aggravated by their premeditation and by the destruction of at 
 
least  a  part  of  her  body  and  the  concealment  of  the  rest.  It  is  also  a  relevant 
 
consideration  that  you  not  only  abducted  April  with  a  sexual  motive  but  then 
 
 
sexually abused her in some way. 
  
 
While I have had regard to the absence of any relevant conviction, I have no doubt 
 
there can be only one sentence – 
 
 
For  the  offence  of  murder,  I  sentence  you  to Life  Imprisonment  with  a  whole  life 
 
order.  There will be no separate penalties on Counts 1 & 3.

2225562,R v David Minto,"The Crown Court at Preston 

Regina v David Minto 

Sentencing Remarks of His Honour Judge Russell QC, Recorder of Preston 

26 July 2013 

 

 

David Minto: You have been convicted by the jury, on overwhelming evidence, of the murder of 
Sasha Marsden, a 16 year old girl who you lured to your hotel in Blackpool on the pretext of giving 
her a job as a cleaner, but your real motive was the sexual one to which the evidence points so 
clearly. 
 
In September of 2012 you met Sasha by chance because she was a friend of a friend of yours, Kim 
Phizacklea. After meeting Kim Phizacklea with Sasha you indecently assaulted Kim when you got the 
opportunity – she rebuffed your attentions and thereafter you persistently tried to arrange another 
meeting with her. It was when she finally brushed you off that you immediately, within minutes, 
turned your attentions to Sasha by contacting her on Facebook and arranging for her to come to your 
hotel on Monday 28th January on the pretext of the cleaning job. Arrangements were made for her 
to return on the Thursday 31st January and she did so. 
 
At your hotel you murdered her in the most brutal fashion. She was stabbed repeatedly on the head 
and neck. It was a ferocious and sustained attack as illustrated by the number of stab and slash 
wounds, in excess of 50, the fact that there were defence type injuries, sustained as Sasha tried to 
fight you off and the fact that the bone of the skull was scored, indicating considerable force. She 
was sexually violated at or immediately before or after the death as indicated by the medical findings 
of Dr Armour the pathologist, both vaginally and anally. 
 
I am not going to repeat the details of this horrific incident – they have been gone through over the 
past two weeks of the trial and it is unnecessary to do so. 
 
However, after the terrible attack your depravity continued in the way in which you dealt with 
Sasha’s body, trying to destroy it by fire as you so obviously did, despite your protestations to the 
contrary. You also attempted to conceal what you had done by cleaning the scene to some extent 
and washing your clothing. Further as the prosecution were able to demonstrate so clearly you have 
throughout the investigation not only lied, but sought to cover your tracks and then tailor your 
account to deal with each new piece of evidence pointing in your direction as it was revealed to you. 
You have shown a degree of low cunning, but it was easily seen through.  
 
I will summarise the aggravating features of which there are several when I come to set the minimum 
term you must serve.
--------
Sasha Marden was an attractive 16 year old girl with the prospect of a happy and successful life 
ahead of her. She had taken up studying child care. She came from a close and hitherto happy family 
and had a nice boyfriend who gave evidence during the trial. You have not only destroyed the life on 
one human being in a most brutal way, but your cruelty has devastated her loving parents and family 
and friends. I have read a most moving account from Sasha’s mother and father which says that each 
wound you inflicted upon Sasha has stabbed at the heart of each and every one of her family. 
 
Despite the overwhelming evidence against you, you contested this trial, with a defence that was so 
preposterous that as they listened to it, not only did the members of Sasha’s family have to suffer 
the ordeal of learning the full detail and relive the events which they describe as horrendous, but 
they must have listened with mounting incredulity as the evidence unfurled and as your attempts to 
brush off your responsibility emerged. As they so accurately put it, Sasha’s parents have had to listen 
to how their youngest child was subjected to the most degrading and foul acts that any person could 
impose on another human being.  Their statement reads: “These things will haunt us for the rest of 
our lives.” 
 
I wish to pay tribute to the family and friends of Sasha who have been present in court throughout 
this trial. Their dignity in the face of this ordeal has been an example to us all. The trial has been 
distressing for us all and for the jury but the agony for this family is in my judgement exceptional 
even given some of the terrible crimes which have been tried in this court. 
 
You, David Minto, are aged 23. You have no significant criminal history. You are not suffering from 
any mental disorder which could explain your conduct or mitigate the offence in any way. There is a 
record of your having suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 1996 and that you had 
some psychiatric problems as a child. However in 2005 it is documented that there were no 
symptoms of ADHD and whilst suffering from depression at that time you were discharged from 
psychiatric care in 2006. 
 
There is no mitigation and I am satisfied that an intention to kill has been established in this case. 
 
You have displayed a complete absence of remorse. There is not a shred of common humanity in 
you. You are, in my judgement a very dangerous and evil man. 
 
The sentence for murder is fixed by Law – accordingly the sentence of the Court for this offence is 
Life Imprisonment.   
 
Whether you are released after the minimum term I am about to set will be for others to decide, and 
you may well be kept in prison for the rest of your life, but if you are ever released you will remain 
subject to licence provisions and eligible to be recalled to prison for the whole of your life. 
 
I do not consider that the criteria to justify a whole life order have been established. 
 
I must therefore consider the part of that life sentence which should be served before you are 
eligible to apply for early release. In my judgement the seriousness of this offence is particularly high 
and I have come to the conclusion that the appropriate starting point for setting the minimum term 
to be served, having regard to the provisions of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, is 30 
years 
 
My reasons are as follows: 
 

Page 2 of 3
--------
This was a case involving sexual conduct within the meaning of Paragraph 5 (2) (e) of the schedule. 
The evidence of Dr Armour the pathologist was to the effect that at the time of or shortly after death 
there was penetration of the vagina and anus with a penis sized object. 
 
I have identified the following aggravating features from paragraph 10 of the schedule. There was 
premeditation or planning, not of the murder itself but of luring this girl to your hotel for your sexual 
purposes and gratification. She was a vulnerable victim by reason of her age. Considerable physical 
suffering was inflicted before her death, as is clear from the nature and extent of the injuries which 
include defence injuries. There was an abuse of trust because you lured her to the hotel on the 
pretext of giving her a cleaning job. Finally after her death you tried to destroy her body.  
 
Taking these factors into account and the complete absence of any mitigation, because I am satisfied 
that an intention to kill has been proved, the sentence of the court for the offence of murder is Life 
Imprisonment of which you must serve a minimum of  35 years before being eligible to apply to the 
authorities for parole. Put another way that means that you will not be able to apply for release until 
the year 2048. 
 
Take him down.

ENGLAND AND WALES
R v Tony McLernon
Chelmsford Crown Court
6 March 2013
Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Fulford

This incident, brutal and terrible in itself, must be put in its true context, and that is that you have an
undoubted capacity to act violently and dangerously towards others and particularly young women
with whom you have a sexual relationship, whether or not under the influence of alcohol. The
evidence from Kimberly Mitchell and Jessica Matthews, together with the history of your relationship
with the deceased, has vividly demonstrated the troubling way in which you control, dominate,
degrade, bully and finally attack women in these circumstances. I found the evidence called by the
prosecution on this issue compelling, and your behaviour has demonstrated a consistent pattern
over many years, but it is not limited to women as the attack on James Abinger last year vividly
revealed.
As long ago as 2004 you attacked Kimberly Mitchell when you were 15 and 14 respectively. Over the
2 years of your relationship with her you prevented her from seeing her friends and she practically
ceased going to school, you undermined her self—confidence and self esteem, you assaulted her
violently and you threatened her with knives. The assaults included punching her, stamping or
treading on her head and holding knives against her body in a terrifying way. In 2006 your violence
resulted in a hairline fracture to herjaw and bad bruising to her face. You even hit her inside a police
station, causing her head to bounce off a glass partition. You threatened Jessica Matthews, another
of your girlfriends, with a knife in Oct 2007, when you ordered her to knees and told her that you
would stab her ifshe moved, having placed the knife, more than once, against her stomach. The
police who arrested you witnessed this incident. You repeatedly punched James Abinger’s head,
whilst holding him down, because he contradicted you. You repeatedly and brutally assaulted Eystna
Blunnie during the course of your relationship and her friends and family frequently saw very bad
bruising to her upper body, of which she was ashamed and tried to hide and about which you
persuaded her lie, particularly by suggesting it was the result of play fighting. It would seem that Dr
Locke and Dr Abou—El—Fadl are undoubtedly correct when they describe you as having an emotionally
unstable personality disorder which is characterised, amongst other things, by displays of extreme
anger and rage. However, the medical profession has evaluated you over the years on the basis of
only a partial history, because the doctors have been unaware of the extent of the violence I have
just described and you lied significantly to Dr Abou—El—Fadl about the course of your relationship with
Eystna Blunnie, to say nothing of the circumstances of her death. You falsely blamed her for
everything and you failed to reveal the repeated violence you visited on her, together with way you
controlled and bullied her.
You repeatedly indicated that you wanted Eystna Blunnie significantly harmed or killed. In April you
strangled her with such force she thought you were going to kill her and her baby started reacting in
distress. It is likely she only survived because your parents intervened. On 3 May 2012 you sent a text
--------
message to Jo Bishop stating ”I want someonejust kick the shit out of her 'n leave me alone"". On 23
June you sent two particular text messages, the first stated ”I swear I'm going prison Monday My
ex is proper tying to ruin my relationship with my girl” and the second ""I Fucking swear bro I’m gonna
knife Eystna soon She's proper ruining my relationship I!” When E was 7 months pregnant Natasha
Turner heard you tell the deceased that she and her child would not make it full term and in June
2012 you sent Eystna a text telling her she would not make it through her pregnancy.
This was not, therefore, a spontaneous offence which was the result of an unthinking moment of
anger but instead you had contemplated her death and the destruction of your child over a long
period of time. The text messages reveal the unrelenting emotional pressure which you brought to
bear on her to meet you in the early hours of the morning in a relatively deserted place,
notwithstanding the fact that she felt ill and was about to give birth. They also demonstrate that
notwithstanding the alcohol you had consumed, you knew exactly what you were doing, no doubt
because you have become accustomed to dealing with the effects of very heavy drinking. Whether
you had finally decided to kill her before she set out or only formed that intention during the
argument that ensued is of secondary importance. The critical factor in my view is that for a
significant period of time you had given serious consideration to ending her life and destroying your
child, and having met her you did the very thing that you had long contemplated and threatened.
The circumstances of the killing were terrible. The prolonged and agonised screams heard by those
living nearby reveal beyond doubt the pain you inflicted and the length of time you took to kill her.
For a significant period that young woman would have known exactly what was happening to her and
the fatal consequences for her child, and she would have been in agony. In your evidence you
described two men jumping up and down on Eystna and kicking her to death. I have no doubt that all
you did in this case was to attribute your own actions to these fictional individuals as part of your
defence which thejury has rejected. I am sure that you jumped up and down on, and delivered heavy
kicks to, the upper body and particularly the head of that young woman.
It follows this was in a real sense a planned, deliberate, cruel and prolonged attack on someone who
had been close to you for a considerable period of time and who was about to give birth to your
daughter. Your history reveals how dangerous you are, particularly as regards those with whom you
are having a sexual relationship, and you have not shown the smallest indication of remorse. Instead,
you have sought to traduce the name and the memory of the deceased.
This was, in essence, a double murder. Whatever the formal position, the child was so close to being
born that to treat this case in any other way would be a travesty.
I have borne in mind your relative youth, alcoholism, personality disorder and lack of significant
criminal convictions. But those factors offer only slight mitigation when set beside the terrible crimes
you committed in June of last year.
The sentence for the murder of Eystna Blunnie which I am about to pass is, in a real sense, partially
dependent on the offence of child destruction, because the starting point for the minimum term is
founded on the seriousness of count 1 and the combination of the homicide offence and the offence
of child destruction with which it is inextricably linked. Given count 2 has been a critical
consideration in reaching the sentence on count 1, it would be wholly artificial to impose a separate
notional sentence on count 2. Indeed, the sentence on count 2 could only be reached by reference
back to the murder of Eystna Blunnie. For that reason there will be no separate penalty for count 2
because that offence and its seriousness have been entirely incorporated into the sentence on count
1.

The sentence on count 1 is a mandatory life sentence and the defendant will serve a minimum of 27
years before consideration can be given to his release on licence.

2225570,R v Kevin Hutchinson-Foster,"CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT 
 

26TH FEBRUARY 2013 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF
 
 

HIS HONOUR JUDGE DAVID RADFORD
 
 

R - V - KEVIN HUTCHINSON-FOSTER
 
 

Kevin Hutchinson-Foster it is now my duty to sentence you for the  
3 separate offences you have committed. 
 
The first two offences (Counts 1 and 2) were committed on the  
29th July 2011.  You pleaded guilty on re-arraignment to these offences on 
the 15th June 2012, having originally pleaded Not Guilty to them on first 
arraignment on the 8th of February 2012 when a date for your trial was set.  
Evidence proving your guilt, including CCTV, DNA and the phone cell 
site evidence was served by the prosecution.  For the purposes of sentence 
I give you credit for your pleas to these counts but their belated timing 
against a background of highly probative evidence must reduce the extent 
of that credit. 
 
The facts of those offences can be shortly summarised.  You went to the 
Lagoon Salon in Kingsland Road, Hackney on the 29th July.  You got into 
an argument with one of the staff concerning a lady with whom both you 
and he were acquainted.  The argument ended by you saying that you 
would be back.  You returned armed with a handgun which you said in 
evidence under cross-examination you did not know if it was or was not 
loaded.  As can be seen in the CCTV, you pointed it at the staff member 
with whom you had earlier argued intending to cause him to believe he
--------
would be shot.  Moments later you used the gun to pistol whip him on the 
head causing him to be injured, for a while to lose consciousness.  You 
then made your get away by car, taking the sock covered gun with you. 
 
These two offences were premeditated and callous.  You did not in the 
least care that what you decided to do was not only to cause  
Mr. Osadebay to fear that he was to be shot but also as it did and as can be 
seen in the CCTV footage to cause fear and panic to wholly innocent 
members of the public present in and near the Salon that day. 
 
5 days later on the 4th  August that self same firearm still in your 
possession and under your control, was supplied by you, with a bullet in its 
magazine, in a shoe box you had obtained from a female friend of yours to 
Mark Duggan when he arrived by taxi in Vicarage Road, Leyton.  From 
Leyton Mr. Duggan continued on his cab journey to Tottenham in 
possession of the lethal firearm you had supplied him with.  When the taxi 
was stopped by the police in Ferry Lane, Mr. Duggan decided to exit the 
taxi, leaving behind the now open and empty shoebox which you had given 
  
him. 
 
The gun which you had supplied to Mr. Duggan was later found on the 
grassy area behind where he had fallen after he was shot.  It is no part of 
the function of this court to give its own judgement on the precise 
circumstances in which Mr. Duggan was fatally injured – that will be for 
the Coroner’s Inquest later this year to decide.  I accept your Counsel’s 
submissions that you are not to be held responsible in law for whatever Mr. 
Duggan decided to do when he left the taxicab or for the response of the 
police to the situation which then occurred.  However, you were 
responsible for the supply to Mr. Duggan of a loaded prohibited firearm in 
circumstances in which you must have known or foreseen its criminal use 
by him and/or others.  Exactly what the extent of your knowledge of 
Mr. Duggan’s planned use of that firearm was you have chosen not to 
reveal, instead cloaking your association with Mr. Duggan and your 
telephone discussions and meeting with him that fateful day with a farrago 
of lies.  Plainly though, as a matter of commonsense, no one would have 
supplied such a weapon to another as you did that day believing it was for 
use for some innocent and lawful purpose.  
 
It is of course beyond argument that all these 3 offences which I have to 
sentence you for today are so serious that only significant immediate 
custodial sentences can properly be passed to mark their seriousness. 
In my judgement, whilst it is right that the sentences on the first two counts 
(the 29th July 2011 offences) should run concurrently (but reflecting in the
--------
lead sentence for  Count 1 the additional criminality involved in Count 2) 
the sentence on Count 3 involves a different day and quite separate serious 
criminality and must run consecutively. 
 
In relation to Count 2, as I am required to, in assessing its own seriousness, 
I have sought to follow the Definitive Guideline for such offences issued 
by the Sentencing Council.  I find that this is a Category 2 offence (lesser 
harm but higher culpability).  Whilst the physical injuries you caused to 
Mr. Osadebay were not serious the use of a weapon to pistol-whip him and 
the presence of a significant degree of premeditation plainly constitutes 
higher culpability.  Added to this, the seriousness of the offence – indeed 
all 3 offences – is aggravated by the fact that at the time you were on 
licence following your release from prison. 
 
So far as Count 1 is concerned, the evidence is clear and factually 
undisputed that the firearm you produced in the Lagoon Salon on the 29th 
 
July was the self-same prohibited weapon you supplied to Mr. Duggan on 
the 4th August. 
 
The issue of law which I have troubled Counsel about is whether that 
means that a mandatory minimum sentence has to be imposed by the Court 
both on Count 1 as it undoubtedly has to in relation to Court 3. 
I drew Counsels’ attention to the decision of the Court of Appeal, Criminal 
Division in Attorney General’s Reference No. 114 of 2004 (Steven 
McDowell) [2005] 2 Cr. App. R. (S) 6.  Mr. Denney has submitted that 
the binding result of that decision is that this court is not required to pass a 
mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years on Count 1 since the count as 
pleaded at the time of your re-arraignment upon it did not allege in terms 
that the firearm described in the count was a prohibited firearm.  The 
prosecution though have submitted that the self-same firearm is described 
in Count 3 as a prohibited firearm, and unlike in the Reference there is no 
confusion or unresolved issue of fact about the nature of the handgun 
concerned, which, if there had been, should have lead to the necessity of a 
further count contrary to Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 being added 
to the indictment. 
 
I have considered the submissions made to me on this question.  I agree 
with the prosecution that the factual matrix of this case is quite different 
from the confusion at the Crown Court outlined by the Court of Appeal in 
 
McDowell.
--------
However, Mr. Denney points out with blunt economy of verbiage in his 
submissions that the Court of Appeal made clear that it was necessary for 
there to be a specific count on the indictment relating to the incident 
concerned which alleged in terms that the firearm was a prohibited weapon 
before the statutory minimum sentence mandatorily had to be passed and 
that this Appellate enjoined requirement of sentencing law is binding on 
me. 
 
I have come to the conclusion that the judgement of the Court of Appeal 
given by its then Vice-President is clear, namely that the cases where the 
prosecution seek to invite a Judge to impose (at least) the mandatory 
minimum sentence they should add such a count to the indictment so as to 
make clear to a defendant and those advising him, that he is at risk in 
relation to his then alleged possession of a firearm on that day of a 
minimum 5 year sentence.  That was not done in relation to the 
Defendant’s possession of the firearm on the 29th July 2011.  I find that I 
am bound by the requirement so to have done in this case, and that the 
charging in Count 3 of later transferring a prohibited firearm on the 4th of 
August 2011 does not enable me to avoid following the clear statement of 
the law by the Court of Appeal.  Of course, in any event, it is for me to 
decide what the appropriate length of sentence must be for this serious 
offence, which as Mr. Denney said in his written submission might be 
lower, higher or the same as the statutory minimum sentence as I shall 
determine. 
 
The fact is that Parliament has required the passing of a minimum 5 year 
sentence if a prohibited firearm is in an offender’s possession (with or 
without the additional specific intent criminalised by Section 16A of the 
Firearms Act 1968) of course the mandatory sentences proscribed by 
 
Parliament are minimum sentences not starting points for all firearms 
offences covered by the statutory proscription (see the judgement of the 
Court of Appeal in Attorney General’s Reference (No.6 of 2011) 
  
Zephen Rollings [2012] 2 Cr. App. R. (S) 67.  In this case I shall shortly 
turn to a consideration of the factors affecting your culpability in relation 
to the offences in Count 1 and 3, having in mind the Appeal Court’s clear 
guidance that such offences call for deterrent and punitive sentences. 
 
Before I do so, I must determine, as the offences pleaded in Counts 1 and 2 
on the indictment are specified violent offences as defined in the Criminal
--------
Justice Act 2003 as amended, whether you are a dangerous offender for 
whom in relation to Count 1 an Extended Sentence should be passed.  In 
that regard I have weighed - as sentencing law requires me to do -  
the analysis contained in the Pre-Sentence Report the conclusions of the 
writer of that Report are not binding on me but are of great significance.   
I acknowledge that until the present offences, you had not previously been 
convicted of any violent offence, and that you did not discharge the firearm 
 
on the 29th July 2011.  However, I do find that the facts of all of these 
offences and the cogent assessment of the Probation Officer who has had 
more contact with you than simply from the usual one session interview, 
combined with your minimalising of your offending, properly lead me to 
conclude that there is a significant risk that you will commit specified 
violent offences in the future which carry with them as a result a 
significant risk that thereby members of the public will be seriously 
injured, either physically and/or psychologically.   
 
Having regard too to the fact that you committed these offences during a 
standard licence period, it is appropriate that you be subject to an Extended 
Licence when you are released from the custodial sentences I shall shortly 
pass on you, if it be the case, as I find it is, that the appropriate sentence on 
Count 1 (concurrent with that passed on Count 2) is one of at least 4 years 
imprisonment.  
 
I turn first though to the factors relevant to sentence on Count 3, for which 
no discount at all for any plea of guilty or any remorse is available to you.  
The account you have given about the circumstances underlying this 
offence on the jury’s verdict and in common sense has from first to last 
been wholly mendacious.  The true facts are that the firearm concerned 
was a lethal weapon with a bullet in its magazine which I find you had 
access to and control over from at least prior to your deployment of it on 
the 29th July 2011 and which you knowingly transferred to Mr. Duggan for 
what must have been to your knowledge a serious criminal purpose.  In 
line with clear guidance given by the Court of Appeal, reflecting the very 
great concern over the transfer by criminals of lethal firearms, this offence 
merits a condign sentence. 
 
At the time of this offence you had not previously been convicted of an 
offence of violence or any firearms offence but you were not a man of 
good character or some wayward youth but a 29 year old adult who was 
subject to licence conditions consequent upon your early release from 
offences for Class A drug trafficking for which you had received sentences 
of 54 months at this Court in August 2009.  You also fall to be sentenced 
on Counts 1 and 2.  Concurrent sentences as between those Counts is
--------
appropriate, though taking into account the overall criminality of both 
Counts in the lead sentence to be imposed on Count 1.   
I accept that you did not discharge the handgun at the Lagoon Salon and it 
is unclear whether or not then it was loaded.  I accept that the physical 
injuries to Mr. Osadebay were in the event not serious.  However, as I said 
previously your decision to return an hour after your first visit armed with 
a firearm to what you knew was a busy hair salon full of innocent people 
was wholly premeditated and cynically callous and indifferent to the 
consequences of the deliberate fear your decision to produce and point that 
handgun would and did engender in such a place. 
 
You are entitled to credit for your pleas of guilty but they were not 
tendered at the first reasonable opportunity and in relation to Count 1 by 
the time you were re-arraigned you had no prospect of mounting an 
arguable defence to it and I find there to be no true remorse for which 
additional credit should be given.  Before coming to my final conclusions 
on the appropriate sentences I should pass, I have to judge how far the 
sentencing law on proportionality or totality should affect their length.  In 
taking such account of totality as I should, I have to have in mind that this 
principle though applicable should not result in rendering nugatory the 
mandatory minimum sentences Parliament requires to be passed for 
qualifying firearms offences.  So far as the effect of your recall to custody

EDWARD MAHER 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE NICOL 

 

5TH MARCH 2013 
  

 

You have pleaded guilty to one count of theft. 
 
In January 1993 you were working for Securicor. On 22nd January you and a 
colleague were entrusted with making deliveries of cash to various banks and other 
places in Suffolk. Over a million pounds in cash was loaded into the van. 
 
 
You went to the Lloyds bank in Felixstowe where your colleague got out and 
delivered the money which had to be deposited there. He was away for only a short 
time. When he returned the van, the remaining cash (about £1.17 million), and you 
had all disappeared. 
 
A few streets away the cash was apparently transferred from the van to another 
vehicle. Access to the rear of the Securicor van must have been gained with  your 
assistance. Another transfer was made a little further still. Parts of a discarded 
uniform, no doubt yours, were found nearby. It is plain that this theft was well 
planned and several of you were involved in this joint enterprise. 
 
None of the stolen cash has been recovered. 
 
You disappeared. 
 
The week before the theft, your partner and your young son had flown to the United 
States. Within a short time you had joined them. 
 
You adopted your brother’s identity and took advantage of his Green Card. You 
adopted a second alias. Your partner also took up a false name. 

 

1
--------
And there matters rested until February 2012 when you were arrested at the place 
where you were then living in Missouri, USA. 
 
You were originally arrested by the US authorities on suspicion of immigration and 
firearms offences.  
 
For many years there had been a warrant outstanding for your arrest. Your extradition 
was sought from the US, although in the end you were returned to the UK voluntarily 
on 10th July 2012. 
 
Initially you pleaded not guilty and you served a defence case statement. Your trial 
was due to start on 4th March. However, on 6th February of this year (and so about a 
month before the trial was due to commence) your solicitors wrote to the Court and 
said you wished to change your plea to guilty. You have done that this morning. 
 
You are now 57.  Before this crime was committed you had been convicted of 10 
other offences on 4 previous occasions. Three of them were convictions when you 
still a juvenile. The last was for robbery, but the sentence of 12 months suspended 
imprisonment suggests that it was not of the most serious kind. As importantly, that 
conviction was in 1977 and so some 16 years before the offence for which I have to 
sentence you. In all these circumstances, I do not consider that any of these previous 
convictions significantly aggravates the present offence. 
 
I am told that in your teenage years you joined the army and served two tours in 
Northern Ireland. You were then in the fire service. Both occupations will have 
involved commendable public service. You then ran a pub in Kent, but the pub was 
damaged, you had to sell up and debts started to accumulate. 
 
The temptation to commit the present offence must have been too great. It will be for 
the confiscation proceedings which will follow in due course to decide quite how 
much was your benefit from this theft. You told the authorities after your arrest that 
you only received £40,000. Your wife has said it was about £200,000. If she is right, 
you made a very substantial gain even if, as you have also said, the money has gone 
over the intervening period. 
 
I have heard that you have impressed many who knew you in the US, but who knew 
nothing of your past. Your wife or partner has stood by you. She and your two sons 
will be pained by the sentence that I will have to pass. But it is unfortunately a 
common occurrence that those who commit crimes cause pain and distress to those 
who are close to them.  
 
The maximum sentence for theft is 7 years imprisonment.  
 
The Sentencing Council has issued a guideline for theft in breach of trust. Where the 
amount involved is £125,000 or more or theft of £20,000 or more in breach of a high 
degree of trust the starting point after a trial is 3 years custody and the sentencing 
range 2 – 6 years. In your case, there was a gross breach of trust. The amount 
involved was very, very substantially more than either of these starting points. There 
was detailed planning a group of you were involved. I have considered whether the 

 

2
--------
interests of justice mean that I should go beyond this range because of these 
aggravating features. I have though, concluded that a starting point after trial at the 
very top of the range will properly reflect the seriousness of the offence. 
  
You are entitled to credit for your plea of guilty – not as much as if you had pleaded 
at the first reasonable opportunity, but more than if you had first indicated your 
change of plea at the beginning of your trial. Your counsel has suggested that 
somewhere between 15% -20% would be appropriate and I agree that a reduction of a 
little more than 15% is right.  
 
Your counsel has submitted that I should make further allowance for the 5 months or 
so which you spent in custody in the USA. I have heard what he has had to say, but I 
do not accept it. You were held in the US on suspicion of committing offences against 
US immigration laws (because you entered and lived there under one or two false 
names) and US firearms legislation (because the licence which you had obtained for 
them was in a false name). To put it at its lowest, there were reasonable grounds to 
believe you had committed those offences. I am told that they were matters for which 
you could have been imprisoned if you had been convicted of them. You were not 
arrested for the theft until you returned to the UK. In all these circumstances, I make 
no alteration to my sentence to reflect the time in custody in the US. 
 
The time in custody in the UK is different. The present legislation means, as I 
understand, that this will be credited automatically against your sentence, but if there 
is any doubt, I make it clear that this period should be set against the time you are 
required to serve. As will have been explained to you, at the half way stage of this 
sentence you will be released on licence. If you then commit any further offence or 
otherwise breach your licence, you may be re-detained. 
 
Stand up. 
 
Edward Maher for the offence of theft I sentence you to 5 years in prison.

CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT 

 

4 MARCH 2013 

 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE BRIAN BARKER Q.C. 


 
RECORDER OF LONDON
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
The professionals who have examined you over the years have revealed a troubled and 
difficult history.  During the trial we have reviewed the findings in considerable detail. 
The central aspects I must re visit. 
 
On November 4th 2005, aged 25, at the invitation of your mother,  you returned from 
London to Forrest Row.  Having spent some of the evening with your brother you 
returned to her home where she was living alone.  There had been a running dispute as 
to the welfare of your young children and within a short time of arriving you stabbed her 
to death with a large kitchen knife.  You were remanded to HMP Bronzefield and then 
 
unsurprisingly spent some months being assessed at the Bracton Centre prior to 
sentence.  You were diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia with a 
prominent mood component at the time of the killing, and your plea of diminished 
responsibility was accepted at the Lewes Crown Court on October 23rd 2006.  Orders 
 
were made under s.37 & 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983.  No further signs were 
detected and your treatment with anti-psychotic and mood stabilising medication 
 
continued. 
 
It is clear from the evidence that we have heard that you were considered a suitable 
 
candidate for a return to the community within a comparatively short time and by 
 
January 2009 a discharge plan had been drawn up.  In September 2009, with the 
 
concurrence of all including the MoJ, you were conditionally discharged.  Your 
medication was to continue, you lived in approved accommodation and you had regular 
meetings with the consultant psychiatrist, your community psychiatric nurse and the 
forensic social worker.  It is quite clear that you had considerable support and 
understanding throughout this period.   
 
You travelled to Jamaica twice in connection with your children and in early 2011 
became pregnant, and by agreement the taking of sodium valporate ceased.  After a 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

1
--------
miscarriage you obtained a part-time job and at the end of September you contacted 
 
your brother on Facebook.  It is perhaps no surprise that this attempt was greeted with 
less than enthusiasm. 
 
Two years have now gone by since the discharge, and on Friday October 7th you reported 
sick to your employers and a relapse of some sort occurred over the following weekend. 
 
By Sunday evening you were calling the police complaining about crackheads in your flat 
 
and on 03.30 Monday morning you were in a cab making some attempt to get to hospital 
for treatment.  You were taken back to the cab office and the employees were sufficiently 
 
alarmed by your behaviour and requests to go to hospital, that they called the police. 
 
Local officers arrived, assessed the situation and promptly took you to the busy A&E of 
the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.  There they waited with you and once you had registered 
 
at 04.45 they returned to their duties. 
  
 
It is apparent that you were attempting to contact the Bracton Centre and your carers on 
 
your mobile but had no success.  Your demeanour and aggression was clearly a cause of 
 
concern.  Within 30 minutes you were seen by the triage nurse and arrangements were 
made to transfer you to the adjoining psychiatric unit Oxleas House.  Meanwhile you had 
made a number of 999 calls indicating that you were dangerous, were having a 
 
breakdown; that you were being ignored, had done a murder before and could end up 
hurting someone if the police did not come. 
  
 
You were assessed at 05.30 by a nurse from Oxleas, your records were obtained and after 
 
being escorted over you arrived at the Centre at 06.40. 
You, at your own request, were left in an internal garden area to smoke.  The plan was to 
admit you and records were investigated.  Dr Idowu, the Senior House Officer, told us 
that as became more aware of your complex history and the conviction , his view was 
that you needed further investigation, to be detained if necessary  and that you were a 
 
possible danger. 
 
You then decided to leave the closed unit, and where you had asked to be.  You said later 
that  ‘they were just tapping keyboards, I told them I was going to hurt someone, this all 
 
their fault.’   It was unfortunate that at this time the shift was changing, and one of the 
doors was apparently faulty.  You remained briefly in reception before walking through 
and out onto the street.  Once the staff realised this, Dr Idowa was notified and he 
immediately dialled 999 and notified the police of his concern. 
 
  
Much of the rest of the story in captured by one CCTV camera or another.  You can be 
 
seen boarding a bus outside the unit with your freedom card, changing at Kidbrook 
Station and journeying on to Bexley Heath Town Centre.  No unusual behaviour is 
 
noticeable on the two buses and you continue to make calls.  At 08.13 you got off and 
 
within minutes entered Asda.  You can be seen making enquiries, selecting a large 
kitchen knife and paying at a self-service till.  You entered the ladies’ toilet and discarded 
 
the wrappings.  You left the store, walked to a nearby bus stop and immediately attacked 
 
Kerry Clark with an overarm blow aimed at her chest.  She was a complete stranger and 
listening to music while waiting for her bus.  Fortunately she reacted with speed and 
 
bravery and grasped the blade with both hands.  Your aggression forced her to the 
 
ground but she managed to retain the knife and kick you off.  You demanded the knife 
back before slipping off as members of the public began to assess and react.  A number of 
 
observers called the police including Mr Nicholas Morris who followed you and was able 
 
to give the police a running commentary and later warn a passer-by of impending danger 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

2
--------
Having gone over the road, you entered a butcher’s shop and while the employee’s back 
 
was turned stole his large working knife.  You set off towards the Bowling Alley, crossing 
a major junction in doing so.   
 
Mrs Sally Hodkin, another complete stranger, had changed her usual route to work and 
was walking into the town centre.  You went directly to her, attacked her violently 
without pause and left her on the grass.  She suffered a number of incised wounds, 
 
delivered with severe force to her neck and head.  In the view of the pathologist, Mrs 
Hodkin’s death was swift. 
 
You then went to the shops at the junction, telling the shopkeeper that you thought you 
 
had hurt someone and killed them.  By this time officers, directed by Mr Morris, were 
arriving and you were arrested.  You made further limited admissions and after being 
 
taken back to the QEH for an injury to be to be dressed, you were booked in to Lewisham 
 
Police Station.  Professionals there took the view that your condition was deteriorating 
and you were later seen by medical staff who had arrived from the from the Bracton 
Centre .  It may well be that both before and after you were experiencing some form of 
 
 
 
transient psychosis.  You were charged in the early hours of the next morning and on 
October 12th you were transferred to Russet Ward at Ealing Hospital where you remained 
until trial.  You have subsequently claimed complete amnesia. 
 
 
The psychiatrists that subsequently examined you accept that you were suffering from an 
abnormality of mental functioning, but disagreed as to what it was.  The jury concluded 
on all the evidence that any such abnormality did not substantially impair your ability to 
form a rational judgment or to exercise self-control during the crucial period and did not 
provide an explanation for the crucial conduct. 
 
In Russet Ward you continued to receive anti psychotic medication but showed no signs 
of psychosis.  What the records show is aggression, intimidation, disruption, anger and 
emotionally instability particularly when your demands were not being met, and a 
 
 
regular feature was blaming everyone else for your situation.  Dr Joseph’s view is that 
 
early and continuing diagnosis after your mother’s death of paranoid schizophrenia is 
 
understandable, but when your behaviour after your arrest for these matters is added to 
the overall picture the dominant characteristic above your mental health difficulties is a 
 
borderline personality disorder with the ability to form rational judgment. 
 
However we look at things, both before and after, your actions from deciding to leave the 
 
 
security of the Oxleas Unit to the stabbing of Mrs Hodkin were a consistent and 
calculated course of criminal conduct.  What I conclude from the full spectrum is that 
you are manipulative and exceptionally dangerous 
 
I am moved by the words of Mr Hodkin and his family describing the personal suffering 
arising out the death of Mrs Hodkin. Everyone in the family and his friends from that 
 
moment on has been struggling to understand their loss, and the fact that she has gone 
for ever.  Nothing that we can do, or say, can turn back the clock, and while over time 
 
Mrs Hodkin’s  family and friends may get used to her death, they will never get over it, 
 
and she will not be forgotten. 
 
I have not been asked for pre-sentence reports and I note the recent medical report 
indicating that there is no need for hospital treatment. I have listened carefully to what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
has been said helpfully on your behalf by Mr Cooper.  In particular he submits that you 

had a significant condition and at the time that you were a woman in crisis trying to 

comply with directions in the care plan.  

He submits that there was little premeditation and it should be relevant that she was not 

 
given the help that she was seeking due to failure by the various authorities.  In addition
 
he submits that the court should adopt a 25 year start time for the murder and that there 

are mitigating features in relation to the attempted murder. 

 
I disagree that responsibility for these acts can be laid at the door of others. 

 
You made a choice and the fact is these were terrible acts, and you must take
 
responsibility for what you did.  I cannot ignore the fact that you have killed before and 

 
that overall you have come as near as can be to having three deaths at your hands.
 
 
The penalty for murder is mandatory; it is life imprisonment.  Parliament in 2003 set out 

the procedure.    I have to determine the minimum term that you must serve before you 

may be considered for release on licence. 

Looking at the overall circumstances, although in accordance with the amended 

schedule 21 of the CJA 2003 the starting point in this case could be one of 25 years, in 

 
my view this offence falls within paragraph 5 namely ‘particularly high’ despite not  being
 
one of the non-exhaustive examples; and thus in my judgment  the appropriate start 

point is 30 years. 

 
I next have to consider whether there are any aggravating or mitigating features which 

might increase or decrease the minimum term to be specified 

 
  
There are a number of aggravating features including premeditation, and a
 
determination to overcome failure in order  to achieve your ends. Additionally,  the fact 

that you obtained two knives for only one conceivable reason and the fact that you chose 

the ideal location to rearm yourself.  These attacks were unprovoked and random 

  
The main mitigating feature is that you suffer from a mental disability,  but on the 

particular facts of this case there is no convincing case to conclude that the abnormality 

reduced your culpability to any significant extent.  I have been referred to various 

 
authorities with regard to sentence, although each turns very much on their own facts. 

 
In addition you have been found guilty of attempting to kill Kerry Clark.  The fact that 

  
you failed was only due to good fortune and swift reaction.
 
 
I have a variety of sentencing options in relation to this offence.  In view of the more
 
 
serious conviction,   I intend to treat that offence as an aggravating feature and reflect it
 
in an increase to the minimum to be served in the life sentence 

 
 
In my view the cumulative features means that I have to raise the minimum term.  What
 
you did could not have been more selfish.  The Hodkin family have lost a loved and 

 
central member; meanwhile Kerry Clark is lucky to be alive and has had to wrestle with
 
the disruption and long term turmoil that your actions generated. For all that you have to 

 
take responsibility.
 
 
 
Taking all factors into account the minimum period of your life imprisonment term will 

 
be one of 37 years.
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
For the attempted murder I have concluded that you represent a significant risk to the 
public under s.225 and that a life sentence is appropriate.  I have considered the 
 
guidelines.  A period of 20 years is the notional determinate term.  I am required to take 
into account the days served and reduce the appropriate figure by half.  The exact 
sentence will be calculated. 
 
 
On the information I have the period for each of you is 510 days 
But if this period is mistaken this court will order an amendment of the record for the 
 
correct period to be recorded 
 
 
 
The law says this means that it is only after you have served the minimum period for 
count two, the murder of Mrs Hodkin; that will then be eligible for consideration for 
release by the Parole Board in their discretion.  
 
If and when released you will be on licence for the rest of your life. 
 
I wish to acknowledge the patience, dignity and suffering of the Hodgkin family and 
Kerry Clark and hope that they will be able to move forward, at least to some extent, in 
their lives 
 
I also wish to pay particular tribute to Nicholas Morris.  By following and commenting he 
 
ignored his own safety and demonstrated public spiritedness of the highest order.  I 
would hope that senior officers would be able to recognise his actions in some 
appropriate way. 
 
 
I also wish to acknowledge the actions of all officers who responded during the course of 
 
these unhappy and difficult events, and the investigating officers for their extensive 
preparations. 
 
Finally my thanks to all counsel for their help, and to those jurors who have returned my 
thanks again for your service to the Court and to the community.

Jacek Kowalczyk, Radoslaw Bielawski and Andrezj Skowron you were found guilty of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causing the death by dangerous driving of Miss Baljinder Gill (Count 2) in the evening 
 
of Saturday 11 June 2011, which was just three days after her 34th  birthday. Behind 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that offence, which involved the deliberate contriving of a crash in the outside lane 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the A40 at a point just to the west of London, lay a conspiracy to commit fraud 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(Count 1) of which each of you was also convicted. The object of the fraud was to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dishonestly  gain  financial  compensation  by  falsely  representing  to  the  insurance 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company  of  the  driver  you  had  targeted  to  crash  into  the  back  of  one  of  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicles that a genuine accident had taken place in consequence of which personal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury and/or vehicle damage had been sustained. Thus you were each involved in an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise  to  “crash  for  cash”  as  it  has  been  called  –  that  is  an  enterprise  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberately cause a road traffic collision solely for the purpose of financial gain. This 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the first such enterprise, resulting in a death, to come before the courts. The fact 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  did  not  also  lead  to  your  obtaining  the  money  was  no  thanks  to  you  but 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather, principally, the result of the police investigation into the crash.

doubt that the planning began at some point significantly before 11 June 2011 and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culminated that evening when you and two others all met up in the Greenford area. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You used two cars. The first was a left hand drive Audi A3 with darkened windows, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which was owned by you Bielawski and registered in Poland. It was driven by you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Skowron, accompanied by another man. The second car was a VW Passat which was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owned and driven by you Kowalczyk, with Bielawski as one of the two passengers. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You set off to the A40 in tandem and drove west. The two cars were in continuous 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact via a telephone call from your phone Kowalczyk to yours Skowron. Between 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you all, you were looking for a vehicle that you could be confident was insured, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then to contrive an apparent accident in which it would crash into the back of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

VW Passat thereby enabling those in that car to claim compensation To that end the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taping around old damage to the rear of the VW had been removed in order that, if 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible, it could be claimed that the damage had been caused by the crash. You 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eventually chose as your target a smart liveried Ford Transit van which was being 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driven by Mr John Fallon. By then you had reached the point on the A40 where it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sweeps  downhill,  3  lanes  wide,  from  the  area  of  the  Swakerleys  Roundabout  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then flattens out shortly before the Denham exit. At that point it is, in all but name, a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motorway – albeit with a pavement instead of a hard shoulder. Mr Fallon was driving 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  70  mph,  the  maximum  permitted  speed,  in  the  outside  lane.  You,  Kowalczyk, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

positioned your VW car in front of him. Skowron you were behind both of them in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the middle lane with another vehicle some distance in front of you also in the middle 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lane, which was fast being caught up with by the VW and the van in the outside lane. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You Skowron then changed down and accelerated up the middle lane undertaking 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the van and then, as the gap narrowed between the VW and the car in front of you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  middle  lane,  you  also  undertook  the  VW  and  then,  apparently  without 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warning,  pulled  across  into  the  outside  lane  immediately  in  front  of  it.  To  those 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

travelling behind, who were unaware of the joint enterprise to contrive a crash, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  fact  that  the  Audi  and  the  VW  were  in  communication  by  telephone,  it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeared (as was intended) that the appalling and unexpected driving of the Audi 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had forced the VW to brake. Knowing what was coming, you Kowalczyk were able to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
brake instantly but instead of braking enough to avoid a collision you braked hard to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  halt  in  order  to  get  Mr  Fallon  to  crash  into  the  back  of  you.  You  Bielawski,  in 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interview,  described  these  manoeuvres  as  “suicide”.  In  the  course  of  cross‐

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examination  you,  Kowalczyk,  described  them  as  being  “highly  dangerous,  with  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious risk to other road users, and impossible to predict what would happen…”. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whilst these were things accepted after the event, they should have been obvious at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time to all three of you. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However Mr Fallon, who had seen the Audi start to cut across you, himself braked 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately and thus was able to stop just short of the back of your car. Travelling 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behind Mr Fallon’s van in her Ford Fiesta, Miss Gill was not so fortunate. The van 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have obstructed her view of the Audi’s manoeuvre, and thus she was not able 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to brake in time, and at the point where the road flattened out crashed into the back 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Mr Fallon’s van pushing it into the back of the VW and thereby causing the VW 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor damage. In the meanwhile you Skowron carried on west, crossing rapidly into 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the inside lane and taking the Denham exit. However, during that process, Mr and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mrs Lim  who were  travelling  west  in  the  inside lane  and  who carried on  past  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crash  managed  to  get  the  Audi’s  registration  number  and  later  passed  it  to  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Police.  It  was  their  public  spirited  conduct  in  doing  so  that  eventually  led  to  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

downfall of all three of you. Having come off the westbound carriageway Skowron, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you went round the roundabout and back up on to the A40 and returned east to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Greenford. In the meanwhile Mr Fallon had also tried to follow the Audi, but had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

soon had to give up. He pulled over onto the pavement just short of the Denham 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exit,  and  rang  the  police.  You,  Kowalczyk  followed  him  and  parked  immediately 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behind him in order to get his insurance details. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miss  Gill,  however,  was  not  able  to  move  her  Fiesta  because  the  gravity  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damage  to  it  resulting  from  the  force  of  the  collision  was  such  that  it  had  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled.  Thus,  although  uninjured  herself,  she  was  stranded  in  the  outside  lane. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Albeit that westbound traffic that evening was relatively light, the evidence showed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Miss Gill was thus left in a position of very considerable danger – not least the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious danger of her car being crashed into at high speed by another vehicle.  She 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
got  out  of  her car, and  was leaning  back into it  to get something, when that was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely what happened. 
  

 

 

 

Colin Lee you were driving your Renault van westbound in the outside lane.  You had 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  passengers  –  a  woman  and  her  young  child.  You  were  travelling  at  70  mph. 
  

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Visibility was perfect.  You arrived at the top of the hill at least 40‐45 seconds after 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  initial  crash.  Having  overtaken  a  coach  as  you  started  down  the  hill  you  had 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some 340 yards of clear visibility to Ms Gill’s stranded Fiesta straight ahead of you. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whilst a stationary vehicle in the outside lane of such a road is relatively rare, you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were under a duty to keep a proper lookout, and there were many visual indications 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Fiesta was stationary.  Yet, over a period of 9 seconds, in which you could 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

readily have braked to a halt, or slowed and gone into the middle lane, you failed to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice what should have been obvious.  You did not brake until less than a second 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before impact when you were only 25 yards short of the Fiesta. Thus you crashed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the back of it at a speed of just over 50mph.  The collision was described by one 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness  as  “an  explosion  of  metal  glass  and  dust”. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  the  product  of  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

careless driving (Count 5). 
 

 

 

 

 

Miss Gill died at the scene from the terrible injuries that she sustained as a result of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that crash. 
   

 

 

It  is  clear,  from  the  statement  made  by  the  Family  Liaison  Officer  and  from  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moving statement made by her younger brother, that Miss Gill’s death has had, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continues  to  have,  an  absolutely  devastating  effect  on  her  family,  who  (shortly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

afterwards) also suffered the loss of her other brother to cancer. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By the time the police arrived on the scene you, Bielawski, had realised that if you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave your proper name to them there would be a risk that your ownership of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Audi  would  come  to  light,  and  that  thus  the  joint  enterprise  would  be  exposed. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Accordingly you rang Artur Okrutny, and for a fee of £300 it was arranged between 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you that you would give his details to the police, and that thereafter he would, if 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary, pretend to the police that he, rather than you, had been the rear seat 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
passenger  in  the  car.  Thus  it  was  that  both  of  you,  Kowalczyk  and  Bielawski, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretended to the police at the scene that Bielawski was Artur Okrutny.  Those were 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice (Count 6). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was against that background that, two days later, on Monday 13 June 2011, you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kowalczyk took the lead in commencing insurance claims on behalf of yourself and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your two passengers – pretending that one of them was Artur Okrutny (albeit that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okrutny himself was not a party to the false claim). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The police investigation duly continued. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

On 15 June 2011 you, Kowalczyk, made a statement to the police in which you falsely 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimed that Artur Okrutny had been one of your two passengers in the VW Passat. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That was another act tending and intended to pervert the course of justice (Count 6). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On 12 July 2011 you Okrutny, having liaised with Bielawski as to what to say, made a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness statement to the police in which (in accordance with your agreement with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bielawski)  you  falsely  claimed,  in  some  detail,  that  you  had  been  the  rear  seat 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passenger in the VW Passat.  Those were also acts tending and intended to pervert 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the course of justice (Count 6). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, the police investigation led to the discovery of the truth, and brought you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all to justice. 
 

 

 

 

To state the obvious, no sentence that I can pass can possibly reflect the value of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miss Gill’s life. 
 

 

 

 

You, Kowalczyk, Bielawski and Skowron, having been convicted by the jury, must be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced for conspiracy to commit fraud (Count 1), and causing Miss Gill’s death by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dangerous driving (Count 2).  In my view you all share equal responsibility for those 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offences,  which  were  both  the  product  of  a  joint  enterprise.  In  addition  you, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
Kowalczyk were convicted of, and you Bielawski pleaded guilty to, doing acts tending 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and intended to pervert the course of justice (Count 6). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have no doubt, in each of your cases, as I made clear when adjourning for sentence, 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the custodial threshold has been crossed. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clearly, the offence of causing death by dangerous driving is the most serious one. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In order to avoid the double counting of aggravating features, and as I am entitled 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, I propose to pass sentences for that offence which also reflect your participation 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the conspiracy to commit fraud which underlay it.  In your cases, Kowalczyk and 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bielawski, there will also be consecutive sentences in relation to your related doing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice.  I will, however, keep 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

totality firmly in mind. 
  

 

 

 

 

As to the offence of causing death by dangerous driving, I have first considered in 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relation  to  each  of  you  whether  you  are,  in  the  terms  of  the  relevant  legislation, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dangerous.  In each case I have decided that you are not. 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  determining  the  seriousness  of  the  offence I must  first,  in  accordance  with  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant Sentencing Council Guideline, evaluate the quality of the driving involved 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the degree of the danger that it foreseeably created. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In this regard the deliberate causing of a crash in the outside lane of what was in all 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but name a motorway, even when the traffic was relatively light, speaks for itself. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Likewise  the  degree  of  danger  that  the  driving  foreseeably  created  was  great  – 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether from an initial concertina of crashes or in their aftermath.  Thus I have no 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hesitation  in  concluding  that,  in  the  terms  of  the  Guideline,  and  as  has  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceded by each of your counsel, this was a Level 1 offence involving driving that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  a  deliberate  decision  to  ignore  the  rules  of  the  road,  and  an  apparent 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregard for the great danger being caused to others. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6
--------
There is, clearly, a spectrum of gravity as to the reason for a deliberate decision to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignore the rules of the road.  The reason here, which is plainly at the upper end of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  spectrum,  was  a  joint  enterprise  to  deliberately  contrive  a  crash  in  order 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulently to obtain money 
 

 

 

 

 

It  is  clear  that  fraud  by  way  of  “crash  for  cash”  is  widespread. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indeed  the  latest 
 

 

 

available figures from the Fraud Insurance Bureau show its annual cost to be in the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  of  £392  million,  which  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  premiums  paid  by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers of insurance companies.  Hence a case such as this requires the court to 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underline that deterrence is one of the purposes of sentence. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As to the conspiracy to commit fraud itself, and in order to avoid double counting, I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

observe only that, as is conceded, the offence was pre‐planned to some extent and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved a number of people.  The amount of money that it was hoped to gain from 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the three fraudulent applications is not entirely clear.  However it is clear enough for 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  to  proceed  upon  the  basis  that  it  was,  in  all,  more  than  £5,000  but  less  than 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

£20,000. 
 

 

The only mitigating feature relied on in relation to the offence of causing death by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dangerous driving is the fact that Miss Gill’s death was contributed to by the careless 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driving of Mr Lee, which was its immediate cause.  However, in the very particular 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  of  this  case,  not  least  the  degree  of  danger  into  which  your  joint 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions put Miss Gill, I do not regard that mitigation as carrying the weight that it 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might in other circumstances. 
 

 

 

 

 

As to the offence of doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in your cases, Kowalczyk & Bielawski, I am required to consider three matters – the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significance  of  the  substantive  offence  to  which  the  perverting  of  the  course  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice related (in this case a road traffic fatality); the degree of persistence (some in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  case  Kowalczyk, and  quite  some  persistence  in your  case  Bielawski);  and  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  on  the  course  of  justice  itself  (which,  no  thanks  to  you,  was  not  ultimately 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perverted). 
 

 

7
--------
There is also the difference between you that you, Bielawski, pleaded guilty at the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plea and Case Management Hearing, and are thus entitled to full discount for that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plea.  In the end it seems to me that that discount equalises the sentence between 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  of  you,  the  more  so  as,  in  each  of  your  cases  I  propose  (additionally)  to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduce  the  otherwise  appropriate  sentence  in  accordance  with  the  principle  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

totality to which I have already made reference. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kowalczyk 
 

You are 32 years of age.  I have taken into account the content of the PSR.  You are 
 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of previous good character, and your employers speak well of you. I bear in mind 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything that has been said on your behalf. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On Count 2, causing death by dangerous driving, I have taken as my starting point (in 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance  with  the  Guideline)  a  sentence  of  8  years  imprisonment.  Having 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered  the  aggravating  feature  that  the  reason  for  the  deliberate  decision  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregard the rules of the road was a joint enterprise to deliberately contrive a crash

1 February 2013 


Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Fulford 


 

 

R –v- April Casburn 


The first issue that I must address in these remarks is the basis on which the defendant is 
 

to be sentenced. It is clear that there are two possible interpretations of the jury’s verdict 

and applying the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v Craig Griffin [2008] 2 Cr. App. 

R. (S) 61, page 357 at page 361, paragraph 10, [2008] EWCA Crim 119, I am obliged to 

make up my own mind as to which provides the proper foundation for sentencing. In 

summary, the competing bases are the prosecution’s case, founded on the entirety of the 

evidence of Mr Wood which notably included the request for money in return for 

confidential information, on the one hand, and the defendant’s account, namely that she 

was motivated by her strong feelings regarding the issue of the allocation of resources for 

the telephone hacking enquiry, on the other. She suggested she was really angry that a 

number of senior officers were diverting resources for the purposes of a “jolly”, to use 

her words. The jury could have convicted on either interpretation of the facts.   

 

On this issue, I have no difficulty. As it seems to me, Mr Wood was a reliable, honest 

and disinterested witness. He took time and trouble during the telephone call to find out 

exactly what Ms Casburn was saying, questioning the defendant on the detail of her
--------
account in order to make an accurate note for his superiors at the News of the World, 

which he wrote up in detail immediately afterwards. He had absolutely no reason to lie 

and every cause to be cautious given the risk that the newspaper was about to become 

the victim of a sting. I consider it inconceivable that he misunderstood what she said to 

him, erroneously misinterpreting her words when he recorded that she was seeking 

payment for information about a confidential investigation into telephone hacking on the 

part of the very newspaper she was telephoning and opening a line of communication if 

the newspaper wished to take up her offer. I repeat, he was an accurate and honest 

witness. 

 

As it seems to me this is, therefore, a straightforward but troubling case of corruption 

and, in the absence of any evidence on the point apart from what the defendant said in 

evidence, I decline to accept that she had significant difficulties working with her male 

colleagues in the senior ranks of the counter terrorism branch which in part, as she 

suggested, led her to act as she did. The most that can be said is that she was a relative 

newcomer to this area of police work and as result she may have felt something of an 

outsider, whether that belief on her part was justified or not. On the evidence before me, 

I am not prepared to go further than acting on that assumption in her favour, and, most 

critically, whatever the defendant may have considered her position to be vis-à-vis her 

fellow officers, any sense of resentment she may have held cannot begin to excuse the 

actions of a Detective Chief Inspector who went to the very newspaper which was the 

subject of a sensitive and confidential investigation by other officers, offering to sell 

details of the progress of the enquiry and the strategy the officers were intending to 

follow. Furthermore, although it is credible that the defendant may have disagreed with 

decisions that had been made as to how the investigation was to be resourced, no police 

officer can take it upon him- or herself to vent professional frustrations and
--------
disagreements in this way. The same conclusion applies to her alleged but erroneous 

belief that the investigation had been launched as a result of inappropriate political 

interference. 

 

In my judgment this offence cannot be described or excused as being wholly or in part 

an honourable, albeit flawed and inappropriate, expression of indignation and concern 

on this defendant’s part or an understandable instance of whistle-blowing. It was, 

instead, a corrupt attempt to make money out of sensitive and potentially very damaging 

information. If the News of the World had accepted her offer, it is clear in my judgment 

that that Ms Casburn would have taken money and as a result she posed a really 

significant threat to the integrity of this important police investigation. Beyond doubt, in 

my view, given she provided her mobile telephone number she contemplated the 

ongoing sale of information if the News of the World took the bait. Although not part of 

the investigating team, it is likely that given her role she would have learnt confidential 

details of the progress of this investigation. Internal Chinese walls in this context are all 

too often porous. 

 

Activity of this kind is deeply damaging to the administration of criminal justice in this 

country; it corrodes the public’s faith in the police force; and it can lead to the acquittal 

of, or the failure by the authorities to prosecute, individuals who have committed 

offences, whether they are serious or otherwise. We are entitled to expect the very 

highest standards of probity from our police officers, particularly those at a senior level, 

and it is, in my judgment, a very serious matter when men or women who have all the 

benefits, privileges and responsibilities of public office use their position for corrupt 

purposes: in this instance the misconduct was the proposed sale of confidential 

information for money.
--------
Ms Casburn, having worked hard for many years, has lost her good character and will 

undoubtedly now lose her job. She and her husband are at an advanced stage in the 

process of adopting a child, and she is undoubtedly placed in a vulnerable position as 

regards most aspects of her future. I accept that as a police officer prison will be a 

difficult experience for this defendant. But, that said, this offence is so serious that it can 

only be marked with a prison sentence. I accept that no money in fact changed hands 

because the News of the World did not rise to the bait and that during this first 

telephone call some, but by no means all, of the information given to Mr Wood was 

already in the public domain. But she revealed the actual intentions of the investigating 

team, she discussed who would be undertaking the police work and she rehearsed in 

detail the current thinking on the available charges, a piece of information which could 

have been of considerable tactical use to suspects who were questioned. That was a truly 

dire step for a senior police officer to take.  The defendant does not have the benefit of 

the mitigation that would have accompanied a guilty plea. 

 

Without the important complicating factor that I am about to go on to consider, the 

sentence would have been 3 years imprisonment.  

 

I have been particularly concerned about the position of the child who has now been 

with the defendant and her partner for over a year during the period leading up to 

adoption and I requested comprehensive reports when the defendant was convicted. The 

additional information, filed with the court yesterday, has proved to be very useful. The 

members of the press are to note that it is critical that the identity of this young person is 

not revealed and, as a result, I am limited to a very real extent as to what I am able to say 

on this subject during these sentencing remarks. This vulnerable child has been placed
--------
with the defendant and her partner following a disastrous beginning in life, and a strong 

and positive bond has developed with both of the proposed adoptive parents. I accept 

that although it is undoubtedly the position that following the defendant’s imprisonment 

the child will continue to have her partner as a permanent figure during the evenings and 

at weekends, the absence of the accused will nonetheless be significant and potentially 

damaging. These consequences will be mitigated, at least to an extent, by the fact that if 

the defendant had not been arrested, she would have returned to work by this time and 

accordingly the child would have been dependent in any event on care at a nursery and 

on friends and members of the respective families. But I do not minimise the critical role 

played by the defendant to date as, in a real sense, the principal carer.  

 

Particularly in exceptional circumstances such as these, the court must consider the 

impact on the child and proportionality of any custodial sentence when deciding if the 

gravity of the offence justifies the imprisonment of the parent, either at all or for a 

particular period of time. Given the overall seriousness of this offending and the clear 

indications that this child will remain in the family unit and will be cared for by the 

adoptive father along with friends and family, and will attend nursery during the day, I 

have no doubt that the sentence I am about to pass reflects Ms Casburn’s criminality 

whilst also taking into account appropriately the real needs of this young person.  I 

consider the ability of Ms Casburn’s husband to look after the child, and the other 

arrangements I have just referred to, mean that this case is not so exceptional as to make 

a suspended sentence necessary. I want to stress that the course that I am about to adopt 

is wholly dependent on the particular and highly unusual circumstances relating to this 

young child and these sentencing remarks should not be misinterpreted as having 

relevance to more conventional circumstances when children will be affected by the loss 

of a parent who is imprisoned.
--------
Bearing in mind all of these factors and circumstances the least sentence I can impose is 

one of 15 months immediate imprisonment.",2013-02-01 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

FREDERICK GILLIARD 


 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF 


HIS HONOUR JUDGE ANTHONY RUSSELL QC, RECORDER OF PRESTON 


 

On 9th July 2012 when your case was listed for trial you pleaded guilty to the unlawful killing of 
 
your wife Josephine June Gilliard who was then aged 74 years.  You had been married to each 
other  for  over  50  years  and  you  lived  together  at  40  Links  Road,  Blackpool.  You  had  been 
charged  with  murder  but  the  prosecution  accepted  your plea of guilty to manslaughter on the 
basis  of  diminished  responsibility.  This  assessment  was  based  upon  the  evidence  of  two 
psychiatrists  to  the  effect  that  at  the  time  of  the  killing  you  were  suffering  from  a  depressive 
episode. For reasons I need not go into there has been an unusually long delay between your 
pleading guilty and the sentence hearing today. 
 
You were the same age as your wife. On 5th February 2102 you made a 999 call.  When officers 
arrived at your home they found that your wife was lying on the floor next to the bed in the main 
 
bedroom.   She  had  suffered  catastrophic  blunt  trauma  injuries  to  the  head  and  several  knife 
 
wounds  to  the  body.   Despite  prolonged  attempts  by  paramedics  to  revive  her  she  was 
 
pronounced dead at the scene. 
 
During the 999 call you said that you had just killed your wife and had smashed her head in then 
stabbed her.  You said that following a blazing row you had just lost it and smashed her quite a 
few times with a thing out of the garden then stabbed her with a carving knife.  In answer to a 
 
direct question you said you had suffered from depression but the tablets you had been given
--------
didn’t work so you stopped taking them.  You said “Everything went today, I don’t know what 
 
happened, I can’t remember flipping hitting her.”  
 
 
 
In the main bedroom was a blood smeared garden ornament.  On top of the body was a long 
 
carving  type  knife  with  a  21.5cm  (8  ½  inches)  blade.  Later  Post-mortem  examination  by  Dr 
Armour revealed that June Galliard had suffered at least 10 blows to the head with considerable 
force  using  an  object  such  as  the  ornament.  Those  blows  caused  skull  fractures  and  other 
significant injury sufficient to have caused death.  However there were also multiple stab wounds 
 
to the neck, chest and abdomen.   
 
When the police arrived you were downstairs smoking a cigarette.  When you were arrested you 
 
said words to the effect of “I should have killed myself” Following your arrest you were taken to 
hospital  for  treatment  of  a  cut  to  your  hand.  You  told  the  nurse  that  you  couldn’t  take  it 
 
anymore, your wife was always putting you down; you had had a blazing row and you had just 
 
lost it so you went to the garden, got a gnome and smashed her with it.  You were very calm and 
collected but at the end of your remarks you said “we’ve been married 54 years” and “I love that 
woman” and became tearful. 
 
This was a very brutal killing as the injuries and examination of the scene revealed. An intention 
 
 
to  kill  at  the  time  was  clearly  established.  In  interviews  with  the  police  you  referred  to  your 
relationship with your wife having got worse over the previous 12 months. 
 
The careful examination of you by 3 psychiatrists confirms that there had been a deteriorating 
relationship  with  your  wife  over  the  relatively  recent  past  and  that  you  were  suffering  from 
 
depression. However the balance of medical opinion is that treatment in a mental hospital under 
the terms of a Hospital Order is not required. 
 
You have written a very moving letter to me which indicates a very genuine remorse and shows 
 
your concern for your family as a consequence of acts which it is clear you greatly regret and 
 
which  would  not  have  occurred  but  for  the  situation  you  found  yourself  in  very  strongly 
influenced by your medical condition. 
 

Page 2 of 3
--------
The tragedy has affected all of your family and you greatly and inflicted emotional damage which 
can never be repaired. The fact that you have the support of your family is something for which 
they are to be commended. 
 
 
In  deciding  the  appropriate  sentence  the  first  principle  is  that  whatever  the  mitigation,  this 
 
offence can only be punished by the imposition of a sentence which results in loss of liberty. So 
there must be a sentence of imprisonment because no alternative sentence is available. This is not 
 
a case for an indeterminate sentence. The length of the sentence must reflect the seriousness of 
the offence and the result, but that can be tempered by the fact that you are aged 76, you were 75 
 
at the time of the offence, and you not only have no previous convictions of any kind but led a 
thoroughly decent life, serving in the Royal Air Force for many years, working hard, bringing up 
and caring for your family. 
 
I  have  considered  reported  cases  of  sentencing  for  diminished  responsibility,  many  of  which 
 
result in a medical disposal which is not appropriate for you. There is no reported case which 
assists me. 
 
 
Although the plea of guilty was entered on the day the case was listed for trial it is appropriate to 
give more credit than the minimum because the plea was notified shortly before the trial and this 
was a case in which it was appropriate to await the psychiatric reports before giving you advice 
on your plea. In those circumstances I shall reduce the sentence by one third to give credit for 
your plea of guilty. 
 
 
Taking into account all the factors I have mentioned the sentence of the court for the offence of 
manslaughter is a sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment.

with a scarf to mask your face. No privacy settings were applied, with the result that the material 
 
posted on it was accessible to anyone with an Internet connection and a Facebook account. This 
 
means that you posted the material in such a way that millions of people could gain access to it. 
  
 
Count 1 concerns a video entitled “The Execution of American Soldier Nick Berg”. 
 
This video records the beheading of Nick Berg an American who was captured during the Iraq 
 
conflict. The execution was carried out by Al Zarqawi a senior Al‐Qaida figure in Iraq, who is believed 
 
to have been responsible for numerous acts of terrorism including bombings and beheadings. The 
 
video also contains footage of the beheading of an unknown man who is referred to as the 
 
“slaughtering of one of the spies who inform about the explosive devices south of Mosul”. This is 
 
 
followed by footage of the beheading of an Iraqi Army major, referred to as an Iraqi Army criminal. 
 
 
Count 2 concerns a video which depicts men in Islamic dress armed with machine guns attacking 
 
vehicles by firing on them. There are references to fighting the Americans and targeting vehicles of 
 
 
Jews and Christians who are referred to as enemies who invaded Afghanistan unjustly. There are 
 
numerous references to Jihad. This video footage is clearly intended to glorify terrorism and 
 
 
encourage people to engage in terrorism.
--------
Count 3 contains similar references and shows armed Mujahideen firing weapons including mortars 
 
 
 
in terrorist attacks and firing at a helicopter. It shows the assembling of an explosive device. There 
 
 
are several references to martyrdom, destroying Jews and Christians. This is clearly another 
 
promotional video glorifying terrorist acts and encouraging others to join. 
 
 
Finally Count 4 concerns the document  entitled “Communiqué from Al Qaida in the Islamic 
 
 
Maghreb: to our Fellow Muslims in Tunisia”. This refers to the rebellion in Tunisia as a jihad and 
 
 
 
suggests that an apostate regime remains in power, that the rebels should remain prepared and not 
 
lay down their weapons until the true religion and Islamic Law are reinstated. Americans and French 
 
people are referred to as “Crusaders”. Again this document I s clearly encouraging people to help the 
 
cause of Islam. 
 
 
 
 
It has been necessary for me to watch these video clips. The content, particularly that of Count 1, is 
 
horrific and disgusting. It beggars belief that anyone can have an interest in such material which 
 
 
reveals a shocking and barbaric depravity and complete absence of any degree of humanity. There is 
 
no doubt that this and the other videos have been created in order to encourage people to rally to 
 
 
the terrorist cause, however difficult it is to comprehend that such material would have that result 
 
 
except for the most perverted of minds. This material is intended to glorify acts of terrorism and 
 
encourage recruits and I am satisfied that that was your object in disseminating it. 
 
 
In my judgement this is a very serious case of its kind. I have considered the case of Regina v Abdul 
 
 
Rahman and Bilal Mohammed [2008] EWCA Crim 1465 in which the Court of Appeal Criminal Division 
 
 
presided over by the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, gave some guidance 
  
as to the approach to sentencing for this type of offence. 
 
 
Whether the defendant intended dissemination of the material or was merely reckless is a factor to 
 
be taken into account. The investigation revealed that you have also linked up with other apparently 
 
Jihadist Facebook accounts. There are numerous anti‐Israel and anti‐American items on your 
 
computer. Analysis of the computer revealed searches by you showing your interest in extreme 
 
Islamist issues and violence. I am quite satisfied that the evidence establishes a deliberate intention 
 
on your part to disseminate the material – this is not a case of recklessness. 
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal stated that sentences for this kind of offence may take into account deterrence 
 
and I consider that in the circumstances of this case that is appropriate. 
 
 
The nature of the material is clearly significant – this is material which shows extreme violence and 
 
which is intended to glorify acts of terrorism. The quantity of material disseminated is also important 
 
 
 
– there are 4 counts and some of the items are extensive. It must also be significant that the manner 
 
 
in which this material was disseminated by you was such, by using a very accessible social networking 
 
site, that you intended it to be widely available. 
 
 
 
The maximum sentence for these offences is 7 years imprisonment. It is appropriate for the 
 
sentences to be concurrent. 
 
 
The offence of possession of a prohibited weapon is an offence of a different nature. The CS gas 
 
canister was labelled “Self Defender” and contained CS gas. It was in working order, capable of 
 
 
discharging gas.. The maximum sentence for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. Given the nature 
 
 
of this weapon a relatively short sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate and it would be 
 
appropriate to order it to run consecutively. However the court must also take into account the 
 
totality of the sentence.

I have considered with care both the pre‐sentence report and the psychiatric report. It seems likely 
 
 
that your extensive drug abuse, referred to in the psychiatric report and as revealed in your previous 
 
convictions, has had some influence on your behaviour, but there is no indication of any serious 
 
mental illness or personality disorder which justifies any approach to this case other than to impose a 
 
sentence of imprisonment. 
 
 
In mitigation it has been submitted that I should take account of the fact that there was no intention 
 
on your part to commit an act of terrorism, and that you did not have the means to do so. However 
 
the gravamen of this offence is the dissemination of material which might encourage others to do so. 
 
 
It has also been submitted that your interest in Islam and the extreme form of it may have been 
 
instilled in you by others, but as has been rightly conceded this is a circular argument because your 
 
conduct may well have had the same effect on others. It is appropriate to note that the material you 
 
 
disseminated was gathered from other sites. 
 
 
It has been submitted that your case is on all fours with the case of Regina v Mohammed Gul [2012] 
 
EWCA Crim 280 in which sentences of 5 years after a trial were upheld. Although the material in 
 
Counts 2, 3 and 4 appears to be very similar to that in Gul the terrible videos of beheading did not 
 
feature in that case, and in my judgment that means that this case is a more serious one than Gul. 
 
  
Your pleas of guilty to Counts 1 to 4 were entered at a relatively late stage in the proceedings a few 
 
weeks before the case was to be tried. I shall give some credit for the pleas in accordance with the 
 
Guidelines. 
 
 
Had you been convicted of the Terrorism Act offences in Counts 1 to 4 after a trial the sentence 
 
would have been one of 6 years imprisonment. I shall reduce that to 5 years imprisonment to give 
 
 
credit for your pleas of guilty. That will be five years imprisonment on each of Counts 1 to 4 
 
concurrent. 
  
 
For the offence of possession of a prohibited weapon, Count 5, there will be a sentence of 8 months 
 
 
imprisonment, which will be a concurrent sentence to take account of totality. 
 
 
That means that the overall sentence is one of 5 years imprisonment. I direct that any days served on 
 
remand will count towards that sentence. 
 
 
The computer and CS gas canister seized will be forfeited for destruction. 
 
 
By virtue of the sentences imposed you are now subject to the notification requirements of the 
 
 
Counter Terrorism Act 2008 – as I understand the provisions you will be subject to those 
 
requirements for a period of 15 years.

2225587,R v Michael Brewer and Hillary Kaye Brewer,"1.	  Michael Brewer. You are 68 years of age. On 8th February 2013 you were 

 

convicted by a jury of five sample counts of indecent assault.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
HIS HONOUR JUDGE MARTIN RUDLAND 

 

MANCHESTER CROWN COURT 
 

 

 
 
R
 
-V-


 
MICHAEL BREWER
 

 
AND
 

 
HILLARY KAYE BREWER
 

 

26 MARCH 2013 

 

 
SENTENCING  REMARKS 

 

 

2.	  Hillary Kay Brewer. You are also now 68 years of age. You too were convicted 
 

by the jury of a single specific offence of indecent assault. 
 

 

3.	  Neither of you has any previous convictions. I shall deal with each of your 

cases separately. 
 

       

  Michael Brewer 

 

 

4.	  In your case Michael Brewer the offences arose between 1979 and 1980 when 
you were the Director of Music at Chetham’s School of Music an educational 
establishment of world renown. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.	  The victim of all these offences, Frances Andrade, or Frances Shorney as she 
then was, was a pupil at the school from the age of 14 and aged a little over 14 
 
when you first began to commit offences against her.  

 

 

6.	  Those offences continued until she was 16 when, as the law then stood, the 

 

 

activity, to which she was submitting ceased to be unlawful. 

7.	  I wish to make it clear that I will also be making reference to the 
 

 

 

 

circumstances concerning your relationship with, another pupil, whom I shall 
call M, who was at a much later stage under your care. However, it is in order 
solely to inform the situation concerning Frances Andrade. I do so because it 
shows that you had a particular sexual interest in your pupils. 

 

 

1
--------
8.	  I wish to acknowledge the terribly sad and tragic death of Mrs Andrade during 

 

the course of these proceedings. However, it is not for this court to inquire 
into the circumstances of her death - that will be considered by others in a 
 
different jurisdiction. Whilst this court has the deepest sympathy for Mrs 
Andrade’s family I am not able to take her death into consideration when 
passing sentence today. 

 

 

 

 

9.	  Whilst you have been convicted of these serious offences - I also have to pay 
regard to the fact that you have over many years pursued an outstanding and 
highly successful career in the field of music. You have enthused many young 
people with your teaching. Countless individuals have been drawn to and led 
 
their own eventful and distinguished musical careers on the international 
 
stage as a result of your commitment, ability and inspiration. Many have 
 
written to the court to confirm these matters. You have had an impressive 
career but that is now at an end. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10. Sadly there is another side to you and it is this. You were, and may still be, a 

 

predatory sex offender. Of that let no-one be in any doubt. You offended 
against Frances Andrade when she was but 14 years old and you were about 
34. She was a child in your care as her teacher. You used your powerful 
 
position to select and groom your victims. The situation was compounded by 
the fact that the position you occupied enabled you to do so, as you chose, 
with little, if any, prospect of challenge from anyone else. The extent of your 
breach of trust in this case cannot be overstated. 

 

 

11.  I made reference to victims in the plural. Your interest in Frances Andrade 
was not the only occasion on which you had sexual designs on a pupil.  You 
conducted a sexual relationship with another pupil, to whom I will refer as M, 
many years later. She had a crush on you which again you exploited 
incrementally solely for the purposes of sexual gratification. 

 

 

12.  Yet another pupil, to whom I shall refer as R, was also the object of your 
 

unwanted attention when you clearly wished to have sexual contact with her 
but she was brave enough and strong enough to stand up to you and nothing 
occurred.  

 

13.  Frances Andrade did not have that strength because her abiding desire was to 
be cared for and cherished by a loving family to which she craved to belong. In 
that respect the care and attention which you gave her, in so manipulative and 
depraved a way, were regarded by her as blessings. She was prepared to 
submit to almost anything, which clearly she did, as you pushed the 
 
boundaries further and further – treating her as your sexual plaything in the 
context of a false loving relationship which she readily accepted. 

 

 

 

14.  It is surprising that all those who have spoken so well of you at your trial, 

 

 

when called by you in your defence, did so, it seems, in the full knowledge of 
your relationship with M. It may well be that they were not aware of the detail 
of the way in which you exploited her but they were apparently nevertheless 
more than happy to overlook one of the most shocking aspects of this case. 

 

 

15.  Indeed, perhaps one of the few positive features to have emerged from this 
case is the resulting close scrutiny of the seemingly wider acceptance of this 
type of behaviour amongst those who should know better. 

2
--------
16.  So far as the sentence is concerned it is important to analyse and explain the 

 

features which will affect the sentencing process having regard to the fact that 
the maximum sentence for each of the individual offences of which you have 
been convicted is one of two years for a single offence taken in isolation. 

 

 
17.  The law dictates that I must sentence you in accordance with the law which 

 

was in force at the time you committed these offences but applied in the 
context of authority from the Court of Appeal (particularly the case of R -v- H 
[2011] EWCA Crim 2753) which requires a measured regard to current 
Sentencing Guidelines relevant to the situation revealed by the established 
facts. 

 

 
18. In this respect I have had regard to the current guidelines in respect of 

 

offences of Sexual Assault of a child aged over 13 and Sexual Activity with a 
 
Child under the age of 16. In general terms those guidelines indicate a range 
of sentences after a trial not exceeding 7 years – the upper end reflecting the 
type of aggravating features which are present in this case. 

 

 

 
19.  What is particularly noteworthy in your case Michael Brewer is that you were 
 
neither young nor immature at the time of the offending and it cannot be said 
that a sexual interest in those in your care was confined to Mrs Andrade and 
you can gain no credit for a guilty plea. 

 
20. In your case the counts on the indictment are sample counts - each reflective 
therefore of more than one event and also different circumstances and time 
periods. 

 

21.  It is therefore necessary to consider in some detail the offences of which you 

 

have been convicted and in particular the period of time over which they took 
place, the frequency with which they took place, your age and the age of your 
victim during that period, the varying nature of the activities in question, the 
 
varying circumstances in which the offences were committed and the overall 
position occupied by you in relation to your victim throughout the period of 
your offending. 

 

 

22. As always the particular circumstances in which the offences were committed 

 
and their seriousness must be the main focus. 

23. Mrs Andrade described your offending as beginning with hugs and kisses 

 
which progressed to the removal of her clothing, fondling her breasts, digitally 
penetrating her vagina and culminating in her performing oral sex on you on 
some occasions to the point of ejaculation. She described this routine of 
sexual misadventure as rapidly becoming a daily occurrence either in your 
office or the practice rooms with the activities intensifying as she attained the 
age of 15. 

 

24. Your activity was accompanied by compliments and flattery as you built up 

 
her self esteem and willingness to do your sexual bidding. 

 

 

25. Of the offences of which the jury convicted you:- 

 

 
26. Count 1 reflects frequent digital penetration of her vagina in your office when 

 

 
she was aged 14. 

3
--------
27. Count 7 reflects frequent digital penetration of her vagina in your office when 

 

 

she was aged 15. 

28. Count 2 reflects the many occasions when you placed your penis in her mouth 

 
in your office when she was aged 14. 

29. Count 8 represents the many occasions when you placed your penis in her 

 
mouth in your office when she was aged 15. 

 
30. Count 11 represents the occasions when you placed your penis in her mouth 

 
while driving the camper van when she was aged 15. 

31.  There is a distinction to be drawn in my view between offences whatever their 

 

nature which occurred when the complainant was as young as 14 and those 
which took place when she was 15 and leading up to her 16th birthday. 
 

32. There is also a distinction to be drawn between digital penetration and the 

 
more serious act of placing your penis in her mouth. 

33. To reflect those distinctions therefore and the frequency of your offending 
 

 
overall it is in my judgment appropriate to impose consecutive sentences in 
relation to the differing circumstances of the offences and her age when you 
were committing them. 

 

 

 
34. Together with a file of references I have seen, read and considered in your 
 
case a pre-sentence report prepared by Sara Blake dated 25th March. I have 
also considered the matters raised by Miss Blackwell QC on your behalf. 

35. In respect of counts 1 and 7 there will be sentences of 15 months 

 

imprisonment on each count which will be consecutive. 

36. Consecutive to those consecutive sentences in relation to counts 2 and 8 there 

 
will be on each count consecutive sentences of 21 months imprisonment.  

37. In respect of count 11 there will be a concurrent sentence of 21 months 

 

imprisonment. 

  
38. The total sentence is therefore one of 6 years imprisonment. 

 

 

 
39. Parliament has decided that you will serve half of this sentence in prison and 
the rest on licence. Time already served will be automatically deducted from 
the custodial element of the sentence. 

 

 

 

 
40. Following your release and for the rest of your life you will be required to 

 
register every change of address with the police and you will in due course be 
 
contacted by the Disclosure and Barring Service concerning restrictions 
relating to future contact with children and young people.  
 

 

4
--------
Hillary Kay Brewer 
 

 

 

41.  You have been convicted of a single offence of indecent assault which took 

place in 1981. That is count 15 on the indictment. This occurred when Frances 
 
Andrade was a guest in your home and had no reason to suppose that she 
would become the subject of your malevolent sexual desires. 
  

 

 

43. You have for many years clothed yourself in a cloak of Christian respectability 

 
42. You have to a degree been in the shadow of your former husband during these 
proceedings but in the final event you have emerged as someone who colluded 
in his offending and who had a sexual agenda of your own. 
 
 
doing good work for the community and gaining the admiration of others, 
some of whom gave evidence on your behalf during the trial. Others have 
 
written to the court to express similar sentiments on your behalf. I have no 
 
reason to suppose that the words they spoke or wrote were anything other 
than genuine. 
 
 
44. However, beneath your latter-day outward good character and desire to care 
for others you conceal a secret; namely that you preyed upon and exploited a 
young girl who was vulnerable, pliable and whom you knew was also being 
exploited sexually by your husband. 

 

 

45. In those circumstances you assaulted her in a way which Mrs Andrade 

 
described as brutal. She said in evidence that you assaulted her in such a 
manner because she told you, at the time of the commission of the offence, 
 
that if you touched her she would not be able to feel anything - such had been 
the numbing effect of ongoing abuse by your husband and possibly others.  
 
 
way in your desire to gain a response from her. You also masturbated yourself 
in her presence as a preliminary to the physical assault. She was still only 18 
years of age. 

46. For that reason, she said, you digitally penetrated her in a particularly rough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47. In your case also your conduct in relation to the pupil M informs the attitude 
you have towards wholly improper relationships between teachers and pupils 
willing as you were, in spite of being a teacher yourself, to condone your then 
49 year old husband’s desire to associate with a 17 year old pupil. Indeed, you 
said yourself in evidence, that you were “happy that he had found someone he 
was fond of”. That was an extraordinary attitude to take and provides perhaps 
some insight of your own offending. 

48. Mrs Andrade described you in her evidence as a good person who made a 

 
 
huge mistake on one occasion. I cannot and do not comment on that 
 
assessment. What is clear is that the one occasion with which the court is 
concerned, and confines itself, involves an ugly and serious incident which 
must have had a terrible and hugely confusing effect on your 18 year old 
victim. 

 

 

 

49. She had always regarded you as a stable mother figure in her life irrespective 

 
of the attention she had been receiving from Michael Brewer. On this 
 
occasion, to her horror, she was betrayed and abused by you as well. 

 

5
--------
50. In the face of your denials the jury convicted you of the assault which Mrs 

 
Andrade described - committed as it was, in the way it was and in the 
circumstances it was.  

 

51.  I have seen and read the references provided on your behalf and the pre-

 

 

 

sentence report prepared by Christine Johnson dated the 11th March. 

52. I have listened with care to everything which Miss Baxter has said on your 
 

 

behalf. 

53. In the end there can be no alternative but to impose a custodial sentence 
 

 

 

which in your case will be a sentence of 21months.  

 
54. Your case is also subject to the fact that Parliament has decided that you will 
serve half of this sentence in prison and the rest on licence. In your case also 
time already served will be automatically deducted from the custodial element 
of the sentence. 

 

55. Having regard to the age of the victim at the time of the commission of the 

 

 

offence and the fact that I am confined by law to keep any sentence under 30 
 
months - there can be no ongoing registration requirement in your case nor 
do I consider any further order to be necessary for the protection of the 
public.

Approved Judgment

Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
 

Press Association -v- Cambridge Crown Court 

 
1.	 

This is an appeal by the Press Association (PA) against orders made by His Honour 
Judge Hawksworth at Cambridge Crown Court on 16 April 2012. 

 
2.	 

On that date he made: 

 
i)	 

an  order  (the  initial  order)  under  s.4(11)  (plainly  a  typographical  error  for 
s.4(2))  of  the  Contempt  of  Court  Act  1981  (the  1981  Act)  imposing  an 
indefinite prohibition on the publication of “anything relating to the name of 
the defendant which could lead to the identification of the complainant which 
could have serious consequences for the course of justice.” 

This was followed shortly afterwards by: 

 
ii)	 

an  order  superseding  the  initial  order  (the  order)  under  s.1(2)  of  the  Sexual 
Offences  (Amendment)  Act  1992  (the  1992  Act),  again  imposing  a 
prohibition, unlimited in time, on the publication of “anything relating to the 
name  of  the  defendant  which  could  lead  to  the  identification  of  the 
complainant which could have serious consequences for the course of justice.” 

A  cursory  glance  at  these  orders  underlines  that  the  issue  raised  in  the  appeal  is 
 
directed to the openness of the administration of criminal justice and the jurisdiction, 
 
if any, of the Crown Court to make an order restricting publication of the name of a 
 
defendant convicted of sexual offences for the purpose of protecting the interests of 
others, in particular the complainant. 

We shall briefly summarise the essential facts. 

On 14 February 2012 the defendant was found guilty of five counts of rape (counts 1-
5) and four counts of breaching a restraining order (counts 6-9). The trial had taken 
 
place in open court and the case had been listed under the defendant’s full name.  On 
 
16 April a sentence of imprisonment for public protection, with a minimum term of 8 
years and 273 days, was imposed on him. 
 

On that date counsel for the prosecution (Ms Matthews) and counsel for the defendant 
 
appeared before the judge.  According to Ms Matthews she was not seeking an order 
 
which would prohibit the publication of the defendant’s name; she merely wanted to 
draw to the judge’s attention – and for him to alert the press – to the concerns which 
would arise if the defendant’s name were published.  In this way, the ambit of any 
proposed  reporting  of  the  case  would  be  clear  and  the  risk  that  the  media  would 
inadvertently undermine the complainant’s anonymity by publishing the defendant’s 
 
name would be avoided.  Whatever her intention, the judge plainly thought that Ms

Matthews  was  seeking  an  order  to  impose  a  prohibition  on  the  publication  of  the 
 
defendant’s  name.    The  judge  made  the  initial  order  under  s.4(2)  of  the  1981  Act. 
 
Thereafter, however, a representative of the local press persuaded the judge that s.4(2) 
 
of the 1981 Act did not apply.  The judge remained concerned about the consequences 
 
for the complainant if the identification of the defendant led to her identification.  He 
 
was concerned, both about the possible impact on her health and wellbeing and about 
other  risks  (upon  which  it  is  unnecessary  to  elaborate)  should  the  complainant’s 
family become aware of these offences and the defendant’s responsibility for them. 
We  understand  the  concerns  of  the  judge,  and  readily  acknowledge  that  he  was 
 
proceeding with the best of intentions, namely the protection of a woman who had 
been the victim of grave crime committed by the defendant. Thus informed, the judge 
 
weighed up the freedom of the press on the one hand and the consequences for the 
complainant on the other.  He underlined that the press was free to publish the facts of 
the offences and the sentence passed on the defendant; he did not see how the public 
interest would be “further bolstered by simply the publication of the man’s name …”. 
Accordingly,  having  carried  out  the  balancing  exercise  he  believed  appropriate,  the 
judge  decided  to  continue  the  initial  order,  but  using  a  different  section  for  this 
purpose: hence the order under s.1(2) of the 1992 Act. 

 

The applicable statutory provisions 
 

 
7.	 

Section 4(2) of the 1981 Act provides: 

“In any such proceedings (i.e. legal proceedings held in public) 
the  court  may,  where  it  appears  necessary  for  avoiding  a 
 
substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in 
 
those  proceedings,  or  in  any  other  proceedings  pending  or 
imminent,  order  that  the  publication  of  any  report  of  the 
 
proceedings, or any part of the proceedings, be postponed for 
such period as the court thinks necessary for that purpose.” 

 
8.	 

Section 11 provides: 

“In any case where a court (having the power to do so) allows a 
name  or  other  matter  to  be  withheld  from  the  public  in 
proceedings  before  the  court,  the  court  may  give  such 
directions prohibiting the publication of that name or matter in 
connection  with  the  proceedings  as  appear  to  the  court  to  be 
necessary for the purpose for which it was so withheld”. 

 

 
9.	 

The 1992 Act, as its preamble makes clear, makes provision relating to anonymity in 
connection  with  allegations  and  criminal  proceedings  relating  to  certain  sexual 
offences.  Section 1 provides, inter alia: 

“(1)  where  an  allegation  has  been  made  that  an  offence  to 
 
which this Act applies has been committed against the person, 
no  matter  relating  to  that  person  shall  during  that  person’s 
lifetime  be  included  in  any  publication  if  it  is  likely  to  lead
--------

Press Association -v- Cambridge Crown Court 

members  of  the  public  to  identify  that  person  as  the  person 
against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed. 

(2) where a person is accused of an offence to which this Act 
applies,  no  matter  likely  to  lead  members  of  the  public  to 
identify  a  person  as  the  person  against  whom  the  offence  is 
alleged to have been committed shall during the complainant’s 
 
lifetime be included in any publication”. 

It  is  a  criminal  offence  to  contravene  section  1  of  the  Act,  whether  by  naming  or 
 
enabling a “jigsaw” identification to be made.  The ambit of the offence is not limited 
to the press.  In short, it encompasses publication of prohibited material by anyone by 
whatever  means  publication  occurs,  and  extends  to  bloggers  and  twitterers  or  any 
other commentators.  However, we note that the sentence is confined to a financial 
 
penalty.  Whether this is always a sufficient punishment for those who deliberately 
breach the anonymity of the victim of sexual crime appears to us to require urgent 
 
reconsideration. 

The submissions 

PA’s ground of appeal, admirably addressed in writing (and developed briefly orally), 
by  Mr  Dodd,  was  that  the  judge  had  no  power  to  make  an  order  anonymising  the 
 
defendant, whether under ss.4(2) or 11 of the 1981 Act or s.1(2) of the 1992 Act.  So 
far  as  the  1992  Act  was  concerned,  the  responsibility  for  ensuring  the  lifelong 
anonymity  granted  to  victims  of  certain  offences  under  s.1,  rested  with  the  editors, 
and  those  reporting  any  trial,  not  with  the  court.    The  press  was  well  aware  that  a 
breach  of  the  anonymity  provisions  in  the  1992  Act  would  give  rise  to  a  criminal 
offence  and  editors  were  reminded  of  their responsibilities  by  the  Editors’  Code  of 
 
Practice.  He  contended  that  Parliament  having  considered  and  rejected  the 
reintroduction of anonymity for defendants in cases involving sexual crime, it was not 
 
open to the court to achieve the same result by way of injunctive result; there was no 
inherent jurisdiction to restrain publication in this way.  Mr Dodd underlined that the 
interest of the PA did not lie in the particular trial itself, but the issue was of major 
importance  to  the  press,  and  he  expressed  considerable  concern  at  the  apparent 
willingness  of  some  courts  to  make  orders  that  were  unnecessary  or  beyond  their 
powers. 

As we understand Ms Matthews for the Crown, she conceded that there was no power 
to make an order under the 1992 Act and that indeed the order in the present case was 
unnecessary.  She  submitted  that  the  statute  conferred  automatic  anonymity  on 
complainants who were the victims of sexual crime.  She likewise conceded that there 
had been no power to make the order under the 1981 Act, not least because there had 
been no reporting restrictions during the trial itself.  All that accepted, she suggested 
that  it  was  appropriate  for  the  judge  to  give  guidance  and  directions  to  the  proper 
 
ambit of what could be reported.  She added that the Crown Court was under a duty 
“to  protect  the  anonymity”  of  a  complainant  which  fell  within  the  ambit  of  the

11.

Press Association -v- Cambridge Crown Court 

anonymity  principles,  although  in  argument  she  was  unable  to  elaborate  how  this 
might be fulfilled. 

 

12.	  Mr Mably, who was invited to make submissions as the Friend of the Court appointed 
by  the  Attorney  General,  submitted  that  the  Crown  Court  is  vested  with  power  to 
order at the outset of proceedings that a defendant should not be named in two limited 
 
circumstances.  First, that the interests of justice require it, and second, if the court is 
satisfied that there is a real and immediate risk to the life of the defendant.  This can 
be achieved by ordering a trial in camera or withholding the name of the defendant. 
 
However, he agreed that the Crown Court lacks jurisdiction to make a free-standing 
order that the defendant is not to be named before, during or after the conclusion of 
 
proceedings simply because it appears to be desirable to do so. 

The 1981 Act 

 
13.	 

As we have indicated, the judge relied on s.4(2) of the Act when making the initial 
order.  These  orders  are  intended  to  avoid  “a  substantial  risk  of  prejudice”  to  the 
proceedings to which they are made, or to linked or related proceedings, such as a 
subsequent trial involving the same defendants or witnesses.  Other examples of the 
 
use  of  the  power  in  s.4(2)  can  be  found  in  prohibitions  against  the  publication  of 
evidence  or  argument  before  the  judge  in  the  absence  of  the  jury  and,  after  a 
successful  appeal  against  conviction,  when  a  new  trial  is  ordered  and,  to  avoid 
prejudice to any retrial, an appropriate order is made.  An order under s.4(2) should, 
however, only be made when it is necessary to do so and as a last resort.  Suffice it to 
say that here, at the time of the making of the initial order, the defendant had been 
tried, convicted and sentenced in public, without any order restricting publication of 
his identity, and there were no pending proceedings which might be prejudiced by the 
publication of his name. Essentially too, s.4(2) as its wording suggests, is aimed at the 
 
postponement  of  publication  rather  than  a  permanent  ban.    An  order  prohibiting 
publication for an indefinite period carries with it the natural inference not merely that 
the  publication  has  simply  been  postponed,  but  that  a  permanent  ban  had  been 
imposed.    Accordingly,  s.4(2)  was,  as  the  judge  swiftly  recognised,  inapt  for  the 
making of the initial order. 

 

14.	  When making his ruling the judge made no reference to s.11 of the 1981 Act and, for 
 
completeness,  it  is  plain  that  this  section  could  not  have  been  relied  on  as  the 
foundation for the initial order.  Section 11 does not arise for consideration unless the 
 
court, having the power to do so, withholds the name or other matter from the public 
in  the  proceedings  before  it  (see  R  v  Arundel  Justices  ex  parte  Westminster  Press 
Limited  [1985]  1  WLR  708  and  in  Re  Trinity  Mirror  plc  [2008]  QB  770).  It  was 
 
therefore a pre-condition to the making of the order on the basis of s.11 that the name 
of the defendant should have been withheld throughout the proceedings.

The 1992 Act 

Press Association -v- Cambridge Crown Court 

 

15.	  We  therefore  turn  to  the  provisions  of  the  1992  Act.    Section  1  confers  lifelong 
anonymity on complainants in cases which involve sexual offences to which the 1992 
Act  applies.  What  however  cannot  be  found  in  the  Act  is  the  conferring  of  any 
express power on the court to make an order restricting publication of the defendant’s 
name in order to protect or enforce a complainant’s right to anonymity.  There are, as 
 
it seems to us, a number of difficulties in reading any such power into the 1992 Act. 
First, the absence of an express power to make such an order is telling.  All the more 
so,  given  that  the  only  express  power  to  make  an  order  impacting  on  the 
complainant’s right to anonymity under s.1 is conferred by s.3, which provides that 
the  judge  may  give  a  direction  which  lifts  the  anonymity  of  the  complainant  in  a 
number  of  carefully  defined  situations  where  the  interests  of  justice  so  require. 
  
Second, on the face of it there is no need for any such power.  The complainant enjoys 
 
the  protection  provided  by  s.1,  and  a  contravention  of  the  complainant’s  right  to 
anonymity involves the commission of a criminal offence.  Third, the absence of a 
 
judicial power to restrict publication provides a clear demarcation of responsibility. 
 
Decisions about what should or should not be published in a newspaper, or for that 
 
matter in the media generally, are left to editors and reporters. As we have explained, 
if section 1 is contravened, they face criminal prosecution.   

 

 
16.	 

It is clear from this legislative provision that the responsibility for decisions relating 
to publication is aligned with risk, and it is for those responsible for publication to 
ensure that the provisions which protect the public identification of a complainant in a 
sexual case are obeyed.  They do so, however, not because they are enjoined to do so 
by  judicial  order,  but  because  that  is  a  statutory  requirement.    In  the  matter  of  B 
 
[2006] EWCA Crim. 2692, at paragraph 25, this court made plain that: 

 

“The  responsibility  for  avoiding  the  publication  of  material 
which  may  prejudice  the  outcome  of  a  trial  rests  fairly  and 
squarely on those responsible for the publication.  In our view, 
broadcasting  authorities  and  newspaper  editors  should  be 
 
trusted  to  fulfil  their  responsibilities  accurately  to  inform  the 
public of court proceedings, and to exercise sensible judgment 
about the publication of comment which may interfere with the 
administration  of  justice.    They  have  access  to  the  best  legal 
advice; they have their own personal judgments to make.  The 
risk of being in contempt of court for damaging the interests of 
justice is not one which any responsible editor would wish to 
take.  In itself that is an important safeguard, and it should not 
 
be overlooked simply because there are occasions when there is 
 
widespread  and  ill-judged  publicity  in  some  parts  of  the 
media”. 

 

Precisely the same approach should be taken to the risks and responsibilities involved 
in  publication  of  material  derived  from  the  trial  which  may  identify  a  complainant 
 
who is entitled to anonymity.

17.	 

For these reasons we are wholly unpersuaded that any power which vests a judge with 
jurisdiction to make an order that a defendant should be given anonymity, even when 
the purpose of the order is to protect the anonymity of the complainant, can be read 
into  the  1992  Act.  Looking  at  the  matter  broadly,  any  such  powers  are  not  to  be 
 
lightly inferred.  There are very good reasons why defendants are not provided with 
anonymity, particularly after they have been convicted. For example, in In re Trinity 
Mirror plc. the defendant pleaded guilty to child pornography offences.  In the Crown 
Court a judge granted an injunction to prohibit the identification of the defendant and 
his children in order to protect the children’s ECHR rights.  A five judge constitution 
of this court allowed an appeal by news media organisations.  The decision turned on 
the jurisdiction of the Crown Court.  However we underline these observations:   

 

 

“32.  In  our  judgment  it  is  impossible  to  over  emphasise  the 
importance to be attached to the ability of the media to report 
criminal trials.  In simple terms this represents the embodiment 
of the principle of open justice in a free country.  An important 
aspect  of  the  public  interest  in  the  administration  of  criminal 
justice is that the identity of those convicted and sentenced for 
 
criminal  offences  should  not  be  concealed.    Uncomfortable 
though it may frequently be for the defendant that is a normal 
 
consequence of his crime…  From time to time occasions will 
arise  where  restrictions  on  this  principle  are  considered 
 
appropriate, but they depend on express legislation, and, where 
the court is vested with a discretion to exercise such powers, on 
the absolute necessity for doing so in the individual case”. 

Conclusion 

 

18.	  We are not here concerned with the kind of extreme case where the identification of 
 
the defendant would imperil his life or safety or that of his family.  As Lord Rodger 
explained in In re Guardian News and Media Limited [2010] 2 AC 697 at para 26: 

“…  in  an  appropriate  case,  where  threats  to  life  or  safety  are 
involved,  the  right  of  the  press  to  freedom  of  expression 
obviously has to yield: a newspaper does not have the right to 
publish information at the known potential cost of an individual 
being killed or maimed.  In such a situation the court may make 
an anonymity order to protect the individual”. 

Mr Dodd, rightly in our view, accepted that such a situation, or indeed a significant 
threat  to  the  administration  of  justice,  might  lead  to  an  anonymity  order.  This  may 
arise at any time although we agree with him that the imposition of some anonymity 
on the identity of the defendant when his identity had not been concealed during the 
 
hearing would be extremely rare.  More important, considerations like these did not 
form the basis for the anonymity direction in the present case.

20.	 

Neither of the present orders, whether made under the 1981 Act or the 1992 Act, can 
be  sustained.  The  court  lacked  the  necessary  jurisdiction.    It  was  for  the  press  to 
decide  how  appropriately  to  report  the  case  so  as  to  ensure  the  anonymity  of  the 
complainant: it was not for the court to instruct the press how to do so by making an 
order  which  in  effect  imposed  a  blanket  prohibition  against  publication  of  the 
 
defendant’s name.  

Having emphasised what we believe to be the essential principles, we can deal briefly 
with two further submissions made on behalf of the PA about the 1992 Act.  It was 
suggested  by  Mr  Dodd  that  for  the  judge  to  give  any  guidance  to  the  press  risked 
 
usurpation of the editor’s discretion about what and how to publish.  There, we do not 
agree.  The judge is entitled to express concerns as to the possible consequences of 
publication,  and  indeed  to  engage  in  a  discussion  with  representatives  of  the  press 
 
present in court about these issues, whether on his own initiative, or in a response to a 
 
request from them. The judge is in charge of the court, and if he thinks it appropriate 
to offer comment, we anticipate that a responsible editor would carefully consider it 
before  deciding  what  should  be  published.    The  essential  point  is  that  whatever 
 
discussions  may  take  place,  the  judicial  observations  cannot  constitute  an  order 
binding  on  the  editor  or  the  reporter.    It  was  also  suggested  that  Rule  16.1  of  the 
 
Criminal Procedure Rules is less clear and inappropriate because it suggests that the 
 
court had a “general open-ended power” to “vary” as well as to remove the protection 
conferred by s.1 of the 1992 Act.  We do not agree.  The rules are entirely clear, and 
we do not think that Rule 16.1 can be read as providing the court with a power which 
has not been conferred on it by primary legislation.

The issue of whole life terms will shortly come before the Grand Chamber of the European Court of 
 
 
Human Rights. This Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Lady Justice Hallett, Lord Justice Hughes, 
 
Lord Justice Leveson and Lady Justice Rafferty) judgment sets out the principal reasons why such 
 
an order is not incompatible with Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights. 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court, sets out the background to the issues before the Court 
 
and the legislative context in paragraphs 1 – 30.

“Whatever  the  judicial  views  about  the  whole  life  minimum  term,  it  was  incorporated  in  express 
 
legislative  terms  in  the  2003  Act.  This  statutory  provision  reflects  the  settled  will  of  Parliament. 
  
Simultaneously, the legislation removed the possibility of imposing it from the executive and placed 
 
it full square in the hands of the judiciary, we emphasise, as a discretionary element of sentencing. 
 
  
The  issue  of  the  whole  life  order,  in  the  context  of  Article  3,  has  been  reflected  in  a  number  of 
 
decisions in the courts both domestically and in Europe.” (para 12) 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Court analysis the case law from the European Court before the Lord Chief Justice concludes: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“In short, it is open to the individual state, to make statutory provision for the imposition of a whole 
 
life minimum term, and in an appropriate case, as a matter of judicial discretion, for the court to 
 
 
make such an order.” (para 22) 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Lord Chief Justice went on to conclude: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“The result is that the whole life order, the product of primary legislation, is reserved for the few 
 
exceptionally  serious  offences  in  which,  after  reflecting  on  all  the  features  of  aggravation  and 
 
mitigation, the judge is satisfied that the element of just punishment and retribution requires the 
 
imposition of a whole life order.  If that conclusion is justified, the whole life order is appropriate: 
 
but only then.  It is not a mandatory or automatic or minimum sentence.

“We have reflected on these submissions.  It seems to us clear that [David Oakes] did not simply 
 
explode into violence as a result of the stresses and strains of the breakdown of his relationship. 
  
Rather, he decided to revenge himself on Christine Chambers.  He did not merely plan to kill her 
 
and their daughter, but he planned and then carried out his deliberate intention to make the death 
 
of his former partner as the most terrifying and agonising ordeal that he could envisage, and this 
 
was exactly what he did.  He was utterly merciless, and took pleasure at her prolonged suffering. 
  
Thereafter, quite deliberately, and in cold blood, he deliberately executed their daughter, as she 
 
was  screaming  with  fear  at  witnessing  what  he  had  been  doing  to  her  mother.  Although  two 
 
people were killed, one after the other in the same place, this was not to be regarded as a double 
 
murder  which  arose  from  a  single  incident:  it  was  a  pre‐meditated  double  murder,  with  two

Kieran Mark Stapleton 
 
 
Kieran Mark Stapleton was convicted of the murder of student on Boxing Day 2011. He was 
 
 
sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 30 years. 
 
 
The Court considers Kieran Mark Stapleton’s case in paragraphs 47 – 60. 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court, said: 
 
 
“Although the choice of victim was entirely random, there was a significant degree of pre‐meditation 
 
 
and he was sure that [Kieran Stapleton’s] intention was to kill and that at all material times he was 
 
 
fully in control of his actions. This was cold‐blooded controlled aggression.” (para 57) 
  
 
In dismissing Kieran Stapleton’s appeal against his sentence, the Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the 
 
Court, said:

connection with another offence.  It takes very little imagination to reflect on the impact that this 
 
offence would have had in the locality; a young man, utterly blameless, simply gunned down as he 
 
walked down the street, and perhaps the most chilling feature of all was the sheer randomness 
 
with which he was chosen to be the victim.  [Kieran Stapleton] had decided that he was going to 
 
kill someone, and he organised a loaded firearm, carried it, and executed his plan.  His attitude to 
 
the offence is chilling.  He has revelled in it.  That adds significantly to the seriousness of this crime.

Danilo Restivo 
 
 
Danilo Restivo was convicted in 2011 of the murder of Heather Barnett in 2002. He was sentenced to 
 
life imprisonment with a whole life tariff. 
  
 
The Court considers Danilo Restivo’s case in paragraphs 61 – 86. 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court, said: 
 
 
“When the judge summed the case up to the jury, he directed them, quite correctly, that the only 
 
court with jurisdiction to try [Danilo Restivo] for the murder of Elisa Clap and to convict him of the 
 
offence was an Italian court. … In short, therefore, [Danilo Restivo] was not tried for or convicted of 
 
 
the murder of Elisa Clap (a murder which he denied), and the verdict did not and could not carry with 
 
 
it the inevitable conclusion that the jury must have been sure that he had murdered her. ” (para 78) 
 
 
 
 
The Court went on to consider whether the trial judge was entitled to take into account his own 
 
assessment, made during the trial that the appellant has committed another earlier murder with 
 
which he was not charged and of which he had not been considered. (para 78) 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice concluded: 
 
 
“….  it is equally axiomatic that, situations such as these apart, a defendant cannot simply be 
 
sentenced for offences of which he has not been convicted, or on the basis that he has in fact 
 
 
committed them.  The ability of the judge to make findings that other offences have been 
 
committed does not extend to reaching a non‐jury verdict about allegations put before the jury by 
 
way of similar fact evidence, at least unless the jury must have been satisfied that they were 
 
 
proved, or unless the defendant has been convicted of them in the past.” (para 79) 
 
   
He went on to say: 
 
 
“In the present case [Danilo Restivo] could not be charged in this jurisdiction with the murder of Elisa 
 
Clap.  It was justiceable in Italy, not here. …” (para 84) 
 
 
“… Quite apart from the question whether in accordance with the law of Italy, the recent 
 
conviction, reached in the absence of the appellant, is to be regarded as a final conviction, when 
 
the sentence imposed in the Crown Court is based on a misapplication of principle, it should be 
 
corrected.  We must take the principled approach and proceed on the basis that it may at some 
 
future unspecified date be for the judicial authorities in Italy to decide what the appropriate 
 
sentence on the appellant should be for the murder of Elisa Clap. …. Moreover although a whole 
 
life term must be quashed, the minimum term, to which we now turn, must be very substantial 
 
 
indeed.” (para 85)

Given the date of the offence, the Court had to determine the minimum term in accordance with the 
 
transitional provisions in Schedule 22 of the 2003 Act. (para 86) 
 
 
However, in deciding the minimum term, the Lord Chief Justice concluded: 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“We note in particular the extensive preparation for the killing (which included careful measures to 
 
avoid  detection)  and  the  display  of  sexual  perversions  and  sadism,  not  least  the  appalling 
 
mutilation  of  the  body,  when  the  appellant  knew  perfectly  well  that  it  would  be  found  by  the 
 
victim’s children.  Thereafter, he was capable of brutal hypocrisy in his purported expressions of 
 
concern  and  assistance  offered  to  them.  A  combination  of  all  these  factors  leads  us  to  the 
 
conclusion that the minimum term should be fixed at 40 years.  This will replace the whole life 
 
 
term.” (para 86) 
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
Michael John Roberts 
 
 
Michael John Roberts was convicted in December 2011 of a number of historic burglaries, rapes and 
 
other serious offences. He was already serving a discretionary life sentence at the time of his trial 
 
and conviction. Following his subsequent convictions in 2011 he was sentence to a discretionary life 
 
 
sentence with a whole life term. 
 
 
The Court considers Michael John Roberts’ case in paragraphs 87 – 103. 
 
 
In giving judgment on behalf of the Court, the Lord Chief Justice said: 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“The essential argument advanced in this appeal is that although this was an extremely serious 
 
series  of  offences,  in  which  the  interests  of  public  safety  amply  justified  the  imposition  of  a 
 
 
discretionary  life  sentence,  the  whole  life  order  was  inappropriate  and  wrong  in  principle. 
In 
 
   
summary, among the cases where whole life orders had been imposed, none could be found in the 
 
 
context of sexual crime where one or more of the victims had not been murdered.  Without in any 
 
 
way  seeking  to  trivialise  the  ordeals  of  the  victims,  it  was  submitted  that  the  whole  life  order 
 
should be reserved for cases where the criminal went even further than MR had gone on any of 
 
these occasions.” (para 101)

“Like the Crown, which accepted that notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences a whole life 
 
order was inappropriate, we agree that there is force in this submission.  It is regrettably possible 
 
to envisage, and there have been cases, where dreadful sexual assaults have been followed by 
 
murderous violence.  The whole life order is reserved for the most exceptional cases.  Without 
 
suggesting that the court is prohibited from making a whole life order unless the defendant is 
 
 
convicted of at least one murder, such an order will, inevitably be a very rare event indeed. 
 
 
“The whole life order must be quashed.  In its place, to allow for [Michael Roberts’] criminality and 
 
his previous convictions, we shall substitute a minimum term of 25 years.  In doing so we are not 
 
to be taken as implying that [Michael Roberts] is anything less than highly dangerous, and on the 
 
evidence before us at the moment it seems highly improbable that he will, after the expiry of 25 or 
 
 
 
30 or more years, or indeed ever be safe for release.” (para 102 – 103)

David Martin Simmons 
 
 
David Martin Simmons was given two discretionary life imprisonment sentences for rape and false 
 
imprisonment committed in 2004. The trial judge did not specify a specific term but on his transfer 
 
from Broadmoor Hospital back to HMP Bristol in 2010 he was told, for the first time, that in the 
 
absence of any tariff sentence, he was regarded as a whole‐life prisoner. (para 104) 
 
 
The Court considers David Martin Simmons case in paragraphs 104 ‐ 112. 
 
 
Having considered his case, the Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court concluded: 
 
 
“The criticism is that the judge, concerned with the element of public protection, failed sufficiently 
 
to appreciate that the assessment of the minimum term represented a separate and distinct 
 
element of the sentencing decision, designed to reflect the appropriate level of punishment.  The 
  
 
 
Crown agrees that the whole life order was inappropriate. 
  
 
“As it seems to us, profoundly disturbing as this offence certainly was, it was not an offence of the 
 
extreme level of seriousness to justify a whole life order.  It was submitted that the appropriate 
 
minimum term would be between 10‐12 years.  The appropriate minimum term, which will replace 
 
the whole life order, is 10 years, the equivalent of a 20 year determinate sentence.  As the offence 
 
took place before the introduction of s.240 of the 2003 Act, we have taken account of s.67 of the 
 
Criminal Justice Act 1967 in assessing the minimum term.  As with MR, in quashing the whole life 
 
order, we emphasise that we are not suggesting for one moment that DS will be safe to be 
 
released at the conclusion of the 10 year period.  We note that it has been necessary for him to 
 
spend time in Broadmoor Hospital, and we suspect that his release is most unlikely.” (para 111 – 
 
 
112) 
 
 
In summary: 
 
 
The Court upheld all five sentences of life imprisonment but amended the minimum terms in three 
 
of the cases (Danilo Restivo, Michael John Roberts and David Martin Simmons).

The issue of whole life terms will shortly come before the Grand Chamber of the European Court of 
 
 
Human Rights. This Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Lady Justice Hallett, Lord Justice Hughes, 
 
Lord Justice Leveson and Lady Justice Rafferty) judgment sets out the principal reasons why such 
 
an order is not incompatible with Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights. 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court, sets out the background to the issues before the Court 
 
and the legislative context in paragraphs 1 – 30. 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, said: 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“Whatever  the  judicial  views  about  the  whole  life  minimum  term,  it  was  incorporated  in  express 
 
legislative  terms  in  the  2003  Act.  This  statutory  provision  reflects  the  settled  will  of  Parliament. 
  
Simultaneously, the legislation removed the possibility of imposing it from the executive and placed 
 
it full square in the hands of the judiciary, we emphasise, as a discretionary element of sentencing. 
 
  
The  issue  of  the  whole  life  order,  in  the  context  of  Article  3,  has  been  reflected  in  a  number  of 
 
decisions in the courts both domestically and in Europe.” (para 12) 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Court analysis the case law from the European Court before the Lord Chief Justice concludes: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“In short, it is open to the individual state, to make statutory provision for the imposition of a whole 
 
life minimum term, and in an appropriate case, as a matter of judicial discretion, for the court to 
 
 
make such an order.” (para 22) 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Lord Chief Justice went on to conclude: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“The result is that the whole life order, the product of primary legislation, is reserved for the few 
 
exceptionally  serious  offences  in  which,  after  reflecting  on  all  the  features  of  aggravation  and 
 
mitigation, the judge is satisfied that the element of just punishment and retribution requires the 
 
imposition of a whole life order.  If that conclusion is justified, the whole life order is appropriate: 
 
but only then.  It is not a mandatory or automatic or minimum sentence.

Rather, he decided to revenge himself on Christine Chambers.  He did not merely plan to kill her 
 
and their daughter, but he planned and then carried out his deliberate intention to make the death 
 
of his former partner as the most terrifying and agonising ordeal that he could envisage, and this 
 
was exactly what he did.  He was utterly merciless, and took pleasure at her prolonged suffering. 
  
Thereafter, quite deliberately, and in cold blood, he deliberately executed their daughter, as she 
 
was  screaming  with  fear  at  witnessing  what  he  had  been  doing  to  her  mother.  Although  two 
 
people were killed, one after the other in the same place, this was not to be regarded as a double 
 
murder  which  arose  from  a  single  incident:  it  was  a  pre‐meditated  double  murder,  with  two 
 
intended  victims,  when  there  was  ample  opportunity  after  the  murder  of  the  first,  for  this 
 
 
appellant to allow a moment of compassion for his child to divert him from his plan.

Kieran Mark Stapleton 
 
 
Kieran Mark Stapleton was convicted of the murder of student on Boxing Day 2011. He was 
 
 
sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 30 years. 
 
 
The Court considers Kieran Mark Stapleton’s case in paragraphs 47 – 60. 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court, said: 
 
 
“Although the choice of victim was entirely random, there was a significant degree of pre‐meditation 
 
 
and he was sure that [Kieran Stapleton’s] intention was to kill and that at all material times he was 
 
 
fully in control of his actions. This was cold‐blooded controlled aggression.” (para 57) 
  
 
In dismissing Kieran Stapleton’s appeal against his sentence, the Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the 
 
Court, said:

connection with another offence.  It takes very little imagination to reflect on the impact that this 
 
offence would have had in the locality; a young man, utterly blameless, simply gunned down as he 
 
walked down the street, and perhaps the most chilling feature of all was the sheer randomness 
 
with which he was chosen to be the victim.  [Kieran Stapleton] had decided that he was going to 
 
kill someone, and he organised a loaded firearm, carried it, and executed his plan.  His attitude to 
 
the offence is chilling.  He has revelled in it.  That adds significantly to the seriousness of this crime.

Danilo Restivo 
 
 
Danilo Restivo was convicted in 2011 of the murder of Heather Barnett in 2002. He was sentenced to 
 
life imprisonment with a whole life tariff. 
  
 
The Court considers Danilo Restivo’s case in paragraphs 61 – 86. 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court, said: 
 
 
“When the judge summed the case up to the jury, he directed them, quite correctly, that the only 
 
court with jurisdiction to try [Danilo Restivo] for the murder of Elisa Clap and to convict him of the 
 
offence was an Italian court. … In short, therefore, [Danilo Restivo] was not tried for or convicted of 
 
 
the murder of Elisa Clap (a murder which he denied), and the verdict did not and could not carry with 
 
 
it the inevitable conclusion that the jury must have been sure that he had murdered her. ” (para 78) 
 
 
 
 
The Court went on to consider whether the trial judge was entitled to take into account his own 
 
assessment, made during the trial that the appellant has committed another earlier murder with 
 
which he was not charged and of which he had not been considered. (para 78) 
 
 
The Lord Chief Justice concluded: 
 
 
“….  it is equally axiomatic that, situations such as these apart, a defendant cannot simply be 
 
sentenced for offences of which he has not been convicted, or on the basis that he has in fact 
 
 
committed them.  The ability of the judge to make findings that other offences have been 
 
committed does not extend to reaching a non‐jury verdict about allegations put before the jury by 
 
way of similar fact evidence, at least unless the jury must have been satisfied that they were 
 
 
proved, or unless the defendant has been convicted of them in the past.” (para 79) 
 
   
He went on to say: 
 
 
“In the present case [Danilo Restivo] could not be charged in this jurisdiction with the murder of Elisa 
 
Clap.  It was justiceable in Italy, not here. …” (para 84) 
 
 
“… Quite apart from the question whether in accordance with the law of Italy, the recent 
 
conviction, reached in the absence of the appellant, is to be regarded as a final conviction, when 
 
the sentence imposed in the Crown Court is based on a misapplication of principle, it should be 
 
corrected.  We must take the principled approach and proceed on the basis that it may at some 
 
future unspecified date be for the judicial authorities in Italy to decide what the appropriate 
 
sentence on the appellant should be for the murder of Elisa Clap. …. Moreover although a whole 
 
life term must be quashed, the minimum term, to which we now turn, must be very substantial 
 
 
indeed.” (para 85)

Given the date of the offence, the Court had to determine the minimum term in accordance with the 
 
transitional provisions in Schedule 22 of the 2003 Act. (para 86) 
 
 
However, in deciding the minimum term, the Lord Chief Justice concluded: 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“We note in particular the extensive preparation for the killing (which included careful measures to 
 
avoid  detection)  and  the  display  of  sexual  perversions  and  sadism,  not  least  the  appalling 
 
mutilation  of  the  body,  when  the  appellant  knew  perfectly  well  that  it  would  be  found  by  the 
 
victim’s children.  Thereafter, he was capable of brutal hypocrisy in his purported expressions of 
 
concern  and  assistance  offered  to  them.  A  combination  of  all  these  factors  leads  us  to  the 
 
conclusion that the minimum term should be fixed at 40 years.  This will replace the whole life 
 
 
term.” (para 86) 
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
Michael John Roberts 
 
 
Michael John Roberts was convicted in December 2011 of a number of historic burglaries, rapes and 
 
other serious offences. He was already serving a discretionary life sentence at the time of his trial 
 
and conviction. Following his subsequent convictions in 2011 he was sentence to a discretionary life 
 
 
sentence with a whole life term. 
 
 
The Court considers Michael John Roberts’ case in paragraphs 87 – 103. 
 
 
In giving judgment on behalf of the Court, the Lord Chief Justice said: 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“The essential argument advanced in this appeal is that although this was an extremely serious 
 
series  of  offences,  in  which  the  interests  of  public  safety  amply  justified  the  imposition  of  a 
 
 
discretionary  life  sentence,  the  whole  life  order  was  inappropriate  and  wrong  in  principle. 
In 
 
   
summary, among the cases where whole life orders had been imposed, none could be found in the 
 
 
context of sexual crime where one or more of the victims had not been murdered.  Without in any 
 
 
way  seeking  to  trivialise  the  ordeals  of  the  victims,  it  was  submitted  that  the  whole  life  order 
 
should be reserved for cases where the criminal went even further than MR had gone on any of 
 
these occasions.” (para 101)

“Like the Crown, which accepted that notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences a whole life 
 
order was inappropriate, we agree that there is force in this submission.  It is regrettably possible 
 
to envisage, and there have been cases, where dreadful sexual assaults have been followed by 
 
murderous violence.  The whole life order is reserved for the most exceptional cases.  Without 
 
suggesting that the court is prohibited from making a whole life order unless the defendant is 
 
 
convicted of at least one murder, such an order will, inevitably be a very rare event indeed. 
 
 
“The whole life order must be quashed.  In its place, to allow for [Michael Roberts’] criminality and 
 
his previous convictions, we shall substitute a minimum term of 25 years.  In doing so we are not 
 
to be taken as implying that [Michael Roberts] is anything less than highly dangerous, and on the 
 
evidence before us at the moment it seems highly improbable that he will, after the expiry of 25 or 
 
 
 
30 or more years, or indeed ever be safe for release.” (para 102 – 103)

David Martin Simmons 
 
 
David Martin Simmons was given two discretionary life imprisonment sentences for rape and false 
 
imprisonment committed in 2004. The trial judge did not specify a specific term but on his transfer 
 
from Broadmoor Hospital back to HMP Bristol in 2010 he was told, for the first time, that in the 
 
absence of any tariff sentence, he was regarded as a whole‐life prisoner. (para 104) 
 
 
The Court considers David Martin Simmons case in paragraphs 104 ‐ 112. 
 
 
Having considered his case, the Lord Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court concluded: 
 
 
“The criticism is that the judge, concerned with the element of public protection, failed sufficiently 
 
to appreciate that the assessment of the minimum term represented a separate and distinct 
 
element of the sentencing decision, designed to reflect the appropriate level of punishment.  The 
  
 
 
Crown agrees that the whole life order was inappropriate. 
  
 
“As it seems to us, profoundly disturbing as this offence certainly was, it was not an offence of the 
 
extreme level of seriousness to justify a whole life order.  It was submitted that the appropriate 
 
minimum term would be between 10‐12 years.  The appropriate minimum term, which will replace 
 
the whole life order, is 10 years, the equivalent of a 20 year determinate sentence.  As the offence 
 
took place before the introduction of s.240 of the 2003 Act, we have taken account of s.67 of the 
 
Criminal Justice Act 1967 in assessing the minimum term.  As with MR, in quashing the whole life 
 
order, we emphasise that we are not suggesting for one moment that DS will be safe to be 
 
released at the conclusion of the 10 year period.  We note that it has been necessary for him to 
 
spend time in Broadmoor Hospital, and we suspect that his release is most unlikely.” (para 111 – 
 
 
112) 
 
 
In summary: 
 
 
The Court upheld all five sentences of life imprisonment but amended the minimum terms in three 
 
of the cases (Danilo Restivo, Michael John Roberts and David Martin Simmons).

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
 

Introduction 
 

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

The  present  appeals  heard  before  a  special  constitution  of  the  Court  of  Appeal 
Criminal  Division  are  directed  at  sentences  which  were  imposed  on  different 
occasions  following  very  grave  crimes.    Three  of  the  appellants  were  convicted  of 
murder, and two of rape and associated sexual crime.  For those convicted of murder 
the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was imposed: for those convicted of rape 
and  sexual  crime  discretionary  life  sentences  were  imposed.    There  is  no  appeal 
against  the  mandatory  life  sentence  of  life  imprisonment  following  conviction  for 
murder.  The  imposition  of  a  discretionary  life  sentence  may  be  the  subject  of  an 
appeal  but  that  issue  does  not  arise  in  either  of  the  present  cases  where  it  was 
 
imposed.    These  orders  ensure  the  long  term  protection  of  the  public.  We  should 
perhaps emphasise at the outset that each of these appellants is dangerous, and on the 
available evidence, likely to remain dangerous for the indefinite future.  At present it 
is difficult to see how it will ever become safe for any of them to be released from 
custody. 

 

The appeals are confined to the second distinct element of the sentences, that is the 
judicial  assessment  of  the  minimum  term  to  be  served  by  the  appellants  for  the 
purposes of punishment and retribution before the possibility of their release may be 
 
considered. In four of these appeals (two of murder and two of rape), whole life terms 
 
were ordered, and in the fifth case, (another case of murder) the minimum term was 
assessed  at  30  years.  This  element  of  sentence,  whether  imposed  following  a 
 
mandatory or a discretionary life sentence, is discretionary.   

Dealing with it very briefly for the moment, the jurisprudence of the European Court 
of Human Rights distinguishes, for reasons which are clearly apparent, between three 
 
different types or classes of sentences of life imprisonment.  They are: 

“(i) a life sentence with eligibility for release after a minimum 
period has been served; 

(ii) a “discretionary sentence of life imprisonment without the 
 
possibility of parole”; and 

(iii)  a  “mandatory  sentence  of  life  imprisonment  without  the 
 
possibility of parole”. 

In the context of this jurisprudence, the whole life terms on four of these appellants 
represented discretionary sentences of life imprisonment without parole, that is, type 
(ii) and the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment with a minimum term assessed 
at 30 years fell within the ambit of type (i).  None fell within type (iii), and in this 
jurisdiction such a sentence cannot be imposed.

into 

to  reflect  punishment  and  deterrence 

It  is  unnecessary  for  this  judgment  to  revisit  the  steady  development  of  sentencing 
practice which followed the abolition of the death penalty and its replacement with 
the  mandatory  life  sentence.    This  included  the  transition  of  the  so-called  “tariff” 
 
period  designed 
the  formalised 
arrangements  for  assessing  the  appropriate  minimum  term  now  encompassed  in 
statute, and the transfer to the court of the responsibility of the Secretary of State for 
the Home Department to determine how long a period should actually be served. It is 
now exclusively for sentencing judges (and where necessary, this court) to decide the 
minimum term which it is appropriate for the defendant who subjected to a sentence 
of life imprisonment to serve before his release. Express statutory provision is made 
in Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 vesting the court with jurisdiction, in 
an appropriate case of exceptionally high seriousness, to order a whole life minimum 
term. It is submitted by Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC on behalf of the appellant Restivo 
that  this  provision  contravenes  Article  3  of  the  European  Convention  of  Human 
Rights. 

Every  civilised  country  embraces  the  principle  encapsulated  in  Article  3.  This 
provides that: 

“No  one  shall  be  subjected  to  torture  or  to  inhuman  or 
degrading treatment or punishment”. 

Simultaneously, however, every civilised country also embraces the principle that just 
punishment  is  appropriate  for  those  convicted  of  criminal  offences.    These  issues 
relating  to  just  and  proportionate  punishment  are  the  subject  of  rational  debate  and 
civilised disagreement.  The assessment of what should be deemed to constitute just 
punishment  or  inhuman  or  degrading  punishment  in  a  particular  circumstance  can 
legitimately  produce  different  answers  in  different  countries,  and  indeed  different 
 
answers  at  different  times  in  the  same  country.  All  these  are  at  least  in  part  a 
consequence  of  the  history  of  each  country.    The  question  whether  the  whole  life 
 
order  constitutes  a  breach  of  Article  3  of  the  Convention,  or  indeed  of  the  long 
established common law principle that the sentence should be proportionate in all the 
relevant circumstances of the offence and the criminal who has committed it, has been 
 
well debated. 
 

 
7.	 

There are those who view the whole life order with grave disquiet. In this jurisdiction 
 
the argument was reflected in the judgment of Laws LJ in R (Wellington) v Secretary 
of State for the Home Department [2007] … 

“…  a  prisoner’s  incarceration  without  hope  of  release  is  in 
many respects in like case to a sentence of death.  He can never 
atone  for  his  offence.  However  he  may  use  incarceration  as 
time for amendment of life, his punishment is only exhausted 
by  his  last  breath  …  The  supposed  inalienable  value  of  the 
prisoner’s  life  is  reduced,  merely  to  his  survival:  to  nothing

more  than  his  drawing  breath  and  being  kept,  no  doubt, 
confined in decent circumstances.  That is to pay lip-service to 
 
the value of life; not to vouchsafe it”. 

 
8.	 

In the European Court of Human Rights, the same concern is clearly underlined in the 
recent joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Garlicki, David Thorbe Jorgivsson and 
 
Nicolaou  in  Vinter  and  Others  v  United  Kingdom  (applications  nos.  66069/09  and 
130/10 and 3896/10). Particular concern was expressed about the 

 

“hopelessness inherent in a sentence of life imprisonment from 
 
which,  independently  of  the  circumstances,  there  is  no 
possibility whatsoever of release while the prisoner is still well 
enough to have any sort of life outside prison”. 

These are examples of many occasions when similar judicial observations have been 
made.   

 
9.	 

Be all that as it may, in the context of the whole life term, contrary views have been 
expressed by eminent jurists, not least, Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ in R v Secretary 
of State for the Home Department, ex parte Hindley [1998] QB 751 at 769: 

 

“I  can  see  no  reason,  in  principle,  why  a  crime  or  crimes,  if 
sufficiently  heinous,  should  not  be  regarded  as  deserving  life 
long incarceration for purposes of pure punishment.” 

It is not without importance that, as the then Lord Chief Justice, he went on to reflect 
that in the context of whole life tariffs, “Successive Lord Chief Justices have regarded 
 
such a tariff as lawful, and I share their view”.  In expressing himself in this way, he 
was, of course, addressing the situation which obtained when assessment of the penal 
period to be served by the defendant was made by the Home Secretary, in the light of 
any judicial recommendations.  

 
10.	 

Hindley’s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, and the House of Lords, too, 
supported the decision of the Divisional Court.  Giving the leading judgment, Lord 
 
Steyn  addressed  the  observation  of  Lord  Bingham,  and  agreed  that  some  crimes 
would be sufficiently heinous to deserve life long incarceration for the purposes of 
 
pure punishment.  He continued: 

“There  is  nothing  logically  inconsistent  with  …  saying  that 
there are cases where the crimes are so wicked that even if the 
prisoner is detained until he or she dies it will not exhaust the 
requirements of retribution and deterrence”. 

At the time when this case was making its way through the courts, the whole-life tariff 
was  not  based  on  an  express  statutory  provision.  Nevertheless  Lord  Bingham  and 
Lord Steyn were expressing views which affirmed support for the principle that there

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

had  been  and  no  doubt  would  continue  to  be  cases  in  which  a  whole  life  order 
represented just punishment. 

 
11.	 

Perhaps  the  need  to  give  due  recognition  and  respect  to  legitimate  but  inconsistent 
views  on  this  issue  is  encapsulated  in  the  observations  of  Baroness  Hale  in  R 
(Wellington)  v  Home  Secretary  [2009]  1  AC  335,  at  paragraph  53,  where,  in  the 
context of extradition to a jurisdiction which embraced the whole life minimum term 
 
principle, she observed: 

 

“I  do  understand  the  philosophical  position,  that  each  human 
being  should  be  regarded  as  capable  of  redemption  here  on 
earth  as  well  as  hereafter.    To  those  who  hold  this  view,  the 
denial  of  the  possibility  of  redeeming  oneself  in  this  life  by 
 
repentance  and  reform  may  seem  inhuman.    I  myself  was 
 
brought up in that tradition.  But … that is not the only tenable 
view  of  the  matter.  …  there  are  many  justifications  for 
subjecting a wrongdoer to a life in prison.  It is not for us to 
impose  a  particular  philosophy  of  punishment  upon  other 
countries”. 

 

12.	  Whatever the judicial views about the whole life minimum term, it was incorporated 
in  express  legislative  terms  in  the  2003  Act.  This  statutory  provision  reflects  the 
settled will of Parliament.  Simultaneously, the legislation removed the possibility of 
imposing it from the executive and placed it full square in the hands of the judiciary, 
 
we emphasise, as a discretionary element of sentencing.  The issue of the whole life 
order, in the context of Article 3, has been reflected in a number of decisions in the 
 
courts both domestically and in Europe. 

In  R  v  Bieber  [2009]  1  WLR  223  this  court  quashed  a  whole  life  order  following 
Bieber’s  conviction  for  murdering  one  policeman,  and  attempting  to  murder  two 
others, in an incident which lasted eight seconds.  It was argued that the facts did not 
justify  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life  order,  which  violated  Article  3.    Particular 
reliance was placed on the decision of the Grand Chamber in the European Court of 
Human Rights in Kafkaris v Cyprus (Apps No: 201906/04). At that date in Cyprus, 
premeditated  murder  was  followed  automatically  by  a  mandatory  sentence  of  life 
imprisonment, in effect a full life term, which was not thereafter considered by any 
judicial  body.  Accordingly  the  question  whether  a  whole  life  term  would  in  fact 
 
follow the conviction was not decided by a judge.  The President of Cyprus, however, 
 
was vested  with a discretion to remit, suspend or commute the life sentence, provided 
 
the Attorney General, who was responsible for the original prosecution, agreed with 
the President.  The ECHR held that there was no breach of Article 3 because of this 
limited possibility of release.   

In  Bieber,  acknowledging  that  the  United  Kingdom  did  not  rank  among  member 
states which considered that there was a maximum level of imprisonment which could 
be  justified  by  way  of  punishment,  after  which  humanity  required  the  defendant’s 
release, the court concluded: 

 
13.	 

 
14.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

“ … Schedule 21 of the 2003 Act proceeds on the premise that 
some  crimes  are  so  heinous  that  they  justify  imprisoning  the 
 
offender for the rest of his life, however long that may be”. 

The court concluded that it did not follow from the decision of the majority of the 
Grand Chamber that an irreducible life sentence imposed “to reflect the appropriate 
punishment  and  deterrence  for  a  serious  offence”  was  necessarily  in  conflict  with 
Article 3.  The court also reflected on the power of the Secretary of State to release a 
life prisoner under s.30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, and considered that if the 
 
time should come when the continued detention of a prisoner subject to a whole life 
order would, of itself, amount to “inhuman or degrading treatment”, the discretionary 
release of the prisoner would fall within the ambit of the powers of the Secretary of 
State. 

Vinter  and  others  v  United  Kingdom  (Applications  Nos.  66069/09  and  130/10  and 
3896/10) was a decision of the fourth section of the European Court of Human Rights, 
subsequently  referred  to  the  Grand  Chamber,  in  which  the  court,  following  the 
 
observations of the House of Lords in R (Wellington), doubted whether the statutory 
power of release under s.30 of the 1997 Act was as broad in its effect as this court had 
suggested  in  Bieber.  Nevertheless  the  court  concluded  that  in  the  three  cases  then 
 
under consideration, the continued detention of three defendants who had been made 
subject to a whole life tariff did not violate Article 3 because the “requirements of 
punishment and deterrence could only be satisfied by a whole life order”.  This was a 
legitimate penological purpose. The court went on to hold that if a discretionary life 
 
sentence  without  the  possibility  of  parole  was  imposed  by  a  court  after  due 
 
consideration  of  all  relevant  mitigation  and  aggravating  factors,  an  Article  3  issue 
would not arise at the moment when it was imposed, but only when it could be shown 
that  the  defendant’s  continued  imprisonment  could  not  longer  be  justified  on  any 
legitimate penalogical grounds (such as punishment, deterrence, public protection of 
rehabilitation); and the sentence is irreducible de facto and de jure.   

The  court  rejected  the  contention  that  a  mandatory  sentence  of  life  imprisonment 
without  the  possibility  of  parole  was  of  itself  incompatible  with  the  Convention, 
despite an acknowledgement of the trend in Europe generally against such sentences. 
 
Unsurprisingly the court believed that such a sentence would be likely to be grossly 
disproportionate  if  the  sentencing  court  was  required  to  disregard  in  particular 
mitigating  factors,  such  as  youth  or  severe  mental  health  problems  which  would 
 
provide for a significantly reduced level of culpability on the part of the defendant,  In 
short the alleged violation of rights under Article 3 was rejected on the basis of the 
 
seriousness of the crimes which had been committed, and the sentences imposed for 
the purpose of deterrent and punishment justified continued incarceration. 

 

The  issue  of  the  whole  life  order  and  Article  3  considerations  have  also  been 
examined closely in the context of extradition.  In this jurisdiction the decision of the 
Divisional  Court  in  R  (Wellington)  was  considered  in  the  House  of  Lords.  The 
 
request  for  extradition  related  among  other  charges,  to  two  charges  of  first  degree 
murder,  for  which  the  prescribed  penalties  were  death  or  imprisonment  for  life

without  eligibility  for  probation,  parole  or  release  except  by  the  act  of  the  State 
Governor.  In  fact  the  prosecuting  authority  gave  an  undertaking  that  it  would  not 
seek the death penalty.  The extradition to the United States was upheld. 

 

Lord Hoffmann agreed with the decision in Bieber, in particular that any complaint 
 
that the whole life term contravened Article 3 of the Convention should be made if 
and when the time came when it could be argued that the continued detention of the 
prisoner infringed Article 3.  Lord Scott suggested that Article 3 was “prescribing a 
minimum standard of acceptable treatment or punishment below which the signatory 
nations could be expected not to sink but not as high a standard as that which many of 
those  nations  might  think  it  right  to  require  for  every  individual  within  their 
jurisdiction,  and  therefore  entitled,  even  if  only  temporarily,  to  their  protection. 
 
Article  3  was  prescribing  the  minimum  standard,  not  a  norm.    It  must  be  open  to 
individual states to decide for themselves what, if any, higher standards they would 
set  for  themselves”.    Although  Lord  Brown  of  Eaton-under-Heywood  doubted  the 
 
efficacy of the compassionate release provisions in s.30 of the 1997 Act referred to in 
Bieber, he concluded that a whole life minimum term was not objectionable provided 
at the date when it was being fixed, all the circumstances were considered, and the 
crime was of sufficient seriousness to merit such draconian punishment. 

In  Harkins  and  Edwards  v  United  Kingdom  (App.  Nos.  9146/07  and  32650/07, 
judgment  on  17th  January  2012),  in  the  context  of  Article  3  of  the  Convention,  the 
European  Court  of  Human  Rights  addressed  the  possibility  of  extradition  to  a 
 
jurisdiction where a life sentence might be imposed without the possibility of parole. 
 
Significantly the court held that no distinction could be drawn in principle between 
the assessment of the minimum level of severity required in the domestic context, and 
the same assessment in the extra-territorial context.  The court was prepared to accept 
that in principle matters of appropriate sentencing largely fell outside the scope of the 
Convention,  but,  understandably,  that  a  “grossly  disproportionate  sentence  could 
amount to ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 at the moment of its imposition”.  The 
 
“gross  disproportionality”  test  would  only  be  met  on  “rare  and  unique  occasions”. 
 
Addressing the issue of the whole life term imposed as a discretionary element of a 
sentence attached to a sentence of life imprisonment, the court observed that such a 
sentence  would  normally  be  imposed  for  an offence  of  the  utmost  severity  such  as 
homicide. Expressly agreeing with the decisions of this court in Bieber (presumably 
subject  to  the  reservations  about  the  s.30  issue)  and  R  (Wellington)  the  court 
 
concluded that an Article 3 issue would only arise if it could be demonstrated that the 
 
continued  incarceration  could  no  longer  be  justified  on  any  legitimate  penological 
grounds, such as punishment, deterrence, public protection or rehabilitation and, that 
 
the sentence would be irreducible de facto and de jure.  Much greater scrutiny was 
required to be directed against the potential vice of any mandatory whole life sentence 
type (iii), which in effect deprived the defendant of any possibility of putting forward 
mitigating factors before the sentencing court.  Such a sentence would condemn the 
 
defendant to spend the rest of his days in prison, irrespective of his culpability, and 
indeed  whether  or  not  the  court  considered  the  sentence  to  be  justified.   That,  of 
course,  is  not  the  situation  which  obtains  in  the  orders  which  are  currently  under 
consideration.

In  Babar  Ahmed  and  others  v  United  Kingdom  (Applications  Nos.  24027/07, 
11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09), in the context of prison conditions, the 
fourth  section,  which  included  three  members  of  the  constitution  of  the  fourth 
chamber who had dissented in Vinter and others, once again addressed the question 
whether and at what point in the course of a life or other very long sentence an Article 
3 issue might arise.  Towards the end of the judgment, starting at paragraph 235, the 
 
court directly addressed the views expressed by the House of Lords in Wellington and 
the Court of Appeal in Bieber in the context of the decision in Kafkaris.  Consistent 
with  the  reasoning  in  Harkins  and  Edwards,  the  court  distinguished  between  a 
mandatory  whole  life  sentence  type  (iii)  and  a  discretionary  sentence  of  life 
imprisonment  without  the  possibility  of  parole  type  (ii)  which,  obtains  in  this 
jurisdiction. The court reflected broadly that a whole life mandatory sentence was not, 
of  itself,  incompatible  with  the  Convention,  although  the  trend  in  Europe  militated 
against  the  imposition  of  such  sentences.    Such  a  sentence  “would  be  much  more 
 
likely  to  be  disproportionate  than  any  other  type  of  life  sentence,  especially  if  it 
required  the  sentencing  court  to  disregard  mitigating  factors  which  are  generally 
understood as indicating a significantly lower level of culpability on the part of the 
 
defendant  such  as  youth  or  severe  mental  health  problems”.    Reflecting  on  the 
discretionary whole life order (ii) the court observed: 

“…  normally  such  sentences  are  imposed  for  offences  of  the 
utmost severity, such as murder or manslaughter.  In any legal 
system,  such  offences,  if  they  do  not  attract  a  life  sentence 
normally  attract  a  substantial  sentence  of  imprisonment, 
perhaps  of  several  decades.  Therefore,  any  defendant  who  is 
convicted of such an offence must expect to serve a significant 
number of years in prison before he can realistically have any 
 
hope  of  release,  irrespective  of  whether  he  is  given  a  life 
 
sentence or a determinate sentence.  It follows, therefore, that, 
 
if a discretionary life sentence is imposed by a court after due 
consideration of all relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, 
an  Article  3  issue  cannot  arise  at  the  moment  when  it  is 
imposed.  Instead, the court agrees with the Court of Appeal in 
 
Bieber and the House of Lords in Wellington that an Article 3 
issue will only arise when it can be shown: 

 

(i)  that  the  applicant’s  continued  imprisonment  can  no  longer 
be  justified  on  any  legitimate  penological  grounds  (such  as 
punishment, deterrence, public protection or rehabilitation); and 

(ii) as the Grand Chamber stated in Kafkaris… the sentence is 
reducible de facto and de jure”. 

From this analysis of the authorities in the European Court, it seems to us clear that 
the Court has proceeded on the basis that, provided the court has reflected on matters 
of  mitigation  properly  available  to  the  defendant,  a  whole  life  order  imposed  as  a 
matter of judicial discretion as to the appropriate level of punishment and deterrence 
following conviction for a crime of utmost seriousness would not constitute inhuman 
or degrading punishment.  In short, it is open to the individual state to make statutory 

 
22.

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

provision  for  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life  minimum  term,  and  in  an  appropriate 
case, as a matter of judicial discretion, for the court to make such an order. 

 
23.	 

In this jurisdiction the relevant provision is found in paragraph 4 of Schedule 21 of 
the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  (the  2003  Act).    This  identifies  cases  which  would 
“normally”  fall  within  the  category  of  exceptionally  high  seriousness,  justifying  a 
whole life order (ii).  These include: 

“…(a) the murder of two or more persons, where each murder 
 

involves any of the following -

(i) a substantial degree of pre-meditation or planning, 

(ii) the abduction of the victim, or  

(iii) sexual or sadistic conduct 

(b) the murder of a child if involving the abduction of the 
  
child or sexual or sadistic motivation, 
 

(c) a murder done for the purpose of advancing a political, 
  
 
religious, racial or ideological cause, or 

(d)  a  murder  by  an  offender  previously  convicted  of 
  
 
murder”. 

 
24.	 

No one doubts that a whole life minimum term is a Draconian penalty, or indeed that 
 
it is the order of last resort reserved for cases of exceptionally serious criminality.  In 
 
R  v  Jones  [2006]  2  Crim.  App.  R(S)  19,  Lord  Phillips  CJ  presiding  in  this  court 
observed, at para 10: 

“A whole life order should be imposed where the seriousness of 
the  offending  is  so  exceptionally  high  that  just  punishment 
requires the offender to be kept in prison for the rest of his or 
her  life.  Often,  perhaps  unusually,  where  such  an  order  is 
called  for  the  case  will  not  be  on  the  borderline.  …  To  be 
 
imprisoned  for  a  finite  period  of  30  years  or  more  is  a  very 
severe penalty.  If the case includes one or more of the factors 
 
set out in paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 21 it is likely to be a case 
that calls for a whole life order, but the judge must consider all 
the material facts before concluding that a very lengthy finite 
term will not be sufficiently severe.” 
 

In R v Wilson [2010] 1 Cr. App R(S) 11, the court repeated the constant principle, that 
a whole life order would be very rarely made.  

“It  remains  a  sentence  of  last  resort  for  cases  of  the  most 
extreme gravity”.

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
25.	 

Time without number the court has underlined that the language of Schedule 21 is not 
prescriptive.  No  statutory  provision  requires  the  judge  to  impose  the  order  if  the 
interests of justice do not require it. 

 

26.	  What the Schedule provides is an indication of appropriate starting points which apply 
to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence of murder, or its combination with 
other offences associated with it.  It recognises that the level of seriousness may be so 
exceptionally high that the court should  consider whether a whole life order would be 
appropriate.  It is also clear from a series of decisions in this court that the statute does 
not  create  a  sentencing  straightjacket,  nor  require  that  a  mechanical  or  arithmetical 
approach to the problem of the assessment of the minimum term may be taken.  R v 
Height and Anderson [2009] 1 Cr. App. R(S) 117 provides the necessary emphasis: 

the 

“We have lost count of the number of times when this court has 
emphasised that these provisions are not intended to be applied 
Indeed,  in  our  judgment,  an  inflexible  approach 
inflexibly. 
would  be 
inconsistent  with 
the  statutory 
framework.    No  scheme  or  guidance  or  statutory  framework 
can  be  fully  comprehensive,  and  any  system  of  purported 
compartmentalisation or prescription has the potential to induce 
 
injustice.  Even when the approach to the sentencing decision is 
 
laid  down  in  an  apparently  detailed,  and  on  the  face  of  it, 
intentionally comprehensive scheme, the sentencing judge must 
achieve a just result”. 

terms  of 

 
27.	 

This  principle  has  been  repeated  on  numerous  occasions.    For  example  in  Inglis 
[2011] 2 Cr. App. R (S) 13, a case of murder committed as a “mercy killing” where 
the offender was the victim’s mother and in a position of trust, but carefully planned 
the killing of a particularly vulnerable son (all features of aggravation) the court was 
satisfied that, notwithstanding that these facts would normally aggravate the offence 
 
of murder, they should not: 

 

“… be taken to aggravate a murder committed by an individual 
who  genuinely  believes  that  her  actions  in  bringing  about  the 
 
death constitute an act of mercy”. 

 
28.	 

In R v M, AM and Kiki [2010] 2 Cr. App. R(s) 19 the court emphasised: 

“… the question for the sentencing judge in the end is not for 
compartmentalisation of the specific offence within this or that 
paragraph of the Schedule but the proper judicial assessment of 
the  appropriate  sentence  to  reflect  the  facts  of  the  individual 
case  and  its  seriousness  and  such  mitigating  features  as  there 
 
may be.  Justice simply cannot be done by a mechanistic filling 
in  of  “tick  boxes”  and  unconsidered  assignment  of  cases  into 
compartments …”.

30.	 

The result is that the whole life order, the product of primary legislation, is reserved 
 
for the few exceptionally serious offences in which, after reflecting on all the features 
of  aggravation  and  mitigation,  the  judge  is  satisfied  that  the  element  of  just 
punishment  and  retribution  requires  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life  order.    If  that 
conclusion is justified, the whole life order is appropriate: but only then.  It is not a 
mandatory or automatic or minimum sentence. 

In these circumstances the provisions of Schedule 21 of the 2003 Act, and paragraph 
4  in  particular,  which  enabled  the  court  to  make  a  whole  life  order  in  a  case  of 
exceptional seriousness are not incompatible with and do not contravene Article 3 of 
the Convention. 

David Oakes 
 

On 11 May 2012 in the Crown Court at Chelmsford before Fulford J and a jury David 
Oakes  (DO)  was  convicted  of  two  counts  of  murder.    He  was  sentenced  to  life 
imprisonment with a whole life term as the specified minimum sentence. 

DO was born in May 1961.  Christine Chambers was born in December 1973.  They 
started to see each other in July 2005.  They began to live together.  She had three 
 
older children, one of whom, CC, lived with her.   Their child, Shania Chambers, was 
born in October 2008. 

  

The relationship was stormy.  It is clear that DO was a violent, domineering man.  As 
 
a result Christine Chambers made an application to the court for a non-molestation 
order.  On  21st  April  2011,  on  the  basis  of  a  number  of  allegations  of  significant 
 
violence, the order was made.  Thereafter he was in constant breach.  She was advised 
to  make  a  formal  complaint  against  him,  and  indeed  he  was  warned  by  the  police 
against these continuing breaches. 

Shortly before midnight on 5th/6th June 2011, uninvited and unexpected, DO went to 
 
the home where Christine Chambers and her two daughters were living.  They were in 
bed.  He entered, using a key in his possession.  He carried a bag which contained an 
axe, a bottle containing petrol and various other implements including a Stanley knife 
 
and pliers.  He was also carrying a double barrelled shotgun together with numerous 
 
cartridges for use in the gun. 

DO  went  to  the  bedroom  and  turned  the  light  on,  waking  the  two  girls.    When 
Christine Chambers told him to get out, he opened the bag and took out the axe.  He 
 
showed them the shotgun and cartridges.  He said he would burn the house down and 
that  he  had  petrol  in  a  blue  bottle  together  with  a  lighter.    He  punched  Christine 
 
Chambers  in  the  eye  and  struck  her  with  the  butt  of  the  gun.    CC  tried  to  use  her 
mobile phone to get help, but he snatched it from her and broke both her phone and 
her mother’s phone.

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
The precise sequence of events thereafter is not entirely clear but Christine Chambers 
was  certainly  subjected  to  a  series  of  degrading  and  humiliating  assaults.    She  was 
ordered to cut off her hair with a pair of scissors which he took from the bag.  He 
made her remove her upper clothing and ordered her to walk about without a bra.  He 
 
made her hug and kiss him, and say that she loved him.  She implored  him  not  to 
touch her or the children, saying that she would do anything.  He ordered CC to go 
upstairs,  threatening  her  with  a  knife.  She  heard  him  threaten  to  blow  Christine 
Chambers’  leg  off  and  rip  off  her  nipples  with  pliers.    CC  managed  to  make  her 
 
escape  and  climbed  out  of  a  bedroom  window  onto  a  flat  roof  where  she  jumped 
 
down and ran for help to her father, who lived near by.  The police were called. 

In  the  meantime  Christine  Chambers  was  subjected  to  an  attack  of  horrifying 
 
violence.  An axe or meat cleaver cut deeply into her scalp and a sharp instrument, 
such as a Stanley knife, was used to disfigure her.  DO inflicted a deep incised wound 
into  her  left  eyebrow,  to  which  he  applied  glue,  and  a  Y  shaped  laceration  to  the 
bridge  of  the  nose,  and  virtual  detachment  to  the  lower  part  of  the  left  ear.    She 
sustained what can reasonably be described as slash marks on both sides of her face, 
and a similar cut running along the mid-line from the lower abdomen to the vulva. 
She was shot in the left thigh, as she was lying on the ground.  She was shot, again, in 
the right knee.  The fatal wound was a gun shot to the left side of her chest, which 
caused fatal damage to the upper abdomen/chest and a transection of the aorta.  A few 
minutes after killing Christine Chambers, DO shot his daughter in the left side of the 
forehead, just above the left eyebrow, and killed her. 

 

DO then shot himself in the face.  In total he had fired 7 shots, loading and unloading 
his gun at least 4 times.    

He was arrested in hospital on 19th June, and in due course charged with the murder 
 
of Christine Chambers and their daughter. 

A search of the victims’ home revealed a shotgun, pieces of a broken gun handle, a 
wooden  handled  axe,  a  pair  of  blue  handled  cutters  or  pliers,  a  home  made  noose 
 
made from wire, and many cartridges, as well as petrol. 

Passing sentence at the end of the trial, in detailed and carefully reasoned sentencing 
observations, Fulford J described some of the background.  He concluded that DO had 
killed Christine Chambers and his daughter simply because he was unable to accept 
 
that Christine Chambers could no longer bear to be with him and wanted to start a 
new life.  His reaction had been purely selfish, self-pitying and extremely violent.  On 
more than one occasion he had said that no other man would be her partner, or would 
act as the father to his daughter.  If the family life was coming to an end, they would 
pay for leaving him with their lives.  The judge was satisfied that DO had decided that 
the last hours of their lives would be terrifying and in the case of Christine Chambers, 
 
agonisingly painful.  The deaths were planned in elaborate detail.  He had collected a 
set  of  implements  for  the  sole  purpose  of  torturing  Christine  Chambers  and  then 
 
killing her and their daughter.  He had entered the house and then remorsely executed

his plan, and while inflicting cruel and substantial injuries on her, he made her beg 
and express her love for him.  At the same time he had been in clear control and knew 
precisely what he was doing as he did it. 

 
42.	 

 
43.	 

 
44.	 

The  judge  emphasised  two  further  aspects  of  the  case.    First,  it  was  apparent  that 
Christine Chambers died in agony.  The head injuries and the shotgun wounds would 
have  been  excruciatingly  painful.  In  his  judgment  the  delay  in  delivering  the  fatal 
 
gunshot was an act of deliberate sadism.  Her daughter was fully aware of part of her 
mother’s  ordeal,  and  their  daughter  was  awake  throughout  the  ordeal  and  had 
witnessed at least some of these dreadful events and been perfectly well aware of her 
mother’s  pain  and  tears.  The  child,  too,  must  have  been  terrified  and  was  heard 
crying at least five minutes after her mother had been shot. Then DO killed her.  Two 
people had been killed in truly shocking circumstances. 

There was not a shred of mitigation.  The seriousness of the case was exceptionally 
 
high.  Given that the deaths were planned well in advance and executed, in the case of 
the mother with a significant degree of sadism, the judge concluded that a whole life 
term was appropriate. 

The appeal is directed at the minimum whole life order.  It is not suggested that the 
sentence  was  “grossly”  disproportionate  to  the  crime,  but  it  is  said  that  it  was 
 
disproportionate. 
It  was  artificial  for  the  murder  of  his  former  partner  and  his 
daughter  to  be  taken  as  if  they  were  separate  events,  both  of  which  involved  a 
substantial degree of premeditation and planning.  His objective was to kill his family 
and then himself.  This situation is not unique.  He had temporarily lost any sense of 
rational and decent behaviour or hope.  Reflecting on paragraphs 4 and 5 of Schedule 
21 to the 2003 Act, which referred to the murder of two or more persons, and the use 
of  sexual  or  sadistic  conduct,  this  case  was  a  borderline  case,  and  not  one  which 
certainly  fell  within  the  exceptionally  serious  category.    Therefore  the  appropriate 
minimum term should have been based on a 30 year starting point.   

 

45.	  We have reflected on these submissions.  It seems to us clear that DO did not simply 
explode into violence as a result of the stresses and strains of the breakdown of his 
 
relationship.  Rather, he decided to revenge himself on Christine Chambers.  He did 
not merely plan to kill her and their daughter, but he planned and then carried out his 
deliberate intention to make the death of his former partner the most terrifying and 
agonising ordeal that he could envisage, and this was exactly what he did.  He was 
 
utterly  merciless,  and  took  pleasure  at  her  prolonged  suffering.    Thereafter,  quite 
deliberately,  and  in  cold  blood,  he  deliberately  executed  their  daughter,  as  she  was 
screaming with fear at witnessing what he had been doing to her mother. Although 
two  people  were  killed,  one  after  the  other  in  the  same  place,  this  was  not  to  be 
regarded  as  a  double  murder  which  arose  from  a  single  incident:  it  was  a  pre-
meditated  double  murder,  with  two  intended  victims,  when  there  was  ample 
opportunity  after  the  murder  of  the  first,  for  this  appellant  to  allow  a  moment  of 
compassion for his child to divert him from his plan.

Kieran Mark Stapleton

Stapleton (KS) was born in January 1991. On 26th July 2012 at the Crown Court at 
Manchester before King J and a jury he was convicted of murder.  He was sentenced 
to life imprisonment and the minimum term was specified at 30 years. 

The facts are simple, but stark.  A young man, aged 23, a post-graduate at Lancaster 
University,  decided  with  his  friends  to  spend  the  Christmas  period  in  Manchester. 
 
The students set off from their hotel on foot in the early hours of 26th December 2011 
to travel to the City Centre to queue up for the Boxing Day sales. The victim of the 
murder was Anuj Bidve, who happened at the fatal moment to be at the back of this 
 
group.  While walking in Salford they saw KS, together with a friend, walking on the 
other side of the road.  KS crossed the road and approached the group, and asked them 
what the time was.  One of them responded that it was 1.30.   

 

49.	  Without any warning, KS produced a silver gun and shot Mr Bidve from very close 
range in the head.  Before he produced the gun there had been no threats or abuse, 
indeed  nothing  which  might  trigger  off  even  the  most  minor  altercation.    He  then 
laughed  or  smiled  before  running  off  with  his  friend.    Mr  Bidve  was  rushed  to 
hospital, but was pronounced dead.  The cause of death was extensive brain injury. 

 
50.	 

 
51.	 

Earlier in the evening KS had threatened to kill someone who had insulted his former 
girlfriend, and he had been complaining that he had had a terrible year, during which 
he had lost his relationship, his house and his driving licence. 

After  the  killing  KS  went  to  stay  in  Wigan,  but  he  returned  to  Salford  on  27th 
December, booking in to a hotel which was a short distance from the crime scene.  On 
 
the  following  day,  he  arranged  for  a  teardrop  to  be  tattooed  onto  his  cheek  which, 
among other things, can signify and in this case was undoubtedly intended to signify 
that the person with such a tattoo has killed someone, and his pride in doing so.  He 
 
was  arrested  on  29th  December.    When  he  did  speak,  he  was  flippant.    When  he 
appeared  at  court,  and  was  asked  his  name,  he  gave  it  as  “Psycho  Stapleton”,  and 
 
when he saw a friend in the public gallery he shouted out that “Ryan (that is the friend 
who was walking with him at the time of the killing) had made a statement.” 

 
52.	 

A  psychological  report  from  Dr  Sonya  Krljes  dated  17th  May  2012  was  served  on 
KS’ behalf.  It was said that he was suffering from an anti-social personality disorder, 
characterised by anti-social and psychopathic traits, likely to have a neuro-biological 
underpinning, which would affect his ability to empathise with others. 

 
53. 

A  psychiatric  report  from  Dr  Nigel  Eastman  dated  2  June  2012  supported  the 
conclusion that KS exhibited a severe personality disorder, satisfying the criteria for
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

ASPD, and within that, psychopathy.  He could not normally experience empathy, and 
would be likely to be abnormally sensitive to the behaviour of others.  Dr Eastman 
believed that KS was fit to plead.  In relation to diminished responsibility the question 
for decision was whether on the instant occasion, KS’ capacities had been so affected 
by  his  personality  disorder  that  his  ability to  exercise  self-control  was  substantially 
impaired.  In the context of the present case, if the group of students had ignored him 
as they walked down the road in opposite directions, his severe personality disorder 
may have read this as provocative. 

Dr John McKenna provided a psychological report dated 12th June 2012.  He agreed 
with  Dr  Krljes  that  KS  showed  no  emotional  response  and  had  poor  reflective 
capacity.  However as to events at the time of the killing, KS’s own account was that 
his disposition and circumstances were unremarkable, and he specifically denied that 
 
he  was  in  a  negative  frame  of  mind  or  that  he  had  been  provoked.    Dr  McKenna 
agreed that KS had a severe personality disorder, but his condition did not meet the 
criteria for psychopathic disorder.  There were good clinical grounds to suggest that 
KS was capable of behaving impulsively and with reduced self-control, but he had in 
 
the past demonstrated both impulsive “defensive” aggression (a reference to a road 
 
rage  incident)  and  “appetite  aggression”  (a  reference  to  an  assault  on  a  fellow 
prisoner)  which  involved  a  degree  of  planning.    This  second  incident  represented 
controlled aggression or “considered purposeful violence”.  As to the possibility that 
he may have experienced “slow burn” provocation he had himself denied the account 
given by his companion about his earlier state of mind. He maintained that he had felt 
 
quite normal, and his own account of his mental state at the relevant time was sparse, 
and  did  not  include  any  awareness  of  feeling  irritated  or  provoked.    He  was  fit  to 
plead. 

The final psychological report, from Dr Adrian West, was dated 18th June 2012.  He 
 
agreed  with  Dr  McKenna  that  KS  had  an  anti-social  personality  disorder,  with 
psychopathic traits, falling short of psychopathy.  He also agreed with the analysis of 
the road rage incident as “defensive aggression” and the prison attack as “predatory 
 
aggression”.  The present incident was another such incident.  The facts indicated that 
KS  may  have  had  a  generalised  and  pre-meditated  murderous  intent.    Dr  West 
disagreed  with  both  Dr  Eastman  and  Dr  Krljes.    The  psychopathic  traits  had  not 
impaired KS’ ability to understand that he was in possession of the gun and had lethal 
means  to  kill  someone.  The  attack  was  carried  out  purposefully,  with  considerable 
cognitive  motor  effort  and  accuracy.  KS  himself  denied  any  earlier  upset  or 
 
humiliation, and he had carried out the shooting in full conscious awareness and with 
 
self-control. 
 

Passing sentence at the end of the trial King J considered the evidence of KS’ anti-
social personality, but concluded that the disorder did not lower his culpability for this 
 
offence.  The  judge  acknowledged  the  evidence  of  his  disturbed  background  and 
disjointed education, and the fact that he lacked full maturity, given that he was 20 
years  old  when  the  offence  was  committed.    As  against  this  mitigation  there  was 
significant pre-meditation, although this was not personally directed at the victim, the 
killing  had  taken  place  on  a  public  highway,  and  KS  was  already  on  bail  awaiting 
sentence following a road rage incident the previous year.

58.	 

 
59.	 

 
The  judge  described  the  killing  as  a  “cold-blooded  murder”  committed  in  the  most 
harrowing circumstances.  He was satisfied that notwithstanding KS’ evidence at trial, 
he knew perfectly well that the gun was loaded, and he had left a party intending to 
find a victim to satisfy his desire to shoot and kill someone.  Although the choice of 
victim was entirely random, there was a significant degree of pre-meditation and he 
was sure that KS’ intention was to kill and that at all material times he was fully in 
control of his actions.  This was cold-blooded controlled aggression.  He had shown 
not the slightest remorse.  He had laughed and smirked as he ran off after the killing, 
and  indeed  during  the  trial.  The  tattoo  and  what  he  said  at  the  Magistrates  Court 
amounted to boasting of the murder. 

The  submission  in  support  of  the  contention  that  the  minimum  term  was  excessive 
involves  criticism  of  the  judge  for  taking  into  account  two  features  of  aggravation, 
first that the killing occurred in a public place, and second that the killing involved an 
element of planning beyond that involved in the premeditation involved in carrying a 
loaded  firearm.    It  is  also  suggested  that  the  judge  failed  to  attach  sufficient 
importance  to  the  mitigation  provided  by  the  defendant’s  relative  youth  and  the 
medical condition, which was examined in close detail during the trial.   

It is clear from his sentencing remarks that the judge was acutely aware of KS’ age 
 
and his personality disorder, and he was also aware that he had only recently been 
bailed in connection with another offence.  It takes very little imagination to reflect on 
 
the  impact  that  this  offence  would  have  had  in  the  locality;  a  young  man,  utterly 
blameless, simply gunned down as he walked down the street, and perhaps the most 
 
chilling feature of all was the sheer randomness with which he was chosen to be the 
 
victim.  KS had decided that he was going to kill someone, and he organised a loaded 
firearm, carried it, and executed his plan.  His attitude to the offence is chilling.  He 
 
has revelled in it.  That adds significantly to the seriousness of this crime.

Danilo Restivo 

(DR) was born on 3 April 1972.  On 29 June 2011 in the Crown Court at Winchester 
before Burnett J and a jury he was convicted of murder.  On the following day he was 
sentenced to life imprisonment, with a whole life specified minimum term. 

On  24  July  2012  the  full  court  refused  his  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against 
conviction (2012 EWCA Crim 1848). 

In considering his appeal against sentence, we do not proposed to reiterate the reasons 
for refusing his application for leave to appeal against conviction.

The murder of Heather Barnett took place on 12 November 2002.  Heather Barnett 
was  a  48  year  old,  single  mother,  living  with  her  children  at  an  address  in 
Bournemouth.  At 8.30 a.m. on 12 November she drove the children to school.  She 
returned  to  her  home  and  parked  her  car  at  about  8.40  a.m.    When  the  children 
returned from school at 4.04 pm, her son, aged 14 years, discovered his mother’s body 
in their bathroom.   

There were no signs of forced entry into the victim’s home.  The attack took place in 
the workroom, adjacent to the patio door, sometime between 8.30 a.m. and 10.56 a.m. 
 

Heather Barnett died as a result of multi-impact to her head with an implement such 
as a hammer.  There were at least 10 lacerating blows, causing skull fractures.  There 
were also defensive wounds to the left hand. 

After the fatal attack further injuries were inflicted on her.  Her throat was cut from 
ear to ear, cut down her spine and both her breasts were cut off.  The zip of her jeans 
was unfastened and her underwear and part of her pubic hair exposed.  A hank of cut 
hair  was  found  in  the  palm  of  her  right  hand  which  lay  over  her  stomach  near  her 
 
groin.  This hair came from someone else, but the victim’s own head hair was cut and 
some was placed in her left hand, and some left on the floor. 
 

 

68.	  When her children left their home to find help, DR and his then girlfriend saw their 
distressed state.  DR purported to offer comfort, when he knew perfectly well that he 
had killed their mother. 

Police  enquiries  revealed  that  DR  admitted  that  he  had  visited  his  victim  on  the 
morning of 6th November, in order to make an inquiry about whether she would make 
some bedroom curtains for him as a surprise Christmas present.  Following that visit 
 
she indicated to friends that she believed that he had taken her key.  As there was no 
forced entry into her home that was plainly right.  When he entered he must have been 
armed with both a hammer and a knife.  The weapons which caused the fatal injury 
and the post mortem injuries were not found, and he must have removed them. 

There was a good deal of further evidence to suggest that DR had a sexual obsession 
with the hair of females, and from time to time he followed women who were on their 
 
own.  However  the  more  significant  feature  of  the  present  case  arose  from  events 
which took place much earlier in September 1993 in Potenza in Italy.  A young 16 
year old woman disappeared in September 1993.  She was murdered, and her body 
was left in the loft of the church of the Most Holy Trinity.  It was not discovered until 
 
March  2010.  Examination  revealed  that  her  bra  was  broken  in  the  same  way  as 
 
Heather Barnett’s bra.  Her trousers were damaged and disarranged in the same way. 
 
Her  hair  was  cut  shortly  after  she  had  died  and  the  body  placed  in  the  loft,  and 
remnants of her hair were left with the body.  As in the present case, the last person 
known to have seen the victim alive was DR, and his victim was acquainted with him 
just  as  Heather  Barnett  was  acquainted  with  him.    The  circumstances  of  these  two

offences which took place in two different countries, and were separated by nearly a 
decade, were strikingly similar.

The  evidence  relating  to  Elisa  Clap’s  death  was  admitted  before  the  jury  at 
Winchester Crown Court as part of the evidence to prove that DR was guilty of the 
murder of Heather Barnett.  At that date, he had not been convicted in Italy of the 
murder of Elisa Clap: he had been convicted simply of lying to an inquiry in Italy 
about the circumstances of her disappearance and how he had received a cut to his 
 
hand  at  about  that  time.    Subsequent  to  the  conviction  and  sentence  at  Winchester 
Crown Court, DR was convicted in his absence of the murder of Elisa Clap in Italy. 
That, however, as we understand it, does not constitute a final conviction, in the same 
 
way as the conviction by a jury in this jurisdiction would be. 

 

The psychiatric report from Dr Joseph dated 6 January 2011 recorded an account by 
DR of a happy early childhood, but of bullying by other children in the sense of being 
neglected  by  his  parents  when  they  moved  to  Potenza.    He  referred  to  an  occasion 
when he responded aggressively to bullying when he was 13 years old.  He admitted 
to voyeurism and that from the age of 15 he like to touch and smell women’s hair, and 
started to cut hair secretly.  However he claimed he was able to stop this when he 
realised it was becoming a problem.  He came to England after chatting to his future 
wife on the internet, and they married in 2004.  He loved her. 

 

The  report  observed  that  if,  contrary  to  Restivo’s  assertion,  he  had  indeed  killed 
Heather Barnett, he chose to kill a mother in circumstances which would leave her 
children to fend for themselves and he may have seen parallels between his life as a 
teenager and directed his anger at his mother onto Heather Barnett.  The hair cutting 
was sexually driven and sadistic, and the murder itself was a sexually sadistic act.  He 
was fit to stand trial, but he suffered from a severely disordered personality amounting 
to  an  abnormality  of  mind.    There  might  therefore  be  a  defence  to  murder  on  the 
grounds of diminished responsibility. 

 

DR  elected  not  to  advance  any  such  defence.    At  trial  he  denied  responsibility  for 
Heather  Barnett’s  death.    The  Crown  called  overwhelming  evidence  of  guilt.  The 
application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  conviction  was  based  on  criticism  of  the 
 
decision to admit as similar fact the evidence relating to the death of Elisa Clap.  This 
 
was refused for reasons given in the judgment [2012] EWCA Crim. 1848. 

In his sentencing remarks the judge observed that the evidence relating to the murder 
of  Elisa  Clap  proved  “without  doubt”  that  DR  was  responsible  for  her  murder. 
 
However  he  continued  “you  have  not  been  convicted  of  that  murder  and  I  do  not 
 
sentence you in respect of it.  But it is important background, because I approach this 
sentence  on  the  basis  that  you  had  killed  before.    It  would  be  quite  unrealistic  to 
pretend that you had not”. 

 
76. 

The judge carefully addressed the specific features of the murder of Heather Barnett. 
 
He recorded that it was carefully planned, and that a false alibi had been prepared.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

The  appellant  appreciated  the  family  arrangements,  and  nevertheless  persisted  with 
the plan to kill Heather Barnett, knowing “that an 11 year old girl and a 14 year old 
boy  would  find  their  mother  butchered  on  the  bathroom  floor”.    The  judge  was 
satisfied that whatever the reason for the selection of Heather Barnett as a victim, the 
evidence  showed  that  DR  was  a  cold,  depraved,  calculated  killer  “who  murdered 
Heather to satisfy a sadistic sexual appetite”.  The mutilation of the body of the victim 
was “shocking”.  Taking all these features into account, together with “the previous 
killing of Elisa Clap”, he was driven to the conclusion that a starting point of 30 years 
imprisonment as the minimum term would not be appropriate.  The order would be a 
whole life order. 

 
77.	 

Focussing on the whole life order made in the particular circumstances of this crime, 
rather  than  on  the  submission  that  a  whole  life  term  was  always  inappropriate 
whatever  the  circumstances,  (a  submission  with  which  we  have  dealt  with  in 
paragraphs 4-30), Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC on DR’s behalf advanced a number of 
 
different grounds of appeal.  The most important criticism was directed at the judge’s 
consideration  of  the  murder  of  Elisa  Clap  as  a  feature  of  the  sentencing  decision. 
Furthermore, he failed to take fully into account that this murder was committed in 
2002, before the new provisions of Schedule 21 of the 2003 Criminal Justice Act had 
come into effect.  In accordance with the practice followed at that time a “whole life” 
 
tariff  would  not  have  been  ordered  by  the  Secretary  of  State.    Accordingly  Mr 
Fitzgerald  submitted  that  the  whole  life  order  retrospectively  increased  the  penalty, 
because even if such an order had been made by the Secretary of State, it would have 
been  subject  to  a  duty  of  regular  review,  and  the  sentence  was  therefore  wholly 
disproportionate  and  wrong  in  principle.  The  case  did  not  fall  within  any  of  the 
 
provisions of paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 21 which would normally justify a whole 
life  order.  Even  if  these  provisions  did  not  include  an  exclusive  list  of  categories, 
there was nothing further in the aggravating features of the case to require it, and in 
any  event  insufficient  attention  was  paid  to  the  evidence  relating  to  DR’s 
 
psychological disorder. 

 

 

78.	  When the judge summed the case up to the jury, he directed them, quite correctly, that 
the only court with jurisdiction to try DR for the murder of Elisa Clap and to convict 
him of the offence was an Italian court.  It is also clear that there was a vast body of 
evidence which provided strong evidence that he was indeed guilty of that murder. 
 
(See pp 65-97 of the summing up).  However, as the case was left to the jury, it was 
clearly open to them to convict DR of the murder of Heather Barnett even if they were 
not sure that he had murdered Elisa Clap.  In short, therefore, DR was not tried for or 
convicted of the murder of Elisa Clap (a murder which he denied), and the verdict did 
not and could not carry with it the inevitable conclusion that the jury must have been 
sure that he had murdered her.  At the same time, the trial judge, presiding over this 
sensitive  trial,  plainly  did  reach  the  sure  conclusion  that  he  was  indeed  guilty,  and 
therefore was not prepared to ignore it as a feature bearing on the sentencing decision. 
 
However, if he was entitled to have regard to it, then the first question which arises is 
whether  the  case  fell  within  the  starting  point  in  paragraph  4(2)(d),  that  when 
convicted  and  sentenced  for  the  murder  of  Heather  Barnett  the  offender  had 
“previously” been “convicted” of murder.  Plainly he had not.  That leaves open the 
question  whether  a  whole  life  order  was  nevertheless  the  appropriate  discretionary 
 
term.  This  is  linked  to  the  question  whether  in  assessing  the  appropriate  minimum
--------

term, the judge was entitled to take into account his own assessment, made during the 
trial that the appellant had committed another earlier murder with which he was not 
charged and of which he had not been convicted. This raises an issue of sentencing 
principle. 

 
79.	 

 

Dealing with it generally, it is axiomatic that, provided the verdict returned by the jury 
or the plea accepted by the Crown has been loyally respected, the sentencing judge is 
 
not merely entitled, but required to reflect on and balance all the relevant aggravating 
and mitigating features of the offence or offences of which the defendant has been 
convicted.  This  includes  any  features  of  aggravation  or  mitigation  which  have 
emerged  during  the  course  of  the  trial,  including  the  judge’s  assessment  of  the 
 
personality, character, maturity and attitude of the defendant to the offence.  This will 
often  include  making  findings  of  fact  on  disputed  points.    Such  findings  may  well 
 
include, for example, that in the course of the offence of which he has been convicted, 
the  defendant  committed  other  offences;  the  indictment  is  not  required  to  be 
overloaded  with  charges.  Where  for  example  the  conviction  is  for  an  offence  of 
conspiracy, the judge may need to make findings for the purpose of sentence about 
which of the overt acts the defendant has been shown to have committed.  There will 
be  other  situations  in  which  it  is  conceded  that  sentence  should  be  passed  which 
reflects  offences  beyond  those  charged;  the  indictment  may  contain  charges  which 
have been treated by consent as samples of a course of conduct, or the defendant may 
ask the court to take into consideration other specific offences.  However, it is equally 
axiomatic that, situations such as these apart, a defendant cannot simply be sentenced 
for offences of which he has not been convicted, or on the basis that he has in fact 
committed them.  The ability of the judge to make findings that other offences have 
been committed does not extend to reaching a non-jury verdict about allegations put 
before the jury by way of similar fact evidence, at least unless the jury must have been 
satisfied that they were proved, or unless the defendant has been convicted of them in 
 
the past. 

 
80.	 

The  principle  is  starkly  expressed  by  Lord  Steyn  in  R  v  Home  Secretary,  ex  parte 
Hindley [2001] 1 AC 410: 

“…  in  deciding  on  her  tariff  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not 
entitled to increase it as retribution and deterrence for murders 
 
of which Hindley had not been convicted.” 

However the Secretary of State was entitled to take into account the fact that, on the 
 
basis of her post trial confession,  Hindley in effect invited additional criminality of 
which she had not been convicted at trial to be taken into account. 

This observation was not newly minted for the purpose of that particularly notorious 
case.  Much earlier in Anderson v DPP [1978] AC 964, the court was concerned with 
the making of a criminal bankruptcy order in which the jurisdiction to make the order 
 
depended on the loss resulting from the offences exceeding £15,000.  As it happened 
the defendant was convicted of thirteen counts, for which the total loss was less than 
 
£15,000,  but  evidence  was  called  at  trial  to  establish  system  based  on  twenty 

 
81.
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
occasions  in  all,  for  which  the  total  loss  exceeded  £15,000.    The  House  of  Lords 
quashed  the  criminal  bankruptcy  order  made  at  trial  and  upheld  in  the  Court  of 
Appeal.  The decision was wrong.  This was because the defendant had not admitted 
any offence in relation to the twenty similar instances given in evidence which were 
not subject of any count in the indictment.  Therefore the judge “clearly had no right 
 
to take them into consideration in determining the sentence”. 

 
82.	 

This reasoning was followed in R v Clark [1996] 2 Cr. App. R 282.  After a close 
 
examination  of  a  substantial  number  of  inconsistent  earlier  authorities,  the  court 
observed: 

“It  seems  to  us  that  it  is  one  thing  to  permit  the  judge  to 
sentence  on  his  view  of  the  gravity  of  the  ingredients  of  the 
 
offence of which the jury have convicted (even if some of those 
ingredients  were  capable  of  being  free-standing  criminal 
offences), and quite a different thing to allow him to sentence 
on  the  basis  that  unproved,  separate  and  distinct  offences 
“aggravate” the offence of which he is convicted”. 

 
83.	 

Shortly  afterwards,  in  R  v  Bradshaw  [1997]  2  Cr.  App.  R(S)  128,  once  again  this 
court appeared to cast doubt on the decision in Clark.  The difficulties were finally 
resolved in, R v Kidd, Canavan and Shaw [1998] 1 WLR 604 where, sitting with Rose 
LJ, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division and Jowitt J, a judge 
with  unrivalled  experience  of  the  criminal  justice  system,  and  reflecting  what  were 
described as basic principles, Lord Bingham CJ  observed that it was 

“not easy to see how a defendant can lawfully be punished for 
offences for which he has not been indicted and which he has 
denied  or  declined  to  admit  …  we  think  it  inconsistent  with 
principle  that  a  defendant  should  be  sentenced  for  offences 
neither admitted or proved by a verdict”. 

After  examining  the  authorities  the  court  upheld  the  decision  in  R  v  Clark  and 
 
indicated that to the extent that it was at variance with other authority, it was “to be 
 
preferred”.  This is an end of the controversy. 

In the present case DR could not be charged in this jurisdiction with the murder of 
Elisa Clap.  It was justiceable in Italy, not here. If the murder had been committed in 
England, it would almost certainly have formed a second count on the indictment.  If 
DR had been convicted of the Elisa Clap offence before his trial for the murder of 
Heather  Barnett,  or  indeed  during  a  joint  trial  of  both  murders,  this  would  have 
 
provided an essential feature for the assessment of the minimum term for that murder. 
The judge properly and expressly rejected the notion that he should pass sentence for 
 
the murder of Elisa Clap.  Nevertheless, he undoubtedly took into account his belief 
that the appellant was guilty of that offence in deciding that a whole life term was 
appropriate.  In other words, although the appellant denied this distinct and separate 
 
offence, was not on trial for it and not convicted of it, the judge’s view that he was in 

 
84.
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
fact guilty, was treated as a significant piece of aggravation. The principle is clear. 
Even  when  evidence  which  serves  to  establish  the  defendant’s  guilt  of  an  offence 
charged  on  the  indictment  is  deployed  as  similar  fact  evidence,  the  sentencing 
decision cannot proceed on the basis that he is guilty of a distinct and separate offence 
of which he has not been convicted and which he denies.  Although we sympathise 
with the judge’s approach, it was inconsistent with what is now an axiomatic principle 
that,  subject  to  considerations  like  those  identified  in  para  79  the  ambit  of  the 
sentencing decision cannot extend to reflect a specific, distinct offence of which the 
offender has not been convicted. 

 

85.	  We  have  reflected  whether  it  is  now  open  on  this  appeal  against  sentence,  to  take 
 
account of the appellant’s conviction, subsequent to the present sentence in Italy. That 
would be problematic.  Quite apart from the question whether in accordance with the 
law of Italy, the recent conviction, reached in the absence of the appellant, is to be 
 
regarded  as  a  final  conviction,  when  the  sentence  imposed  in  the  Crown  Court  is 
based  on  a  misapplication  of  principle,  it  should  be  corrected.    We  must  take  the 
principled approach and proceed on the basis that it may at some future unspecified 
 
date be for the judicial authorities in Italy to decide what the appropriate sentence on 
the appellant should be for the murder of Elisa Clap. In reality that is most unlikely to 
happen. As we have already indicated, we think it highly improbable that it will ever 
 
be safe for DR to be released from custody.  Moreover although a whole life term 
must be quashed, the minimum term, to which we now turn, must be very substantial 
indeed. 

 

 
86.	 

The  appellant  fell  to  be  sentenced  in  accordance  with  the  transitional  provisions  in 
Schedule  22  of  the  2003  Act,  as  illuminated  for  guidance  purposes  by  the  relevant 
 
Practice Direction.  Where the offence was committed after 31st May 2002 and before 
 
18th December 2003, where the offender’s culpability is exceptionally high, a starting 
point  of  15/16  years  would  be  appropriate,  but  to  allow  for  significant  aggravating 
features of the case, a minimum term of 30 years might be appropriate, and indeed in 
cases of most exceptional gravity, a whole life term could be imposed.  Omitting from 
consideration the appellant’s involvement in the murder of Elisa Clap and reflecting 
 
on the horrific circumstances of the murder of Heather Barnett,  there are a number of 
 
aspects  of  the  killing  which  are  profoundly  disturbing.    We  note  in  particular  the 
extensive  preparation  for  the  killing  (which  included  careful  measures  to  avoid 
detection) and the display of sexual perversions and sadism, not least the appalling 
mutilation of the body, when the appellant knew perfectly well that it would be found 
by  the  victim’s  children.    Thereafter,  he  was  capable  of  brutal  hypocrisy  in  his 
purported expressions of concern and assistance offered to them.  A combination of 
all these factors leads us to the conclusion that the minimum term should be fixed at 
40 years.  This will replace the whole life term.

87.	  Michael  John  Roberts  (MR)  was  born  in  April  1966.    He  has  many  previous 
convictions, including a conviction for robbery in 1995 for which he was sentenced to

6 years imprisonment, and robbery again, in May 2005 when he was sentenced to life 
imprisonment.   

 
88.	 

 
The offences of which he was convicted on 20th December 2011 in the Crown Court 
at  Southwark  before  His  Honour  Judge  Robbins  and  a  jury  pre-date  the  robbery 
convictions.  He now appeals against the sentence imposed on 12 January 2012.  They 
were: 

Burglary, rape and causing grievous bodily harm in December 
1988 to EM, life imprisonment for rape, 15 years imprisonment 
for causing GBH, and 10 years imprisonment for burglary; 

Rape, indecent assault and burglary in September 1989, where 
the victim was GM.  Life imprisonment for rape, and 10 years 
imprisonment for indecent assault and burglary; 

indecent 

assault 

Rape,  buggery, 
life 
 
imprisonment for rape and buggery, and 10 years imprisonment 
for burglary and indecent assault.  These offences took place in 
October 1989 and the victim was AM; 

and  burglary, 

Causing  grievous  bodily  harm  and  burglary,  15  years 
imprisonment and 10 years imprisonment (respectively).  The 
victim was .  . . 

All  offences  were  ordered  to  run  concurrently.    So  far  as  the  sentences  of  life 
imprisonment were concerned, a whole life order was imposed as the minimum term. 

The  victims  in  all  these  offences  were  women,  no  longer  young,  living  alone,  who 
were attacked in their homes.   

The victims in Counts 1-3 was a 57 year old virgin, already suffering from a degree of 
disability,  who  returned  home  on  Boxing  Day  after  spending  Christmas  with  her 
family.  She recalled finding a man in her house who had struck her repeatedly.  She 
sustained multiple injuries to her face, which included a broken jaw, haematomas on 
both eyes, and a fractured eye socket.  There was a deep 10cm cut above her right 
eyebrow.  Her torso, notably around her left breast and shoulders were bruised.  There 
were  defensive  injuries  on  both  hands.  Her  thighs  were  bruised,  with  dried  blood 
smeared over the entire surface of the thighs and lower legs, particularly to the front, 
and marks around this area consistent with bruising caused by finger pressure.  There 
was a 1.5cm laceration found in the vagina running down towards the perineum, with 
further bruising and lacerations in this area, and on further examination, bleeding was 
noted from higher up the vagina vault.  Due to the distress caused by this part of the 
examination, it was halted, but these findings were consistent with sexual penetration. 
 
Obviously she had been subjected to a violent physical assault.  The majority of the 
 
blows to her head were caused by a clenched fist.  The injuries to her jaw and eye 
sockets were caused by separate impacts, possibly by punches or blows from a soft 
heeled shoe.  The injuries above her right ear were more consistent with kicks, but 
 

 
89.	 

 
90.

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
could  also  have  been  caused  by  repeated  fist  blows.    The  other  injuries  were 
 
consistent with having been gripped and having her thighs forced apart during forcible 
sexual assault. 

The victim in counts 4-6 lived only a few yards away from the victim in counts 1-3. 
 
She was 77 years old, a frail elderly woman with advanced arthritis.  Some 10 days or 
so before the attack, MR had appeared in her sitting room, claiming that he had been 
chased out of a pub, but on that occasion the victim was able to call out to a neighbour 
and he ran away. 

On  11th  September  1989  MR  again  entered  her  sitting  room,  demanding  to  know 
where her money and jewellery were.  He told her not to look at him or her face and 
 
then ordered her to take off her clothes, threatening her with his fists if she did not. 
He made her lie on the bed.  He tried to penetrate her vaginally, and then anally.  She 
told him she was single and had never had sex, and she did not want it now.  Her 
 
pleas were ignored.  He inserted his finger into her vagina and put his penis in her 
mouth.  He then tried to make her kneel on the floor but she told him because of her 
 
arthritis she could not do so, so he ordered her back to the bed.  He made her remove 
 
her dentures and suck his penis before putting his finger into her anus.  He then left 
 
her, taking £5 from her handbag in the kitchen. 

On examination the victim had bruising on her arm, her vagina was exquisitely tender 
and  bright  red.  These  findings  were  consistent  with  recent  digital  penetration  and 
attempted penile penetration. 

 

The victim in count 7-10 was attacked approximately one month later, on 7 October 
 
1989.  Her flat was just over 300 yards from MR’s then new address.  Shortly after 
her nephew had left the premises, MR entered, grabbing her from behind and putting 
his hand over her nose and mouth.  He pushed her into the sitting room, and ordered 
her not to speak and told her he could be violent.  She said that her son would be 
coming back at any moment, and he told her that she was lying.  He told her that he 
wanted money, and ordered her to take off her clothes.  When she refused he started 
to pull her dressing gown off, and, because she was not strong enough to resist, and 
terrified, she took off her remaining clothes.  The appellant touched her breasts, and 
then  licked  and  sucked  them.    He  made  her  go  through  to  her  bedroom  where  he 
committed various sexual offences, including attempts to penetrate her vaginally and 
anally with his penis, and then tried to make her suck his penis by pushing it in her 
mouth.  He placed his fingers and then his tongue in her vagina.  She was heaving, 
shaking  and  crying,  and  begged  him  to  leave.    She  persuaded  him  to  let  her  make 
some tea, in the hope that it would bring him to his senses.  But after a drink from a 
 
tap  he  again  returned  and  attempted  vaginal  and  anal  rape  and  then  forced  her  to 
masturbate him and tried to make her take his penis in her mouth.  This was followed 
by  vaginal  rape  and  ejaculation.  The  ordeal  lasted  for  3  hours,  and  after  MR  had 
sought to remove all trace of his presence in the flat, he cut the telephone wire.

95.	 

 
96.	 

 
The victim in counts 11-12 was an 84 year old woman, living alone in a ground floor 
flat, close to the address of the last victim.  She was severely assaulted by MR at the 
end of February or beginning of March 1990, when, due to a recent hip operation she 
 
had difficulty walking. 

She was found, on 2 March 1990 by her “home-help” with serious injuries to her fact, 
unable  to  speak  or  describe  anything  of  what  had  happened  to  her.    Medical 
 
examination revealed that her upper jaw was fractured in one place, and the lower jaw 
 
in two places.  The left side of her face was severely swollen, blackened and bruised. 
 
There was no evidence of sexual assault.  Her telephone wire had been cut. 

 

97.	  MR’s responsibility for these offences was established following what are known as 
“cold  case  reviews”.  He  was  produced  from  HMP  Wandsworth  where  he  was  a 
serving the sentence imposed in June 2005.  On his arrest he replied “you are having a 
joke, aren’t you?”   

Psychiatric reports, prepared in the context of his appearance following conviction for 
 
robbery in 2005, were made available to the sentencing judge.  The psychiatrists were, 
of course, unaware of the offences with which we are concerned.   

They recorded a history of drink and drug abuse, and an earlier diagnosis of excessive 
compulsive  disorder  and  depression.    On  the  basis  of  his  numerous  previous 
convictions, MR could properly  be regarded as having a personality disorder, or in 
legal  terms,  a  psychopathic  disorder.    His  then  recent  offending  and  behaviour 
suggested a deterioration in behaviour, possibly secondary to the abuse of alcohol and 
drugs.  Treatment for his mental state could be given in custody, and did not merit 
transfer to a psychiatric hospital for assessment or treatment.  It was clearly indicated 
that  he  could  not  be  regarded  as  anything  other  than  “a  danger  to  the  public”  and 
treatment  for  his  condition,  even  after  “the  most  arduous  efforts”  were  not  assured 
because treatment for such conditions “is notoriously unsuccessful”. 

In  his  sentencing  remarks  Judge  Robbins  clearly  directed  himself  about  the 
appropriate criteria for discretionary life sentences, and came to the conclusion that on 
the facts here, such a sentence was right.  He then went on to examine the appropriate 
 
minimum  term.    MR  broke  into  the  homes  of  his  victims  and  subjected  them  to 
degrading sexual attacks, and the offences were aggravated by terrible violence, far 
 
over and above whatever pressure would have been needed to perpetrate the sexual 
offences.  As  a  result,  the  entire  community  in  South  London  had  been  terrified. 
 
There  were  multiple  aggravating  features.    These  were  most  vulnerable  elderly 
women  living  alone,  who  were  deliberately  targeted,  subjected  to  violent  sexual 
attack, and completely terrorised.  The victim impact statements showed how much 
 
their lives had been ruined.  Their last years were utterly blighted.  None would ever 
 
recover.  MR himself had shown no pity or remorse.  These offences, together with 
some of his earlier convictions, confirm that he was cruel and ruthless and a real and 
continuing danger especially to vulnerable people.  The judge concluded that a whole 
life term was appropriate.

100.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 

101.	  The essential argument advanced in this appeal is that although this was an extremely 
serious series of offences, in which the interests of public safety amply justified the 
imposition of a discretionary life sentence, the whole life order was inappropriate and 
 
wrong in principle.  In summary, among the cases where whole life orders had been 
imposed, none could be found in the context of sexual crime where one or more of the 
victims had not been murdered.  Without in any way seeking to trivialise the ordeals 
 
of the victims,  it was submitted that the whole life order should be reserved for cases 
where the criminal went even further than MR had gone on any of these occasions.   

 

102.	  Like the Crown, which accepted that notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences a 
whole life order was inappropriate, we agree that there is force in this submission.  It 
is regrettably possible to envisage, and there have been cases, where dreadful sexual 
assaults have been followed by murderous violence.  The whole life order is reserved 
 
for the most exceptional cases.  Without suggesting that the court is prohibited from 
making a whole life order unless the defendant is convicted of at least one murder, 
such an order will, inevitably be a very rare event indeed.   

 

103.	  The whole life order must be quashed.  In its place, to allow for MR’s criminality and 
his  previous  convictions,  we  shall  substitute  a  minimum  term  of  25  years,  the 
 
equivalent of a 50 year determinate sentence.  In doing so we are not to be taken as 
 
implying that MR is anything less than highly dangerous, and on the evidence before 
us at the moment it seems highly improbable that he will, after the expiry of 25 or 30 
or more years, or indeed ever be safe for release.   

 
David Martin Simmons 
 

 

104.	  David Simmons (DS) was born in March 1972.  On 17th February 2004 he pleaded 
guilty to rape and false imprisonment, and on 9th December 2004 before His Honour 
Judge  Foley  he  was  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment  on  each  count.    It  is  open  to 
 
question whether the judge positively ordered that he should be subject to a whole-life 
term.  What is certain is that he did not specify any lower or specific term.  Shortly 
after sentence, DS was transferred from prison to Broadmoor Hospital, and in 2010 he 
 
was transferred back to HMP Bristol.  There he was told, for the first time, that in the 
absence of any tariff sentence, he was regarded as a whole-life prisoner.  He requires 
an extension of time of over 7 years in which to seek leave to appeal against sentence. 
  
In  view  of  the  uncertainty  of  the  true  effect  of  the  judge’s  sentencing  remarks,  the 
 
confusion  is  understandable,  and  in  these  exceptional  circumstances  leave  was 
granted. 

 

105.	  The  facts  of  this  case  are  uncomplicated.    It  was  just  after  midnight  on  25  August 
 
2003 when the complainant accepted a lift from DS.  Shortly afterwards he produced 
a knife and held it to her throat.  He then drove to an industrial estate.  He tied her 
hands behind her back and blindfolded her.  The passenger seat was reclined.  She 
 
was  forced  to  lie  back.  Her  footwear,  jeans  and  knickers  were  removed.    The 
 
appellant penetrated her digitally, and then, using a condom, got on top of her and 
unsuccessfully  attempted  to  penetrate  her.    Frustrated  he  then  used  great  force  to
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

penetrate her vagina and ejaculated inside her.  He then removed her from the vehicle, 
washing her vagina and anus with wine, before putting her jeans back on, tying her to 
the passenger seat, and driving her, blindfolded, to another industrial estate.  There 
 
she was taken from the car.  Her jumper was placed over the back of her head.  Some 
 
of it was put in her mouth as a gag and it was secured with a rope.  He said he would 
“slit her throat”, saying that he would go and get a bigger knife, and he left.  He did 
not  return.    Eventually  the  complainant  was  able  to  make  contact  with  a  security 
officer and the police were contacted. 
 

 

106.	  DS was arrested and interviewed on a number of occasions.  He said that he had been 
with a prostitute and agreed a price for certain sex acts, adding that he had “lost the 
 
plot”.  Although he could not remember what had happened he did not accept that he 
 
had threatened the victim or done anything against her will. 

 

107.	  DS  had  a  number  of  previous  convictions,  including  two  in  2000  for  an  indecent 
assault  and  robbery.  The  2000  offences  had  many  similarities  to  the  present  case. 
 
The  victim  was  a  working  prostitute.  He  forced  her  to  perform  oral  sex  and 
masturbate him.  He threatened her with a knife held to her throat.  He inserted his 
fingers into her vagina.  The victim in the offence of robbery was a woman in the 
street whom he grabbed from behind.  He told her he had a knife and he would kill 
her if she did not shut up. 

 

108.	  DS refused to attend for interview for the purposes of a pre-sentence report.  In view 
 

 

of the high risk he posed to women, a life sentence was recommended.   

 
109.	 

In brief sentencing remarks the judge expressed himself satisfied that DS presented 
and posed “a significant risk to women”.  He imposed a discretionary sentence of life 
 
imprisonment.  He said that it was the wish of the court that he “could not be released 
until (he) ceased to be such a risk.”  DS was a person of “unstable character likely to 
commit similar offences,” and he was “a danger”.  He then said that the court was not 
required to specify a period “if it is of the opinion that no period should be specified”, 
and  he  expressed  himself  so  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  the  overall  seriousness  of  the 
offences,  the  antecedent  history,  and  the  reports  on  him.  The  sentencing  remarks 
culminated:  “Accordingly there will be a sentence of life imprisonment”.   

 

110.	  Given the appellant’s previous convictions, and the circumstances of this very serious 
sexual offence, unsurprisingly, it was not argued on his behalf that the discretionary 
 
life  sentence  was  inappropriate.  The  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  for  the 
indefinite future DS posed a substantial risk to public safety. 
   

 

111.	  The criticism is that the judge, concerned with the element of public protection, failed 
sufficiently  to  appreciate  that  the  assessment  of  the  minimum  term  represented  a 
separate  and  distinct  element  of  the  sentencing  decision,  designed  to  reflect  the 
appropriate  level  of  punishment.    The  Crown  agrees  that  the  whole  life  order  was 
inappropriate.

112.	  As it seems to us, profoundly disturbing as this offence certainly was, it was not an 
offence  of  the  extreme  level  of  seriousness  to  justify  a  whole  life  order.    It  was 
submitted  that  the  appropriate  minimum  term  would  be  between  10-12  years.    The 
appropriate minimum term, which will replace the whole life order, is 10 years, the 
equivalent of a 20 year determinate sentence.  As the offence took place before the 
introduction of s.240 of the 2003 Act, we have taken account of s.67 of the Criminal 
Justice Act 1967 in assessing the minimum term.  As with MR, in quashing the whole 
 
life order, we emphasise that we are not suggesting for one moment that DS will be 
safe to be released at the conclusion of the 10 year period.  We note that it has been 
necessary  for  him  to  spend  time  in  Broadmoor  Hospital,  and  we  suspect  that  his 
release is most unlikely.",2012-11-21 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
 

Introduction 
 

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

The  present  appeals  heard  before  a  special  constitution  of  the  Court  of  Appeal 
Criminal  Division  are  directed  at  sentences  which  were  imposed  on  different 
occasions  following  very  grave  crimes.    Three  of  the  appellants  were  convicted  of 
murder, and two of rape and associated sexual crime.  For those convicted of murder 
the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was imposed: for those convicted of rape 
and  sexual  crime  discretionary  life  sentences  were  imposed.    There  is  no  appeal 
against  the  mandatory  life  sentence  of  life  imprisonment  following  conviction  for 
murder.  The  imposition  of  a  discretionary  life  sentence  may  be  the  subject  of  an 
appeal  but  that  issue  does  not  arise  in  either  of  the  present  cases  where  it  was 
 
imposed.    These  orders  ensure  the  long  term  protection  of  the  public.  We  should 
perhaps emphasise at the outset that each of these appellants is dangerous, and on the 
available evidence, likely to remain dangerous for the indefinite future.  At present it 
is difficult to see how it will ever become safe for any of them to be released from 
custody. 

 

The appeals are confined to the second distinct element of the sentences, that is the 
judicial  assessment  of  the  minimum  term  to  be  served  by  the  appellants  for  the 
purposes of punishment and retribution before the possibility of their release may be 
 
considered. In four of these appeals (two of murder and two of rape), whole life terms 
 
were ordered, and in the fifth case, (another case of murder) the minimum term was 
assessed  at  30  years.  This  element  of  sentence,  whether  imposed  following  a 
 
mandatory or a discretionary life sentence, is discretionary.   

Dealing with it very briefly for the moment, the jurisprudence of the European Court 
of Human Rights distinguishes, for reasons which are clearly apparent, between three 
 
different types or classes of sentences of life imprisonment.  They are: 

“(i) a life sentence with eligibility for release after a minimum 
period has been served; 

(ii) a “discretionary sentence of life imprisonment without the 
 
possibility of parole”; and 

(iii)  a  “mandatory  sentence  of  life  imprisonment  without  the 
 
possibility of parole”. 

In the context of this jurisprudence, the whole life terms on four of these appellants 
represented discretionary sentences of life imprisonment without parole, that is, type 
(ii) and the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment with a minimum term assessed 
at 30 years fell within the ambit of type (i).  None fell within type (iii), and in this 
jurisdiction such a sentence cannot be imposed.

into 

to  reflect  punishment  and  deterrence 

It  is  unnecessary  for  this  judgment  to  revisit  the  steady  development  of  sentencing 
practice which followed the abolition of the death penalty and its replacement with 
the  mandatory  life  sentence.    This  included  the  transition  of  the  so-called  “tariff” 
 
period  designed 
the  formalised 
arrangements  for  assessing  the  appropriate  minimum  term  now  encompassed  in 
statute, and the transfer to the court of the responsibility of the Secretary of State for 
the Home Department to determine how long a period should actually be served. It is 
now exclusively for sentencing judges (and where necessary, this court) to decide the 
minimum term which it is appropriate for the defendant who subjected to a sentence 
of life imprisonment to serve before his release. Express statutory provision is made 
in Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 vesting the court with jurisdiction, in 
an appropriate case of exceptionally high seriousness, to order a whole life minimum 
term. It is submitted by Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC on behalf of the appellant Restivo 
that  this  provision  contravenes  Article  3  of  the  European  Convention  of  Human 
Rights. 

Every  civilised  country  embraces  the  principle  encapsulated  in  Article  3.  This 
provides that: 

“No  one  shall  be  subjected  to  torture  or  to  inhuman  or 
degrading treatment or punishment”. 

Simultaneously, however, every civilised country also embraces the principle that just 
punishment  is  appropriate  for  those  convicted  of  criminal  offences.    These  issues 
relating  to  just  and  proportionate  punishment  are  the  subject  of  rational  debate  and 
civilised disagreement.  The assessment of what should be deemed to constitute just 
punishment  or  inhuman  or  degrading  punishment  in  a  particular  circumstance  can 
legitimately  produce  different  answers  in  different  countries,  and  indeed  different 
 
answers  at  different  times  in  the  same  country.  All  these  are  at  least  in  part  a 
consequence  of  the  history  of  each  country.    The  question  whether  the  whole  life 
 
order  constitutes  a  breach  of  Article  3  of  the  Convention,  or  indeed  of  the  long 
established common law principle that the sentence should be proportionate in all the 
relevant circumstances of the offence and the criminal who has committed it, has been 
 
well debated. 
 

 
7.	 

There are those who view the whole life order with grave disquiet. In this jurisdiction 
 
the argument was reflected in the judgment of Laws LJ in R (Wellington) v Secretary 
of State for the Home Department [2007] … 

“…  a  prisoner’s  incarceration  without  hope  of  release  is  in 
many respects in like case to a sentence of death.  He can never 
atone  for  his  offence.  However  he  may  use  incarceration  as 
time for amendment of life, his punishment is only exhausted 
by  his  last  breath  …  The  supposed  inalienable  value  of  the 
prisoner’s  life  is  reduced,  merely  to  his  survival:  to  nothing
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

more  than  his  drawing  breath  and  being  kept,  no  doubt, 
confined in decent circumstances.  That is to pay lip-service to 
 
the value of life; not to vouchsafe it”. 

 
8.	 

In the European Court of Human Rights, the same concern is clearly underlined in the 
recent joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Garlicki, David Thorbe Jorgivsson and 
 
Nicolaou  in  Vinter  and  Others  v  United  Kingdom  (applications  nos.  66069/09  and 
130/10 and 3896/10). Particular concern was expressed about the 

 

“hopelessness inherent in a sentence of life imprisonment from 
 
which,  independently  of  the  circumstances,  there  is  no 
possibility whatsoever of release while the prisoner is still well 
enough to have any sort of life outside prison”. 

These are examples of many occasions when similar judicial observations have been 
made.   

 
9.	 

Be all that as it may, in the context of the whole life term, contrary views have been 
expressed by eminent jurists, not least, Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ in R v Secretary 
of State for the Home Department, ex parte Hindley [1998] QB 751 at 769: 

 

“I  can  see  no  reason,  in  principle,  why  a  crime  or  crimes,  if 
sufficiently  heinous,  should  not  be  regarded  as  deserving  life 
long incarceration for purposes of pure punishment.” 

It is not without importance that, as the then Lord Chief Justice, he went on to reflect 
that in the context of whole life tariffs, “Successive Lord Chief Justices have regarded 
 
such a tariff as lawful, and I share their view”.  In expressing himself in this way, he 
was, of course, addressing the situation which obtained when assessment of the penal 
period to be served by the defendant was made by the Home Secretary, in the light of 
any judicial recommendations.  

 
10.	 

Hindley’s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, and the House of Lords, too, 
supported the decision of the Divisional Court.  Giving the leading judgment, Lord 
 
Steyn  addressed  the  observation  of  Lord  Bingham,  and  agreed  that  some  crimes 
would be sufficiently heinous to deserve life long incarceration for the purposes of 
 
pure punishment.  He continued: 

“There  is  nothing  logically  inconsistent  with  …  saying  that 
there are cases where the crimes are so wicked that even if the 
prisoner is detained until he or she dies it will not exhaust the 
requirements of retribution and deterrence”. 

At the time when this case was making its way through the courts, the whole-life tariff 
was  not  based  on  an  express  statutory  provision.  Nevertheless  Lord  Bingham  and 
Lord Steyn were expressing views which affirmed support for the principle that there

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

had  been  and  no  doubt  would  continue  to  be  cases  in  which  a  whole  life  order 
represented just punishment. 

 
11.	 

Perhaps  the  need  to  give  due  recognition  and  respect  to  legitimate  but  inconsistent 
views  on  this  issue  is  encapsulated  in  the  observations  of  Baroness  Hale  in  R 
(Wellington)  v  Home  Secretary  [2009]  1  AC  335,  at  paragraph  53,  where,  in  the 
context of extradition to a jurisdiction which embraced the whole life minimum term 
 
principle, she observed: 

 

“I  do  understand  the  philosophical  position,  that  each  human 
being  should  be  regarded  as  capable  of  redemption  here  on 
earth  as  well  as  hereafter.    To  those  who  hold  this  view,  the 
denial  of  the  possibility  of  redeeming  oneself  in  this  life  by 
 
repentance  and  reform  may  seem  inhuman.    I  myself  was 
 
brought up in that tradition.  But … that is not the only tenable 
view  of  the  matter.  …  there  are  many  justifications  for 
subjecting a wrongdoer to a life in prison.  It is not for us to 
impose  a  particular  philosophy  of  punishment  upon  other 
countries”. 

 

12.	  Whatever the judicial views about the whole life minimum term, it was incorporated 
in  express  legislative  terms  in  the  2003  Act.  This  statutory  provision  reflects  the 
settled will of Parliament.  Simultaneously, the legislation removed the possibility of 
imposing it from the executive and placed it full square in the hands of the judiciary, 
 
we emphasise, as a discretionary element of sentencing.  The issue of the whole life 
order, in the context of Article 3, has been reflected in a number of decisions in the 
 
courts both domestically and in Europe. 

In  R  v  Bieber  [2009]  1  WLR  223  this  court  quashed  a  whole  life  order  following 
Bieber’s  conviction  for  murdering  one  policeman,  and  attempting  to  murder  two 
others, in an incident which lasted eight seconds.  It was argued that the facts did not 
justify  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life  order,  which  violated  Article  3.    Particular 
reliance was placed on the decision of the Grand Chamber in the European Court of 
Human Rights in Kafkaris v Cyprus (Apps No: 201906/04). At that date in Cyprus, 
premeditated  murder  was  followed  automatically  by  a  mandatory  sentence  of  life 
imprisonment, in effect a full life term, which was not thereafter considered by any 
judicial  body.  Accordingly  the  question  whether  a  whole  life  term  would  in  fact 
 
follow the conviction was not decided by a judge.  The President of Cyprus, however, 
 
was vested  with a discretion to remit, suspend or commute the life sentence, provided 
 
the Attorney General, who was responsible for the original prosecution, agreed with 
the President.  The ECHR held that there was no breach of Article 3 because of this 
limited possibility of release.   

In  Bieber,  acknowledging  that  the  United  Kingdom  did  not  rank  among  member 
states which considered that there was a maximum level of imprisonment which could 
be  justified  by  way  of  punishment,  after  which  humanity  required  the  defendant’s 
release, the court concluded: 

 
13.	 

 
14.
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

“ … Schedule 21 of the 2003 Act proceeds on the premise that 
some  crimes  are  so  heinous  that  they  justify  imprisoning  the 
 
offender for the rest of his life, however long that may be”. 

The court concluded that it did not follow from the decision of the majority of the 
Grand Chamber that an irreducible life sentence imposed “to reflect the appropriate 
punishment  and  deterrence  for  a  serious  offence”  was  necessarily  in  conflict  with 
Article 3.  The court also reflected on the power of the Secretary of State to release a 
life prisoner under s.30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, and considered that if the 
 
time should come when the continued detention of a prisoner subject to a whole life 
order would, of itself, amount to “inhuman or degrading treatment”, the discretionary 
release of the prisoner would fall within the ambit of the powers of the Secretary of 
State. 

Vinter  and  others  v  United  Kingdom  (Applications  Nos.  66069/09  and  130/10  and 
3896/10) was a decision of the fourth section of the European Court of Human Rights, 
subsequently  referred  to  the  Grand  Chamber,  in  which  the  court,  following  the 
 
observations of the House of Lords in R (Wellington), doubted whether the statutory 
power of release under s.30 of the 1997 Act was as broad in its effect as this court had 
suggested  in  Bieber.  Nevertheless  the  court  concluded  that  in  the  three  cases  then 
 
under consideration, the continued detention of three defendants who had been made 
subject to a whole life tariff did not violate Article 3 because the “requirements of 
punishment and deterrence could only be satisfied by a whole life order”.  This was a 
legitimate penological purpose. The court went on to hold that if a discretionary life 
 
sentence  without  the  possibility  of  parole  was  imposed  by  a  court  after  due 
 
consideration  of  all  relevant  mitigation  and  aggravating  factors,  an  Article  3  issue 
would not arise at the moment when it was imposed, but only when it could be shown 
that  the  defendant’s  continued  imprisonment  could  not  longer  be  justified  on  any 
legitimate penalogical grounds (such as punishment, deterrence, public protection of 
rehabilitation); and the sentence is irreducible de facto and de jure.   

The  court  rejected  the  contention  that  a  mandatory  sentence  of  life  imprisonment 
without  the  possibility  of  parole  was  of  itself  incompatible  with  the  Convention, 
despite an acknowledgement of the trend in Europe generally against such sentences. 
 
Unsurprisingly the court believed that such a sentence would be likely to be grossly 
disproportionate  if  the  sentencing  court  was  required  to  disregard  in  particular 
mitigating  factors,  such  as  youth  or  severe  mental  health  problems  which  would 
 
provide for a significantly reduced level of culpability on the part of the defendant,  In 
short the alleged violation of rights under Article 3 was rejected on the basis of the 
 
seriousness of the crimes which had been committed, and the sentences imposed for 
the purpose of deterrent and punishment justified continued incarceration. 

 

The  issue  of  the  whole  life  order  and  Article  3  considerations  have  also  been 
examined closely in the context of extradition.  In this jurisdiction the decision of the 
Divisional  Court  in  R  (Wellington)  was  considered  in  the  House  of  Lords.  The 
 
request  for  extradition  related  among  other  charges,  to  two  charges  of  first  degree 
murder,  for  which  the  prescribed  penalties  were  death  or  imprisonment  for  life

without  eligibility  for  probation,  parole  or  release  except  by  the  act  of  the  State 
Governor.  In  fact  the  prosecuting  authority  gave  an  undertaking  that  it  would  not 
seek the death penalty.  The extradition to the United States was upheld. 

 

Lord Hoffmann agreed with the decision in Bieber, in particular that any complaint 
 
that the whole life term contravened Article 3 of the Convention should be made if 
and when the time came when it could be argued that the continued detention of the 
prisoner infringed Article 3.  Lord Scott suggested that Article 3 was “prescribing a 
minimum standard of acceptable treatment or punishment below which the signatory 
nations could be expected not to sink but not as high a standard as that which many of 
those  nations  might  think  it  right  to  require  for  every  individual  within  their 
jurisdiction,  and  therefore  entitled,  even  if  only  temporarily,  to  their  protection. 
 
Article  3  was  prescribing  the  minimum  standard,  not  a  norm.    It  must  be  open  to 
individual states to decide for themselves what, if any, higher standards they would 
set  for  themselves”.    Although  Lord  Brown  of  Eaton-under-Heywood  doubted  the 
 
efficacy of the compassionate release provisions in s.30 of the 1997 Act referred to in 
Bieber, he concluded that a whole life minimum term was not objectionable provided 
at the date when it was being fixed, all the circumstances were considered, and the 
crime was of sufficient seriousness to merit such draconian punishment. 

In  Harkins  and  Edwards  v  United  Kingdom  (App.  Nos.  9146/07  and  32650/07, 
judgment  on  17th  January  2012),  in  the  context  of  Article  3  of  the  Convention,  the 
European  Court  of  Human  Rights  addressed  the  possibility  of  extradition  to  a 
 
jurisdiction where a life sentence might be imposed without the possibility of parole. 
 
Significantly the court held that no distinction could be drawn in principle between 
the assessment of the minimum level of severity required in the domestic context, and 
the same assessment in the extra-territorial context.  The court was prepared to accept 
that in principle matters of appropriate sentencing largely fell outside the scope of the 
Convention,  but,  understandably,  that  a  “grossly  disproportionate  sentence  could 
amount to ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 at the moment of its imposition”.  The 
 
“gross  disproportionality”  test  would  only  be  met  on  “rare  and  unique  occasions”. 
 
Addressing the issue of the whole life term imposed as a discretionary element of a 
sentence attached to a sentence of life imprisonment, the court observed that such a 
sentence  would  normally  be  imposed  for  an offence  of  the  utmost  severity  such  as 
homicide. Expressly agreeing with the decisions of this court in Bieber (presumably 
subject  to  the  reservations  about  the  s.30  issue)  and  R  (Wellington)  the  court 
 
concluded that an Article 3 issue would only arise if it could be demonstrated that the 
 
continued  incarceration  could  no  longer  be  justified  on  any  legitimate  penological 
grounds, such as punishment, deterrence, public protection or rehabilitation and, that 
 
the sentence would be irreducible de facto and de jure.  Much greater scrutiny was 
required to be directed against the potential vice of any mandatory whole life sentence 
type (iii), which in effect deprived the defendant of any possibility of putting forward 
mitigating factors before the sentencing court.  Such a sentence would condemn the 
 
defendant to spend the rest of his days in prison, irrespective of his culpability, and 
indeed  whether  or  not  the  court  considered  the  sentence  to  be  justified.   That,  of 
course,  is  not  the  situation  which  obtains  in  the  orders  which  are  currently  under 
consideration.

In  Babar  Ahmed  and  others  v  United  Kingdom  (Applications  Nos.  24027/07, 
11949/08, 36742/08, 66911/09 and 67354/09), in the context of prison conditions, the 
fourth  section,  which  included  three  members  of  the  constitution  of  the  fourth 
chamber who had dissented in Vinter and others, once again addressed the question 
whether and at what point in the course of a life or other very long sentence an Article 
3 issue might arise.  Towards the end of the judgment, starting at paragraph 235, the 
 
court directly addressed the views expressed by the House of Lords in Wellington and 
the Court of Appeal in Bieber in the context of the decision in Kafkaris.  Consistent 
with  the  reasoning  in  Harkins  and  Edwards,  the  court  distinguished  between  a 
mandatory  whole  life  sentence  type  (iii)  and  a  discretionary  sentence  of  life 
imprisonment  without  the  possibility  of  parole  type  (ii)  which,  obtains  in  this 
jurisdiction. The court reflected broadly that a whole life mandatory sentence was not, 
of  itself,  incompatible  with  the  Convention,  although  the  trend  in  Europe  militated 
against  the  imposition  of  such  sentences.    Such  a  sentence  “would  be  much  more 
 
likely  to  be  disproportionate  than  any  other  type  of  life  sentence,  especially  if  it 
required  the  sentencing  court  to  disregard  mitigating  factors  which  are  generally 
understood as indicating a significantly lower level of culpability on the part of the 
 
defendant  such  as  youth  or  severe  mental  health  problems”.    Reflecting  on  the 
discretionary whole life order (ii) the court observed: 

“…  normally  such  sentences  are  imposed  for  offences  of  the 
utmost severity, such as murder or manslaughter.  In any legal 
system,  such  offences,  if  they  do  not  attract  a  life  sentence 
normally  attract  a  substantial  sentence  of  imprisonment, 
perhaps  of  several  decades.  Therefore,  any  defendant  who  is 
convicted of such an offence must expect to serve a significant 
number of years in prison before he can realistically have any 
 
hope  of  release,  irrespective  of  whether  he  is  given  a  life 
 
sentence or a determinate sentence.  It follows, therefore, that, 
 
if a discretionary life sentence is imposed by a court after due 
consideration of all relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, 
an  Article  3  issue  cannot  arise  at  the  moment  when  it  is 
imposed.  Instead, the court agrees with the Court of Appeal in 
 
Bieber and the House of Lords in Wellington that an Article 3 
issue will only arise when it can be shown: 

 

(i)  that  the  applicant’s  continued  imprisonment  can  no  longer 
be  justified  on  any  legitimate  penological  grounds  (such  as 
punishment, deterrence, public protection or rehabilitation); and 

(ii) as the Grand Chamber stated in Kafkaris… the sentence is 
reducible de facto and de jure”. 

From this analysis of the authorities in the European Court, it seems to us clear that 
the Court has proceeded on the basis that, provided the court has reflected on matters 
of  mitigation  properly  available  to  the  defendant,  a  whole  life  order  imposed  as  a 
matter of judicial discretion as to the appropriate level of punishment and deterrence 
following conviction for a crime of utmost seriousness would not constitute inhuman 
or degrading punishment.  In short, it is open to the individual state to make statutory

provision  for  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life  minimum  term,  and  in  an  appropriate 
case, as a matter of judicial discretion, for the court to make such an order. 

 
23.	 

In this jurisdiction the relevant provision is found in paragraph 4 of Schedule 21 of 
the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  (the  2003  Act).    This  identifies  cases  which  would 
“normally”  fall  within  the  category  of  exceptionally  high  seriousness,  justifying  a 
whole life order (ii).  These include: 

“…(a) the murder of two or more persons, where each murder 
 

involves any of the following -

(i) a substantial degree of pre-meditation or planning, 

(ii) the abduction of the victim, or  

(iii) sexual or sadistic conduct 

(b) the murder of a child if involving the abduction of the 
  
child or sexual or sadistic motivation, 
 

(c) a murder done for the purpose of advancing a political, 
  
 
religious, racial or ideological cause, or 

(d)  a  murder  by  an  offender  previously  convicted  of 
  
 
murder”. 

 
24.	 

No one doubts that a whole life minimum term is a Draconian penalty, or indeed that 
 
it is the order of last resort reserved for cases of exceptionally serious criminality.  In 
 
R  v  Jones  [2006]  2  Crim.  App.  R(S)  19,  Lord  Phillips  CJ  presiding  in  this  court 
observed, at para 10: 

“A whole life order should be imposed where the seriousness of 
the  offending  is  so  exceptionally  high  that  just  punishment 
requires the offender to be kept in prison for the rest of his or 
her  life.  Often,  perhaps  unusually,  where  such  an  order  is 
called  for  the  case  will  not  be  on  the  borderline.  …  To  be 
 
imprisoned  for  a  finite  period  of  30  years  or  more  is  a  very 
severe penalty.  If the case includes one or more of the factors 
 
set out in paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 21 it is likely to be a case 
that calls for a whole life order, but the judge must consider all 
the material facts before concluding that a very lengthy finite 
term will not be sufficiently severe.” 
 

In R v Wilson [2010] 1 Cr. App R(S) 11, the court repeated the constant principle, that 
a whole life order would be very rarely made.  

“It  remains  a  sentence  of  last  resort  for  cases  of  the  most 
extreme gravity”.

Time without number the court has underlined that the language of Schedule 21 is not 
prescriptive.  No  statutory  provision  requires  the  judge  to  impose  the  order  if  the 
interests of justice do not require it. 

 

26.	  What the Schedule provides is an indication of appropriate starting points which apply 
to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence of murder, or its combination with 
other offences associated with it.  It recognises that the level of seriousness may be so 
exceptionally high that the court should  consider whether a whole life order would be 
appropriate.  It is also clear from a series of decisions in this court that the statute does 
not  create  a  sentencing  straightjacket,  nor  require  that  a  mechanical  or  arithmetical 
approach to the problem of the assessment of the minimum term may be taken.  R v 
Height and Anderson [2009] 1 Cr. App. R(S) 117 provides the necessary emphasis: 

the 

“We have lost count of the number of times when this court has 
emphasised that these provisions are not intended to be applied 
Indeed,  in  our  judgment,  an  inflexible  approach 
inflexibly. 
would  be 
inconsistent  with 
the  statutory 
framework.    No  scheme  or  guidance  or  statutory  framework 
can  be  fully  comprehensive,  and  any  system  of  purported 
compartmentalisation or prescription has the potential to induce 
 
injustice.  Even when the approach to the sentencing decision is 
 
laid  down  in  an  apparently  detailed,  and  on  the  face  of  it, 
intentionally comprehensive scheme, the sentencing judge must 
achieve a just result”. 

terms  of 

 
27.	 

This  principle  has  been  repeated  on  numerous  occasions.    For  example  in  Inglis 
[2011] 2 Cr. App. R (S) 13, a case of murder committed as a “mercy killing” where 
the offender was the victim’s mother and in a position of trust, but carefully planned 
the killing of a particularly vulnerable son (all features of aggravation) the court was 
satisfied that, notwithstanding that these facts would normally aggravate the offence 
 
of murder, they should not: 

 

“… be taken to aggravate a murder committed by an individual 
who  genuinely  believes  that  her  actions  in  bringing  about  the 
 
death constitute an act of mercy”. 

 
28.	 

In R v M, AM and Kiki [2010] 2 Cr. App. R(s) 19 the court emphasised: 

“… the question for the sentencing judge in the end is not for 
compartmentalisation of the specific offence within this or that 
paragraph of the Schedule but the proper judicial assessment of 
the  appropriate  sentence  to  reflect  the  facts  of  the  individual 
case  and  its  seriousness  and  such  mitigating  features  as  there 
 
may be.  Justice simply cannot be done by a mechanistic filling 
in  of  “tick  boxes”  and  unconsidered  assignment  of  cases  into 
compartments …”.

30.	 

The result is that the whole life order, the product of primary legislation, is reserved 
 
for the few exceptionally serious offences in which, after reflecting on all the features 
of  aggravation  and  mitigation,  the  judge  is  satisfied  that  the  element  of  just 
punishment  and  retribution  requires  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life  order.    If  that 
conclusion is justified, the whole life order is appropriate: but only then.  It is not a 
mandatory or automatic or minimum sentence. 

In these circumstances the provisions of Schedule 21 of the 2003 Act, and paragraph 
4  in  particular,  which  enabled  the  court  to  make  a  whole  life  order  in  a  case  of 
exceptional seriousness are not incompatible with and do not contravene Article 3 of 
the Convention. 

David Oakes 
 

On 11 May 2012 in the Crown Court at Chelmsford before Fulford J and a jury David 
Oakes  (DO)  was  convicted  of  two  counts  of  murder.    He  was  sentenced  to  life 
imprisonment with a whole life term as the specified minimum sentence. 

DO was born in May 1961.  Christine Chambers was born in December 1973.  They 
started to see each other in July 2005.  They began to live together.  She had three 
 
older children, one of whom, CC, lived with her.   Their child, Shania Chambers, was 
born in October 2008. 

  

The relationship was stormy.  It is clear that DO was a violent, domineering man.  As 
 
a result Christine Chambers made an application to the court for a non-molestation 
order.  On  21st  April  2011,  on  the  basis  of  a  number  of  allegations  of  significant 
 
violence, the order was made.  Thereafter he was in constant breach.  She was advised 
to  make  a  formal  complaint  against  him,  and  indeed  he  was  warned  by  the  police 
against these continuing breaches. 

Shortly before midnight on 5th/6th June 2011, uninvited and unexpected, DO went to 
 
the home where Christine Chambers and her two daughters were living.  They were in 
bed.  He entered, using a key in his possession.  He carried a bag which contained an 
axe, a bottle containing petrol and various other implements including a Stanley knife 
 
and pliers.  He was also carrying a double barrelled shotgun together with numerous 
 
cartridges for use in the gun. 

DO  went  to  the  bedroom  and  turned  the  light  on,  waking  the  two  girls.    When 
Christine Chambers told him to get out, he opened the bag and took out the axe.  He 
 
showed them the shotgun and cartridges.  He said he would burn the house down and 
that  he  had  petrol  in  a  blue  bottle  together  with  a  lighter.    He  punched  Christine 
 
Chambers  in  the  eye  and  struck  her  with  the  butt  of  the  gun.    CC  tried  to  use  her 
mobile phone to get help, but he snatched it from her and broke both her phone and 
her mother’s phone.

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
The precise sequence of events thereafter is not entirely clear but Christine Chambers 
was  certainly  subjected  to  a  series  of  degrading  and  humiliating  assaults.    She  was 
ordered to cut off her hair with a pair of scissors which he took from the bag.  He 
made her remove her upper clothing and ordered her to walk about without a bra.  He 
 
made her hug and kiss him, and say that she loved him.  She implored  him  not  to 
touch her or the children, saying that she would do anything.  He ordered CC to go 
upstairs,  threatening  her  with  a  knife.  She  heard  him  threaten  to  blow  Christine 
Chambers’  leg  off  and  rip  off  her  nipples  with  pliers.    CC  managed  to  make  her 
 
escape  and  climbed  out  of  a  bedroom  window  onto  a  flat  roof  where  she  jumped 
 
down and ran for help to her father, who lived near by.  The police were called. 

In  the  meantime  Christine  Chambers  was  subjected  to  an  attack  of  horrifying 
 
violence.  An axe or meat cleaver cut deeply into her scalp and a sharp instrument, 
such as a Stanley knife, was used to disfigure her.  DO inflicted a deep incised wound 
into  her  left  eyebrow,  to  which  he  applied  glue,  and  a  Y  shaped  laceration  to  the 
bridge  of  the  nose,  and  virtual  detachment  to  the  lower  part  of  the  left  ear.    She 
sustained what can reasonably be described as slash marks on both sides of her face, 
and a similar cut running along the mid-line from the lower abdomen to the vulva. 
She was shot in the left thigh, as she was lying on the ground.  She was shot, again, in 
the right knee.  The fatal wound was a gun shot to the left side of her chest, which 
caused fatal damage to the upper abdomen/chest and a transection of the aorta.  A few 
minutes after killing Christine Chambers, DO shot his daughter in the left side of the 
forehead, just above the left eyebrow, and killed her. 

 

DO then shot himself in the face.  In total he had fired 7 shots, loading and unloading 
his gun at least 4 times.    

He was arrested in hospital on 19th June, and in due course charged with the murder 
 
of Christine Chambers and their daughter. 

A search of the victims’ home revealed a shotgun, pieces of a broken gun handle, a 
wooden  handled  axe,  a  pair  of  blue  handled  cutters  or  pliers,  a  home  made  noose 
 
made from wire, and many cartridges, as well as petrol. 

Passing sentence at the end of the trial, in detailed and carefully reasoned sentencing 
observations, Fulford J described some of the background.  He concluded that DO had 
killed Christine Chambers and his daughter simply because he was unable to accept 
 
that Christine Chambers could no longer bear to be with him and wanted to start a 
new life.  His reaction had been purely selfish, self-pitying and extremely violent.  On 
more than one occasion he had said that no other man would be her partner, or would 
act as the father to his daughter.  If the family life was coming to an end, they would 
pay for leaving him with their lives.  The judge was satisfied that DO had decided that 
the last hours of their lives would be terrifying and in the case of Christine Chambers, 
 
agonisingly painful.  The deaths were planned in elaborate detail.  He had collected a 
set  of  implements  for  the  sole  purpose  of  torturing  Christine  Chambers  and  then 
 
killing her and their daughter.  He had entered the house and then remorsely executed

his plan, and while inflicting cruel and substantial injuries on her, he made her beg 
and express her love for him.  At the same time he had been in clear control and knew 
precisely what he was doing as he did it. 

 
42.	 

 
43.	 

 
44.	 

The  judge  emphasised  two  further  aspects  of  the  case.    First,  it  was  apparent  that 
Christine Chambers died in agony.  The head injuries and the shotgun wounds would 
have  been  excruciatingly  painful.  In  his  judgment  the  delay  in  delivering  the  fatal 
 
gunshot was an act of deliberate sadism.  Her daughter was fully aware of part of her 
mother’s  ordeal,  and  their  daughter  was  awake  throughout  the  ordeal  and  had 
witnessed at least some of these dreadful events and been perfectly well aware of her 
mother’s  pain  and  tears.  The  child,  too,  must  have  been  terrified  and  was  heard 
crying at least five minutes after her mother had been shot. Then DO killed her.  Two 
people had been killed in truly shocking circumstances. 

There was not a shred of mitigation.  The seriousness of the case was exceptionally 
 
high.  Given that the deaths were planned well in advance and executed, in the case of 
the mother with a significant degree of sadism, the judge concluded that a whole life 
term was appropriate. 

The appeal is directed at the minimum whole life order.  It is not suggested that the 
sentence  was  “grossly”  disproportionate  to  the  crime,  but  it  is  said  that  it  was 
 
disproportionate. 
It  was  artificial  for  the  murder  of  his  former  partner  and  his 
daughter  to  be  taken  as  if  they  were  separate  events,  both  of  which  involved  a 
substantial degree of premeditation and planning.  His objective was to kill his family 
and then himself.  This situation is not unique.  He had temporarily lost any sense of 
rational and decent behaviour or hope.  Reflecting on paragraphs 4 and 5 of Schedule 
21 to the 2003 Act, which referred to the murder of two or more persons, and the use 
of  sexual  or  sadistic  conduct,  this  case  was  a  borderline  case,  and  not  one  which 
certainly  fell  within  the  exceptionally  serious  category.    Therefore  the  appropriate 
minimum term should have been based on a 30 year starting point.   

 

45.	  We have reflected on these submissions.  It seems to us clear that DO did not simply 
explode into violence as a result of the stresses and strains of the breakdown of his 
 
relationship.  Rather, he decided to revenge himself on Christine Chambers.  He did 
not merely plan to kill her and their daughter, but he planned and then carried out his 
deliberate intention to make the death of his former partner the most terrifying and 
agonising ordeal that he could envisage, and this was exactly what he did.  He was 
 
utterly  merciless,  and  took  pleasure  at  her  prolonged  suffering.    Thereafter,  quite 
deliberately,  and  in  cold  blood,  he  deliberately  executed  their  daughter,  as  she  was 
screaming with fear at witnessing what he had been doing to her mother. Although 
two  people  were  killed,  one  after  the  other  in  the  same  place,  this  was  not  to  be 
regarded  as  a  double  murder  which  arose  from  a  single  incident:  it  was  a  pre-
meditated  double  murder,  with  two  intended  victims,  when  there  was  ample 
opportunity  after  the  murder  of  the  first,  for  this  appellant  to  allow  a  moment  of 
compassion for his child to divert him from his plan.

Kieran Mark Stapleton

Stapleton (KS) was born in January 1991. On 26th July 2012 at the Crown Court at 
Manchester before King J and a jury he was convicted of murder.  He was sentenced 
to life imprisonment and the minimum term was specified at 30 years. 

The facts are simple, but stark.  A young man, aged 23, a post-graduate at Lancaster 
University,  decided  with  his  friends  to  spend  the  Christmas  period  in  Manchester. 
 
The students set off from their hotel on foot in the early hours of 26th December 2011 
to travel to the City Centre to queue up for the Boxing Day sales. The victim of the 
murder was Anuj Bidve, who happened at the fatal moment to be at the back of this 
 
group.  While walking in Salford they saw KS, together with a friend, walking on the 
other side of the road.  KS crossed the road and approached the group, and asked them 
what the time was.  One of them responded that it was 1.30.   

 

49.	  Without any warning, KS produced a silver gun and shot Mr Bidve from very close 
range in the head.  Before he produced the gun there had been no threats or abuse, 
indeed  nothing  which  might  trigger  off  even  the  most  minor  altercation.    He  then 
laughed  or  smiled  before  running  off  with  his  friend.    Mr  Bidve  was  rushed  to 
hospital, but was pronounced dead.  The cause of death was extensive brain injury. 

 
50.	 

 
51.	 

Earlier in the evening KS had threatened to kill someone who had insulted his former 
girlfriend, and he had been complaining that he had had a terrible year, during which 
he had lost his relationship, his house and his driving licence. 

After  the  killing  KS  went  to  stay  in  Wigan,  but  he  returned  to  Salford  on  27th 
December, booking in to a hotel which was a short distance from the crime scene.  On 
 
the  following  day,  he  arranged  for  a  teardrop  to  be  tattooed  onto  his  cheek  which, 
among other things, can signify and in this case was undoubtedly intended to signify 
that the person with such a tattoo has killed someone, and his pride in doing so.  He 
 
was  arrested  on  29th  December.    When  he  did  speak,  he  was  flippant.    When  he 
appeared  at  court,  and  was  asked  his  name,  he  gave  it  as  “Psycho  Stapleton”,  and 
 
when he saw a friend in the public gallery he shouted out that “Ryan (that is the friend 
who was walking with him at the time of the killing) had made a statement.” 

 
52.	 

A  psychological  report  from  Dr  Sonya  Krljes  dated  17th  May  2012  was  served  on 
KS’ behalf.  It was said that he was suffering from an anti-social personality disorder, 
characterised by anti-social and psychopathic traits, likely to have a neuro-biological 
underpinning, which would affect his ability to empathise with others. 

 
53. 

A  psychiatric  report  from  Dr  Nigel  Eastman  dated  2  June  2012  supported  the 
conclusion that KS exhibited a severe personality disorder, satisfying the criteria for
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

ASPD, and within that, psychopathy.  He could not normally experience empathy, and 
would be likely to be abnormally sensitive to the behaviour of others.  Dr Eastman 
believed that KS was fit to plead.  In relation to diminished responsibility the question 
for decision was whether on the instant occasion, KS’ capacities had been so affected 
by  his  personality  disorder  that  his  ability to  exercise  self-control  was  substantially 
impaired.  In the context of the present case, if the group of students had ignored him 
as they walked down the road in opposite directions, his severe personality disorder 
may have read this as provocative. 

Dr John McKenna provided a psychological report dated 12th June 2012.  He agreed 
with  Dr  Krljes  that  KS  showed  no  emotional  response  and  had  poor  reflective 
capacity.  However as to events at the time of the killing, KS’s own account was that 
his disposition and circumstances were unremarkable, and he specifically denied that 
 
he  was  in  a  negative  frame  of  mind  or  that  he  had  been  provoked.    Dr  McKenna 
agreed that KS had a severe personality disorder, but his condition did not meet the 
criteria for psychopathic disorder.  There were good clinical grounds to suggest that 
KS was capable of behaving impulsively and with reduced self-control, but he had in 
 
the past demonstrated both impulsive “defensive” aggression (a reference to a road 
 
rage  incident)  and  “appetite  aggression”  (a  reference  to  an  assault  on  a  fellow 
prisoner)  which  involved  a  degree  of  planning.    This  second  incident  represented 
controlled aggression or “considered purposeful violence”.  As to the possibility that 
he may have experienced “slow burn” provocation he had himself denied the account 
given by his companion about his earlier state of mind. He maintained that he had felt 
 
quite normal, and his own account of his mental state at the relevant time was sparse, 
and  did  not  include  any  awareness  of  feeling  irritated  or  provoked.    He  was  fit  to 
plead. 

The final psychological report, from Dr Adrian West, was dated 18th June 2012.  He 
 
agreed  with  Dr  McKenna  that  KS  had  an  anti-social  personality  disorder,  with 
psychopathic traits, falling short of psychopathy.  He also agreed with the analysis of 
the road rage incident as “defensive aggression” and the prison attack as “predatory 
 
aggression”.  The present incident was another such incident.  The facts indicated that 
KS  may  have  had  a  generalised  and  pre-meditated  murderous  intent.    Dr  West 
disagreed  with  both  Dr  Eastman  and  Dr  Krljes.    The  psychopathic  traits  had  not 
impaired KS’ ability to understand that he was in possession of the gun and had lethal 
means  to  kill  someone.  The  attack  was  carried  out  purposefully,  with  considerable 
cognitive  motor  effort  and  accuracy.  KS  himself  denied  any  earlier  upset  or 
 
humiliation, and he had carried out the shooting in full conscious awareness and with 
 
self-control. 
 

Passing sentence at the end of the trial King J considered the evidence of KS’ anti-
social personality, but concluded that the disorder did not lower his culpability for this 
 
offence.  The  judge  acknowledged  the  evidence  of  his  disturbed  background  and 
disjointed education, and the fact that he lacked full maturity, given that he was 20 
years  old  when  the  offence  was  committed.    As  against  this  mitigation  there  was 
significant pre-meditation, although this was not personally directed at the victim, the 
killing  had  taken  place  on  a  public  highway,  and  KS  was  already  on  bail  awaiting 
sentence following a road rage incident the previous year.

The  judge  described  the  killing  as  a  “cold-blooded  murder”  committed  in  the  most 
harrowing circumstances.  He was satisfied that notwithstanding KS’ evidence at trial, 
he knew perfectly well that the gun was loaded, and he had left a party intending to 
find a victim to satisfy his desire to shoot and kill someone.  Although the choice of 
victim was entirely random, there was a significant degree of pre-meditation and he 
was sure that KS’ intention was to kill and that at all material times he was fully in 
control of his actions.  This was cold-blooded controlled aggression.  He had shown 
not the slightest remorse.  He had laughed and smirked as he ran off after the killing, 
and  indeed  during  the  trial.  The  tattoo  and  what  he  said  at  the  Magistrates  Court 
amounted to boasting of the murder. 

The  submission  in  support  of  the  contention  that  the  minimum  term  was  excessive 
involves  criticism  of  the  judge  for  taking  into  account  two  features  of  aggravation, 
first that the killing occurred in a public place, and second that the killing involved an 
element of planning beyond that involved in the premeditation involved in carrying a 
loaded  firearm.    It  is  also  suggested  that  the  judge  failed  to  attach  sufficient 
importance  to  the  mitigation  provided  by  the  defendant’s  relative  youth  and  the 
medical condition, which was examined in close detail during the trial.   

It is clear from his sentencing remarks that the judge was acutely aware of KS’ age 
 
and his personality disorder, and he was also aware that he had only recently been 
bailed in connection with another offence.  It takes very little imagination to reflect on 
 
the  impact  that  this  offence  would  have  had  in  the  locality;  a  young  man,  utterly 
blameless, simply gunned down as he walked down the street, and perhaps the most 
 
chilling feature of all was the sheer randomness with which he was chosen to be the 
 
victim.  KS had decided that he was going to kill someone, and he organised a loaded 
firearm, carried it, and executed his plan.  His attitude to the offence is chilling.  He 
 
has revelled in it.  That adds significantly to the seriousness of this crime.

(DR) was born on 3 April 1972.  On 29 June 2011 in the Crown Court at Winchester 
before Burnett J and a jury he was convicted of murder.  On the following day he was 
sentenced to life imprisonment, with a whole life specified minimum term. 

On  24  July  2012  the  full  court  refused  his  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against 
conviction (2012 EWCA Crim 1848). 

In considering his appeal against sentence, we do not proposed to reiterate the reasons 
for refusing his application for leave to appeal against conviction.

The murder of Heather Barnett took place on 12 November 2002.  Heather Barnett 
was  a  48  year  old,  single  mother,  living  with  her  children  at  an  address  in 
Bournemouth.  At 8.30 a.m. on 12 November she drove the children to school.  She 
returned  to  her  home  and  parked  her  car  at  about  8.40  a.m.    When  the  children 
returned from school at 4.04 pm, her son, aged 14 years, discovered his mother’s body 
in their bathroom.   

There were no signs of forced entry into the victim’s home.  The attack took place in 
the workroom, adjacent to the patio door, sometime between 8.30 a.m. and 10.56 a.m. 
 

Heather Barnett died as a result of multi-impact to her head with an implement such 
as a hammer.  There were at least 10 lacerating blows, causing skull fractures.  There 
were also defensive wounds to the left hand. 

After the fatal attack further injuries were inflicted on her.  Her throat was cut from 
ear to ear, cut down her spine and both her breasts were cut off.  The zip of her jeans 
was unfastened and her underwear and part of her pubic hair exposed.  A hank of cut 
hair  was  found  in  the  palm  of  her  right  hand  which  lay  over  her  stomach  near  her 
 
groin.  This hair came from someone else, but the victim’s own head hair was cut and 
some was placed in her left hand, and some left on the floor.

had killed their mother. 

Police  enquiries  revealed  that  DR  admitted  that  he  had  visited  his  victim  on  the 
morning of 6th November, in order to make an inquiry about whether she would make 
some bedroom curtains for him as a surprise Christmas present.  Following that visit 
 
she indicated to friends that she believed that he had taken her key.  As there was no 
forced entry into her home that was plainly right.  When he entered he must have been 
armed with both a hammer and a knife.  The weapons which caused the fatal injury 
and the post mortem injuries were not found, and he must have removed them. 

There was a good deal of further evidence to suggest that DR had a sexual obsession 
with the hair of females, and from time to time he followed women who were on their 
 
own.  However  the  more  significant  feature  of  the  present  case  arose  from  events 
which took place much earlier in September 1993 in Potenza in Italy.  A young 16 
year old woman disappeared in September 1993.  She was murdered, and her body 
was left in the loft of the church of the Most Holy Trinity.  It was not discovered until 
 
March  2010.  Examination  revealed  that  her  bra  was  broken  in  the  same  way  as 
 
Heather Barnett’s bra.  Her trousers were damaged and disarranged in the same way. 
 
Her  hair  was  cut  shortly  after  she  had  died  and  the  body  placed  in  the  loft,  and 
remnants of her hair were left with the body.  As in the present case, the last person 
known to have seen the victim alive was DR, and his victim was acquainted with him 
just  as  Heather  Barnett  was  acquainted  with  him.    The  circumstances  of  these  two

offences which took place in two different countries, and were separated by nearly a 
decade, were strikingly similar.

The  evidence  relating  to  Elisa  Clap’s  death  was  admitted  before  the  jury  at 
Winchester Crown Court as part of the evidence to prove that DR was guilty of the 
murder of Heather Barnett.  At that date, he had not been convicted in Italy of the 
murder of Elisa Clap: he had been convicted simply of lying to an inquiry in Italy 
about the circumstances of her disappearance and how he had received a cut to his 
 
hand  at  about  that  time.    Subsequent  to  the  conviction  and  sentence  at  Winchester 
Crown Court, DR was convicted in his absence of the murder of Elisa Clap in Italy. 
That, however, as we understand it, does not constitute a final conviction, in the same 
 
way as the conviction by a jury in this jurisdiction would be. 

 

The psychiatric report from Dr Joseph dated 6 January 2011 recorded an account by 
DR of a happy early childhood, but of bullying by other children in the sense of being 
neglected  by  his  parents  when  they  moved  to  Potenza.    He  referred  to  an  occasion 
when he responded aggressively to bullying when he was 13 years old.  He admitted 
to voyeurism and that from the age of 15 he like to touch and smell women’s hair, and 
started to cut hair secretly.  However he claimed he was able to stop this when he 
realised it was becoming a problem.  He came to England after chatting to his future 
wife on the internet, and they married in 2004.  He loved her. 

 

The  report  observed  that  if,  contrary  to  Restivo’s  assertion,  he  had  indeed  killed 
Heather Barnett, he chose to kill a mother in circumstances which would leave her 
children to fend for themselves and he may have seen parallels between his life as a 
teenager and directed his anger at his mother onto Heather Barnett.  The hair cutting 
was sexually driven and sadistic, and the murder itself was a sexually sadistic act.  He 
was fit to stand trial, but he suffered from a severely disordered personality amounting 
to  an  abnormality  of  mind.    There  might  therefore  be  a  defence  to  murder  on  the 
grounds of diminished responsibility. 

 

DR  elected  not  to  advance  any  such  defence.    At  trial  he  denied  responsibility  for 
Heather  Barnett’s  death.    The  Crown  called  overwhelming  evidence  of  guilt.  The 
application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  conviction  was  based  on  criticism  of  the 
 
decision to admit as similar fact the evidence relating to the death of Elisa Clap.  This 
 
was refused for reasons given in the judgment [2012] EWCA Crim. 1848. 

In his sentencing remarks the judge observed that the evidence relating to the murder 
of  Elisa  Clap  proved  “without  doubt”  that  DR  was  responsible  for  her  murder. 
 
However  he  continued  “you  have  not  been  convicted  of  that  murder  and  I  do  not 
 
sentence you in respect of it.  But it is important background, because I approach this 
sentence  on  the  basis  that  you  had  killed  before.    It  would  be  quite  unrealistic  to 
pretend that you had not”. 

 
76. 

The judge carefully addressed the specific features of the murder of Heather Barnett. 
 
He recorded that it was carefully planned, and that a false alibi had been prepared.
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

The  appellant  appreciated  the  family  arrangements,  and  nevertheless  persisted  with 
the plan to kill Heather Barnett, knowing “that an 11 year old girl and a 14 year old 
boy  would  find  their  mother  butchered  on  the  bathroom  floor”.    The  judge  was 
satisfied that whatever the reason for the selection of Heather Barnett as a victim, the 
evidence  showed  that  DR  was  a  cold,  depraved,  calculated  killer  “who  murdered 
Heather to satisfy a sadistic sexual appetite”.  The mutilation of the body of the victim 
was “shocking”.  Taking all these features into account, together with “the previous 
killing of Elisa Clap”, he was driven to the conclusion that a starting point of 30 years 
imprisonment as the minimum term would not be appropriate.  The order would be a 
whole life order. 

 
77.	 

Focussing on the whole life order made in the particular circumstances of this crime, 
rather  than  on  the  submission  that  a  whole  life  term  was  always  inappropriate 
whatever  the  circumstances,  (a  submission  with  which  we  have  dealt  with  in 
paragraphs 4-30), Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC on DR’s behalf advanced a number of 
 
different grounds of appeal.  The most important criticism was directed at the judge’s 
consideration  of  the  murder  of  Elisa  Clap  as  a  feature  of  the  sentencing  decision. 
Furthermore, he failed to take fully into account that this murder was committed in 
2002, before the new provisions of Schedule 21 of the 2003 Criminal Justice Act had 
come into effect.  In accordance with the practice followed at that time a “whole life” 
 
tariff  would  not  have  been  ordered  by  the  Secretary  of  State.    Accordingly  Mr 
Fitzgerald  submitted  that  the  whole  life  order  retrospectively  increased  the  penalty, 
because even if such an order had been made by the Secretary of State, it would have 
been  subject  to  a  duty  of  regular  review,  and  the  sentence  was  therefore  wholly 
disproportionate  and  wrong  in  principle.  The  case  did  not  fall  within  any  of  the 
 
provisions of paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 21 which would normally justify a whole 
life  order.  Even  if  these  provisions  did  not  include  an  exclusive  list  of  categories, 
there was nothing further in the aggravating features of the case to require it, and in 
any  event  insufficient  attention  was  paid  to  the  evidence  relating  to  DR’s 
 
psychological disorder. 

 

 

78.	  When the judge summed the case up to the jury, he directed them, quite correctly, that 
the only court with jurisdiction to try DR for the murder of Elisa Clap and to convict 
him of the offence was an Italian court.  It is also clear that there was a vast body of 
evidence which provided strong evidence that he was indeed guilty of that murder. 
 
(See pp 65-97 of the summing up).  However, as the case was left to the jury, it was 
clearly open to them to convict DR of the murder of Heather Barnett even if they were 
not sure that he had murdered Elisa Clap.  In short, therefore, DR was not tried for or 
convicted of the murder of Elisa Clap (a murder which he denied), and the verdict did 
not and could not carry with it the inevitable conclusion that the jury must have been 
sure that he had murdered her.  At the same time, the trial judge, presiding over this 
sensitive  trial,  plainly  did  reach  the  sure  conclusion  that  he  was  indeed  guilty,  and 
therefore was not prepared to ignore it as a feature bearing on the sentencing decision. 
 
However, if he was entitled to have regard to it, then the first question which arises is 
whether  the  case  fell  within  the  starting  point  in  paragraph  4(2)(d),  that  when 
convicted  and  sentenced  for  the  murder  of  Heather  Barnett  the  offender  had 
“previously” been “convicted” of murder.  Plainly he had not.  That leaves open the 
question  whether  a  whole  life  order  was  nevertheless  the  appropriate  discretionary 
 
term.  This  is  linked  to  the  question  whether  in  assessing  the  appropriate  minimum
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

term, the judge was entitled to take into account his own assessment, made during the 
trial that the appellant had committed another earlier murder with which he was not 
charged and of which he had not been convicted. This raises an issue of sentencing 
principle. 

 
79.	 

 

Dealing with it generally, it is axiomatic that, provided the verdict returned by the jury 
or the plea accepted by the Crown has been loyally respected, the sentencing judge is 
 
not merely entitled, but required to reflect on and balance all the relevant aggravating 
and mitigating features of the offence or offences of which the defendant has been 
convicted.  This  includes  any  features  of  aggravation  or  mitigation  which  have 
emerged  during  the  course  of  the  trial,  including  the  judge’s  assessment  of  the 
 
personality, character, maturity and attitude of the defendant to the offence.  This will 
often  include  making  findings  of  fact  on  disputed  points.    Such  findings  may  well 
 
include, for example, that in the course of the offence of which he has been convicted, 
the  defendant  committed  other  offences;  the  indictment  is  not  required  to  be 
overloaded  with  charges.  Where  for  example  the  conviction  is  for  an  offence  of 
conspiracy, the judge may need to make findings for the purpose of sentence about 
which of the overt acts the defendant has been shown to have committed.  There will 
be  other  situations  in  which  it  is  conceded  that  sentence  should  be  passed  which 
reflects  offences  beyond  those  charged;  the  indictment  may  contain  charges  which 
have been treated by consent as samples of a course of conduct, or the defendant may 
ask the court to take into consideration other specific offences.  However, it is equally 
axiomatic that, situations such as these apart, a defendant cannot simply be sentenced 
for offences of which he has not been convicted, or on the basis that he has in fact 
committed them.  The ability of the judge to make findings that other offences have 
been committed does not extend to reaching a non-jury verdict about allegations put 
before the jury by way of similar fact evidence, at least unless the jury must have been 
satisfied that they were proved, or unless the defendant has been convicted of them in 
 
the past. 

 
80.	 

The  principle  is  starkly  expressed  by  Lord  Steyn  in  R  v  Home  Secretary,  ex  parte 
Hindley [2001] 1 AC 410: 

“…  in  deciding  on  her  tariff  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not 
entitled to increase it as retribution and deterrence for murders 
 
of which Hindley had not been convicted.” 

However the Secretary of State was entitled to take into account the fact that, on the 
 
basis of her post trial confession,  Hindley in effect invited additional criminality of 
which she had not been convicted at trial to be taken into account. 

This observation was not newly minted for the purpose of that particularly notorious 
case.  Much earlier in Anderson v DPP [1978] AC 964, the court was concerned with 
the making of a criminal bankruptcy order in which the jurisdiction to make the order 
 
depended on the loss resulting from the offences exceeding £15,000.  As it happened 
the defendant was convicted of thirteen counts, for which the total loss was less than 
 
£15,000,  but  evidence  was  called  at  trial  to  establish  system  based  on  twenty 

 
81.
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
occasions  in  all,  for  which  the  total  loss  exceeded  £15,000.    The  House  of  Lords 
quashed  the  criminal  bankruptcy  order  made  at  trial  and  upheld  in  the  Court  of 
Appeal.  The decision was wrong.  This was because the defendant had not admitted 
any offence in relation to the twenty similar instances given in evidence which were 
not subject of any count in the indictment.  Therefore the judge “clearly had no right 
 
to take them into consideration in determining the sentence”. 

 
82.	 

This reasoning was followed in R v Clark [1996] 2 Cr. App. R 282.  After a close 
 
examination  of  a  substantial  number  of  inconsistent  earlier  authorities,  the  court 
observed: 

“It  seems  to  us  that  it  is  one  thing  to  permit  the  judge  to 
sentence  on  his  view  of  the  gravity  of  the  ingredients  of  the 
 
offence of which the jury have convicted (even if some of those 
ingredients  were  capable  of  being  free-standing  criminal 
offences), and quite a different thing to allow him to sentence 
on  the  basis  that  unproved,  separate  and  distinct  offences 
“aggravate” the offence of which he is convicted”. 

 
83.	 

Shortly  afterwards,  in  R  v  Bradshaw  [1997]  2  Cr.  App.  R(S)  128,  once  again  this 
court appeared to cast doubt on the decision in Clark.  The difficulties were finally 
resolved in, R v Kidd, Canavan and Shaw [1998] 1 WLR 604 where, sitting with Rose 
LJ, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division and Jowitt J, a judge 
with  unrivalled  experience  of  the  criminal  justice  system,  and  reflecting  what  were 
described as basic principles, Lord Bingham CJ  observed that it was 

“not easy to see how a defendant can lawfully be punished for 
offences for which he has not been indicted and which he has 
denied  or  declined  to  admit  …  we  think  it  inconsistent  with 
principle  that  a  defendant  should  be  sentenced  for  offences 
neither admitted or proved by a verdict”. 

After  examining  the  authorities  the  court  upheld  the  decision  in  R  v  Clark  and 
 
indicated that to the extent that it was at variance with other authority, it was “to be 
 
preferred”.  This is an end of the controversy. 

In the present case DR could not be charged in this jurisdiction with the murder of 
Elisa Clap.  It was justiceable in Italy, not here. If the murder had been committed in 
England, it would almost certainly have formed a second count on the indictment.  If 
DR had been convicted of the Elisa Clap offence before his trial for the murder of 
Heather  Barnett,  or  indeed  during  a  joint  trial  of  both  murders,  this  would  have 
 
provided an essential feature for the assessment of the minimum term for that murder. 
The judge properly and expressly rejected the notion that he should pass sentence for 
 
the murder of Elisa Clap.  Nevertheless, he undoubtedly took into account his belief 
that the appellant was guilty of that offence in deciding that a whole life term was 
appropriate.  In other words, although the appellant denied this distinct and separate 
 
offence, was not on trial for it and not convicted of it, the judge’s view that he was in 

 
84.
--------

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
fact guilty, was treated as a significant piece of aggravation. The principle is clear. 
Even  when  evidence  which  serves  to  establish  the  defendant’s  guilt  of  an  offence 
charged  on  the  indictment  is  deployed  as  similar  fact  evidence,  the  sentencing 
decision cannot proceed on the basis that he is guilty of a distinct and separate offence 
of which he has not been convicted and which he denies.  Although we sympathise 
with the judge’s approach, it was inconsistent with what is now an axiomatic principle 
that,  subject  to  considerations  like  those  identified  in  para  79  the  ambit  of  the 
sentencing decision cannot extend to reflect a specific, distinct offence of which the 
offender has not been convicted. 

 

85.	  We  have  reflected  whether  it  is  now  open  on  this  appeal  against  sentence,  to  take 
 
account of the appellant’s conviction, subsequent to the present sentence in Italy. That 
would be problematic.  Quite apart from the question whether in accordance with the 
law of Italy, the recent conviction, reached in the absence of the appellant, is to be 
 
regarded  as  a  final  conviction,  when  the  sentence  imposed  in  the  Crown  Court  is 
based  on  a  misapplication  of  principle,  it  should  be  corrected.    We  must  take  the 
principled approach and proceed on the basis that it may at some future unspecified 
 
date be for the judicial authorities in Italy to decide what the appropriate sentence on 
the appellant should be for the murder of Elisa Clap. In reality that is most unlikely to 
happen. As we have already indicated, we think it highly improbable that it will ever 
 
be safe for DR to be released from custody.  Moreover although a whole life term 
must be quashed, the minimum term, to which we now turn, must be very substantial 
indeed. 

 

 
86.	 

The  appellant  fell  to  be  sentenced  in  accordance  with  the  transitional  provisions  in 
Schedule  22  of  the  2003  Act,  as  illuminated  for  guidance  purposes  by  the  relevant 
 
Practice Direction.  Where the offence was committed after 31st May 2002 and before 
 
18th December 2003, where the offender’s culpability is exceptionally high, a starting 
point  of  15/16  years  would  be  appropriate,  but  to  allow  for  significant  aggravating 
features of the case, a minimum term of 30 years might be appropriate, and indeed in 
cases of most exceptional gravity, a whole life term could be imposed.  Omitting from 
consideration the appellant’s involvement in the murder of Elisa Clap and reflecting 
 
on the horrific circumstances of the murder of Heather Barnett,  there are a number of 
 
aspects  of  the  killing  which  are  profoundly  disturbing.    We  note  in  particular  the 
extensive  preparation  for  the  killing  (which  included  careful  measures  to  avoid 
detection) and the display of sexual perversions and sadism, not least the appalling 
mutilation of the body, when the appellant knew perfectly well that it would be found 
by  the  victim’s  children.    Thereafter,  he  was  capable  of  brutal  hypocrisy  in  his 
purported expressions of concern and assistance offered to them.  A combination of 
all these factors leads us to the conclusion that the minimum term should be fixed at 
40 years.  This will replace the whole life term.

6 years imprisonment, and robbery again, in May 2005 when he was sentenced to life 
imprisonment.

The offences of which he was convicted on 20th December 2011 in the Crown Court 
at  Southwark  before  His  Honour  Judge  Robbins  and  a  jury  pre-date  the  robbery 
convictions.  He now appeals against the sentence imposed on 12 January 2012.  They 
were: 

Burglary, rape and causing grievous bodily harm in December 
1988 to EM, life imprisonment for rape, 15 years imprisonment 
for causing GBH, and 10 years imprisonment for burglary; 

Rape, indecent assault and burglary in September 1989, where 
the victim was GM.  Life imprisonment for rape, and 10 years 
imprisonment for indecent assault and burglary; 

indecent 

assault 

Rape,  buggery, 
life 
 
imprisonment for rape and buggery, and 10 years imprisonment 
for burglary and indecent assault.  These offences took place in 
October 1989 and the victim was AM; 

and  burglary, 

Causing  grievous  bodily  harm  and  burglary,  15  years 
imprisonment and 10 years imprisonment (respectively).  The 
victim was .  . . 

All  offences  were  ordered  to  run  concurrently.    So  far  as  the  sentences  of  life 
imprisonment were concerned, a whole life order was imposed as the minimum term. 

The  victims  in  all  these  offences  were  women,  no  longer  young,  living  alone,  who 
were attacked in their homes.   

The victims in Counts 1-3 was a 57 year old virgin, already suffering from a degree of 
disability,  who  returned  home  on  Boxing  Day  after  spending  Christmas  with  her 
family.  She recalled finding a man in her house who had struck her repeatedly.  She 
sustained multiple injuries to her face, which included a broken jaw, haematomas on 
both eyes, and a fractured eye socket.  There was a deep 10cm cut above her right 
eyebrow.  Her torso, notably around her left breast and shoulders were bruised.  There 
were  defensive  injuries  on  both  hands.  Her  thighs  were  bruised,  with  dried  blood 
smeared over the entire surface of the thighs and lower legs, particularly to the front, 
and marks around this area consistent with bruising caused by finger pressure.  There 
was a 1.5cm laceration found in the vagina running down towards the perineum, with 
further bruising and lacerations in this area, and on further examination, bleeding was 
noted from higher up the vagina vault.  Due to the distress caused by this part of the 
examination, it was halted, but these findings were consistent with sexual penetration. 
 
Obviously she had been subjected to a violent physical assault.  The majority of the 
 
blows to her head were caused by a clenched fist.  The injuries to her jaw and eye 
sockets were caused by separate impacts, possibly by punches or blows from a soft 
heeled shoe.  The injuries above her right ear were more consistent with kicks, but 
 

 
89.	 

 
90.

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 
could  also  have  been  caused  by  repeated  fist  blows.    The  other  injuries  were 
 
consistent with having been gripped and having her thighs forced apart during forcible 
sexual assault. 

The victim in counts 4-6 lived only a few yards away from the victim in counts 1-3. 
 
She was 77 years old, a frail elderly woman with advanced arthritis.  Some 10 days or 
so before the attack, MR had appeared in her sitting room, claiming that he had been 
chased out of a pub, but on that occasion the victim was able to call out to a neighbour 
and he ran away. 

On  11th  September  1989  MR  again  entered  her  sitting  room,  demanding  to  know 
where her money and jewellery were.  He told her not to look at him or her face and 
 
then ordered her to take off her clothes, threatening her with his fists if she did not. 
He made her lie on the bed.  He tried to penetrate her vaginally, and then anally.  She 
told him she was single and had never had sex, and she did not want it now.  Her 
 
pleas were ignored.  He inserted his finger into her vagina and put his penis in her 
mouth.  He then tried to make her kneel on the floor but she told him because of her 
 
arthritis she could not do so, so he ordered her back to the bed.  He made her remove 
 
her dentures and suck his penis before putting his finger into her anus.  He then left 
 
her, taking £5 from her handbag in the kitchen. 

On examination the victim had bruising on her arm, her vagina was exquisitely tender 
and  bright  red.  These  findings  were  consistent  with  recent  digital  penetration  and 
attempted penile penetration. 

 

The victim in count 7-10 was attacked approximately one month later, on 7 October 
 
1989.  Her flat was just over 300 yards from MR’s then new address.  Shortly after 
her nephew had left the premises, MR entered, grabbing her from behind and putting 
his hand over her nose and mouth.  He pushed her into the sitting room, and ordered 
her not to speak and told her he could be violent.  She said that her son would be 
coming back at any moment, and he told her that she was lying.  He told her that he 
wanted money, and ordered her to take off her clothes.  When she refused he started 
to pull her dressing gown off, and, because she was not strong enough to resist, and 
terrified, she took off her remaining clothes.  The appellant touched her breasts, and 
then  licked  and  sucked  them.    He  made  her  go  through  to  her  bedroom  where  he 
committed various sexual offences, including attempts to penetrate her vaginally and 
anally with his penis, and then tried to make her suck his penis by pushing it in her 
mouth.  He placed his fingers and then his tongue in her vagina.  She was heaving, 
shaking  and  crying,  and  begged  him  to  leave.    She  persuaded  him  to  let  her  make 
some tea, in the hope that it would bring him to his senses.  But after a drink from a 
 
tap  he  again  returned  and  attempted  vaginal  and  anal  rape  and  then  forced  her  to 
masturbate him and tried to make her take his penis in her mouth.  This was followed 
by  vaginal  rape  and  ejaculation.  The  ordeal  lasted  for  3  hours,  and  after  MR  had 
sought to remove all trace of his presence in the flat, he cut the telephone wire.

The victim in counts 11-12 was an 84 year old woman, living alone in a ground floor 
flat, close to the address of the last victim.  She was severely assaulted by MR at the 
end of February or beginning of March 1990, when, due to a recent hip operation she 
 
had difficulty walking. 

She was found, on 2 March 1990 by her “home-help” with serious injuries to her fact, 
unable  to  speak  or  describe  anything  of  what  had  happened  to  her.    Medical 
 
examination revealed that her upper jaw was fractured in one place, and the lower jaw 
 
in two places.  The left side of her face was severely swollen, blackened and bruised. 
 
There was no evidence of sexual assault.  Her telephone wire had been cut. 

 

97.	  MR’s responsibility for these offences was established following what are known as 
“cold  case  reviews”.  He  was  produced  from  HMP  Wandsworth  where  he  was  a 
serving the sentence imposed in June 2005.  On his arrest he replied “you are having a 
joke, aren’t you?”   

Psychiatric reports, prepared in the context of his appearance following conviction for 
 
robbery in 2005, were made available to the sentencing judge.  The psychiatrists were, 
of course, unaware of the offences with which we are concerned.   

They recorded a history of drink and drug abuse, and an earlier diagnosis of excessive 
compulsive  disorder  and  depression.    On  the  basis  of  his  numerous  previous 
convictions, MR could properly  be regarded as having a personality disorder, or in 
legal  terms,  a  psychopathic  disorder.    His  then  recent  offending  and  behaviour 
suggested a deterioration in behaviour, possibly secondary to the abuse of alcohol and 
drugs.  Treatment for his mental state could be given in custody, and did not merit 
transfer to a psychiatric hospital for assessment or treatment.  It was clearly indicated 
that  he  could  not  be  regarded  as  anything  other  than  “a  danger  to  the  public”  and 
treatment  for  his  condition,  even  after  “the  most  arduous  efforts”  were  not  assured 
because treatment for such conditions “is notoriously unsuccessful”. 

In  his  sentencing  remarks  Judge  Robbins  clearly  directed  himself  about  the 
appropriate criteria for discretionary life sentences, and came to the conclusion that on 
the facts here, such a sentence was right.  He then went on to examine the appropriate 
 
minimum  term.    MR  broke  into  the  homes  of  his  victims  and  subjected  them  to 
degrading sexual attacks, and the offences were aggravated by terrible violence, far 
 
over and above whatever pressure would have been needed to perpetrate the sexual 
offences.  As  a  result,  the  entire  community  in  South  London  had  been  terrified. 
 
There  were  multiple  aggravating  features.    These  were  most  vulnerable  elderly 
women  living  alone,  who  were  deliberately  targeted,  subjected  to  violent  sexual 
attack, and completely terrorised.  The victim impact statements showed how much 
 
their lives had been ruined.  Their last years were utterly blighted.  None would ever 
 
recover.  MR himself had shown no pity or remorse.  These offences, together with 
some of his earlier convictions, confirm that he was cruel and ruthless and a real and 
continuing danger especially to vulnerable people.  The judge concluded that a whole 
life term was appropriate.

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 

101.	  The essential argument advanced in this appeal is that although this was an extremely 
serious series of offences, in which the interests of public safety amply justified the 
imposition of a discretionary life sentence, the whole life order was inappropriate and 
 
wrong in principle.  In summary, among the cases where whole life orders had been 
imposed, none could be found in the context of sexual crime where one or more of the 
victims had not been murdered.  Without in any way seeking to trivialise the ordeals 
 
of the victims,  it was submitted that the whole life order should be reserved for cases 
where the criminal went even further than MR had gone on any of these occasions.   

 

102.	  Like the Crown, which accepted that notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences a 
whole life order was inappropriate, we agree that there is force in this submission.  It 
is regrettably possible to envisage, and there have been cases, where dreadful sexual 
assaults have been followed by murderous violence.  The whole life order is reserved 
 
for the most exceptional cases.  Without suggesting that the court is prohibited from 
making a whole life order unless the defendant is convicted of at least one murder, 
such an order will, inevitably be a very rare event indeed.   

 

103.	  The whole life order must be quashed.  In its place, to allow for MR’s criminality and 
his  previous  convictions,  we  shall  substitute  a  minimum  term  of  25  years,  the 
 
equivalent of a 50 year determinate sentence.  In doing so we are not to be taken as 
 
implying that MR is anything less than highly dangerous, and on the evidence before 
us at the moment it seems highly improbable that he will, after the expiry of 25 or 30 
or more years, or indeed ever be safe for release.   

 
David Martin Simmons 
 

 

104.	  David Simmons (DS) was born in March 1972.  On 17th February 2004 he pleaded 
guilty to rape and false imprisonment, and on 9th December 2004 before His Honour 
Judge  Foley  he  was  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment  on  each  count.    It  is  open  to 
 
question whether the judge positively ordered that he should be subject to a whole-life 
term.  What is certain is that he did not specify any lower or specific term.  Shortly 
after sentence, DS was transferred from prison to Broadmoor Hospital, and in 2010 he 
 
was transferred back to HMP Bristol.  There he was told, for the first time, that in the 
absence of any tariff sentence, he was regarded as a whole-life prisoner.  He requires 
an extension of time of over 7 years in which to seek leave to appeal against sentence. 
  
In  view  of  the  uncertainty  of  the  true  effect  of  the  judge’s  sentencing  remarks,  the 
 
confusion  is  understandable,  and  in  these  exceptional  circumstances  leave  was 
granted. 

 

105.	  The  facts  of  this  case  are  uncomplicated.    It  was  just  after  midnight  on  25  August 
 
2003 when the complainant accepted a lift from DS.  Shortly afterwards he produced 
a knife and held it to her throat.  He then drove to an industrial estate.  He tied her 
hands behind her back and blindfolded her.  The passenger seat was reclined.  She 
 
was  forced  to  lie  back.  Her  footwear,  jeans  and  knickers  were  removed.    The 
 
appellant penetrated her digitally, and then, using a condom, got on top of her and 
unsuccessfully  attempted  to  penetrate  her.    Frustrated  he  then  used  great  force  to

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

penetrate her vagina and ejaculated inside her.  He then removed her from the vehicle, 
washing her vagina and anus with wine, before putting her jeans back on, tying her to 
the passenger seat, and driving her, blindfolded, to another industrial estate.  There 
 
she was taken from the car.  Her jumper was placed over the back of her head.  Some 
 
of it was put in her mouth as a gag and it was secured with a rope.  He said he would 
“slit her throat”, saying that he would go and get a bigger knife, and he left.  He did 
not  return.    Eventually  the  complainant  was  able  to  make  contact  with  a  security 
officer and the police were contacted. 
 

 

106.	  DS was arrested and interviewed on a number of occasions.  He said that he had been 
with a prostitute and agreed a price for certain sex acts, adding that he had “lost the 
 
plot”.  Although he could not remember what had happened he did not accept that he 
 
had threatened the victim or done anything against her will. 

 

107.	  DS  had  a  number  of  previous  convictions,  including  two  in  2000  for  an  indecent 
assault  and  robbery.  The  2000  offences  had  many  similarities  to  the  present  case. 
 
The  victim  was  a  working  prostitute.  He  forced  her  to  perform  oral  sex  and 
masturbate him.  He threatened her with a knife held to her throat.  He inserted his 
fingers into her vagina.  The victim in the offence of robbery was a woman in the 
street whom he grabbed from behind.  He told her he had a knife and he would kill 
her if she did not shut up. 

 

108.	  DS refused to attend for interview for the purposes of a pre-sentence report.  In view 
 

 

of the high risk he posed to women, a life sentence was recommended.   

 
109.	 

In brief sentencing remarks the judge expressed himself satisfied that DS presented 
and posed “a significant risk to women”.  He imposed a discretionary sentence of life 
 
imprisonment.  He said that it was the wish of the court that he “could not be released 
until (he) ceased to be such a risk.”  DS was a person of “unstable character likely to 
commit similar offences,” and he was “a danger”.  He then said that the court was not 
required to specify a period “if it is of the opinion that no period should be specified”, 
and  he  expressed  himself  so  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  the  overall  seriousness  of  the 
offences,  the  antecedent  history,  and  the  reports  on  him.  The  sentencing  remarks 
culminated:  “Accordingly there will be a sentence of life imprisonment”.   

 

110.	  Given the appellant’s previous convictions, and the circumstances of this very serious 
sexual offence, unsurprisingly, it was not argued on his behalf that the discretionary 
 
life  sentence  was  inappropriate.  The  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  for  the 
indefinite future DS posed a substantial risk to public safety. 
   

 

111.	  The criticism is that the judge, concerned with the element of public protection, failed 
sufficiently  to  appreciate  that  the  assessment  of  the  minimum  term  represented  a 
separate  and  distinct  element  of  the  sentencing  decision,  designed  to  reflect  the 
appropriate  level  of  punishment.    The  Crown  agrees  that  the  whole  life  order  was 
inappropriate.

R - v - David Oakes and Others 
 

 

112.	  As it seems to us, profoundly disturbing as this offence certainly was, it was not an 
offence  of  the  extreme  level  of  seriousness  to  justify  a  whole  life  order.    It  was 
submitted  that  the  appropriate  minimum  term  would  be  between  10-12  years.    The 
appropriate minimum term, which will replace the whole life order, is 10 years, the 
equivalent of a 20 year determinate sentence.  As the offence took place before the 
introduction of s.240 of the 2003 Act, we have taken account of s.67 of the Criminal 
Justice Act 1967 in assessing the minimum term.  As with MR, in quashing the whole 
 
life order, we emphasise that we are not suggesting for one moment that DS will be 
safe to be released at the conclusion of the 10 year period.  We note that it has been 
necessary  for  him  to  spend  time  in  Broadmoor  Hospital,  and  we  suspect  that  his 
release is most unlikely.",2012-11-21 00:00:00,UK High Court

Adam Lewis, you have pleaded guilty to the murder of Hannah Windsor, and to two 
offences of assaulting her by penetration.  You have also pleaded guilty to offences of 
 
burglary,  and  arson  being  reckless  as  to  whether  life  was  endangered.  I  have  to 
 
 
sentence  you  for  those  offences.  I  also  have  to  explain  to  you  the  reasons  for  my 
 
 
 
sentence.  I will try to do that as simply as I can, so that you can understand it.  You 
have an intermediary sitting beside you to help you to understand. 
 
Before I say anything about what you did, I need to say something about you.  Your 
 
 
barrister, Mr Riordan QC, has helped me by making a number of important points on 
 
your behalf.  In addition I have read expert reports from two consultant psychiatrists, 
Dr Noir Thomas and Dr Simon Halstead, and from a consultant forensic psychologist 
 
Dr Ailis Murphy.  Because I have all that information about you, Mr Riordan did not 
 
ask me to order a pre-sentence report. 
 
As  Mr  Riordan  said,  you  are  a  very  troubled  young  man.  As  a  child  you  suffered 
 
 
parental  neglect  and  physical  abuse.  Your  development  was  delayed  by  learning 
 
 
difficulties.  You  have a very low IQ, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and a 
 
conduct disorder.  When you were about 9 you went to live with your grandparents, 
who clearly did all they could for you and who are to be commended both for that and 
 
for their very responsible behaviour when they learned that you had admitted killing 
 
 
Hannah Windsor. Your behaviour was impulsive, you set fires, you self-harmed and 
 
you  were disruptive at school.  You  were made the subject of a statement of  special 
educational  needs  and  transferred  at  the  age  of  11  to  the  special  school  where  you 
 
later  met  Hannah  Windsor. She  had  problems  of  her own.  You  have  been  a  heavy 
 
 
drinker of  alcohol  from  a  very  early  age,  and  have  also  abused  cannabis. It  is  clear 
from the reports that you have only a limited ability to think things through in order 
 
 
to control your actions.  In Dr Thomas’ opinion, you  have a mild learning difficulty 
and a personality disorder.  You do not care for the feelings of others.
--------
You have a number of previous convictions.  None of your previous offences seems to 
 
have  been  particularly  serious  in  itself,  but  you  have  twice  previously  burgled 
 
someone’s home. 
   
 
Next  I  am  going  to  summarise  what  you  did.  On  Saturday  12th  May  this  year  you 
 
 
burgled the home of the ex-boyfriend of your sister and stole various items.  You also 
 
lit  two  fires  in  the  house,  destroying  some  furniture  and  causing smoke  damage  to 
 
other items.  Then, to use your own words, you went on your toes and spent a number 
  
of nights camping out on Bidston Hill.  You took with you a Swiss Army type of knife. 
 
 
 
I accept  that  you  were  not  carrying that  knife  as  a  weapon, but you  later used it  to 
   
mutilate and stab Hannah Windsor. 
 
 
Hannah Windsor was only 17 years old at the time.  She had been your girlfriend off 
 
 
and on for some time.  You  told her what you had done.  On Monday 14th  May she 
   
made a statement about that to the police. 
 
She visited you at your campsite on Wednesday 16th  May.  She had been advised by 
 
the police not to do so, but she must have thought she would be safe with you.  She 
 
had with her a note she had been given by the police, telling her which number to ring 
 
if she needed to contact them again.  That note, torn into pieces, was later found near 
where you murdered Hannah, and I am sure you must have seen it. 
 
On the Thursday, 17th  May, you spoke to a man who was walking on Bidston Hill and 
 
asked him what you would get for murder.  It seems clear that by that time you had 
 
sexually assaulted and murdered Hannah Windsor, although her body was not found 
   
until the Saturday, 19th May. 
 
 
Only you  know exactly what you did to Hannah, and in what order you  did it.  It is 
 
however clear that you deliberately inflicted cruel injuries upon her which must have 
 
caused  her  immense  pain  and  suffering.  The  evidence  of  the  very  experienced 
 
pathologist, Dr Alison Armour, makes chilling reading.  You tied Hannah Windsor to 
 
 
a tree, using straps around her wrists.  You covered her mouth with sticky tape.  You 
 
forcefully  penetrated  her  vagina  and  her  anus,  causing  bruising  and  tearing,  either 
 
with  your penis or with  some object shaped like  a  penis.  You  bruised  and tore  her 
 
urethra, the part of the body from which she would urinate.  That is an unusual injury, 
 
which  you  probably  did  that  by  inserting  something  into  it  rather  than  as  part  of 
 
forcible penetration of the vagina.  You cut into the outer lips of her vagina, another 
 
unusual  injury  which  you  must  have  done  deliberately.  Most  if  not  all  of  those 
 
agonising injuries to her private parts must have been caused whilst she was alive. 
  
You  repeatedly dragged your knife across her body, leaving long cuts and scratches. 
 
Several  of  those  cuts  and  scratches  were  on  or  near  her  breasts.  You  stabbed  her 
 
body and her legs a number of times.  You stabbed her through the inside part of the 
  
left upper thigh: that injury damaged the femoral artery and caused internal bleeding. 
 
Again, many of those very painful wounds were caused whilst Hannah was alive.  You 
 
also  inflicted  a  quite  dreadful  wound  lower  down  her  left  thigh.  The  photographs 
 
show that you gouged deeply into the thigh  and then dragged the point of the knife 
 
down to her knee.  In addition, you strangled her using a length of nylon cord which 
   
was found nearby, and you may also have throttled her with your hands. 
 
In Dr Armour’s opinion, Hannah’s death was caused by multiple injuries: asphyxia by 
 
 
a  combination  of  the  surgical  tape  which  you  wrapped  around  her  mouth  and 
 
strangulation, together with blood loss from the wound in the upper inner thigh. Dr 
 
Armour is able to say that many of the injuries which I have summarised must have 
 
been caused whilst Hannah was alive.  Some, including the gouging of the left thigh, 
 
may have occurred around the time of death.

--------
Adam  Lewis,  that  was  a  prolonged,  merciless  and  terrible  attack,  which  must  have 
 
been agonisingly painful for Hannah Windsor before she died.  You have not given 
 
any explanation for why you did it.  You say she had hit you, but even if she had that 
 
does  not  begin  to  explain  why  you  made  her suffer as  you  did.  It  may  be  that  you 
 
learned that she had told the police where you  were, and you wanted to get back at 
 
her for that.  Clearly you had a sexual motive in cutting her breasts and her vagina, 
 
and in penetrating and injuring her private parts in the way I have mentioned.  But in 
 
addition, what you did to Hannah must have taken quite a long time, and you must 
 
have used  quite  a  lot  of  force.  You  must have  known  what  dreadful  pain  you  were 
 
causing her.  Her hands were tied and she cannot have been in any position to resist. 
  
You  did it in cold blood.  So I am sure that you  also acted out of deliberate cruelty, 
 
 
and that the prosecution are right when they describe this as a case of torture. 
I am 
      
also sure that you intended to kill Hannah, not just to cause her really serious injury. 
   
 
I have taken into account the points Mr Riordan has made about that, but the nature 
 
 
 
and  extent  of  your  violence  to  Hannah  Windsor  whilst  she  was  alive,  including  in 
 
particular  the  force  which  you  must  have  used  to  strangle  her,  make  me  sure  that 
 
when you caused the fatal injuries you must have intended to kill her. 
   
To make matters even worse, after you had murdered Hannah  you hid her body by 
 
 
moving it to a place in the bushes which was difficult to reach and by covering it with 
 
 
soil and branches. 
   
On  the  other  hand,  you  quickly  admitted  responsibility  for  the  killing.  You  also 
 
showed the police where you had buried the body. Those are important points in your 
 
favour.  If you had not helped the police in that way, it seems to me that it could well 
 
 
have been a considerable time before Hannah’s body was found. 
   
 
In every crime of murder, one life is taken but many other lives are damaged.  I have 
 
read and taken account of statements by both of Hannah’s parents.  They, and other 
 
members of Hannah’s family and friends, have suffered and will continue to suffer as 
 
a result of what you did. 
   
The sentence for murder is fixed by law.  I must impose a life sentence, which because 
 
of  your  age  is  a  sentence  of  custody  for  life. I  must  also  set  the  minimum  term:  in 
 
other words, the length of time which you must stay in prison before you can even be 
 
considered  for  release.  Before  I  decide  that  minimum  term,  it  is  important  to 
 
emphasise the two features of a  life sentence which  protect the public whatever the 
 
length of the minimum term.  The first is that you will not automatically be released 
 
once you have completed your minimum term: a decision will have to be made at that 
 
stage as to whether it is yet safe to allow your release.  The second is that even when 
 
you are released on licence, your life sentence will not then come to an end.  You will 
 
have to obey the conditions of your licence for the rest of his life.  If at any time you 
 
 
reoffend,  the  Secretary  of  State  has  the  power  to  recall  you  to  prison  to  continue 
 
 
serving your life sentence for as long as may be necessary. 
   
The law says that I have to set the minimum term which I consider appropriate taking 
 
into account amongst other things the seriousness of the offence of murder and the 
 
other offences which  you have admitted.  Your lawyers will understand that I have 
 
had  regard  to  the  law  set  out  in  Schedule  21  to  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003,  in 
 
 
particular paragraphs 5(2)(e), 10(g), 11(c) and 11(g).  Again, I will  try to  explain the 
 
 
most important points to you as simply as I can. 
   
 
You were born on 25th  February 1994, and so you were aged about 18 years 12 weeks 
 
 
when  you  committed  the  murder.  I  am  quite  sure  that  your  murder  of  Hannah

Windsor involved  both  a  sexual  and  a  sadistic  element.  The  law  says  that  in  those 
 
circumstances the starting point is a minimum term of 30 years.  However, if you had 
 
been under 18 when you committed the murder, the starting point would only have 
 
been 12 years.  So I have to take into account the fact that you were only just 18, and I 
   
have to take into account your mental difficulties because they make you less mature 
 
and less capable than other 18 year olds.  You are an adult in the eyes of the law, but 
 
you  clearly  have  your  limitations,  and  you  do  not  have  the  same  level  of 
 
understanding as most adults.  That combination of your young age and your mental 
 
limitations  makes  it  necessary  for  me  to  reduce  significantly  the  minimum  term 
 
which I would otherwise set in this extremely serious case.  However, it is important 
 
to  note  that  the  psychiatrists  do  not  say  that  your  mental  disorder  provides  an 
 
explanation for what you did, or substantially reduces your mental responsibility for 
 
the  murder.  They  do  not  say  that  it  was  your  mental  disorder  which  drove  you  to 
 
torture and murder Hannah Windsor.  It is also important to note that the murder of 
 
Hannah Windsor was not an impulsive act or an unthinking act.  You knew what you 
 
were doing, and you did it deliberately.  So there is a limit to how much your mental 
 
difficulties can reduce your sentence. 
 
There  is  one  other  important  point  in  your  favour  which  also  helps  to  reduce  the 
 
 
minimum  term.  You  pleaded  guilty  to  all  the  offences.  You  pleaded  guilty  to  the 
 
arson  at  an  early  stage,  and  you  are  entitled  to  full  credit  for  that  plea.  You  also 
 
pleaded  guilty  to  the  burglary  at  an  early  stage,  but  the  law  imposes  a  minimum 
 
sentence for that offence and restricts the extent to which I can reduce the sentence 
 
because of your guilty plea.  You pleaded guilty to the murder and the sexual offences 
 
on the day of trial, and you can only have limited credit for those late pleas.  But I will 
 
give you as much credit as I properly can, because it took courage to plead guilty, and 
 
the fact that you did so meant that Hannah’s family did not have to sit through a trial 
 
wondering what the outcome would be.  I can tell you that your guilty plea to murder 
 
has made it possible to reduce your minimum term by 2 years. 
 
 
For the  offence  of  murder,  the sentence  is  one  of  custody  for life.  I direct  that  the 
 
minimum term which must expire before you can be considered for release on licence 
 
is  one  of  22 years, less  the days which  you have  spent  on  remand in custody, all  of 
 
which  will  count  towards  your  sentence.  For  the  other  offences  there  will  be 
 
concurrent  sentences  of  detention  in  a  Young  Offender  Institution  as  follows:  for 
 
burglary, 2 years 6 months; for arson, 3 years 4 months; for each  of the offences of 
 
assault by penetration, 5 years 6 months.  Because you have been convicted of those 
 
sexual  offences  you  will  be  subject  for  the  rest  of  your  life  to  the  notification 
 
requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which your lawyers will explain to you. 
   
 
I understand that you have spent 181 days in custody.  If that figure turns out to be 
 
 
wrong,  it  can  be  corrected  administratively.  The  end  result  is  that  you  have  a  life 
 
sentence, and you must stay in prison for at least the next 21 years 184 days.

Ahmad Otak 

Sentencing Remarks of Mr. Justice Coulson  

9 November 2012 

 
 

Ahmad Otak, you may remain seated until I tell you to stand.   

 

You have pleaded guilty to the murder of Kimberley Frank and her friend Samantha 

Sykes in March of this year.  It is now my duty to sentence you.   

 

Before doing so, however, I need to make a finding as to your age.  This is because, if I 

conclude that you were over 21 at the time of the murders, the mandatory sentence is 

imprisonment  for  life.    If  you  were  less  than  21,  the  mandatory  sentence  would  be 

custody for life. 

 

Pursuant  to  Section  164  of  the  Powers  of  Criminal  Court  (Sentencing)  Act  2000,  I 

must  determine  your  age  as  “that  which  it  appears  to  the  court  to  be,  after 

considering any available evidence”.   

 

I am in no reasonable doubt that you are over 21 now, and were over 21 at the time 

that  you  committed  these  murders.    There  is  a  considerable  amount  of  evidence 

which support those conclusions. 

 

First, when you first entered the country as an illegal immigrant, you gave your date 

of birth as 1st June 1991. That would make you 21 now, and 20 years and 9 months 

when you killed these young women.
--------
But  you  boasted  to  Elisa  Frank,  Kimberley  Frank’s  sister,  that  you  had  lied  to  the 

authorities about your true date of birth.  Unsuccessful asylum-seekers like you only 

lie to the authorities to  understate  your  age, knowing that the  younger you  are,  the 

more favourable the treatment you are likely to receive. And you are a practised liar; 

the  interviews  with  the  police  reveal  you  telling  lie  after  lie,  some  of  which  you 

repeated as recently as mid-July, in an interview with your own psychiatrist. On that 

basis  alone,  I  conclude  that  you  were  at  least  a  year  older  than  you  claimed  then, 

making you 21 at the time of the murders in March. 

 

Importantly, that conclusion is borne out by the expert evidence. Various x-rays and 

scans of you have been considered by an expert, Lucina Hackman, who has produced 

a  report  dated  10.4.12,  which  I  have  considered  in  detail.  She  concludes  that  “it  is 

highly  likely  that  this  individual  is  over  21  years  of  age  today”,  and  she  finds  that 

there is “a very strong probability” that you were over 22 in April of this year. 

 

That conclusion is supported, rather than undermined, by the report of 13.7.12 from 

Philip  Marsdon,  a  dental  surgeon,  who  has  examined  a  dental  radiograph  and  has 

concluded that you are at least 20 now and that you could be many years older than 

that.  

 

There  is  no  credible  evidence  which  can  be  set  in  the  balance  against  the  matters 

which  I  have  already  set  out.    You  now  say  that  you  do  not  know  how  old  you  are. 

Accordingly, taking into account all the evidence, I conclude that you are at least 22 

now and were at least 21 at the time of the murders.  

  

Stand up please. 

 

On these findings as to your age, I sentence you to life imprisonment for the murder 

of Kimberley Frank and Samantha Sykes. 

 

You  are  an  Afghan  national  whose  asylum  claim  was  rejected  when  you  illegally 

entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  2007.    However,  you  were  granted  a  period  of 

humanitarian  protection,  until  5th  November  2013.    It  now  seems  that  that  was  the 

direct consequence of the lies you told about your age. You were wholly undeserving 

of any such protection; you repaid the generosity of the authorities and the taxpayers 

of  this  country  by  murdering  two  of  its  citizens  in  a  carefully  planned  and  entirely
--------
cold-blooded  way.  You  claimed  humanitarian  protection,  but  you  showed  yourself 

incapable of behaving like a human being.   

 

You had an on/off relationship with Elisa Frank in Wakefield.  You took advantage of 

her estrangement from her mother and her emotional vulnerability.  Throughout the 

relationship you were controlling and threatening.  Elisa was frightened of you.  You 

repeatedly  made  threats  that  if  she  ever  left  you,  you  would  kill  her,  her  friend 

Samantha Sykes, her mother, and her sisters Kimberley and Faye.  You even said to 

her that if she stayed with you she would be saving lives.  To reinforce these threats 

you regularly carried a knife and on at least one occasion you threatened Elisa with 

that knife..   

 

Elisa Frank was too frightened of you to report you to the police. It is one of the many 

tragedies  of  this  case  that  her  friend,  Samantha  Sykes,  was  not  frightened,  and 

reported you to both the United Kingdom Border Agency and the Police.  Unhappily, 

nothing came of those complaints.   

 

When  Elisa  Frank  left  you  for  the  first  time  in  September  2011,  you  threatened  to 

throw  acid  in  her  face  and  to  petrol  bomb  her  mother’s  house.    After  a  week,  Elisa 

went back to you.  She remained scared for her own safety and had a code with her 

sister Kimberly that she would activate if she was in danger.   

 

By February of this year, Elisa Frank had had enough and she left you again, moving 

out of the flat that you had shared, and telling  you that your relationship was over.  

Initially it appeared that you were not going to react in the violent way that Elisa had 

feared,  although  you  continued  to  stalk  her  during  the  first  days  of  March.    On  9th 

March you met Elisa and her sister Kimberley in Wakefield.  Shortly after that, Elisa 

asked you to bring her possessions from the flat that you had shared to Kimberley’s 

house.  You immediately went into  a kitchenware shop and bought  a stainless steel 

carving  knife  for  £7.99.    You  rang  Elisa  and  asked  her  if  she  was  going  to  take  you 

back.    She  said  No.    You  arrived  at  Kimberley’s  flat  with  the  knife  hidden  on  your 

person.  

 

To the extent that it was suggested that you intended to use the knife on yourself, I 

reject such an explanation; you took the knife there to do what you had long talked 

about; to harm those who were close to Elisa Frank.
--------
As soon as you entered the flat, you again asked Elisa whether she was sure that she 

would not go back to you.  She answered ‘Definitely not’.  A few minutes later, when 

the three of you were in the hallway, you suddenly attacked Kimberley Frank with the 

knife that you had bought.  You stabbed and slashed her repeatedly with the knife in a 

frenzied attack.  Kimberley Frank sustained 15 incised wounds, mainly stab wounds.  

She  suffered  internal  and  fatal  wounds  to  her  lung,  her  heart,  spleen,  liver  and 

kidney. The most serious wound was a massive stab wound to her neck which severed 

her jugular vessels and left carotid artery.  The wound was delivered with such force 

that it damaged the spine.   

 

After you had killed her sister you made Elisa Frank sit down and told her that if she 

had gone back to you, you would not have killed Kimberley.  At one point you stood 

over  Kimberley’s  body,  and  laughed,  licking  blood  from  the  knife  and  spitting  it  on 

her body.   

 

You then made Elisa Frank send several text messages to her friend Samantha Sykes, 

asking her to come to the flat. Fearing for her life, she had no alternative but to do as 

you demanded. You tied Miss Frank’s legs and wrists together so that she could not 

get away.   

 

When Samantha Sykes entered the hallway of the flat you attacked her with the knife, 

stabbing and slashing at her repeatedly.  Elisa Frank sat, tied up in the living room, 

unable to help as you murdered her friend.     

 

Samantha  Sykes  sustained  32  incised  wounds;  many  of  them  stab  wounds,  some 

caused  by  a  slashing  motion.    Two  wounds  to  the  chest  penetrated  her  lung,  heart, 

liver and spleen.  You used such force that a rib was split.  Her neck was cut, severing 

the  jugular  vessels  and  carotid  artery.    Like  Kimberley  Frank,  Samantha  Sykes 

sustained a number of defensive wounds to the arms and legs.   

 

Following  the  killings,  you  fled  to  Dover  with  Elisa  Frank,  intending  to  leave  the 

country on a lorry on a ferry to France.  In order to achieve this you teamed up with 

Bahram Bahrami, an illegal immigrant from Iran, who was also intending to travel to 

France on a lorry.  However, it became apparent to Mr. Bahrami that Miss Frank was 

extremely distressed and, when they had a moment to speak freely in the back of a 

stationary lorry, Elisa  Frank told  him that you were taking her against her will  and 

that you would kill her if you heard her talking to him.  To his credit, Mr. Bahrami
--------
abandoned his own attempt to leave the country. His courage saved Elisa Frank.  He 

lied to you that the lorry was not going to France after all.  When you had got off the 

lorry he grabbed the knife and did not give it back, allowing Elisa Frank to run away 

to some nearby houses.  He then snapped the knife, thus preventing you from using 

it.    He  sought  refuge  in  another  house  until  you  were  arrested  by  the  police.    You 

denied your involvement in many of these events during your interviews. 

 

I  have  read  the  victim  impact  statements  that  have  been  prepared  by  Sarah  Frank, 

Kimberley’s mother; Elisa Frank; and Julie Warren-Sykes, Samantha’s mother. They 

provide eloquent testimony of the devastating effect that you have had on their lives; 

because of you, they will never be the same people, the same families, ever again. 

   

Turning  to  the  sentencing  exercise,  the  first  issue  for  me  is  whether,  pursuant  to 

paragraph 4 of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act, I should impose a whole life 

order; in other words, whether I should here and now extinguish any hope that you 

may have of an eventual release from prison. 

 

I am in no doubt that the seriousness of these offences was exceptionally high. You 

killed two people in the brutal way that you had planned. You forced Elisa Frank to 

take  part  and  then  abducted  her.  And  your  treatment  of  her  sister’s  body 

demonstrates at least a degree of sadism. Thus I consider that the making of a whole 

life order is open to me. And although they are rare, they are not unknown; indeed, in 

a not dis-similar case, Mr Justice Field passed such a sentence just a few days ago. 

 

But I must also reflect the fact that you are young – on the basis set out already, I find 

that you are at least 22 – and that you pleaded guilty, thereby saving Elisa Frank from 

the  dreadful  ordeal  of  giving  evidence.  Taking  those  two  factors  into  account,  I 

consider that it would not be appropriate to make a whole life order. I consider that a 

life sentence, with a lengthy minimum term, is a sufficiently severe penalty. 

 

Thus,  the  remaining  issue  then  becomes  the  length  of  your  minimum  term;  the 

number of years you will have to serve before you are even considered for release by 

the Parole Board. So that there is no doubt about it, this is the minimum period that 

you  will  serve  in  prison;  depending  on  the  views  of  the  Parole  Board  when  that 

minimum period has been served, you may not be released even then.
--------
Because you murdered two people, I consider that these were offences of particularly 

high  seriousness.  Therefore,  pursuant  to  paragraph  5(2)(f)  of  Schedule  21  of  the 

Criminal  Justice  Act  2003,  the  starting  point  for  any  assessment  of  the  minimum 

term in your case is 30 years.  

 

However, there is then a raft of aggravating factors which have not been taken into 

account in the calculation of the starting point, and which significantly increases the 

length of the appropriate minimum term.   

 

First,  as  I  have  said,  these  murders  were  the  result  of  a  significant  degree  of 

premeditation  and  planning.    You  had  told  Elisa  Frank  months  before,  when  you 

were still in a relationship with her, that if she ended it you would kill her family and 

friends.    When  she  left  you,  you  put  that  plan  into  action,  and  you  purchased  the 

knife for that specific purpose, and took it to Kimberley’s house. Moreover, you killed 

Kimberley  and  then  calmly  waited  for  Samantha  to  arrive  before  killing  her,  the 

clearest possible premeditation. 

 

Secondly, these murders were committed with a knife taken to the flat for that sole 

purpose. 

 

Thirdly, the killings were carried out using grossly excessive force.  In each case, you 

cut the throat of your victims and inflicted multiple stab wounds.   

 

Fourthly, there was deliberate and gratuitous violence against both victims. Spitting 

blood on Kimberley’s body was an act of bestiality. Indeed, throughout, you behaved 

like an animal. 

 

Fifthly, there was your use of duress and threats against Elisa Frank to enable you to 

kill  Samantha  Sykes.    Samantha  Sykes  only  went  to  the  house  in  the  first  place 

because you had forced Elisa Frank to ask her to come, and threatened to kill Elisa if 

she did not co-operate.  You made Elisa Frank an unwitting vehicle for the murder of 

her  friend  Samantha  Sykes  because  of  your  threats  to  kill  her.  And  she  was  there, 

against her will, when you murdered her sister and her friend. 

 

Finally, there is the exceptionally serious psychological effect that these events have 

had on Elisa Frank, as demonstrated in her victim impact statement.
--------
Those aggravating factors are, in my view, so serious that they increase the minimum 

term, before a consideration of any mitigating factors, to 40 years.   

 

As to the mitigating factors, there is first a suggestion that you suffered from a mental 

disorder or  mental disability.   However, the highest that it can  be put  in the report 

produced on your behalf by Dr Puri is that when you came to the UK in 2007 you had 

an adjustment disorder (but not depression) and that you may have been depressed 

(Dr Puri can only put it on the balance of probabilities) in the week leading up to the 

killings.  

 

Of course, the difficulty with his whole report is that it is based on your own version 

of events, the reliability of which must be doubtful to say the least. What is more, Dr 

Puri is very clear that any mental disorder that you may have had did not affect your 

criminal culpability; he said expressly that you did not have an abnormality of mental 

functioning which could have given rise to the defence of diminished responsibility.  

 

Accordingly,  whilst  Dr  Puri’s  evidence  might  justify  a  modest  reduction  in  the 

minimum term, it is not a significant mitigating factor. It had no real effect on your 

criminal culpability. It does not alter the  basic position: that you are an inadequate 

man with controlling and violent tendencies who, out of childish jealousy and vicious 

spite, murdered two innocent women in cold blood.  

 

I consider that your mental disorder cannot justify a reduction of more than 2 years 

from the 40 years previously noted. 

 

The next mitigating factor urged on your behalf is your youth, which I have already 

taken into account. It was one of the principal reasons why I did not impose a whole 

life  term.    Even  if  a  further  reduction  is  warranted  on  account  of  it,  that  reduction 

could not be significant; otherwise I would be double-counting. But it is not a factor 

which I should ignore altogether. In all the circumstances of the case, I would reduce 

the minimum term by a further 3 years to reflect your youth.  

 

The final matter of potential mitigation urged on me is the absence of any previous 

convictions.  In  the  light  of  all  the  circumstances  of  this  horrific  case,  I  decline  to 

make any reduction for the fact that you have no convictions; in truth, all that means 

is that you were not previously prosecuted for making the vile threats to Elisa Frank 

that you eventually carried out.
--------
Accordingly,  the  40  years  is  reduced  by  a  total  of  5  years  by  reference  to  these 

mitigating factors. 

 

Next is the credit for your guilty plea. I have already taken that into account too; it is 

the  other  main  reason  why  I  have  decided  not  to  impose  a  whole  life  order. 

Furthermore, I do not agree with the proposition that your guilty plea was entered at 

the first opportunity; by 5.10.12, when you pleaded guilty, the trial had already been 

adjourned  once  and  refixed.  That  was  your  first  formal  acceptance  of  your 

responsibility, although I accept that it had been assumed for some time before that 

that  you  would  not  deny  killing  both  women.  In  any  case,  the  evidence  against  you 

was  overwhelming.  In  the  circumstances,  I  am  only  prepared  to  make  a  further 

reduction of 1 year to reflect your late guilty plea. 

 

I impose no separate penalty in respect of the possession of the knife.  

 

Thus  the  total  reduction  from  the  maximum  40  year  term  noted  above  is  6  years, 

leaving a net figure of 34 years. From that falls to be deducted the 241 days that you 

have spent on remand, giving a minimum term of 33 years and 124 days. 

 

Ahmad  Otak,  you  are  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment  with  a  minimum  term  of  33 

years and 124 days.  To put that another way, so that you and everyone else in court 

understands  the  effect  of  this  sentence,  you  will  not  even  be  considered  for  release 

until the year 2046.",2012-11-09 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Sentencing remarks of Mr. Justice Keith 

 
R 
-v-

Kweku Adoboli 

 

 

 
 

 
 
Kweku Adoboli, whatever the verdicts of the jury would have been, you would forever 
have been known as the man who was responsible for the largest trading loss in British 
banking history.   The jury’s verdicts mean that what you did was criminal as well.   That 
 
is not surprising.  In the last few months before your arrest, you amassed huge positions 
 
when trading on behalf of the bank, well beyond your risk limits, and you did not protect 
 
the bank from the risk of loss by hedging your trades.   I accept that you started to do 
that in order to maximise the profits which the bank would make from your trading, and 
 
the  effect  which  being  regarded  as  a  star  trader  would  have  on  your  bonus  and  your 
prospects for advancement within the bank was a secondary consideration only.   Nor do 
I doubt that you were persuaded, despite your view that the market would fall, to trade 
 
on the basis that the market would rally.  But the fact is that the market did fall.  Your 
unhedged trading well beyond your risk limits resulted in the bank being exposed to the 
risk of enormous losses – at one stage to the risk of losses amounting to an unbelievable 
 
$11.8bn.  And you then took larger and larger positions in a desperate attempt to recoup 
 
those  losses.  Throughout  all  that,  you  concealed  what  you  were  doing  by  booking 
fictitious  hedging  trades  to  give  the  back  office  the  impression  that  your  trades  were 
 
hedged when they were not.  Once your positions had been unwound, the actual losses 
which your trading caused still came to a colossal $2.25bn. 
 
 
It goes without saying that you did not intend to cause that loss – or indeed any loss – to 
 
the bank, but the loss arose out of the way you were trading, and you knew that the way
--------
you were trading would inevitably expose the bank to the risk of huge losses.  That is the 
basis on which I am sure the jury convicted you of fraud in the later period of trading, 
and  the  sentence  which  I  shall  be  passing  in  respect  of  that  period  of  trading  has  to 
reflect that.  Having said that, your conviction on count 3, and not just on count 6, is 
 
important.  Your trading in the period to which count 3 relates did not result in any 
provable loss to the bank.   But your conviction on that count shows that your unhedged 
 
trading was fraudulent from the outset, and not just in the period of trading when you 
amassed the huge positions which you did. 
 
I appreciate that you have not disputed in this trial what you did.   The questions which 
 
the jury had to address were why you did what you did, whether it amounted to an abuse 
of your position as a senior trader at one of the world’s leading investment banks, and 
whether  you  realised  at  the  time  that  what  you  were  doing  would  be  regarded  as 
 
dishonest by the standards of sensible and honest people.   By their verdicts, the jury 
 
have answered those questions, and in my opinion there were no other realistic verdicts 
 
open to the jury on the two counts on which they have found you guilty.   I suspect that 
the only reason why the jury acquitted you on the four counts of false accounting is that 
 
they  were  not  sure  that  you  booked  the  fictitious  trades  predominantly  to  make  a 
financial gain for yourself.  Your acquittal on those counts therefore does not necessarily 
mean that the jury must have thought that your booking of the fictitious trades might 
have been honest, and in any event the fictitious hedging trades you booked remain part 
of the picture of what your fraudulent trading involved.   I know that a basis of plea was 
 
submitted to the prosecution shortly after your arrest.   That implies that you were at 
least  considering  the  possibility  at  that  stage  of  admitting  that  your  conduct  was 
 
dishonest.  It is a great pity that you eventually decided to maintain otherwise.    
 
The  tragedy  for  you  is  that  you  had  everything  going  for  you.    Your  father  was  in  a 
responsible position which enabled you to be educated at a private school.   I am not 
saying that you come from a privileged background, but you had some advantages that 
 
In addition, you had your own natural talents.   You are 
other people do not enjoy. 
highly intelligent.  You are plainly very articulate.  And as I told the jury, you appear to 
 
have  a  considerable  amount  of  charm.  Your  fall  from  grace  as  a  result  of  these 
convictions is spectacular.   I bear in mind that you have no previous convictions, but 
that cannot count for very much because you would not have been in the position of
--------
trust you occupied at UBS if you had previous convictions.   The fact is that you are 
profoundly  unselfconscious  of  your  own  failings.    There  is  the  strong  streak  of  the 
gambler in you, borne out by your personal trading.  You were arrogant enough to think 
that the bank’s rules for traders did not apply to you.   And you denied that you were a 
 
rogue  trader,  claiming  that  at  all  times  you  were  acting  in  the  bank’s  interests,  while 
conveniently ignoring that the real characteristic of the rogue trader is that he ignores the 
rules designed to manage risk. 
 
I am required by law to have regard to the guideline issued in October 2009 by the 
Sentencing Guidelines Council on sentencing for offences of fraud.  I have re-read the 
guidance carefully, and I have taken it into account, but this case is far removed from the 
more common examples of fraud for which the guideline suggests various starting points 
for the sentencing judge or what the appropriate sentencing range should be.   The 
maximum sentence for the crime of fraud by abuse of position is 10 years’ 
imprisonment, and you have been convicted of two such offences.   Taking everything 
 
into account, I have concluded that you should go to prison for a total of 7 years.   On 
count 3, you will go to prison for 4 years, and on count 6 you will go to prison for 7 
years.  Both those terms will be served concurrently with each other making 7 years’ 
imprisonment in all.  You will serve half that sentence, but during the remainder of your 
sentence you will be on licence, and if you do not comply with the terms of your licence, 
you can be returned to custody to serve the rest of your sentence.   The number of days 
you have spent in custody on remand will count towards your sentence, as will half the 
 
number of days during which you were subject to an electronically-monitored curfew.   I 
have been told that the former comes to 271 days, and half of the latter comes to 78 
days, so that the number of days in total which will count towards your sentence is 349, 
or the correct number of days if the number of days I have been given turns out to be 
incorrect.",2012-11-20 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE
 

 

 
15TH NOVEMBER 2012
 

 
 
 

You have been convicted by the jury of the manslaughter of Georgia Varley.  Her life 

 
was ended in a dreadful way at the age of just 16 by your gross negligence. You did 

not intend to kill or even to injure her, but you displayed an appalling disregard for 

her safety, and she paid for your criminal negligence with her life.   

 

When  a  crime  of  homicide  is  committed,  one life is ended but many more lives are 

damaged  or  destroyed.  In  an  eloquent  written  statement,  Georgia  Varley’s  mother 
 

has made very clear the excruciatingly painful sadness which she suffers.  Of course, 

she is not alone in grieving: Georgia’s father, her wider family and her friends have all 

suffered  and  will  continue  to  suffer.  No  sentence  of  the  court  can  bring  back  their 

loved one, or make up for their loss. 

 

In assessing the seriousness of your offence, and deciding the appropriate sentence, I 

am required by s143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to consider your culpability in 

committing  the  offence  and  the  harm  which  you  caused.    Since  that  Act  came  into 

force, the courts have placed a greater emphasis than before on the fatal consequence 

of a crime.  That greater emphasis was made clear in the case of Appleby [2010] 2 Cr 

 
App R (S) 46, and in the recent case of Holtom [2011] 1 Cr App R (S) 18 the Court of 

Appeal has confirmed that the same approach is to be adopted in cases such as this 

where manslaughter is committed by gross negligence.  It is important that everyone
--------
understands that this is not a case of murder, and that the level of sentence which is 

 
appropriate to murder is not appropriate to manslaughter.  That is because murder 

involves an intention to kill or to cause really serious injury, whereas manslaughter 

 
does  not.  Nor  is  this  a  case  in  which  you  are  likely  to  be  a  danger  to  others  in  the  

future,  and  so  an  extended  or  indeterminate  sentence  is  not  needed  to  protect  the 

public.  Nevertheless,  as  Mr  Birkett  has  realistically  acknowledged  on  your  behalf, 

your  crime  is  plainly  so  serious  that  nothing  less  than  a  sentence  of  immediate 

imprisonment would be appropriate. 

 

As  to  the  length  of  that  sentence,  there  is  no  definitive  sentencing  guideline  which 

directly applies to this offence. 

 

You  do  not  have  the  mitigation  of  a  guilty  plea.    However,  Mr  Birkett  has  rightly 

 
identified a number of features of the case which do set limits to the seriousness of 

your  offence,  and  do  count  in  your  favour.  Your  gross  negligence  occurred  over  a 

period  which  can  be  measured  in  seconds:  it  was  not  a  prolonged  course  of  risk-

taking.  You  were  not  motivated  by  financial  profit  or  self-advantage.    As  to  your 

 

personal mitigation, you have never previously been convicted of any crime, and your 

 
one  formal  police  caution  was  for  a  completely  different  type  of  offence  and  can  be 

 
ignored  for  present  purposes.  Your  negligence  on  this  occasion  must  be  viewed 

 
against the background of more than 20 years conscientious service on the railways. 

You  will  live  with  the  knowledge  of  what  you  did,  and  I  accept  that  will  be  a  heavy 

burden  to  you.  Your  conduct  has  resulted  in  your  suffering  post-traumatic  stress 

disorder: there is clear expert evidence that the symptoms of that disorder, together 

with severe anxiety and depression, still continue a year after the incident.  Lastly, for 
 

a man of your age and position, any sentence of imprisonment will be difficult to bear, 

and I have no doubt you have dreaded this day. 

 

 
All  those  points  were  well  made  by  Mr  Birkett.   I  accept  that  individually  and  

 
collectively they do mitigate your crime.  But I have to have regard also to the very 

grave harm that you caused, namely the death of a 16 year old girl.  Moreover, there 

are in my judgment five other serious and aggravating features of this offence.   

 

Page 2 of 4
--------
First, the evidence has plainly shown that throughout your career with Merseyrail you 

have been repeatedly trained and instructed in matters of safety.  You knew as well as 

anyone  the  risk  of  accidents  associated  with  what  has  been  referred  to  as  the 

 

platform/train  interface.  You  must  also  have  known  that  a  passenger  who  falls 

 
between platform and moving train is likely to be killed.  It follows that any risk you 

took in that area was a risk to the life of the passenger. 

 

Secondly, as the guard of the train, you were in complete control of the movement of 

the  train.  That  control  carries  with  it  the  direct  and  personal  responsibility  for  the 

 
safety  of  passengers.    Much  has  been  made  on  your  behalf  during  this  trial  of  how  

intoxicated Georgia Varley was, but that did not relieve you of the duty of care which 

you  owed  to  her.  You  alone  determined  whether  the  train  remained  stationary  or 

began  to  move.  Your  decision  and  your  action  determined  whether  Georgia  Varley 

was safe from risk. 

 

Thirdly, having heard all the evidence I am quite sure that you did in fact know that 

 
Georgia Varley was heavily intoxicated.  You must surely have noticed at least some of 

her behaviour at Meols, when she left the train and was then brought back onto it by 

 
a friend.  In any event the CCTV footage makes me sure that within moments of your 

seeing her on the platform at James St you must have known that she was unsteady 

on her feet.  You yourself confirmed to the police in interview that the last train into 

town on a Saturday night was looked on as a problem train because many passengers 

 
had had too much to drink.  After 20 years’ experience of dealing with passengers, I 

am sure you sized up Georgia Varley’s condition almost at a glance. It follows that I 

am sure you knew she was particularly vulnerable to losing her balance.   

 

That  being  so,  I  regard  it  as  a  fourth  serious  feature  of  the  case  that  you  were 

watching this vulnerable girl leaning against the side of the train, in the most obvious 

position of danger, when you pressed the bell twice to signal the driver to move the 

train.  You were not distracted at the vital moment, or required to turn away in order 

to operate the controls.  You had a continuous and perfect view of her: you were only 

about 25 metres apart, in a slightly elevated position and with nothing at all between 

you and her.  In my judgment, the CCTV footage is unequivocal: Georgia Varley was 

not moving away, and she was not showing any sign of moving away, when you gave 

Page 3 of 4
--------
that  signal.  On  the  contrary,  she  was  leaning  against  and  supported  by  the  train 

which you chose to set in motion.  She only moved when the movement of the train 

 
deprived her of that support and caused her to lose balance and fall to her death.  In 

the horror of realising what you had done you may later have persuaded yourself that 

you thought she was moving away, but I do not believe that you did think that at the 

time.  Georgia  Varley  had  done  nothing  to  give  you  any  reason  to  think  that.    I  am 

 
satisfied that you merely hoped and assumed she would get out of the way when the 

 
train  began  to  move,  and  on  that  wholly  inadequate  basis  you  took  a  terrible  risk. 

You completely ignored your repeated training and instruction to the effect that you 

must ensure it was safe to start the train before you gave the signal.   

 

 
Lastly, even after you had given that signal, you could easily have countermanded it. 

 
It would have been the work of a moment to give one more ring on the bell to signal 

the driver to stop before the train had really begun to move.  It would have taken only 

 
seconds for you to step down from the cab, walk a few paces to where Georgia Varley 

was standing, and tell her to move away for her own safety.   But you did nothing. 

 

 

I  take  into  account  all  those  features  of  the  case  which  I  have  mentioned,  both 

aggravating and mitigating As you have no doubt been advised, you will serve half of 

the sentence which I am about to pass.  You will then be released on licence for the 

remainder of the sentence, but you may be returned to prison if you do not comply 

with the conditions of your licence. 

 

In my judgment, the least sentence which I can pass for this serious crime is one of 5 

years’ imprisonment.

R v Ronald Charles Johns 


Sentencing Remarks by Mr Justice Singh 


19 November 2012 


 

 

 
 
1.	 

 

You have pleaded guilty to a total of 10 sexual offences which took place between 

1983 and 1991, contrary to the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which was then in force.  

There were three different victims of your offences, to whom I will refer as A, B 

and C.  Some of the counts on the amended indictment are specimen counts, that 

is counts 5, 6 and 7, and so are examples of a larger number of offences committed 

against the same victim (A) over a period of time.  In accordance with the Crown’s 

request, I will direct that counts 1, 2 and 14 shall lie on the file on the usual terms; 

and that count 8, which was an alternative to count 3, should be marked ‘plea to 

alternative.’ 

 

2.	  You committed your offences while you held senior positions in the Church of 

 

England in Borrowdale, where you moved to become a Vicar in 1979, and Carlisle, 

where you moved to become Canon in 1989. 

 

The first two offences in respect of A (that is counts 3 and 9) were of indecent 

assault on a male under the age of 16 and were committed between 20 January 

 
3.	 

1
--------
1985 and 19 January 1987.  It is accepted on your behalf that at least one of those 

offences was committed after 1 September 1985, when the maximum sentence for 

such offences was increased to 10 years imprisonment and that I should sentence 

on that legal basis. 

 

4.	  Also in relation to A you have pleaded guilty to four counts of gross indecency 

 

between 1985 and 1987, at a time when A was aged between 14 and 16.  The 

maximum sentence for such offences was 2 years imprisonment. 

 

 
5.	 

 

In relation to B, you have pleaded guilty to two counts of gross indecency, which 

took place between 1983 and 1985, at a time when B was aged 17.  In relation to C, 

you have pleaded guilty to two counts of gross indecency, which took place 

between 1989 and 1991, at a time when C was also aged 17.  In the cases of B and 

C, it is accepted on your behalf that what you did was a criminal offence at the 

time but it is submitted that, when it comes to sentence, the Court should bear in 

mind that Parliament has since thought fit to equalise the age of consent in such 

cases to 16. 

6.	  Your first victim was A, whom you got to know from the age of 5 in Liverpool.  

 

You were a friend of the family and he referred to you as an ‘honorary uncle.’  He 

would sometimes stay overnight with you and you also had sole care for him at 

other times.  The abuse included rubbing your penis against A’s buttocks (counts 3 

and 9), which took place when A was 15; kissing, touching and fondling (count 4); 

requiring him to perform oral sex on you (count 5); performing oral sex on him 

(count 6); and mutual masturbation (count 7).  You sometimes gave A alcohol. 

 

2
--------
7.  Your second victim was B, aged 17 at the time.  You had helped with B’s 

 

confirmation when he was 11 or 12.  The abuse occurred at his home, which you 

visited as a family friend.  You played a pornographic video and suggested playing 

a game of ‘strip poker.’  You masturbated yourself and your victim.  Later you got 

into a shower with your victim and engaged in mutual masturbation before 

ejaculating.  B felt fear and panic.  You told B not to tell anyone. 

 

8.	  Your third victim was C, whom you knew from the age of about 12 and who 

 

considered you to be a ‘father figure.’    The two offences took place over a two 

day period when C was staying with you at your residence at Carlisle Cathedral.  

You gave him some whiskey and showed a pornographic video.  The abuse 

included your touching and masturbating C. 

 

 
9.	 

 

 
10.	 

 

I have read the Victim Personal Statements from each of your victims.  They make 

clear the continuing impact on them of the abuse they suffered at your hands but 

also their desire to achieve closure in this case. 

It is accepted on your behalf that you engaged in techniques of ‘grooming’ your 

victims although it is submitted that you never used force.  The Pre-sentence 

Report in your case observes that you manipulated your victims into being abused 

and describes your behaviour as “predatory.”  The report recommends a sentence 

of imprisonment and that it should be long enough to enable you to complete a 

Sex Offender Treatment Programme. 

11.	  Among the statements which are before the Court is one from the Archdeacon of 

 

West Cumberland who makes his statement on behalf of the Church as an 

3
--------
institution and on behalf of the parishes and congregations which have been 

caught up in this matter. He informs the Court that they have expressed shock, 

horror and betrayal. A person they trusted with their loved ones has turned out to 

be an abuser of children when they ought to be the most protected. As the 

Archdeacon says, your actions have damaged the Church’s credibility and standing 

in the world. It relies for its work on trust and respect and these have been eroded 

as a result of your actions. In addition, as he says, the Church aspires to be a place 

where people, especially the most vulnerable, are safe and can find what they need. 

However, people will feel the exact opposite as a result of your actions. 

It is common ground that, although the maximum powers of the Court are limited 

by the legislation which was in force at the relevant time, appropriate guidance can 

be obtained from guidelines which are available today.  The relevant guidance was 

issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council in 2007 and, although it relates to the 

2003 Act, it is common ground that it provides helpful guidance in particular in 

relation to your offences of indecent assault in counts 3 and 9.  Today that would 

be equivalent to the offence of sexual assault, which is governed by the guidance at 

pp.31-34.  In a case of this kind, where there is contact between the naked genitalia 

of the offender and the naked genitalia, face or mouth of the victim, the starting 

point is given as 3 years imprisonment with a range of 2-5 years.  That guideline 

assumes a person of good character after a trial. 

 

 
12.	 

 

13.	  As is accepted on your behalf, there are the following aggravating factors in your 

 

 
case: the number of complainants; the type of abuse, in particular the fact of 

ejaculation; your abuse of a position of trust; and the period of time over which 

your offending took place. 

4
--------
14.	 

 

 
15.	 

 

I bear in mind that you are a person of previous good character: you have reached 

the age of 75 years without any previous criminal convictions.  You will also be 

given full credit for your early pleas of guilty. In that way your victims have been 

spared the need to relive their experiences by having to give evidence in Court. 

I also bear in mind the testimonials which have been placed before the Court, 

which speak of the distinguished service you have given to the Church and the 

help you have given to other people during your life.  As you yourself accept, you 

have ruined your life and brought disgrace on yourself.  I also note the apology you 

have given through your counsel to your victims, their families and the Church, all 

of whom you accept you betrayed.  Finally, I bear in mind the principle of totality. 

16.	  The sentence of the Court is as follows.  On counts 3 and 9, which relate to A, you 

 

will be sent to prison for three years concurrent.  On counts 4, 5, 6 and 7, which 

also relate to A, the sentence is 1 year, also concurrent.  On counts 10 and 11, 

which relate to B, the sentence is six months, concurrent on each but consecutive 

to the earlier sentences.  On counts 12 and 13, which relate to C, the sentence is six 

months, again concurrent on each but consecutive to the earlier sentences. 

 

17.	  That makes a total of four years imprisonment.  You will serve one half of that 

 

sentence and will then be released on licence but you will remain liable to recall by 

the Secretary of State until the end of your sentence. 

 

18.	  You will also be subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order in the terms which 

 

have been read to the Court and which are accepted on your behalf.  You will be 

5
--------
the subject of disqualification by the Independent Safeguarding Authority.  You 

will be subject to the notification requirements which apply to a person who is on 

the sex offenders’ register for the period which is laid down by law.

Mrs Justice Cox has dealt with two applications by the defence prior to the plea and case 
 
management hearing in this criminal trial. The first related to the admissibility of evidence, which 
 
was heard in February 2012. As a result of the judge’s ruling some evidence was excluded which 
 
related to both murder charges.  In effect this resulted in the charge for the murder of Rebecca 
 
Gooden‐Edwards being withdrawn from the current indictment. The second application, heard in 
 
 
May 2012, related to an application to stay proceedings as an abuse of process. The judge dismissed 
 
this application. 
 
 
Summary of Facts 
 
 
Christopher Halliwell was originally charged on the current indictment with two separate murders, of 
 
 
Sian O’Callaghan and Becky Godden‐Edwards.  Following Halliwell’s arrest on 24 March 2011 there 
 
were serious and irretrievable breaches by the Senior Investigating Officer (SIO) of the mandatory 
 
rules governing the detention and interview of arrested suspects by the police. The SIO made a 
 
deliberate decision to breach those rules, contrary to the advice of his deputy investigating officer. 
   
An application to exclude the evidence of Halliwell’s actions and statements, as a result of those 
 
breaches following his arrest, was successful for the reasons given in the first ruling.  The 
 
Prosecution did not appeal against that ruling. 
  
 
Following this ruling a further application was made by the defence to halt the prosecution of 
 
Halliwell completely, on the basis that further misconduct, by the same SIO, in deliberately briefing 
 
the media on matters which were sub judice amounted to an abuse of process and meant that 
 
Halliwell could no longer have a fair trial.  Mrs Justice Cox rejected this application in a further ruling 
 
 
on 9 May 2012 .  A further hearing, in respect of the charge of murdering Sian O’Callaghan, is now to 
 
 
be held at Bristol Crown Court at 12.00 on 19 October.  The second charge, of the murder of Becky 
 
 
Godden‐Edwards, remains under investigation at present and will not be dealt with on this 
 
 
indictment on 19 October. 
   
 
First Ruling on Preliminary Issue: Admissibility of Evidence 
 
 
Introduction 
 
 
The Defendant, Christopher Halliwell, was before the Court on an indictment containing two counts 
 
of murder – the murder of Sian O’Callaghan and the murder of Rebecca Godden‐Edwards. 
 
 

 
    
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

1
--------
Counsel for the defence contested the admissibility of evidence relating to the entire series of events 
 
which followed the Defendant’s arrest until his arrival at the Gable Cross Police Station in Swindon 
 
 
some 4 hours later. 
 
 
The defence application was heard at a voire dire over four days in February 2012.  (paras 1 – 6) 
 
 
The facts 
 
 
The facts surrounding the police tactics and arrest of Christopher Halliwell and the subsequent 
 
actions of Detective Superintendent Fulcher are set out in paragraphs 7 – 77. 
 
 
The issues 
 
 
Counsel for the defence submitted that there were, in this case, fundamental breaches of both 
 
Section 76 and the PACE Codes, so that Section 78 is engaged by both and the breaches taken 
 
together render inadmissible all the evidence of events during the whole of the period between this 
 
Defendant’s arrest at 11:06 on 24 March 2011 and his arrival at the police station four hours later at 
 
15:15.  (para 78) 
 
 
The judge considers the relevant statutory provisions in detail at paragraphs 80 – 86. 
 
 
On the issue of Section 76, and whether the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that 
 
the Defendant’s confession had not been obtained by oppression, Mrs Justice Cox concluded: “I find 
 
 
that the Prosecution have not discharged the burden to the criminal standard and the evidence 
 
relating to his confession and the location of Ms O’Callaghan’s body is therefore inadmissible 
 
 
pursuant to Section 76(2) of PACE.” (para 96) 
 
 
The judge considers whether PACE Code C.11.1 was engaged on the facts of the case in detail in 
 
 
paragraphs 97 – 118. 
 
 
Mrs Justice Cox concluded: “For the reasons given [in my ruling] and in respect of Section 76 I do not 
 
   
accept the submission that what happened in this case had no impact upon this Defendant or caused 
 
 
him no disadvantage.  These were indeed significant and substantial breaches of the Codes, in 
 
circumstances deliberately designed to persuade the Defendant to speak.  Further questions were 
 
asked, all without caution, during the journey to the location of Ms O’Callaghan’s body.  Admissibility 
 
of this evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that it ought 
 
not to be admitted.” (para 118) 
 
 
Rebecca Godden‐Edwards 
 
 
Mrs Justice Cox went on to consider the implications of the police conduct in relation to the charge 
 
 
relating to the murder of Rebecca Godden‐Edwards in paragraphs 119 – 131. 
 
 
In her ruling the judge said: “This whole series of events began with a deliberate decision by a senior 
 
officer to breach the Codes and it developed into circumstances where I consider there may have 
 
been oppression, for the reasons I have given.  Once the Defendant had directed Det Supt Fulcher to 
 
 
the place where Ms O’Callaghan could be located, the relevant risk had been averted and the 
 
qualifying criteria for an urgent interview under C.11.1 no longer existed.  There is no doubt on the 
 
evidence that C.11.1 was no longer engaged.” (para 125)

“…As soon as he began to talk about another offence it is clear that he should have been cautioned. 
  
There should have been no further discussions about it and the Defendant should have been taken to

admission of the evidence relating to the confession concerning Ms Godden‐Edwards and the

The Crown Prosecution Service did not appeal the judge’s ruling. 
 
 
Second Ruling on Preliminary Issue: Abuse of Process 
 
 
Introduction: 
 
 
Following the admissibility of evidence application, counsel for the defence applied for the entire 
 
proceedings to be stayed as an abuse of process. 
 
 
In summary, the basis for this application was that, after the defendant’s arrest, the same SIO had 
 
called a series of press conferences and deliberately briefed the press in detail on matters which 
 
were sub judice, namely what the defendant had told the police and how he had led them to 
 
separate locations where two bodies could be found.  There was then extensive and repeated 
 
national media coverage of the case and of these facts in particular, over a number of weeks, such 
 
 
that it is no longer possible to rectify the damage caused by this publicity and the defendant could 
 
not have a fair trial.  (para 4) 
 
 
This application was heard on 4 April 2012 and dismissed at a hearing on 9 May 2012. 
 
 
At a PCMH hearing on 31 May 2012, the defence applied to dismiss Count 2 (Rebecca Godden‐
Edwards murder charge) from this indictment. The Crown did not resist and the charge was deleted 
 
from the indictment; the Court was informed by the Prosecution that this is a crime which is still 
 
 
under investigation. The defendant was then arraigned on Count 1 (Sian O’Callaghan murder charge) 
 
 
and pleaded not guilty. (paras 1 – 9) 
 
 
Relevant Facts 
 
 
The judge considers the police media strategy adopted from the start of Operation Mayan and 
 
relevant facts in detail at paragraphs 10 – 32. 
 
 
This includes an undisputed bullet point list of facts provided to the press after the defendant’s 
 
 
arrest. (para 32) 
 
 
Defence Submissions 
 
 
Defence counsel submitted that what happened here constitutes an abuse of process in two 
 
respects.  There was, he submitted, an assault on the integrity of the criminal justice system as a

result of the deliberate misconduct of the police in briefing the media on what the arrested man had 
 
told them.  Counsel said that alone merits a stay of the proceedings.  Further, the nature and extent 
 
of what was done also means that it is now impossible for this defendant to have a fair trial.  (para 
 
 
33) 
 
 
Counsel’s submissions are summarised in paragraphs 33 – 43 of the ruling. 
  
 
The Law 
 
 
Mrs Justice Cox considers the legal principles and case law on these issues in detail at paragraphs 44 
 
 
– 61. 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
 
Mrs Justice Cox concluded: “I am not satisfied on the evidence that there was bad faith here on the 
 
 
part of the Prosecution.  [Defence counsel] raised concerns as to the contents of [the Crown 
 
Prosecution Service’s statement], as reported in The Mirror on 27 March.  However, it is customary 
 
to use the phrase “working closely” with police officers, in relation to charging decisions and more 
 
generally, and I see nothing sinister in the use of that expression. 
 
 
“On its face this statement clearly and entirely properly urged restraint, in terms of publicity, and 
 
there is no evidence before me to suggest that the Crown Prosecution Service did anything other 
 
than urge restraint.” (paras 62 – 63) 
 
 
She added: “Nor am I satisfied that there was bad faith on the part of Det Supt Fulcher.  He frankly 
 
and unapologetically gave his reasons for acting as he did and expressed robust views in evidence, in 
 
 
an effort to explain and justify the course he took and the reasons for it.  Further, his evidence that 
 
his handling of the media was all done under the general supervision of the Gold Group was 
 
unchallenged.  It is not clear what the individual members of the Gold Group actually knew about the 
 
 
specific terms in which Det Supt Fulcher was briefing the media at his press conferences, but it is 
 
 
clear that this officer had authority to conduct these press conferences and to issue the various press 
 
 
 
releases, and that position did not change.” (para 64) 
 
 
The judge agreed with prosecuting counsel that whilst Det Supt Fulcher’s judgment may be open to 
 
criticism, the exercise of poor judgment falls far short of a determination that he acted in bad faith. 
 
 
(para 65) 
 
 
Mrs Justice Cox said: “The first seven bullet points in the list of facts referred to [in para 33], all 
 
relating to the evidence which has been ruled inadmissible, all seem to me to be information given 
 
by Det Supt Fulcher at the press conferences.  The subsequent bullet point facts also came from the 
 
police and while there are references to “a source” or to “a police source”, the terms are used 
 
interchangeably.  Although he was not specifically asked about this when he gave evidence, I find on 
 
   
 
the balance of probabilities that this information also came from Det Supt Fulcher.  However, none of 
 
 
 
the evidence referred to in these subsequent bullet points has been ruled inadmissible at the 
 
 
defendant’s trial.” (para 66) 
 
 
She went on to say: “I take into account my findings as to the conduct of this officer in my earlier 
 
ruling.  I accept that he was then annoyed and frustrated when the defendant stayed silent in 
 
interview under caution, as he was entitled to, on the advice of his solicitor. 
 
 
“… I consider that this was a serious error of judgment on his part, but I am not satisfied that he was 
 
acting in bad faith, or that there was otherwise serious fault on the part of the Prosecution, such as

to render this defendant’s trial an affront to the public conscience and to merit a stay of these 
 
proceedings on that ground alone.” (paras 67 – 68) 
 
 
The key question for the judge, applying the legal principles set out in her ruling, is whether the 
 
reporting of all this information and the publicity which ensued means that the defendant cannot 
 
now have a fair trial. (para 70) 
 
 
In coming to her conclusion the judge analysed all the press reports and an ‘echosonar’ graph 
 
produced by the Prosecution. She considered the substantial time gap between the coverage and the 
 
 
expected trial date in so far as the risk of recollection by any member of the jury is concerned (almost 
 
 
two years). The judge decided that her decision to transfer the defendant’s trial from Bristol to 
 
Preston also provided an important safeguard, along with the ability to give clear instructions to the 
 
jury that they must not carry out any research themselves. (paras 72 – 84) 
 
 
Mrs Justice Cox concluded: “For all these reasons I am not persuaded to the requisite civil standard 
 
that it is impossible for this defendant to have a fair trial on the charge of murder.  His application for 
 
 
  
the proceedings to be stayed for abuse of process is therefore dismissed.” (para 85)

A PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE NORTHERN CIRCUIT 

 
 
 
IN THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT   
T1992 0238 
 
 

THE QUEEN -v- ASIL NADIR 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS 

 

23 AUGUST 2012 

 

Asil  Nadir,  you  are  a  man  of  outstanding  business  skills,  and  in  the  1980s  you 

achieved remarkable success.  In a decade you developed Polly Peck International plc 

into  a  multi-national  business.    You  no  doubt  brought  employment  and  financial 

benefit to many persons around the world.  You are entitled to take great pride in that 

achievement.    The  company’s  success  was  in  many  ways  your  success.    But  the 

company’s  money  was  not  your  money.    You  knew  that.    You  nonetheless  helped 

yourself to it.  You committed theft on a grand scale.   

 

You have been convicted of 10 offences of theft.  The first involved the theft by you of 

£5,150,000 on 14th August 1987 – 25 years ago last week.  The last involved the theft 

of another £5 million three years later, on 6th August 1990.  In all, during that three-

year period, you stole from PPI sums totalling £28.6 million, and US$500,000 with a 

sterling  equivalent  at  the  time  of  nearly  £300,000.    Without  making  any  detailed 

analysis of changes in the value of money over the intervening years, it is fair to say 

that the total sum stolen equates to more than £60 million today.   

 

You committed those thefts by authorising or instructing the transfer of monies out of 

PPI’s bank accounts in London.  The monies were then moved through various other 

bank accounts, in particular a bank account of a PPI subsidiary company known as
--------
the Unipac Jersey account, to end uses which were nothing to do with PPI’s business 

but were instead for the benefit of you, your family and associates.  The flow charts 

which  were  provided  to  the  jury  showed  the  complex  routes  which  the  money  took 

before reaching those end uses.  That complexity was intended by you, and designed, 

to  obscure  and  conceal  the  reality  of  what  you  were  doing.    The  transactions  were 

accounted  for  in  the  books  and  records  of  PPI  in  such  a  way  that  it  appeared  that 

funds  were  legitimately  being  transferred,  for  company  purposes,  to  subsidiary 

companies  in  northern  Cyprus  and  Turkey.    The  reality  was  that  you  were  stealing 

from the company.   

 

It is relevant to give some brief examples of the end uses to which the stolen money 

was  applied.    It  was  used  to  buy  shares  in  PPI,  both  in  your  own  name  and  in  the 

names of others who were clearly your nominees and controlled by you.   It was used 

to  acquire  or  fund  various  businesses  and  properties  from  which  you  benefited.    It 

was used to pay your personal expenditure, including a tax bill of over £1 million.   On 

one  occasion,  stolen  money  was  even  used  to  make  a  donation  to  charity  in  your 

name.  The fact that stolen money was used to fund an extravagant lifestyle can often 

be  a  very  significant  aggravating  feature  in  cases  of  theft.  I  do  not  regard  it  as 

counting  particularly  heavily  against  you  here,  because  it  seems  to  me  that  you 

already had an extravagant lifestyle as a result of your success in business.  It follows, 

however, that you were a wealthy man who stole out of pure greed.  

 

The direct consequence of your crimes was that the company suffered the loss of just 

under £29 million.  But that was not the only consequence.  In the late summer and 

autumn  of  1990,  the  bankers  who  had  previously  been  glad  to  lend  money  to  PPI 

began  to  seek  repayment  of  short-term  loans  as  they  fell  due.    There  was  then  an 

urgent need for cash to be remitted from the near east subsidiary companies to PPI 

head  office  in  London  so  that  the  most  pressing  demands  could  be  met  and  the 

confidence  of  the  lending  banks  restored.    But  nothing  was  remitted.    You  gave  a 

series  of  assurances  to  your  fellow  directors  and  to  the  banks  as  to  particular  sums 

being available by particular dates.  None of those assurances was kept.  No money 

was  made  available.    After  a  time,  the  banks  –  unsurprisingly  -  would  no  longer 

accept  your  talk  of  money  arriving  shortly.    One  bank  pressed  particularly  hard  for 

repayment  of  a  comparatively  small  loan.    You  were  told  of  that  demand  for 

Page 2 of 9
--------
repayment,  and  promised  in  a  telephone  call  that  you  would  fix  it.    The  evidence 

makes  me  sure  that  you  fixed  it  by  arranging  for  one  of  your  assistants  to  forge  a 

letter  which  purported  to  be  confirmation  from  a  bank  that  the  necessary  funds 

would be remitted.  That was not the only document which was falsified by those who 

were  assisting  you  in  northern  Cyprus,  and  again  the  evidence  makes  me  sure  that 

your hand was behind the various forgeries and other false accounting records which 

were used to conceal the thefts of which you have been convicted.     

 

Your  fellow  directors  decided,  entirely  understandably,  that  there  was  no  realistic 

option open to them other than to petition for PPI to be placed into administration. 

In  your  evidence  to  the  jury  you  unjustly  accused  those  directors  of  having  been 

intimidated by legal advice as to their prospective personal liabilities if PPI continued 

trading whilst insolvent.  You further accused many others of incompetence, wrong 

doing and malice.  You blamed everyone but yourself for the collapse of PPI.  I accept 

that there may well have been many complex factors which collectively brought about 

that  collapse,  and  I  agree  with  Mr  Hackett  that  it  would  be  wrong  to  say  that  you 

alone  were  responsible  for  it.    However,  the  evidence  makes  me  sure  that  one 

substantial cause of the collapse was the failure of the near east subsidiaries to remit 

any cash when it was so urgently needed.  If all the money was where it should have 

been, and if there was nothing to hide, then the failure to send any of it from northern 

Cyprus  to  London  was  inexplicable.  Whatever  concerns  the  directors  of  those 

subsidiaries may have had as to their future, the evidence makes it entirely clear that 

they  would  obey  your  direct  instructions.  But  of  course  the  money  which  you  had 

stolen  was  not  where  it  should  have  been,  and  so  you  did  have  something  to  hide.  

The evidence I have heard therefore drives me to the conclusion that you, having on 

ten  occasions  stolen  PPI’s  money,  were  determined  to  frustrate  any  meaningful 

investigation of the finances of the near east subsidiaries which would have revealed 

those  thefts.  I  am  sure  that  for  that  reason  you  were  responsible  for  the  failure  to 

remit  funds.  You  blame  others  for  the  collapse  of  PPI,  but  the  evidence  makes  me 

sure that your conduct in committing those ten thefts, and in seeking to cover them 

up, was at least one of the substantial causes of it.  With that collapse, of course, came 

financial loss to all who had invested in PPI: not just large institutional investors, but 

private investors and persons whose pension funds were partly invested in PPI shares.   

 

Page 3 of 9
--------
You  were  arrested  and  charged.  After  lengthy  preparation,  your  trial  was  set  for 

September 1993.  You did not remain in this country to stand trial.  Instead, in May 

1993,  you  fled  to  northern  Cyprus.    No  doubt  you  had  been  under  very  great  stress 

and pressure in the period before your departure, and I accept that for at least a short 

time your health suffered as a result; but you had brought the stress of criminal and 

civil proceedings upon yourself by your thefts from PPI.    Mr Hackett asks me to have 

regard to what were on any view extraordinary events in the proceedings around that 

time, which he submits would have shaken the confidence of anyone in your position.  

I am not persuaded by that point; but even if I were, it does not begin to explain your 

then staying in northern Cyprus.  You remained absent from this country for 17 years, 

and so delayed for nearly two decades the day of reckoning which has finally arrived. 

 

It  is  important  that  I  should  make  clear  to  you  and  to  the  public  the  sentencing 

principles which I have applied.   

 

First,  the  jury  heard  evidence  about  many  transfers  of  money  which  were  not  the 

subject of counts in the indictment.  Although that evidence was properly considered 

by them, the law provides that the court can sentence only for the specific offences of 

which you have been convicted.  I make it plain that is what I will do.   

 

Next, the approach the court must take in sentencing for crimes committed long ago 

has been indicated by the Court of Appeal in the recent case of R v H & Others [2012] 

1  WLR  1416.    I  must  apply  current  statutory  provisions.    You  therefore  gain  the 

benefit  of  a  statutory  amendment  which  has  come  into  force  since  you  committed 

your crimes, the effect of which is that the maximum sentence for any one offence is 

now 7 years imprisonment even though it was 10 years at the time when the offences 

were committed.   I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in section 

142  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003,  and  by  section  143  of  that  Act  I  must  have 

regard to the seriousness of the offences, taking into account your culpability and the 

harm which your offending caused.   

 

Next,  I  must  also  have  regard  to  the  sentencing  guidelines  which  are  now  in  force, 

notwithstanding  that  they  did  not  exist  when  the  offences  were  committed.    The 

relevant guideline is that applicable to offences of theft committed in breach of trust.  

Page 4 of 9
--------
It indicates a starting point of 3 years’ imprisonment, and a range of 2 to 6 years, for a 

man of previous good character convicted after trial of a single offence of theft of a 

sum  of  £125,000  or  more.  You,  of  course,  have  been  convicted  of  ten  offences, 

involving far larger sums.   

 

In  assessing  the  seriousness  of  your  offences,  I  regard  the  following  as  aggravating 

features. 

 

First,  the  combination  of  your  breach  of  the  trust  reposed  in  you  by  your  fellow 

directors, and your abuse of your position of authority and control over PPI in general 

and the near east subsidiaries in particular.  It is true that you were but one director 

in a board of directors; but the evidence in this trial has shown very clearly that you 

were a dominant figure, especially so in relation to anything to do with the near east 

subsidiaries.  You were in a position to use that dominance for good or for ill.  You 

chose to use it in ways which enabled you to commit theft.  A particular example of 

that  is  your  determined  retention  of  your  sole  signatory  status  in  respect  of  the 

Unipac Jersey account, a status which you cynically exploited by using that account to 

disguise what was really happening to the funds which had left PPI. 

 

Secondly, the number of your offences and the extent of the loss which you caused.    

 

Thirdly,  your  persistence  in  stealing  over  a  period  of  time.  In  this  regard,  I  take 

particular note of the evidence that in October 1989 you were spoken to by one of the 

company’s  auditors,  who  had  cause  to  question  a  particular  transaction.  You  gave 

him an untruthful explanation, which concealed what had really happened. Even on 

that basis, he advised you that what you had done was extremely unwise. You were 

not deterred by that warning.  You went on to commit three further offences. 

 

Fourthly, the sophistication of the manner in which the thefts were committed, and 

your  concealment  of  your  crimes  by  causing  others  to  make  false  entries  in  the 

company’s  books  and  records.    You  were  assisted  by  a  number  of  persons  in  this 

country and abroad: each of them was an employee of PPI or of a company which had 

been set up to manage your personal wealth, and in that way you exploited the fact 

that you were in effective charge of both companies.   

Page 5 of 9
--------
As  to  matters  of  mitigation,  I  take  into  account  the  following  points  which 

individually and collectively enable me to reduce to some extent the sentences which 

would otherwise be appropriate. 

 

First, your previous good character.  Allied to that, I accept Mr Hackett’s submission 

that the court can be confident you will not reoffend.   

 

Secondly, your central role in the successful development of PPI and the benefits it 

brought to many employees and investors before its collapse. 

 

Thirdly, and importantly, your voluntary return to this country.  The jury’s verdicts 

establish  that  you  did  not  return  because  you  were  an  innocent  man  who  had  been 

the  victim  of  injustice.    But  whatever  its  true  motivation  may  have  been,  that 

voluntary return enabled the trial to proceed.   

 

Fourthly,  the  fact  that  having  returned  the  conditions  of  your  bail  required  you  to 

observe  a  nightly  curfew  which  continued  for  nearly  two  years.    Although  not 

qualifying  by  statute  for  a  specific  reduction  in  your  sentence,  I  accept  that  it 

constituted a significant restraint upon your liberty which I should take into account.  

I similarly take into account the short periods which you spent in police custody.   

 

Fifthly, your current state of health.  I have at an earlier stage of these proceedings 

received medical evidence, in particular the reports of two consultant cardiologists.   I 

am aware that you underwent a medical procedure in 2005, and that your condition 

requires  medication  and  regular  monitoring. 

  It  appears  however  that  your 

cardiovascular condition is stable under this medication, and has not worsened since 

2005.    You  must  understand  that  in  the  ordinary  way,  the  ill  health  of  a  person 

sentenced  to  imprisonment  is  a  matter  for  the  prison  authorities,  not  a  reason  to 

reduce what would otherwise be the appropriate sentence. As Mr Hackett realistically 

accepts, the evidence I have heard as to your state of health does not indicate that it is 

so  poor  as  to  render  imprisonment  unusually  difficult  or  onerous  in  your  case.  I 

nonetheless  think  it  appropriate  to  take  your  poor  health  into  account  when 

considering your voluntary return to this country: it provided another reason why you 

Page 6 of 9
--------
might  have  chosen  to  remain  in  the  near  east,  and  it  is  to  your  credit  that  you 

nonetheless returned.   

 

In  a  similar  way,  I  take  into  account  your  age  as  another  factor  relevant  to  your 

voluntary return.  You were aged 69 at that time, which was another reason why you 

might have chosen to remain in northern Cyprus.  On that ground alone, your age is a 

factor which counts to some extent in your favour.  I make it plain however that in my 

judgment your age does not assist you in  any other way, for the simple reason that 

you chose to flee the jurisdiction and remain absent from this country for 17 years.  If 

you had stood trial in 1993, as you should have done, you would have been 52 years 

old.   

 

I have considered but rejected other possible mitigating features. You are not assisted 

by the fact that you yourself lost a lot of money when PPI’s share price collapsed: that 

was another self-inflicted wound. 

  

Finally I should mention that there is here no mitigation in the nature of remorse for 

your past offending. You were entitled to have your trial, and you were entitled before 

that trial to make the several applications you did seeking on legal grounds to prevent 

the trial ever going ahead. The fact that you exercised those rights does not make your 

crimes  more  serious  than  they  already  are,  and  does  not  in  any  way  increase  the 

sentences  which  would  otherwise  be  appropriate.  But  it  does  mean  that  I  have  had 

the opportunity to observe you not only throughout the months which this trial has 

occupied  but  also  at  the  many  pre-trial  hearings  which  I  have  conducted  since  late 

2010.  You are a man of considerable charm and unfailing courtesy, and it is sad to 

see the waste of your undoubted talents.  But I have no hesitation in concluding that 

you  have  shown  not  the  slightest  remorse  for  your  crime.  Your  sole  concern 

throughout has been to avoid any acceptance of your own responsibility. 

 

Balancing  those  various  factors,  it  is  in  my  judgment  clear  that  the  aggravating 

features  substantially  outweigh  the  mitigating  features.    I  am  nonetheless  able  to 

reflect  such  mitigation  as  there  is  by  reducing  the  total  sentence  which  I  would 

otherwise  have  passed.    That  total  is  reduced  by  2  years  to  reflect  the  mitigating 

features which I have identified. 

Page 7 of 9
--------
I take into account the submissions ably made on your behalf by Mr Hackett.  I take 

into account also the recent cases which counsel have put before me as indications of 

the  appropriate  level  of  sentence.    I  agree  with  Mr  Hackett  that  none  of  them  is 

closely analogous to your case.   

 

I have no doubt that each of your ten offences is so very serious that only a sentence 

of  imprisonment  is  appropriate,  and  that  the  starting  point  for  each  individual 

offence  should  be  a  sentence  at  or  near  the  top  of  the  range  indicated  by  the 

sentencing guidelines.  But of course you are not to be sentenced for only one offence.  

Where  offences  are  committed  over  a  significant  period  of  time,  the  court  has  to 

consider whether concurrent sentences would properly reflect the overall criminality.  

In  your  case,  they  would  not.    There  must  be  some  consecutive  sentencing  to  mark 

your persistence in offending repeatedly over a lengthy period.  In particular, it would 

in my judgment be wholly wrong not to mark by way of consecutive sentencing your 

continuing  to  offend  after  the  warning  given  to  you  in  October  1989.    The  fact  that 

consecutive  sentences  produce  a  total  which  exceeds  the  statutory  maximum  for  a 

single offence is no bar.  Indeed, there is no bar in principle to the court imposing the 

maximum  sentence  on  each  of  two  or  more  offences  and  ordering  them  to  run 

consecutively.   

 

That brings me to the final consideration which the court must have in mind, namely 

the principle of totality.  If I simply passed the appropriate prison sentence on each 

count,  and  made  each  of  them  consecutive  to  all  others,  the  total  would  be  far  too 

high.  I must therefore step back and limit the aggregate sentencing to a total which is 

proportionate to the overall criminality.  I make it clear that in doing so my primary 

consideration is the totality of my sentencing, not the precise structure by which that 

totality is achieved.   

 

My  duty  is  to  determine  the  appropriate  sentence,  not  to  direct  when  you  will  be 

released.  I must however explain to you the practical effect of my sentence.  Counsel 

have researched the relevant statutory provisions, and I accept that the effect of them 

is as follows.  You will serve half of the total sentence which I am about to pronounce.  

You  will  then  be  released  on  licence  for  the  remainder  of  the  total  term.  When  so 

Page 8 of 9
--------
released,  you  will  be  subject  to  the  conditions  of  your  licence,  and  the  Secretary  of 

State will have the power to withdraw your licence and order your return to prison. 

 

On  counts  1,  2,  3,  5,  6,  7  and  8  there  will  be  concurrent  sentences  of  5  years’ 

imprisonment.    On  counts  10,  12  and  13  there  will  be  sentences  of  5  years’ 

imprisonment:  those  three  sentences  will  be  concurrent  with  each  other  but 

consecutive to the other seven sentences.  Your total sentence, accordingly, is one of  

10 years’ imprisonment.

 TRENTON OLDFIELD
 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF HH JUDGE ANNE MOLYNEUX 

19 OCTOBER 2012 

 

On 7th April 2012 you swam into the River Thames during the University Boat Race. 
You intended to disrupt the race and you did so. You have been convicted of Public 
Nuisance. Thousands of people had lined the banks of the river to enjoy a sporting 
competition. Many more were watching at home on live television. 
 
The race officials were alarmed that you were at risk of death or serious injury, or that 
you might cause a crash between the 20 or so launches which were following the 
rowers. They took swift and decisive action to stop the race. The crews of both boats 
responded quickly and you were not harmed. You were arrested and the Police acted 
with great diligence to ensure that you were kept safe from the angry crowd. It is a 
fact, upon which you should reflect, that the first thought of all those you came to 
disrupt was to ensure your safety. 
 
It took some 25 minutes to restart the race. At your trial you placed great emphasis on 
 
the fact that the race was restarted and was completed. That is so. No one will ever 
know what the outcome would have been if you had not acted as you did. What we do 
know is that you spoiled the race. You caused delay and disruption to it and to the 
members of the public who had gone to watch it and to enjoy the spectacle of top 
athletes competing. 
 
The rowers had trained for many months. You had no regard for the sacrifices they 
had made or for their rigorous training when you swam into their paths. 
 
You gave evidence at your trial of your views that this was an elitist race supported by 
an elite society. You said that you acted as you did to draw attention to inequality. 
You said that you planned to disrupt the race, that you are content with what you did 
and that you have no regrets. You said “I knew that there would be people upset. 
There is a long history of protest, it is part of British culture, and unfortunately delays 
are a part of protest”. It is a fact, upon which you should reflect, that the race you 
interrupted is a free spectacle open to all. 
 
 

 

1
--------
Lord Hoffman said, in a speech upon which you rely, “It is a mark of a civilised 
society that it can accommodate protests, but there are conventions which are 
generally accepted by the law breakers on one side and the law enforcers on the other. 
Protestors behave with a sense of proportion and do not cause excessive damage or 
inconvenience. And they vouch for the sincerity of their beliefs by accepting the 
penalties imposed by the law”. 
 
You have drawn that speech to the attention of the court, together with the case of 
Anwen Jones and other cases to suggest that your sentence should be a conditional 
discharge. Each case must, of course, be considered on its own facts. It is notable that 
those who protested in the Anwen Jones case did so with some elements of 
spontaneity.  Your actions were planned. The offence they were convicted of was 
different from that for which you have been convicted. They all accepted 
 
responsibility for their actions and pleaded guilty to them. That cannot be said of you. 
 
  The prosecution accepted that you are a man with a social conscience. A great many 
good people gave evidence at your trial on your behalf. A great many more have 
written in your support. You have worked for the benefit of the community both paid 
and unpaid over the last 11 years since you came to the UK. You are a man previously 
of good character. You are an intelligent man. You have observed the strict conditions 
of your bail for many months. A full pre sentence report has been prepared and the 
court has had regard to it. All of those matters are taken into account in your favour. 
 
On 7th April at least 5 elements of your decision and behaviour were wrong: 
 

1.	  You acted disproportionately. There were many other ways in which you 

 

could have promoted your views more effectively. It was not clear to anyone 
who saw what you did what your views actually were. 

 
2.	  There was no immediate or instant need to act as you did. Other means were 
available to you of drawing attention to your cause. As Lord Justice Buxton 
said “in those circumstances, criminal self help can not be reasonable”. 

 

 
 
3.	

 Your actions were dangerous. You placed your life at risk and in so doing 
endangered the health and safety of others. 

 

 

 

 

4.	  You decided that you had the right to stop members of the public enjoying a 

 

sporting competition which they had chosen to go and watch. You did not 
have that right. You did nothing to address inequality by giving yourself the 
right to spoil the enjoyment of others. In doing so you acted without regard for 
equality and contrary to the meaning of it. 

5.	  You made your decision to sabotage the race based on the membership or 

 

perceived membership of its participants of a group to which you took 
exception. That is prejudice. No good ever comes from prejudice. Every 
individual and group of society is entitled to respect. It is a necessary part of a 
liberal and tolerant society that no one should be targeted because of a 
characteristic with which another takes issue. Prejudice in any form is wrong. 

2
--------
Your offence was planned. It was deliberate. It was disproportionate. It was 
dangerous. You have shown no regret. 
 
The court has regard to the principles of sentencing as set out in the Criminal Justice 
Act. The Court has weighed the culpability and harm of your actions. 
 
I sentence you to six months in custody.

IN THE CROWN COURT, LEEDS   
 
 

R -v- SARAH LOUISE CATT 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS 

 

17 September 2012 

 
 
1.  You have pleaded guilty to administering Misoprostol to yourself with intent to procure 

your own miscarriage.  You are entitled to credit for that plea and generously, I give you the 
full 1/3 credit although you maintained your innocence during police interviews, since you 
entered a plea at a relatively early point following charge.  The starting point for my 
sentencing before discount for plea takes account of the aggravating features of this matter. 

 
2.  Whilst this is an offence which is rarely charged these days, the facts underlying it are 

unusual.  The critical element of your offending is the deliberate choice made by you in the 
full knowledge of the due date for the birth of your child, to terminate the pregnancy at 
term or very close to it, in the full knowledge that termination after week 24 was unlawful 
and in the full knowledge that your child’s birth was imminent.  This is so serious that only 
an immediate sentence of imprisonment will suffice.  The sentence will be one of 8 years.   

 
3.  You ordered the Misoprostol on 14 April 2010 and it was delivered on the 10 May 2010.  

On the 21 May 2010 you enquired on the internet as to what would happen if you took 
Misoprostol at term.  On the 26 May you enquired again on the net as to how soon the 
drug would take effect.  As you also took an afternoon off work on the 25 May, it is a fair
--------
inference that you must have taken the drug somewhere around that time.  You went on a 
family holiday on about the 27 May.  

 
4.  You told the man with whom you were having an affair of your pregnancy back in October 

2009 and your last menstrual period would, on the basis of other evidence, including your 
own enquiries on the internet, have been about 19 August 2009.  You were concerned to 
keep the knowledge of your pregnancy and your affair from your husband, but you had 
intermittent contact with the Marie Stopes Clinic website in January and February 2010 
with a booking on the 16 March 2010 based on your statement to the clinic that your last 
menstrual period was in late November.  You did not attend on the 16 March because on 
the previous day, you attended the British Pregnancy Advisory Service and were told that 
the scan showed pregnancy of 26 weeks and 3 days and that the 24 week period for lawful 
abortion had passed.  You challenged this calculation and then attended a hospital where 
more sophisticated equipment produced a figure of 29 weeks and 5 days.  A termination on 
the 12 May would be at about 38 weeks and 2 weeks later would be as near to term as 
makes no difference. 

 
5.  You told the Psychiatrist that you acted alone and took the drug whilst your husband was 
away, delivering the baby induced by the drug at home.  You told the Psychiatrist that the 
child was a boy, was not breathing on birth and did not move – in other words it was still-
born.  You said you buried the body but have refused to disclose the location.  You 
delivered the afterbirth and cleaned up the bathroom on your own, telling no-one what had 
taken place.   

 
6.  According to the pre-sentence report: “on discovering that she had exceeded the legal limit, 
Mrs Catt said she still pursued the abortion avenue, knowing that it was illegal.  I discussed 
other possible options that Mrs Catt could have taken, such as keeping the baby; having the 
baby adopted; making a decision sooner.  Mrs Catt said she explored all other possible 
options and discounted them.” 

 
7.  You are a woman who obtained sufficient A Levels to attend Newcastle University 

although you gave up your course in Mathematics there in your second year.  You have 
experience of childbirth and of abortion and must have full knowledge of the 
developmental stages of the child in the womb as well as the lawful limits on abortion of 

Page 2 of 5
--------
which you were expressly told.  You do not suffer from any mental disorder of any kind, as 
appears from the 27 page psychiatric report that I have read. I see no need for a report 
from a psychologist. This was a cold calculated decision that you took for your own 
convenience and in your own self interest alone. 

 
8. 

In the past, when at University, you became pregnant but concealed this from your parents 
until delivery, after you had given up your university course.  You attended hospital without 
receiving any antenatal care and gave up your daughter for adoption immediately on birth.  

 
9.  You entered into a relationship with your current husband, whom you married after 10 

years in May 2009.  In 2000, pregnant by him you had the pregnancy terminated, with his 
agreement, at about the legal limit.  In 2002 you again sought a termination but you were 
told the pregnancy was too far advanced and you were duly delivered of a child on the 1 
July 2002.  In 2004 you attended hospital for delivery of a child, having concealed that 
pregnancy from your husband as he now is.  That child was born in April of that year.  You 
therefore are no stranger to the issues which surround childbirth, abortion and adoption. 

 
10.  Despite marrying your long-term partner in May 2009, it seems, on your own say-so, that 

you had an on/off 7 year affair with a work colleague before becoming pregnant.  You 
clearly thought that the child was his as you told him, but not your husband, of the 
pregnancy in October 2009.  He offered to leave his wife to start a family with you but you 
declined.  You broke off the relationship in January telling him that there was no child and 
it was none of his business.  You told the Probation Officer that it was not until March 
2010 that you decided you wanted to remain with your husband and to have an abortion.  
You resumed the casual relationship with the man whom you considered had fathered your 
child in this affair, in June 2010 following the termination.  You concealed the pregnancy 
from your husband as you had done once before, though he had been both supportive and 
understanding following the delivery of that child, unexpected as it was to him.  He is still 
supportive of you now.   

 
11.  Concealment and deceit have played a part in your relationship with your parents, with 

previously employers from whom you stole in 1999 and with your husband.  Throughout 
the police investigation, including 9 ½ hours of interview, you maintained the lie that you 
had undergone a legal termination within the period allowed by the Abortion Act, by the 

Page 3 of 5
--------
Marie Stopes Clinic and that you had destroyed the papers relating to it.  You have also 
suggested that, when you took the Misoprostol, you thought that the birth would involve 
essentially blood and excrement – a suggestion I have to reject.  A person of your 
intelligence, education and experience would know just how early on, a child’s 
characteristics and features are seen in the womb and the extent of a child’s development at 
38-40 weeks, however inexact the calculation of the due date. 

 
12.  You could well have been charged under Section 1 of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 

1929 for destruction of a child capable of being born alive.  Section 1(2) of that Act 
provides a presumption in law that if a woman is pregnant for 28 weeks, the child en ventre 
sa mere is capable of being born alive.   

 
13. 

It makes little different that you have been charged with a different offence, since the 
gravamen of your conduct is the same and the maximum sentence for each offence is 
identical – life imprisonment.  The question I have to consider is where on the scale or 
calendar of criminal offences your conduct lies. 

 
14.  What you did was to end the life of a child that was presumptively capable of being born 

alive, by inducing birth or miscarriage.  I am not able to accept anything much that you 
have told others about what occurred but I bear in mind all that has been said on your 
behalf in mitigation, in particular the fact that you are a good parent to your 2 children.  
However, but for the drugs intentionally taken, there is no reason to believe that you would 
not have been delivered of a healthy boy.  Had he been born safely within a matter of days, 
and had you killed him after birth, you would be facing a charge of murder.  Had that been 
the case you would have faced life imprisonment and I would have to set a minimum term 
to be served in prison with a starting point of 15 years, less discount for the plea and any 
mitigating factors.   

 
15.  There is no mitigation available by reference to the Abortion Act, whatever view one takes 
of its provisions which are, wrongly, liberally construed in practice so as to make abortion 
available essentially on demand prior to 24 weeks with the approval of registered medical 
practitioners.  What you have done is to rob an apparently healthy child en ventre sa mere, 
vulnerable and defenceless, of the life which he was about to commence.  You are not 
charged with murder and I would be wrong to treat it as such as matter of law.  Equally this 

Page 4 of 5
--------
16. 

is not manslaughter nor akin to it where the intention is not to cause death. Nor is it on a 
par with causing death by dangerous driving either, with its maximum sentence of 14 years, 
bearing in mind the calculated intentionality here.   

In English Law, none of those offences could be committed in respect of an unborn child, 
but the gravamen of this offence is that, at whatever stage life can be said to begin, the 
child in the womb here was so near to birth that in my judgement all right thinking people 
would consider this offence more serious than manslaughter or any offence on the calendar 
other than murder.  

 
17.  With no real mitigation, no remorse that I can detect, though suffering emotional distress 
that any woman might suffer from the sequence of events which have taken place, I have 
to sentence on the basis that a substantial period of imprisonment is required, regardless of 
the effect on your family which I know will be considerable.  As a matter of public policy 
and bearing in mind the need for deterrence, a long determinative sentence is required.  
There is no reason to believe that you would not act in the same way should similar 
circumstances arise but fortunately the chances of that are small, so that I do not consider it 
necessary further to consider the dangerous offender provisions of the 2003 Act.   

 
18. 

 
19. 

I have had regard to the authority cited to me, namely the decision of Mr Justice McKinnon 
in 2007 in relation to the termination of a pregnancy at 7 ½ months.  It is not comparable 
and I take a different view of the criminality involved here. I have had regard to Appleby 
and sentencing decisions in relation to manslaughter of a child but, as I have said, I see no 
analogous offence and must proceed on the basis of the seriousness of the offence as I see 
it in terms of culpability and consequences. 

In my judgement the starting point taking into account all aggravating factors is 12 years, to 
which I apply a discount of one third which results in an 8 year determinative sentence.   

 
20.  Of this you will spend half in custody and half on licence subject to recall should you break 
the terms of that licence at any stage.  You counsel will further explain the effect of this to 
you.

This case concerns the financial help that these defendants, Mohammed Shabir Ali 
 
and Mohammed Shafik Ali, provided to their brother, Mohammed Shamim Ali, 
 
between August 2008 and, in reality, October 2010 (when the first arrest that is 
 
 
relevant to this case occurred). That financial assistance took place at a time when 
 
both defendants suspected their older brother was involved in terrorist training 
 
activities in Somalia. It is accepted by the prosecution that they sent the funds 
 
primarily out of concern for their brother’s physical and mental health, but it is 
 
important to note this was in the context of his planned involvement in terrorism. 
 
They were in contact with Shamim during the relevant period and they provided 
 
funding to him on a continuing basis, although they undoubtedly would have 
 
encountered difficulties in transferring the funds. It is clear that they knew their 
 
brother needed financial assistance and why: this was all explained by Shamim over 
 
 
the telephone once he had arrived in Somalia, and additionally both defendants 
 
 
understood the need for their activities to remain undetected. 
  
 
They pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of fundraising contrary to section 15 (3) 
 
(a) and (b) Terrorism Act 2000, accepting by their plea that they sent approximately 
 
£3000 from England to the Horn of Africa during the period just set out. Offences 
 
under section 15 carry a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years. 
   
 
In order to put this case in its relevant context, it is to be noted at the outset that a 
 
 
further defendant, Shabaaz Hussain, was sentenced by Calvert Smith J on 9 March 
 
2012 to 5 years 3 months imprisonment for 7 counts of fundraising contrary to the 
 
same section of the Terrorism Act 2000. In essence the case against Shabaaz Hussain
--------
was that he transferred approximately US$14,000 to Shamim Ali (the present 
 
defendants’ brother), Tufail Ahmed and Muhammad Jahangir who he accepted were 
 
all engaged, or were intending to engage, in acts of terrorism. It is undisputed that 
 
those three men had travelled to Somalia in August 2008 to join a large number of 
 
foreign fighters in that country dedicated to creating an “Islamic Emirate of 
 
Somalia”. In that year the number of foreign fighters had dropped sharply leading to 
 
 
 
appeals from Al‐Shabaab (the Muslim Youth Movement) for volunteers to join the 
 
 
 
Somali Jihad. 
  
 
The £3000 sent by these defendants to Shamim Ali was transferred to Somalia, 
 
 
either entirely or in the main, by Shabaaz Hussain. 
  
 
Given the strong link (as regards the timing and the nature of this offending) 
 
between Shabaaz Hussain and Shabir and Shafik Ali, inevitably this sentencing 
 
exercise has involved a detailed comparison of the respective positions of the two 
 
 
brothers, on the one hand, and Mr Hussain, on the other. It is argued on behalf of 
 
these defendants that in determining the right sentence, I should, amongst other 
 
things, reflect the favourable factors that distinguish them from Shabaaz Hussain. 
  
 
As it seems to me, the following factors are of particular relevance in reaching the 
 
right sentence in this case:

Shabaaz Hussain, on the basis of the material found at the time of his arrest, 
 
is a man undoubtedly committed to a fundamentalist and extreme ideology 
 
that provided the motivation for his involvement in funding terrorism. Put 
 
simply, the flat where he lived was full of violent jihadist material and the 
 
prosecution inevitably invited the court to assess his criminality against the 
 
background of his knowledge and, particularly, sympathies. In taped 
 
conversations Mr Hussain made clear his support for the mujahedeen and his 
 
 
sympathies for the difficulties faced by the fighters in Somalia.  He was 
 
significantly involved in this offending, over a protracted period of time. 
  
 
These defendants had read certainly parts of “44 Ways to Support Jihad” 
 
which is an undoubtedly inflammatory jihadist publication, which contains a 
 
 
wealth of practical instruction (in the context of this case, Ways 3, 4 and 5 
 
have particular resonance in that they deal with financing and fundraising). 
 
Furthermore, at the time of this offence they expressed, by reference to 
 
someone called Brother Hamza, an interest in militant struggle. Therefore, 
 
although they have not committed any other relevant offences and they are 
 
not suggested to have held the most extreme leanings or views, they 
 
nonetheless did have a degree of what I am going to describe as relevant 
 
ideological interest at the time of this offence. But that said, I accept that 
 
their principal concern in committing this offence was to ensure that money 
 
reached their brother in order to help him in very difficult circumstances. 
 
There are indications that, certainly at one stage whilst he was in Somalia, 
 
these two accused believed Shamim Ali was unwell. And there are some 
 
indicators that in the past he had suffered from psychiatric instability.  These

two defendants were clearly involved to a markedly lesser extent than Mr 
 
Hussain and essentially for different reasons, and the sum of money they 
 
provided to their brother was significantly smaller than the overall amounts 
 
Shabaaz Hussain transferred to the Horn of Africa. I accept that if Shamim 
 
had not travelled to Somalia they would not have committed this offence. 
  
 
Both men are married and I have carefully read the various letters that have 
 
 
 
been handed in and I have taken them into account. 
  

   
 

 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shabir Ali has three children. He was studying for an NVQ TA course at the 
 
 
time of his arrest, with a view, so I am told, to working in education. His 
 
 
family are undoubtedly suffering as a result of his absence, and in particular 
 
 
his wife has to care for three children alone. 
  

   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shafik Ali’s wife is pregnant with their first child. She has found her husband’s 
 
imprisonment particularly onerous, given her dependence on him. I am told 
 
he had been employed before this case by Transport for London. 
   

 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Their mother is unwell (she suffers from depression and has been diagnosed 
 
with schizophrenia) and they are both closely involved with her care. They 
 
have a large extended family and strong community ties. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apart from Shabir’s essentially irrelevant minor previous convictions they are 
 
both of good character and they are still young men. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They have shown a strong element of social responsibility by giving evidence 
 
for the prosecution at this court in a recent murder trial which resulted in the 
 
convictions of four defendants. Their role in that case, I am told, and 
 
particularly the evidence they gave was significant. 
 

 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

   
 

 
Notwithstanding all of those matters, I must not forget that over a reasonably 
 
protracted period of time they worked to help somebody who was contributing, or 
 
intending to contribute, to terrorist activities in a war‐torn country in Africa, whether 
 
or not he was a member of their family. 
 
 
The courts must reflect the seriousness of offences of this kind in the sentences that 
 
 
are handed down given they are intended to support terrorism, and in this case 
 
notwithstanding the powerful mitigation that I have considered as to the 
 
circumstances of the offence and the defendants’ respective domestic situations. 
 
 
Calvert Smith J adopted a starting point of 7 years for Shabaaz Hussain, deducting 
 
close to 1/3 for his guilty plea. 
  
 
Although the domestic circumstances and mitigation of these defendants are not 
 
entirely identical, I do not consider that the differences that have been brought to 
 
my attention merit distinguishing between them. Their culpability is the same, and
--------
the mitigation advanced on their behalf has many common themes. There is no 
 
sustainable basis for passing sentences of different lengths on these two accused. 
  
 
(Please stand up) 
 
 
I accept that your sentences undoubtedly ought to be linked to that passed on 
 
 
Shabaaz Hussain. Bearing in mind his significantly greater involvement in funding 
 
terrorist activities in Somalia and his extremist motivation, and reflecting the overall 
 
differences between his position and yours, the starting point for you is 5 years. 
 
From that I deduct 1/3 for your plea (taking the sentence down to 3 years 4 months) 
 
and I have additionally reflected your responsible approach, apart from this offence, 
 
to your family and our society. 
  
 
Bearing in mind all those matters, the sentence on you both is 3 years, from which is 
 
 
to be deducted 119 days which you have served on remand. 
   
 
The relevant notification period is 10 years.",2012-08-01 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HHJ RICHARD MCGREGOR‐JOHNSON
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

THE QUEEN
 
 

 

‐V‐


HANS KRISTIAN RAUSING
 
 

 

 

1. 
 

Hans Kristian Rausing, you have pleaded guilty to preventing the lawful 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and decent burial of your wife. If ever there was an illustration of the utterly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families, it is to be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found in the facts of this case. You and your wife had every material advantage 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imaginable, and for a time a happy family life. Your relapse into the misuse of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drugs,  together  with  that  of  your  wife,  destroyed  all  that.  It  is  graphically 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrated  by  the  contrast  between  the  rooms  visitors  saw,  and  the  utter 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

squalor of the rooms you really lived in. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. 
 

The sentencing decisions on offences of this type to which I have been 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred make it clear that there is a wide range of sentencing options, very 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much dependent on the intentions and purpose behind the concealing of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death. At its most serious, where the concealment is done to frustrate justice 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and especially where the death itself was criminal or potentially so, substantial
--------
immediate  custodial  sentence  have  been  upheld.  Those  are  not  the  facts  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case. 
 

 

3. 
 

I accept that the medical evidence, including that of the examination of 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  pacemaker  and  toxicology  report,  suggests  that  your  wife  died  of  heart 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure coupled with the effect of drugs; there  is  no evidence to suggest the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involvement  of  anyone  else,  including  you,  in  her  death.  I  accept  too  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion of Dr McPhillips that having been present when your wife died, you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were unable to cope with that, and suffered some sort of a breakdown, to use 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a layman’s term. That does not, in my view, entirely explain your conduct, nor 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  it  completely  absolve  you  of  responsibility  for  it.  In  carrying  out  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentions,  you  acted  with  deceit  and  deliberation,  equipping  yourself  with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

items  you  used  to  try  to  prolong  the  act  of  concealment.  The  effect  in  due 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course  was  firstly  to  cause  great  concern  amongst  those  anxious  as  to  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wife’s  whereabouts,  and  then  to  cause  the  dreadful  shock  of  discovery  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distressing circumstances, firstly for those who had to uncover the body but 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially for your wife’s parents who were in the room when their daughter’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body was discovered. Their understanding and generous response is essentially 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  tribute  to  them,  but  it  does  too  limit  the  effect  that  your  actions  might 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise have had. 
 

 

 

4. 
 

I  have  considered  carefully  Dr  McPhillips’  report.  Had  I  come  to  the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion that you were no more than a rich drug user, then I would have had 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no hesitation in taking a similar course to that followed by the Court of Appeal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
in  the  cases  of  Pedder  and  King  where  the  defendants  were  similarly  drug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
abusers but without your advantages. I have come to the conclusion, however, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
that  the  circumstances  in  which  you  committed  this  offence,  and  especially
--------
your mental state at the time, and your continuing need for treatment, allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
me to take a different course. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
5. 

 
The nature of the offence, and its effect on others, in my view demand a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
custodial sentence, but one which I can properly suspend in view of the other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
factors I have mentioned, provided you are willing to comply with what will be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  
a very demanding drug rehabilitation requirement as a resident. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
6. 

 
In setting the length of the custodial sentence I give you full credit for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
your guilty plea, entered as it is at the first opportunity, and I bear in mind your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
previous good character, including the contribution you have made, along with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
your wife, to drug treatment charities. The sentence that I pass is one of 10 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
months  imprisonment,  suspended  for  2  years.  That  means  that  should  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
commit any offence within the next 2 years you run the risk of having to serve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
this sentence in addition to any other penalty. To make matters entirely plain, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
“any  offence”  means  exactly  what  it  says,  including  driving  a  car  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
disqualified or when under the influence of drugs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
7. 

 
There  will  be  a  requirement  that  you  submit  to  treatment  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
direction  of  Dr  McPhillips  for  a  period  of  2  years  and  provide  samples  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
testing  as  and  when  required.  I  am  satisfied  that  in  order  to  provide  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
maximum chance of success it is necessary that you are resident at the Capio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
Nightingale Hospital. This order will be reviewed by me, and at such reviews I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
will  consider,  in  the  light  of  reports  from  Dr  McPhillips  and  the  responsible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
officer, whether you continue to require residential treatment. There will also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
be a requirement of supervision by a probation officer during the same 2 year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
period.
--------
8. 
 

I need to impress on you the importance of complying fully with these 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements. Should you not do so, you run the risk of being brought back to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  and  of  having  the  sentence  of  imprisonment  activated.  In  view  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature and gravity of the offence, any breach proceedings would be heard in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Crown Court. 
 

 

 

9. 
 

I have to deal with the offence of driving when unfit through drugs – in 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances where you were plainly a danger to the public. Again I give you 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit for your plea. 
 

 

 

 

The  sentence will be  one  of  2 months  imprisonment  suspended  for  2 years, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  same  drug  rehabilitation  and  supervision  requirements  as  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed on the main offence. As with that sentence, any breaches would be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealt with in the Crown Court. You will be disqualified from driving for a period 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 2 years, and your licence will be endorsed.

SENTENCING REMARKS 

 

22 MAY 2012 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

This Defendant has been convicted of the murder of Peter Bick. I am satisfied that the attack 
 
was  planned  and  that  the  Defendant’s  intention  was  to  kill.  He  tricked  his  way  into  Peter 
 
Bick’s house and while there, killed him by striking him at least five severe blows on the head 
 
with  a  hammer  which  smashed  the  skull  and  damaged  the  brain.  He  also  placed  a  tight 
ligature  round  Peter  Bick’s  neck  causing  some  degree  of  asphyxia.    I  am  satisfied  from  the 
 
degree of planning that the Defendant either went to the flat armed with the hammer or knew 
 
before he went to Peter Bick’s flat that he would be able to find a suitable weapon there. The 
 
hammer has never been recovered. At the least I am satisfied that when the Defendant went 
 
to Peter Bick’s flat he was prepared to kill him. 
 
That this was a planned and cold blooded killing is confirmed by the meticulous way in which 
 
the Defendant cleared up the flat afterwards.  As well as clearing up, he tied a leather thong 
 
around the penis of Peter Bick’s naked body and covered him with bedclothes and sex toys 
demonstrating his contempt for the man that he had just killed. 
 
 
The Defendant told the police when he gave himself up on the night of the killing that he had 
 
killed Peter Bick because he was a paedophile. Apart from evidence given by the Defendant, 
which I reject, there is no convincing evidence that Peter Bick was a paedophile. I am unable 
however  to  be  sure  that  the  Defendant  did  not  believe  that  he  was.  For  that  reason 
I  will 
 
sentence  him  on  the  basis  that  he  had  that  belief.  The  prosecution  contend  that  the 
Defendant  killed  Peter  Bick  because  he  was  a  homosexual.  They  base  their  contention  on 
remarks made by the Defendant to a psychiatrist that, after his release from prison, he met 
up with a number of homosexuals who he intended to kill but ended up having sex with them. 
 
If  true  that  would  support  the  contention  that  the  Defendant  set  out  to  kill  homosexuals 
 
rather than paedophiles. It is difficult to reach any firm conclusion as to the truth of what the 
 
Defendant  told  psychiatrists  and  I  place  little  reliance  on  that  part  of  the  evidence.  On  the 
other hand there is objective evidence that the Defendant was doing research on the internet 
 
seeking to identify men who appeared to express an interest in younger men or women. I do 
 
not believe that the Defendant’s investigations were as extensive as he has made out, but he 
 
clearly  made  some,  and  the  nature  of  his  enquiries  and  the  communications  that  he  made,  
 
support the  contention that he was  looking for older men interested in  much younger  men 
 
and women. 
 
 
I am satisfied that the Defendant does have an intense hatred of paedophiles and the harm 
 
that  they  do.  He  believes  that  the  penalties  handed  out  by  the  Courts  for  child  abuse  are 
 
inadequate.  For him the appropriate  penalty, if  he considers it necessary, is death. He has
--------
appointed  himself  Judge,  jury  and  executioner.  However  good  the  evidence  of  child  abuse, 
 
the  Defendant  was  not  entitled  to  take  the  law  into  his  hands  in  the  way  he  did  but,  as  he 
demonstrated in this case, he was prepared to reach his conclusions on entirely inadequate 
evidence. 
 
 
It is not difficult to understand the reason for this intense hatred. The Defendant was abused 
 
as  a  child,  as  the  prosecution  accept,  and  that  abuse  led  to  his  conviction  for  murder.  He 
 
served  over  nine  years  of  a  life  sentence  before  he  was  eventually  cleared  of  any  criminal 
responsibility for the death of his abuser. It was not a failing of the system that caused that 
 
miscarriage of justice. He did not disclose the abuse until he had served a number of years of 
 
his  sentence.  For  that  he  is  not  to  be  blamed.  Many  people  who  have  been  abused  find  it  
 
impossible to talk about abuse whatever the consequences to them of not revealing it. Nor is 
he to be blamed for the fact that he is now a very damaged person.  
 
 
I accept that the Defendant’s hatred of paedophiles, which started with that abuse,
 fed on 
 
the attitudes of other prisoners whose contempt for sex offenders is well known and grew in 
 
intensity  until  it  dominated  the  Defendant’s  life.  He  may  also  have  come  into  contact  in  
 
prison with sex offenders whose lack of remorse for the harm that they had done, convinced 
him that sex offenders could not be stopped by conventional means.  
 
 
Having said what I do accept, there is a great deal of the Defendant’s case that I reject. I reject 
his account  that he believed  a 16 year old was  in danger of sexual abuse from Peter Bick. I 
 
accept  the  contention  of  the  prosecution  that  it  was  the  defendant  who  wrote  the  text 
message sent on Peter Bick’s phone, probably after his death, expressing interest in meeting 
 
up  with  a  15  year  old  for  sexual  activity.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Defendant  practised  that 
 
deception to try and give some substance to his accusation that Peter Bick was a paedophile. I 
also reject the Defendant’s account that immediately prior to the killing, Peter Bick had the 
 
Defendant around the throat and had tried to get hold of a hammer which was conveniently 
just within his reach. Those parts of the Defendant’s account were not given at an early stage 
 
but  were  added  later  and  are  inventions.  I  reject  the  Defence  submission  that  there  was  in 
this case some provocation but not sufficient to reduce the offence to manslaughter. 
 
 
While I acknowledge that the Defendant’s life experiences have played their part in shaping 
 
the man he has become, the evidence that I have heard has driven me to the conclusion that 
the  Defendant  is  now  an  extremely  dangerous  man  who  may  well    kill  again  were  he  to  be 
 
released  in  the  foreseeable  future.  The  Parole  Board  will  undoubtedly  take  all  that  into 
account  when  deciding  when,  and  if,  this  Defendant  should  ever  be  released.  I  ignore  the 
 
danger that the Defendant presents in fixing the minimum term that he should serve before 
he  is  released.  The  minimum  term  is  what  I  assess  to  be  the  appropriate  term  that  the 
Defendant should   serve to reflect his culpability for the killing of Peter Bick, not the danger 
 
that  he  presents  to  the  public.  As  the  sentence  I  will  pass  is  life  imprisonment,  the  danger 
 
that  he  presents  to  the  public  is  reflected  in  that  and  the  requirement  that  he  cannot  be 
 
released  until  he  is  no  longer  a  danger.  The  minimum  period  is  exactly  what  it  says,  a 
minimum. The time may never come when this Defendant is considered safe to be released.   
  
 
Parliament has laid down starting points that I must adopt in deciding the minimum term. It 
is  agreed  in  this  case  that  it  is  not  a  case  to  which  the  whole  life  minimum  applies.  The 
 
prosecution point to some parts of the evidence which they say may mean that this is a case of 
higher  culpability  so  that  a  starting  point  of  30  years  applies.  I  have  considered  each  with 
 
care  but  I  am  not  satisfied  so  that  I  am  sure  that  any  of  them  applies  in  this  case.  I  will  
  then  have  to  consider  the  aggravating  and 
therefore  take  a  starting  point  of  15  years.  I 
mitigating features of the case to decide whether to increase or decrease the starting point.  
 
 
I  have  no  doubt  that  the  starting  point  has  to  be  increased.  As  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  
 
pointed out on a number of occasions, Parliament could not anticipate in Schedule 21 of the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003 every possible factual scenario which could affect culpability. The

--------
principle  aggravating  factors  in  this  case  are  the  planning;  the  cold  blooded  nature  of  the 
 
killing; the fact that it took place within Peter Bick’s own home; the treatment of Peter Bick 
 
by  the  Defendant  both  before  and  after  the  death  and  the  fact  that  this  was  all  part  of  a  
 
campaign to track down paedophiles, although, as I say, I do not believe it was on the sort of 
 
scale  that  the  Defendant  claims.  Those  matters  substantially  increase  the  starting  point  to 
one of about 21 years. 
 
The mitigating features to be found in the facts of the case are limited but he did admit to the 
police within 24 hours that he had killed Peter Bick. 
 
I do consider that the circumstances of his previous abuse and the prison sentence which he 
served for an offence of which he was ultimately acquitted are relevant mitigating features.  I 
 
do  not  give  him  credit  in  this  sentence  for  the  years  he  should  not  have  served  in  prison  
 
following  his  first  conviction.  That  does  not  seem  to  me  to  be  a  proper  consideration  in 
 
determining this sentence. What I am seeking to reflect is that the Defendant’s culpability is 
reduced for this offence because of the part that the abuse and the imprisonment have played 
in making him a killer.  
 
Calculating  the  amount  of  the  appropriate  reduction  is  not  easy  and  has  to  depend  on  my 
 
assessment  of  the  contribution  that  those  life  experiences  made  and  the  balancing  of  a 
 
number of different factors. That involves a careful consideration  and  assessment  by me of 
 
the  evidence  that  I  have  heard.  I  will  reduce  my  original  starting  point  to  reflect  all  the 
 
mitigating  factors.  In  my  judgement  the  appropriate  minimum  period  that  the  Defendant 
must serve before he is eligible to be considered for parole is 18 years.

Sentencing Remarks* of Mr Justice Fulford 

 

Chelmsford Crown Court 

 

11 May 2012 

 
 

 
 
In the early hours of 6 June 2011, David Oakes took the lives of Christine and Shania 
Chambers. Their tragic and needless deaths occurred in deeply shocking circumstances. A 
bullying and controlling man who had frequently inflicted serious violence on Christine 
Chambers during the course of their 5 or 6 year relationship, killed his partner and young 
daughter simply because he was unable to accept that Ms Chambers could no longer bear 
to be with him and wanted to start a new life.  Ms Chambers had, for her part, made it clear 
that she wished to treat the defendant generously. She recognised that he was important to 
Shania and that contact between father and daughter ought to continue. She agreed, 
without any apparent hesitation, arrangements that would have enabled Shania to spend 
three weekends out of four with the accused and generally, notwithstanding their past rows 
and the accused's attacks on her, she behaved in a mature and civilised way, putting 
Shania's interests before anything else. In my judgment she carries not a shred of blame 
for what happened that night. 
 
The reaction of the defendant was the exact opposite. When it became clear to David Oakes 
that the relationship was at an end and the family court was likely in the very near future to 
make an order for  Shania's future care that would make explicit that their separation was 
final, his reaction was purely selfish, self pitying and grotesquely violent. Instead of 
thinking about his daughter whom he has claimed to love, he concentrated on himself 
alone and most particularly his desire for revenge and his determination, that he had 
expressed quite clearly on more than one occasion in the past, that no other man was going 
to be Christine's partner or was going  act as Shania's father. He resolved that if the family 
was at an end, then they would pay for leaving him with their lives. And worse still, he 
decided that their last hours of life would be terrifying, and in the case of Christine 
Chambers, extremely painful. 
 
He planned their deaths in elaborate detail. He decided to kill them on the night before a 
potentially crucial court hearing, and he collected together a set of implements, the sole 
purpose of which was to torture Christine Chambers and then to kill her and their 
daughter.  He took with him a 12 bore shotgun and many cartridges; a variety of very 
sharp bladed implements; an axe; a length of wire threaded through rubber tubing that 
was undoubtedly to be used as a garrotte; heavy-duty pliers to pull off parts of Ms
--------
Chambers body (indeed that threat was made to [other daughter] as well, as she heard) 
and petrol to burn the house down with Christine, [other daughter] and Shania inside. 
Whether the drill which he used on his own head was originally intended for Ms Chambers 
we shall probably never know. 
 
And he remorselessly carried out his plan. As [other daughter] described with such clarity, 
he made her mother beg and express her love for him whilst simultaneously inflicting cruel 
and substantial injuries. He hit her head not only with his fist but also with the gun and 
either the axe or a meat cleaver, which cut into her skull. He forced her to take her upper 
clothes off and he then used a very sharp implement to disfigure her torso. He told the jury 
that he never allows alcohol to get the better of him, and so it was that night. As Dr Cary 
said, the cuts to the deceased were inflicted with a clear degree of control. Drink and drugs 
may well have played their part, but this defendant knew exactly what he was doing, 
particularly having  clearly prepared and planned these deaths for a not-insignificant 
period in advance. 
 
Two final aspects of this terrible history need emphasising. First it is apparent that before 
she died, Christine Chambers would have been in agony. The injury to her head and the 
shotgun wound to her knee would have been excruciatingly painful. I am certain that 
Oakes delayed delivering the fatal gunshot wound as an act of deliberate sadism. She had 
made him suffer by ending the relationship as he told [other daughter] and this was his 
revenge. 
 
Second, as I have already observed, he has claimed repeatedly that he loved his daughter 
and that he is a victim. However, the evidence has critically revealed that [other daughter] 
left Shania in her cot, and from the police evidence it is clear she secured the gate to 
Shania's room before she, that is [other daughter], escaped. Yet when Shania's body was 
found she was on the landing side of the closed gate. The undoubted inference to be drawn 
is that Shania was awake; the defendant had brought her out of her room; and as a result 
she would have been able to see her gravely injured mother and she would have witnessed 
some of these dreadful events. Throughout she would have been aware of her mother's 
cries and tears. In my judgment the defendant allowed his daughter to see at least part of 
what he was doing and she would have seen the appalling injuries to her mother. The next 
door neighbour heard Shania crying for a least 5 minutes after Christine Chambers had 
been shot. That little girl must have been terrified. He then put the barrel of the 12 bore 
shot gun against her head and pulled the trigger. No civilised, decent human being could 
ever describe that as being the result of love. 
 
As I said at the outset, this defendant killed two people in truly shocking circumstances. 
There is not a shred of mitigation. 
 
Given the nature of these crimes, the result is inevitable. I have applied the provisions set 
out in Schedule 21, paragraph 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The seriousness of this 
case is exceptionally high for the reasons I have outlined. The sentence on each count is 
that of life imprisonment and given the deaths of Christine and Shania Chambers were 
planned well in advance and they were executed with a significant degree of sadism, 
particularly as regards Christine Chambers but also in the case of her daughter given the 
fear that child must have experienced before her death, these will be whole life terms. The 
defendant will never be released from prison.  
 
I want to say a word about [other daughter]. As it seems to me she is a truly remarkable 
child who acted with great courage during these terrible events, particularly when she tried 
 
to stand up to David Oakes whilst he was attacking her mother. She showed considerable
--------
presence of mind in how she dealt with her sister (putting her to bed and changing her 
bloodstained clothes) and later when she obeyed her mother’s instructions to escape and to 
raise the alarm. Her accounts throughout have been clear and consistent, and her 
measured and cooperative approach during this trial has been of considerable assistance to 
the court. I would be grateful if the officer in the case would pass on these remarks to her.  
 
Finally Jean and Kenneth Chambers. I have read the statement from Jean Chambers as to 
the effect this has had on them and their family, and the sadness it has caused. All I need 
 
say is that they have acted with exemplary dignity throughout this trial and it will come as 
a surprise to no one that the consequences of David Oakes’ actions on 5/6 June extend far 
beyond the two lives that he took.

R -V- ALI KOC 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE CALVERT-SMITH 
 

18 MAY 2012 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Between the 5th and the 31st January 2011 there was a series of 7 attacks on men 
carried out in broad daylight in parks in North London from Alexandra Palace Park 
in the west to Downhills Park in the East. The attacks were vicious, random and 
without any motive other than, in the words of one of the victims, “the infliction of 
violence for violence sake”. The series of attacks, its perpetrator and the victims well 
illustrate the diverse nature of London’s population and the best and the worst of its 
citizens. 
 
 
You, Ali Koc, have been convicted, on what was overwhelming evidence, of 
 
responsibility for these attacks. You are a 30 year old inhabitant of this area of 
London and have lived with your parents at the same address in Hornsey since 1996. 
You have lived on a combination of state benefits and your parents’ generosity since 
then. You enjoy watching violent films and you have been convicted in the past of 
offences involving violence. Your days for some time had been passed either sitting at 
home watching films or listening to music, wandering the streets, and betting in local 
bookmakers apart from the days when you needed to visit either or both of the local 
Job Centre to maintain your entitlement to Job Seekers’ Allowance or the Post Office 
in Hornsey to draw your fortnightly benefit from your account. According to your 
parents, who were not called to give evidence for understandable reasons, your 
behaviour had been difficult for years – in contrast to your siblings who have grown 
up and left home and are leading responsible and productive lives. In particular – as 
is borne out by your record but was not revealed to the jury - you have abused drugs 
for many years. 
 
In September 2010 you confronted a young man, Alex Law, in an alleyway near 
 
Queens Wood in Highgate a short walk from your home and abused him, using a 
term of abuse you were later to use to one of your victims. This young man then took 
notice of you each time he saw you subsequently, both in Queens Wood, Alexandra 
 
Palace Park and, on one occasion in the Job Centre in Wood Green. You always had 
the same hostile expression, the thousand yard stare as he described it. On the 
evening of the defendant’s arrest he compiled a photofit and the following day he was 
the first person to identify Ali Koc at a video identification procedure. The public 
 
owes him a debt of gratitude for his powers of observation and his immediate offer of 
assistance when he heard of the last of the 7 attacks.
--------
In December you attended your GP’s surgery with an injury to your hand which you 
said you had got in a fight. Your antagonist on that occasion has never been 
identified. 
 
On the 22nd of December 2010 your benefit was stopped for some reason and 
payment did not resume until after the last of these attacks. Although you clearly 
 
have a fondness for fighting and violence generally I am certain that that fondness 
was increased by your anger at being temporarily unable to spend as much money as 
you had in the past, even though your mother would help you out if you asked for 
money. Over the next few weeks you were frequently on the telephone to the DWP, 
and often visited the Post Office trying to withdraw cash from your account without 
  
success. 
 
On the 5th of January 2011 Mr Parsons a 67 year old pensioner living on his own, set 
off in the morning for a walk from his home to Alexandra Palace Park some 2 miles 
 
away.  According to his sister his principal hobbies were walking and enjoying nature 
 
and visiting the Labour Club in Wood Green where he would promulgate his left wing 
views to like-minded people. By 10.00 a.m. he had been viciously attacked in a 
secluded and wooded area of the park and left for dead, until his discovery by a 
public-spirited grandmother who was out walking her 14 month old grandchild. She 
at once, with the assistance of another helpful passer by, rang 999 and the victim, 
 
then semi-conscious, was taken to hospital, His jaw, in 2 places, and his eye socket, 
had been fractured by the force of the blow or blows which had rendered him 
unconscious. The weapon used was very likely a piece of wood which was found near 
his body and which had a small quantity of blood attributable to the victim on it. The 
blow or blows had been forceful blows clearly aimed at the head by a blunt 
instrument whether that piece of wood or some other similar weapon. Mr Parsons 
never regained consciousness and on 2nd February doctors decided that he should 
 
only receive palliative care from then until his inevitable death on 25th February. 
Mrs Westmoreland, his sister, has described in a recent statement the effect upon her 
 
and her family of the news, of the days beside her brother’s bed when she nursed 
some hope of at least partial recovery, and of the 3 weeks between the news that he 
 
would not recover and his actual death.  
 
On the 17th January his temper got the better of him and Ali Koc used highly offensive 
 
language on the telephone to the DWP calling the person who answered a “nigger” or 
“fucking nigger” no less than 5 times. 
  
 
On Friday 21st January Mr Holding, a 30 year old IT worker, was, unusually, working 
at home. During his lunch hour he took his two dogs out for a walk in Alexandra 
Park. Ali Koc saw him and shouted at him to “wait there”. Mr Holding thought that 
 
he might want, as some passers by do, to ask him about his dogs which are of a 
 
slightly unusual breed. As soon as Ali Koc came near him, and without another word, 
 
he head-butted Mr Holding, knocked him to the floor, and proceeded to punch him 
while he was on the ground. Mr Holding managed to escape, get to his feet, and run 
 
uphill to a more open part of the park where he met a member of the public. In order 
to distract the defendant he had thrown his mobile phone away. Koc picked it up and 
took off with what witnesses were to describe in other cases as a brisk, swaggering 
 
walk. 
 
Next day Saturday 22nd January Victor Aguilera a 38 year old Spanish scientist living 
in London, went jogging in the same park. He had his earphones on and was listening 
to music. Not far from the place where Mr Holding had been attacked he became 
 
aware of a man coming towards him. The next he knew he had received a heavy blow 
– almost certainly a head butt - from Ali Koc. This knocked him to the ground. Ali
--------
Koc then attacked him viciously with both kicks and punches while he lay on the 
ground. The victim was terrified, since the violence seemed to be violence for no 
purpose other than to inflict violence. He was able to escape and get to his feet and he 
ran away. Ali Koc followed him, and knocked him to the ground again. On this 
occasion his I-phone came out of his hand and was taken by Koc. Mr Aguilera got up 
again and ran away, covered in mud, in the other direction. Ali Koc meanwhile 
walked off in the same brisk way and was seen by a Mr Bush who had just walked into 
the park with his wife and their dog at this time. Both Mr Aguilera and Mr Bush 
identified Ali Koc at video identification parades following the arrest of Ali Koc. 
 
Next Sunday 23rd January Rashid Meizongo, a 35 year old construction worker, went 
jogging in Priory Park, the entrance to which is across the road from the end of the 
 
road in which Ali Koc lived. He had done a number of circuits of the park and as he 
was running through a wooded area for the last time he was confronted by Ali Koc 
 
who barred his path. Koc had a can of Fosters lager in his hand. Mr Meizongo moved 
to the edge of the path to pass him and Koc said as he ran by “Hey you nigger where 
do you think you’re going. Come back here you pussy.” Understandably enough Mr 
 
Meizongo’s reaction was to stick his middle finger up at him and run on. He ran to an 
open area of the park where he finished his run in case Koc followed him and wanted 
to continue his abuse. When he got there Ali Koc approached him, took off his jacket, 
put his fists up and attacked him. Mr Meizongo punched him back. When Koc 
realised he might not win the fight he picked up a piece of wood and struck Mr 
Meizongo with it. It broke and he went to the undergrowth to look for another. Mr 
Meizongo took the opportunity to make his escape. A month later Mr Meizongo too 
identified Ali Koc as his attacker. 
 
On either 24th or 26th January Mrs Thompson who lives close to Queens Wood in 
Highgate was walking her dog there when she saw a man standing in the 
undergrowth glaring at her. Although she failed to identify Koc at a parade later the 
way in which this man behaved was typical of the behaviour described by Mr Law. 
 
On Friday 28th January Mr Carey a 63 year old solicitor, and another local dog owner, 
 
was walking one of his dogs in Queens Wood. He was confronted by Ali Koc whom he 
 
had first seen standing in the undergrowth and off the well worn or paved paths 
which criss-cross the wood. Koc picked a piece of wood one or two feet long and 
attacked Mr Carey, first to the legs and later higher up his body before giving up 
when he realised that Mr Carey was not going to collapse in the face of his attack. Koc 
 
shouted “Fuck off” to him and made quickly for an exit from the park which would 
have taken him further away from his home. Mr Carey later picked Koc out at an 
identification parade. 
 
On Saturday 29th January Mr Chinhirun, a 52 year old originally from Thailand living 
 
and working in London, was returning from an art class he attended at a local college. 
His route took him through Downhills Park. He was walking through an open area of 
 
the park but like Messrs Aguilera and Holding he became aware of a man in front of 
him. It was Ali Koc. He said – completely without justification - “You are following 
 
me”. Then without warning Ali Koc punched him in the face. Mr Chinhirun fell over 
 
and Koc proceeded to kick or punch him – he could not say which – several times 
before walking away fast.  
 
All 5 of the victims suffered injuries – cuts, abrasions, bruises – although fortunately 
none of them was seriously hurt.  
 
On Monday 31st January after breakfast Keith Needell an 84 year old retired quantity 
 
surveyor set off from home to go the Family Records Office in Islington. Although 84
--------
Mr Needell was extremely active both physically – he can be seen on the CCTV 
 
footage taken on the day of his death walking at a good speed - but mentally, 
interesting himself in family history, doing part time work in a London museum 
 
restoring old bookbindings, and active in their local church in Highgate. By 1.30 or 
just after he had reached Highgate Underground station after a morning’s work at the 
Records office and he was captured on CCTV leaving the station to go into Queens 
Wood on his way home. His route would have taken him through the wood and out 
into Wood Vale the other end. Tragically he never got home. He was confronted by 
Ali Koc, whom another witness had seen waving a stick about in a strange way earlier. 
Koc attacked him savagely with a piece of wood, which broke into 3 pieces in the 
course of the attack. The attack left Mr Needell unconscious and with many 
comminuted fractures to his cheekbones. Koc – just as he had with Mr Parsons – left 
 
him for dead. He was found minutes later by a cyclist who stopped to see whether the 
man on the ground was asleep or ill. Others arrived and the ambulance was 
summoned. Mr Needell was taken to hospital. Like Mr Parsons he never recovered. 
 
As the statements read to the court made clear both Mrs Needell, his wife of 57 years, 
 
and their son have been devastated by the cruel loss of their husband and father and 
by the added torture of more than 6 months of waiting and hoping that he might 
recover. 
  
That morning Ali Koc had telephoned the DWP constantly from before 9.30 in the 
morning until 1.15 pm. On two of those occasions he had called his respondent a 
“nigger” amongst other abuse. The calls had been interspersed with 999 calls to 
complain about the service he was getting from the DWP. In one of those 999 calls he 
was so abusive that the operator reported him to the police. The police  traced his call 
and visited him at home only an hour or so after he had attacked Mr Needell. Soon 
after a call 1.15 he must have left home and gone straight to Queens Wood. At 1.26 the 
   
DWP called his home and there was no reply. 
 
From the descriptions given to the police by Messrs Law and Carey – and of the man 
acting strangely on 31st January, police officers saw Ali Koc walking near Alexandra 
Palace Park and arrested him. He was interviewed over the next 3 days and denied all 
the offences, admitting only that he had been in a fight – but in self defence – with 
one of the complainants. Over the next week and months the identifications to which 
I have referred were made and diligent scientific work revealed that in two cases in 
which there was no identification there was compelling scientific evidence to connect 
him to the attack on Mr Chinhiru and the murder of Mr Needell. DNA and or blood 
which could only have come from Messrs Chinhirun and Needell was found on his 
right trainer and Mr Needell’s blood on his jeans. Shortly before trial examination of 
wood left at the scene which he had used to attack Mr Needell was found to contain 
fibres which had come from his gloves. 
 
Although there was and remains no evidence to connect Ali Koc directly with the 
killing of Mr Parsons the similarities between this attack and the others clearly 
convinced the jury that this series of attacks was the work of the same man. 
 
I therefore have to sentence Ali Koc in respect of 2 offences of murder and 5 of 
 
attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. 
 
The offence of murder carries a mandatory life sentence. 
 
When a defendant has been convicted of two murders and – as in this case - with 
other associated offences - the court must past a single minimum term to reflect the 
fact of the second conviction and the associated offences. Thus the seriousness of the
--------
offending as whole is to be reflected in a single sentence which sets the minimum 
term to be served before release can be considered. 
 
The starting point for each murder would be 15 years. 
 
The murder of Keith Needell and the other cases have the following aggravating 
features. 

 

 

 
1.	  Keith Needell was an elderly and vulnerable victim. 2 of the other victims, 

 

including of course Mr Parsons, were in their sixties.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.	  The attack on him – and on all the others involved a significant degree of 

premeditation. Ali Koc clearly went out on the days in question looking for 
victims. 

3.	  The commission of so many offences within such a short period and in such a 
small area was likely at least to cause widespread fear and anxiety beyond the 
immediate circle of victim and family. 

4.	  The offences were all committed in public places set aside for people of all 

 

ages to enjoy themselves. I accept the Crown’s submissions that this too 
amounts to an aggravating feature of the case. 

 

5.	  The defendant is a man of bad character with 18 convictions in all, 5 for 

burglary or attempted burglary, 3 for assaults, one for obstruction of police, 
one for possession of a craft knife and a large number for possession of 
  
cannabis. On 5 occasions he has served short custodial sentences. 

6.	  The attack on Mr Meizongo was racially aggravated and by s 145 of the 
 

 
Criminal Justice Act 2003 the sentence should be increased to reflect that 
fact. 

 

 

 

 
Although it is likely – in particular in the case of Mr Needell - that you intended to 
kill the two of your victims who died, I will sentence you on the basis that that was 
not a settled intention, although leaving elderly men lying on the ground unconscious 
having inflicted the injuries you did to them was in the highest degree reckless.  
 
This was a brutal campaign of violence carried out for the sake of showing that you 
could intimidate and hurt other human beings.  
 
There is no other mitigation within the offences themselves. There is none in your 
 
conduct of the trial. Even when, albeit late in the day, evidence became available that 
you had held the piece of wood used to kill Keith Needell you declined to avail 
yourself of the mitigation of a guilty plea. So far as personal mitigation too there is 
 
none. Members of your family believe that it was what amounts to an addiction to 
cannabis which started you on the wrong track. That, as they effectively concede, 
amounts to no mitigation either.  
 
In the case of Malasi 2009 1 Cr App R (S) 51 the Court of Appeal commended the trial 
judge’s decision to indicate what the individual sentences would have been before the 
application of the principle of totality.  
 
In my judgment the murder of Keith Parsons, had it stood alone, would have merited 
a minimum term of 15 years. The murder of Keith Needell would have merited a 
minimum term of 20 years. The series of unprovoked assaults on 5 strangers which 
carry the same aggravating features and the same lack of any mitigation beyond that 
which is integral to the offences such as the comparative lack of serious injury in each 
case would have merited sentences, had they stood alone and after taking account of 
the principle of totality, of 12 years imprisonment in total made up as follows: 
27 months on both Counts 2 and 6,  
30 months on count 4 (6 months of which to reflect the racial aggravation) and
--------
30 months on both counts 3 and 5 to reflect the vicious nature of the assault in Count 
3 and the use of the weapon in Count 5 making  
12 years imprisonment.  
That series of offences on its own would likely have merited an indeterminate 
sentence under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 with a minimum tern to be served of 6 
years. Having regard to the principle of totality I will reduce what would therefore 
have been a minimum term of 42 years months to one of 35 years.  
 
Accordingly on counts 1 and 7 I sentence you to life imprisonment and I fix the 
 
minimum term to be served before your release may be considered at 35 years less 
468 days spent on remand awaiting trial thus 33 years 262 days. In respect of counts 
2-6 I pass sentences of 27 months imprisonment on counts 2 and 6, 30 months on 
Count 4 and 30 months on counts 3 and 5. These sentences are to run consecutively

SENTENCING REMARKS* OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE GERALD CLIFTON 

 

9 MAY 2012 

 

 
You have all been convicted by the jury after a long and careful trial of very grave 
sexual offences which were committed between the springs of 2008 and 2010. They 
involved the grooming and sexual exploitation of several girls aged in their early 
teens. In some cases those girls were raped callously, viciously and violently. In some 
cases they were driven round Rochdale and Oldham to be made to have sex with 
paying customers. Most of you were many years older than they were. They were 
going through a period in their lives full of difficulty and misery. One had left her 
parent’s home and another had been in care for many years. You attracted them to 
your company by flattery, free food and alcohol. Some of you acted as you did to 
satiate your lust, some to make money out of them. All of you treated them as though 
they were worthless and beyond all respect. I believe that one of the factors that led 
to that was that they were not of your community or religion. Indeed [A], said in the 
course of the trial that he did not wish to be seen with young white girls in his 
community in Oldham. Some of you raised in the trial the suggestion that this 
prosecution was triggered by racial factors. That is so much nonsense. As I have said, 
what triggered this prosecution was your lust and greed. I wish to emphasize that the 
sentences I am about to pass on you all are sentences which would apply to all 
defendants be they white or Asian. I say that partly because it is the only proper way 
to approach sentence and partly because I am obliged to and do observe the 
 
guidelines set out by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, now The Sentencing 
Council. In relation to that, where one of you has been convicted of both trafficking a 
single girl and conspiracy to engage in penetrative sex with more than one girl, I 
intend to pass concurrent sentences but have increased the sentences in accordance 
with the latest guidelines on totality from the Sentencing Council. 
 
I will now deal with you individually according to the counts of the indictment upon 
which the jury have convicted you. 
 
 
[A]
--------
You raped a young girl of 15 on several occasions and gave her to a young man that 
you referred to as your nephew to be raped by him. You deliberately got her very 
drunk and then overcame what defence she put up by violence and blackmail. Having 
seen the way in which you have treated this court I can quite well understand the fear 
that she must have felt. You are an unpleasant and hypocritical bully. You tried to 
embark on the same course with another 15 year old girl but she firmly put you in 
your place. The sentence on the rape counts reflects the total of your criminality and 
the principle of totality. Your total sentence is 19 years on the counts of rape, 8 years 
on the trafficking, 8 years on the conspiracy and 6 months on the sexual assault, all 
to be concurrent. 
 
 
Kabeer Hassan 
 
 
You though young and of previous good character have been convicted of the grave 
offence of rape. You had already for a short period been involved in the conspiracy by 
grooming potential victims. You must have known that this 15 year old girl was not 
consenting to sex forced upon her by [A’s] orders. You took no pity on her. When 
interviewed, you slyly tried to avoid the significance of any scientific evidence that 
might be found against you. I reduce your sentence for rape by one year on the basis 
of your being under the influence of [A] but this was a rape by more than one 
offender acting together for which the starting point is 10 years. The sentence is 9 
years for rape and 3 years concurrent for conspiracy. The SOA notification regime 
will apply to you for an indefinite period. I direct that the period of 6 days spent in 
custody on remand shall count towards you sentence. 
 
Abdul Aziz 
 
 
I have to sentence you for conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child by 
 
penetrative sex and trafficking for sexual exploitation a 15 year old girl. You are an 
intelligent man, referred to by some of your co-accused as The Master. You took over 
from [A] and ran this operation with [X]. You took the victim who was so many years 
younger than you to the Jephey St. flat. You knew that she had been or was to be 
plied with weed and vodka. You then coerced her into sex with men. You took her 
there several times a week for a period of 3 months. You also took her twice to a flat 
in Falinge and to Ashworth Valley. You received payment from these men. You made 
her have anal sex when she was menstruating. I accept that you did not have sexual 
intercourse with her yourself. Society finds this sort of behaviour repugnant. In my 
view, having watched you carefully during this trial I am satisfied that the degree of 
coercion you used towards her was real and severe and that this constitutes an 
additional aggravating factor. As far as the conspiracy count is involved, you were 
aware that a large number of men were involved and several girls. The sentence on 
you despite your previous good character must be severe. On the count of trafficking 
you will go to prison for 9 years. On the count of conspiracy 9 years concurrent. The 
SOA notification regime will apply to you for an indefinite period. I direct that the 
period of 336 days that you have spent in custody on remand shall count towards 
your sentence. 
 
 
Abdul Rauf
--------
You have to be sentenced for trafficking a 15 year old girl and conspiracy. The 
trafficking varied between your driving her to a lonely area near Heywood and having 
sex with her in your taxi and driving her to a flat in Rochdale where you and others 
had sex with her. This happened from 10 to 20 times .The image you gave during this 
trial was of a deeply hypocritical individual. I accept that you have health issues. On 
the count of trafficking you will go to prison for 6 years and on the count of 
conspiracy for 6 years concurrent. The SOA notification regime will apply to you for 
an indefinite period. I direct that the 179 days that you are entitled to shall count 
towards your sentence. 
 
Mohammed Sajid 
 
 
You fall to be sentenced on one count of rape, two of conspiracy, one of penetrative 
sexual activity with a girl aged as young as 13 or 14 years, and trafficking a girl of 15. 
The rape took place when this girl was very drunk on vodka and other drinks. She 
had been asleep. You knew that she did not consent but carried on regardless. You 
ejaculated over her. The starting point for such a rape is 8 years but there are two 
additional aggravating factors that I have just mentioned. I also bear in mind your 
criminality on the other counts when reaching a sentence for all your offending 
which is proportionate and fair in totality. On the count of rape you will go to prison 
for 12 years, on each conspiracy and the count of sexual activity for 6 years 
concurrent. On the trafficking count which falls towards the lower end of the range, 
there will be a concurrent one year sentence. The SOA notification regime will apply 
to you for an indefinite period.  I direct that the period of 165 days that you have 
spent on remand in custody shall count towards sentence. 
 
Adil Khan 
 
 
You fall to be sentenced for two offences of conspiracy and trafficking a 15 year old 
girl. During the course of this case the jury heard that you in your forties had formed 
a relationship with a 15 year old girl from which she became pregnant. Until you were 
forced to do so by scientific proof, you refused to admit that relationship.  Having 
met another 15 year old at one address you trafficked her to another where she had 
sex with you and another about 4 times. When she remonstrated with you about 
what you were ordering her to do, you used violence towards her. You too are an 
intelligent man and also in my view a hypocrite. On the trafficking count you will go 
to prison for 8 years with 8 years concurrent on the conspiracy count. The SOA 
notification regime will apply to you for an indefinite period. I direct that the period 
of 336 days that you have spent in custody on remand shall count towards your 
sentence. 
 
 
Mohammed Amin 
 
You have to be sentenced for conspiracy and sexual assault. Your participation in the 
conspiracy was not as persistent as that of others but remains serious. You were 
prepared to have sex with clearly under age girls. The sexual assault on the 15 year 
old in your taxi was towards the lower end of the scale and not persisted in. On the 
conspiracy count you will go to prison for 5 years with I year concurrent on the 
sexual assault count. The SOA notification regime will apply to you for an indefinite 
period. I direct that the period of 179 days that you have spent on remand in custody 
shall count towards your sentence.
--------
Abdul Qayyum 
 
 
You have been convicted on the count of conspiracy only. You at the age of 40 had 
sex with two underage girls, one on only one occasion. You used at least two 
addresses. The sentence on you is that you go to prison for 5 years. The SOA 
notification regime will apply to you for an indefinite period. The period of 6 days 
that you have spent on remand in custody shall count towards sentence. 
 
Hamid Safi 
 
 
You have been convicted of Conspiracy and Trafficking. The trafficking count falls 
toward the lower end of the scale of such offences. As for the conspiracy, I accept that 
you were involved for a period as short as 3 weeks. In the light of the jury’s verdicts 
on the counts of rape it is difficult to pin point your exact role. I believe that you were 
there to attract young girls because of your own youth and to give a veneer of 
respectability to an otherwise suspicious set up. You have no right to be in this 
country and I hope that you will be forced to leave it at the conclusion of your 
sentence. The sentence on you for the conspiracy count is one of 4 years 
imprisonment with one year concurrent for the trafficking count. The SOA 
notification regime will apply to you for an indefinite period. The period of 291 days 
that you spent on remand in custody I direct shall count towards your sentence. 
 
In the case of every defendant I make a Disqualification Order under s28 
of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 which disqualifies 
you from working with children forever in the future. You are to be 
included in the barred list.

Lord Justice Pitchford : 
 

 

This  is  an  application  made  under  section  36  Criminal  Justice  Act  1988  by  HM 
 
Attorney General for leave to refer sentences of 40 months imprisonment imposed for 
offences of rape of a child contrary to section 5 Sexual Offences Act 2003. We grant 
 
leave. 

Introduction 
 

The offenders, Roshane Channer and Ruben Monteiro, are both aged 21 years. At the 
date  when  their  offences  were  committed,  11  July  2011,  they  were  aged  20  years. 
 
They were each charged in separate indictments with the rape of the same child under 
the  age  of  13  years  on  the  same  occasion,  Channer  by  penetration  of  the  child’s 
vagina  with  his  penis  and  Monteiro  by  penetration  of  her  mouth  with  his  penis. 
Channer pleaded guilty to the indictment on 30 August 2011 before HHJ Farrell QC 
at  Luton  Crown  Court.  Monteiro  pleaded  guilty  before  the  same  judge  at  the  same 
 
court on 18 October 2011. On 10 February 2012 the offenders were each sentenced to 
a term of 40 months imprisonment. This was a technical inaccuracy. The sentences 
 
should  have  been  expressed  as  detention  in  a  Young  Offender  Institution.  In 
 
Channer’s  case  178  days,  and  in  Monteiro’s  case  130  days,  were  ordered  to  count 
 
towards  sentence  for  the  purposes  of  section  240  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003.  In 
addition, the judge imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order in each case. 

The  sentencing  task  which  arose  for  the  judge  was  the  proper  assessment  of  the 
 
seriousness  of  the  offences.  As  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  guideline  on 
offences contrary to the Sexual Offences Act 2003 explains, at page 5, paragraph 1.2, 
the seriousness of the offence is to be determined by reference to two main factors, 
the culpability of the offender and the harm either caused or risked by the offence, 
including the impact on the victim. Where there is an imbalance between culpability 
and harm, the culpability of the offender in the particular circumstances of the case 
should be the primary factor in determining the seriousness of the offence. Since these 
were sexual offences committed against a child under the age of 13 years the levels of 
both harm and culpability are inevitably high. 

 

The victim was aged 11 years at the time of the offences. The offenders maintained 
that they thought she was much older. Furthermore, they were charged with the rape 
of  a  child  who  could  not  in  law  consent  to  sexual  intercourse,  but  the  offenders 
 
asserted  that  she  was  a  “willing  participant”.  The  impact  of  these  issues  in  the 
assessment of the seriousness of a section 5 offence has previously been considered 
by  this  court  in  Attorney  General’s  References  numbers  74  and  83  of  2007  (Keith 
 
Fenn and Simon Foster) [2007] EWCA Crim 2550, [2008] 1 Cr AppR (S) 110, and it 
will be necessary to examine with some care the assistance then given.  

The offences 
 

The complainant lived at home with her mother and step-father. Her two older sisters 
 
had left home. The complainant had been close to her grandmother who died in 2009. 
Her  death  had  a  traumatic  effect  on  the  complainant.  According  to  her  mother  her 
behaviour deteriorated. She self-harmed. Background information suggests that there 
 
was indifferent parental supervision. The complainant took to staying out late at night, 
a practice which placed her at risk. In November 2010 she was, she alleged, raped by

a man in a house when similar activity was taking place between two other men and 
two other girls who were relatives of the complainant. More recently, the complainant 
 
said, she had been subjected to rape by four males in an alleyway. On the night of 11 
July  2011  the  complainant  was  out  late  while  her  mother  was  working.  She  lost 
contact  with  her  female  friend  and  found  herself  alone  in  Luton  town  centre.  The 
judge was informed that the complainant had consumed drugs and/or alcohol earlier 
in the evening. She was approached by a 16 year old boy who was well known to the 
 
complainant’s  family.  He  was  the  son  of  her  mother’s  best  friend.  The  boy  at  first 
threatened to tell her mother that she had been with men and then told her that she 
should go with him to do something for him. Without knowing what it was that he 
 
wanted  of  her  the  complainant  accompanied  him  to  the  Iceland  store.  Outside  the 
store she saw the two offenders. She was taken by all three males to the flats opposite 
and, once inside, up some stairs to a landing. In her ABE interview the complainant 
said  she  felt  uncomfortable  and  was  scared.  By  this  time,  present  with  the 
complainant  were  the  16  year  old,  another  young  male  of  similar  age,  and  the  two 
offenders. 

The complainant said that neither of the offenders spoke much. Her top was removed 
and her trousers were pulled down. Channer stood behind her, bent her at the hip and 
penetrated her vagina from the rear. He told her that he was going to use a condom 
but  the  complainant  could  not  tell  whether  he  did  or  not.  In  her  interview  the 
complainant said that she tried to stop it but he kept forcing her. Monteiro then joined 
 
in. He, in a sitting or semi-sitting position in front of the complainant, held her head 
 
and placed his penis in her mouth. He grasped her hair and by that means moved her 
 
mouth over his penis. She described feeling as though she was going to choke and 
vomit. At this time the complainant was aware that the 16 year old who had taken her 
 
to the offenders was filming the event on a mobile telephone.  

There  is  no  evidence  that  either  man  ejaculated.  When  the  act  was  over  the 
complainant was permitted to leave and she went home. In the morning her mother 
enquired what had happened the night before. The complainant told her that she had 
 
been out with friends. The incident came to light in this way -  the 16 year old sent the 
 
footage from his mobile phone to his step-sister. She downloaded the material to her 
mother’s computer. The complainant’s mother learned of the film doing the rounds 
and the police were informed. The footage was recovered from the computer and the 
step-sister’s  mobile  phone.  The  first  film  depicted  sexual  intercourse  between 
Channer  and  the  complainant.  The  second  depicted  both  men  penetrating  the 
complainant.  In  the  first  film  Channer  smiled  at  the  camera.  As  a  result  he  was 
 
arrested on 15 August. Later, Monteiro was identified from stills and he was arrested 
on  1  October.  Neither  man  made  any  comment  in  interview.  Monteiro’s  attitude 
 
appeared to be one of unconcern. The complainant’s account of sexual exploitation in 
and since November 2010 came to light. The 16 year old was not prosecuted for any 
offence. 

The complainant was medically examined on 15 July 2011. She was 5’4” in height 
and  weighed  89  kilograms,  almost  14  stones,  described  as  morbidly  obese.  She 
appeared  well  and  healthy  but  emotionally  subdued  and  upset.  She  complained  of 
tenderness over the supra-pubic area. Genital examination revealed disruption of the 
hymen which was, in general, consistent with the girl’s accounts of sexual activity.

She  was  suffering  a  sexually  transmitted  infection  but  it  pre-dated  the  current 
offences. 

The police investigation led to the involvement of Social Services. The complainant 
was removed from her maternal home and placed with foster parents with whom it 
appeared she was settled, happier and well behaved. 

 

The sentence hearings 

The case was first listed for sentence on 8 November 2011. The facts were opened by 
Ms Elliott for the prosecution. The judge was plainly familiar with the contents of the 
papers.  Counsel  referred  the  judge  to  the  guideline  for  rape  contrary  to  section  5 
involving children under the age of 13. The prosecution submitted that in the presence 
of  the  aggravating  feature  that  the  offences  were  committed  by  two  men  in  the 
presence of others (level 2), the recommended starting point was 13 years custody and 
the  range  11  –  17  years  custody  (Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  guideline  Sexual 
Offences  Act  2003,  page  25).  The  judge  was  referred  to  a  summary  of  the  court’s 
judgment in Fenn and Foster in Banks on Sentencing. 

Both offenders pleaded guilty on a written basis, namely that the complainant was “a 
 
willing participant”. The prosecution accepted that basis and endorsed the documents. 
At that stage the judge did not indicate whether he was prepared to accept their basis 
of plea and it became apparent to the judge that although there had been no written 
claim  by  the  offenders  as  to  their  belief  of  the  complainant’s  age,  there  was  a  live 
issue as to that belief. The police had interviewed the 16 year old boy who said that he 
told the offenders that she was “only 11”. The offenders were said to have responded 
that she must be aged 15 years at least. At the hearing counsel for the offenders were 
 
instructed that the offenders believed the complainant had been aged 16 years. The 
prosecution  was  not  in  a  position  on  that  day  to  prove  that  the  offenders  knew  the 
complainant’s true age. Counsel for Monteiro indicated that the offenders might well 
wish to give evidence in support of their assertion. The judge properly and sensibly 
adjourned  the  sentence  hearing  to  enable  a  Newton  hearing  to  take  place  and  the 
prosecution to prepare its evidence. 

The adjourned hearing was held on 10 February 2012. In the result the prosecution 
was unable to adduce any direct evidence of the conversation between the 16 year old 
and the offenders as to the age of the complainant. The judge indicated that, having 
seen the first recording of Channer’s activity, during which the complainant could be 
 
seen  apparently  smiling  at  the  camera,  he  would  sentence  on  the  basis  that  the 
complainant had been a “willing” participant. He had also viewed the ABE interview. 
 
His provisional judgement was that the offenders could reasonably have thought that 
the  complainant  was  aged  14  years  but  no  older.  The  judge  identified  three 
 
aggravating features of the offences: first, that there was more than one offender each 
committing an offence in the presence of the other, second, that they gave implicit 
approval to the filming of the incident by and in the presence of young males and, 
third, the offenders used the complainant for casual sex, not being concerned what her 
age actually was. The judge having given this indication, neither offender elected to 
give evidence. 

 
13.	 

The  judge  opened  his  sentencing  remarks  with  the  following  description  of  the 
 
offences:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

 

“Each of you has pleaded guilty to the single count on each of 
your separate indictments of rape of a child under the age of 13. 
The victim of these two rapes was a vulnerable 11 year old girl 
who had clearly been subjected to a period of systematic sexual 
 
exploitation. Each of you two willingly used this child for your 
own sexual gratification. It is made all the more abhorrent by 
your  casual  attitude  to  sexual  relationships.  You  see  it  purely 
from your own perspective, using another person, in this case a 
young  child,  without  a  care  for  the  consequences.  It  is 
aggravated even further in this particular case by the fact that it 
was a group act and that the event was videoed. I have had here 
evidence  in  relation  to  the  act  itself  and  have  had  to  see  the 
short video that was taken of you two raping this young girl. I 
have also watched part of the ABE … video in order to assess 
the  age  of  the  girl,  having  regard  to  submissions  which  were 
made  to  me  as  to  your  belief  in  her  age.  She  was  in  fact  11 
years of age at the material time. But, as I have already found 
in  this  instance  …  you  knew  or  reasonably  believed  that  she 
was about 14 years of age at the material time. It is conceded 
by  the  prosecution  that  despite  her  age  she  was  a  “willing” 
 
participant  in  this  act.  Notwithstanding  that,  this  particular 
provision  is  there  to  protect…young  girls  from  this  type  of 
behaviour and to protect them from themselves.” 

 
14.	 

 
15.	 

The judge went on to note the wide disparity in ages between the offender and the 
complainant, even the complainant’s age as they believed it to be. The judge specified 
the following factors in mitigation: (1) The “willingness” of the complainant, (2) the 
pleas at the first opportunity, (3) some, but limited, remorse, and (4) the absence of 
convictions for sexual offences. 

The judge acknowledged the sentencing guidelines’ starting point and range but this 
was, he said, an exceptional case which required him to depart from the guideline. He 
 
could not conclude that the current offences could be compared with those in the case 
of Cleverley [2010] EWCA Crim 1842. They were much more serious. He would take 
a  starting  point  of  5  years  imprisonment  which,  after  discount  of  one-third  for  the 
 
guilty  pleas,  produced  sentences  of  40  months  imprisonment.  In  his  sentencing 
remarks the judge said: 

“As far as the sentence itself is concerned, as has been argued before me, I 
must  apply  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council’s  guidance  in  relation  to 
sentences unless there are exceptional circumstances which enable me to 
say,  in  the  interests  of  justice,  that  I  should  depart.  The  sentencing 
guidelines put the starting point for this type of offence at thirteen years, 
with a range of eleven to seventeen years. But, those guidelines were not 
 
designed with this type of offence that you have each pleaded guilty to in 
this particular case, because of the fact that, despite her age, … this was 
 
consensual in the sense that she was a willing participant; and, secondly, 
because of the fact that you, as I have already found, reasonably believed 
her to be fourteen, not as young as eleven.”

It  is  this  conclusion  of  the  judge  which  requires  examination  by  reference  to  the 
scheme of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the guidelines for sentencing. 

Submissions 

 
16.	 

It is now submitted by the Attorney General that the sentences imposed were unduly 
lenient. The Attorney’s detailed submissions can be summarised as follows: 

 
i)	  The  learned  judge  failed  to  apply  the  sentencing  guidelines.  There  was  no 
justification for his departure from the starting point and range indicated at page 
25  of  the  guidelines  for  offences  contrary  to  the  Sexual  Offences  Act  2003. 
Notwithstanding  the  apparent  age  of  the  complainant  and  her  “willingness”  to 
engage in sexual activity, the aggravating features of the offences identified by 
the judge should have kept the starting point within the guideline range, that is 
11-17 years custody; alternatively, it was submitted, the judge’s starting point fell 
so far below the range that the sentences imposed were unduly lenient; 

 

ii)	  The  judge  over-emphasised  the  apparent  age  of  the  complainant  and  failed  to 
place sufficient weight upon the obligation upon the offenders to make enquiries 
 
as to the age of the child; 

 

iii)  The judge gave too much weight to the “willingness” of the complainant. What 
 
was happening in reality was the opportunistic exploitation of a young girl, who 
was plainly vulnerable, for sexual self gratification; 

 

iv)  The judge failed to place sufficient weight on the harm inevitably caused by the 
offence. Activity of this nature at the expense of an 11 year old girl was bound to 
have a severe effect upon her long term emotional well-being. 

For the offenders, Ms Punjani and Ms Rajshakha reminded the court of the findings of 
fact made by the judge at the Newton hearing. Those facts entitled the judge to depart 
from  the  sentencing  guideline,  on  the  authority  of  Fenn  and  Foster.  The  judge 
balanced the aggravating and mitigating features, found that there was exploitation of 
the complainant and reached his starting point accordingly. It was conceded that the 
 
resultant  sentences  might  be  regarded  as  lenient  but  not,  it  was  submitted,  unduly 
lenient. 

The approach of the Sexual Offences Act to adults and children 

The  Sexual  Offences  Act  2003  created  the  following  non-consensual  offences  in 
respect  of  sexual  activity  towards  persons  aged  16  or  over  (although  they  apply  to 
victims of any age): rape (section 1), assault by penetration (section 2), sexual assault 
(section 3) and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent (section 
4). It is a defence to each such charge that the offender reasonably believed that the 
 
victim was consenting. The maximum sentence for offences contrary to section 1 and 
section  2  is  imprisonment  for  life.  The  maximum  sentence  for  offences  contrary  to 
section 3 is 10 years imprisonment. The maximum sentence for an offence contrary to 
section  4  is,  when  the  sexual  activity  comprises  penetration  of  the  vagina,  anus  or 
mouth  of  the  victim  (and  in  certain  other  circumstances,  see  section  4(4))), 
imprisonment for life.

Sections  5  -  8  of  the  Sexual  Offences  Act  2003  created  a  second  group  of  sexual 
offences  against  children  under  the  age  of  13  which  mirror  the  non-consensual 
offences created by sections 1 – 4 of the Act: rape of a child under 13 (section 5), 
assault of a child under 13 by penetration (section 6), sexual assault of a child under 
13 (section 7), and causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity 
(section 8). It is no defence to any of these charges that the child consented or that the 
offender believed that the child was consenting to the sexual activity concerned, or 
 
that the offender believed the child to be older than 13, or indeed older than 15. 

The maximum sentence for offences contrary to sections 5 and 6, and section 8 when 
the offence involves penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth with the penis (and in 
certain  other  circumstances,  see  section  8(2)),  is  imprisonment  for  life.  This  is  the 
same maximum as for the equivalent offences under sections 1, 2 and 4 (rape, assault 
by  penetration,  and  causing  a  person  to  engage  in  sexual  activity  without  consent). 
The maximum sentence for offences contrary to section 7 is 14 years, which compares 
 
with the maximum of 10 years imprisonment for the equivalent offence against adults 
 
under  section  3  (sexual  assault).  It  is  clear  that  Parliament  intended  to  criminalise 
sexual conduct towards children under the age of 13 whether they ‘consented’ or not. 

The  Act  created  a  third  group  of  offences  aimed  at  offences  committed  by  adults 
 
against children aged between 13 and 15 years, although they may also be charged 
when the victim is a child under 13 years: sexual activity with a child under the age of 
16  years  (section  9),  causing  or  inciting  a  child  under  the  age  of  16  to  engage  in 
sexual  activity  (section  10),  engaging  in  sexual  activity  in  the  presence  of  a  child 
under the age of 16 (section 11), and causing a child under the age of 16 to watch a 
sex act (section 12). It is no defence to any of these charges that the child consented or 
 
that the offender believed the child to be consenting to the sexual activity concerned. 
When the child was aged under 13 years a reasonable belief that the child was aged 
over 13 years, or over 15 years, is no defence. It is, however, a defence to each of 
 
these  charges,  if  the  child  was  aged  13  –  15  years,  that  the  offender  reasonably 
believed the child to be aged 16 or over. 

The maximum sentence for the offence of sexual activity with a child aged 13 – 15 
years, when the sexual activity involves penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth of 
the victim by the penis (and in certain other circumstances, see section 9(2)), is a term 
of 14 years imprisonment (c.f. life imprisonment for offences contrary to sections 4 
and  8);  similarly  for  offences  contrary  to  section  10.  The  maximum  sentence  for 
 
offences  contrary  to  section  11  is  10  years  imprisonment;  similarly  for  offences 
contrary to section 12. 

By section 13 of the Act a person under the age of 18 commits an offence if he does 
anything which would be an offence under sections 9 – 12 if he were aged 18. The 
maximum sentence for such an offence is 5 years custody. 

The sentencing guideline 

The sexual offences guideline at page 5 paragraphs 1.6 – 1.8 identifies, in addition to 
the need to assess harm and culpability, the requirements of deterrence. At paragraphs 
1.10 and 1.11 the guideline states: 

“The harm caused by sexual offences

1.10  All sexual offences where the activity is non- consensual, 
coercive  or  exploitative  result  in  harm.  Harm  is  also 
inherent where victims ostensibly consent but where there 
capacity  to  give  informed  consent  is  affected  by  their 
 
youth or mental disorders: 

 

1.11  The  effects  of  sexual  offending  may  be  physical  and/or 
 
psychological. The physical effects – injury, pregnancy or 
sexually  transmitted  infections  –  may  be  very  serious. 
 
The  psychological  effects  may  be  equally  or  even  more 
 
serious, but much less obvious (even unascertainable) at 
the time of sentencing. They may include any or all of the 
following  (although  this  list  is  not  intended  to  be 
 
comprehensive  and  items  are  not  listed  in  any  form  of 
priority):

25.	 

At  page  6,  paragraph  1.12,  the  guideline  explains  that  exploitative  activity  is 
 
inherently  harmful  and  that  in  itself  increases  the  offenders’  culpability.  The 
 
Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  gave  specific  consideration  to  those  offences  in 
respect of which consent could not be given as a matter of law. At page 19, paragraph 
2.7 and following the guideline states: 

 

“The Age of the Victim 

2.7	  The  extreme  youth  or  old  age  of  a  victim  should  be  an 

 

aggravating factor. 

 
2.8	 

In  addition,  in  principle,  the  younger  the  child  and  the 
greater the age gap between the offender and the victim, 
the higher the sentence should be.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

 

 
2.9	  However, the youth and immaturity of the offender must 

 

also be taken into account in each case. 

[Note that at paragraph 1.15 the Council observed: 

“The  age  of  the  offender  will  be  significant  in  the  sentencing 
exercise in relation to non-consensual offences, where no special 
sentencing provisions have been provided for on the legislation. 
Its  significance  is  particularly  acute  in  relation  to  the  strict 
 
liability  offences  such  as  ‘rape  of  a  child  under  13’,  where  the 
maximum penalty is life imprisonment, especially if an offender 
 
is very young and the disparity in age between the offender and 
the victim is very small.”] 
 

 

 

2.10  The court in Millberry adopted the principle that a sexual 
offence  against  a  child  is  more  serious  than  the  same 
offence perpetrated against an adult and attracts a higher 
starting point. No distinction was made between children 
age 13 and over but under 16, and those aged under 13. 

 

2.11  Special  weight  has  subsequently  been  accorded  to  the 
protection of very young children by the introduction of a 
range  of  strict  liability  offences  in  the  SOA  2003 
specifically designed to protect children under 13: 

 
	  The offences of “rape of a child under 13”, “assault 
by penetration of a child under 13”, and “causing a 
 
child  under  13  to  engage  in  sexual  activity”  where 
the  activity  included  sexual  penetration  carry  the 
 
maximum life penalty. 

 
	  The maximum penalty for the new offence of “sexual 
assault of a child under 13” is 14 years, as opposed to 
a  maximum  of  10  years  for  the  generic  “sexual 
assault” offence. 

2.12  In keeping with the principles of protection established in 

 

the SOA 2003, the Council has determined that: 

 
	  Higher  starting  points  in  cases  involving  victims  under  13  should 

normally apply, but there may be exceptions; 

 
	  Particular  care  will  need  to  be  taken  when  applying  the  starting 
points in certain cases, such as those involving young offenders or 
offenders whose judgment is impaired by a mental disorder; and 

 
	  Proximity in age between a young victim and an offender is also a 

relevant consideration.” 

 
26. 

At page 21, paragraph 2.16, the Guideline continues:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

 

 

“2.16  	All  the  non-consensual  offences  involve  a  high  level  of 
culpability  on  the  part  of  the  offender,  since  that  person  will 
have  acted  either  deliberately  without  the  victim’s  consent  or 
 
without giving due consideration whether the victim was able to, 
or did in fact give consent. 

 
2.17	  Notwithstanding  paragraph  2.11  above,  there  will  be  cases 
 
involving victims under 13 years of age where there was, in fact, 
consent where, in law, it cannot be given. In such circumstances, 
presence  of  consent  may  be  material  in  relation  to  sentence, 
particularly in relation to a young offender where there is close 
proximity in age between the victim and offender or where the 
mental capacity or maturity of the offender is impaired. 

 

 
 

2.18	  Where  there  was  reasonable  belief  on  the  part  of  a 
young offender that the victim was 16 this can be taken 
into consideration as a mitigating factor.” 
 

 
27.	 

It  is  to  be  noted  that  in  paragraphs  2.17  and  2.18  the  SGC  did  not  require  any 
distinction to be drawn between ‘consensual’ and ‘non-consensual’ offences when the 
 
victim was aged under 13 years and the offender was an adult. It is said that factual 
consent  may  be  material,  and  may  be  particularly  material  when  there  is  a  close 
proximity in the ages of the offender and the victim, or the offender is immature or a 
 
person whose mental capacity is impaired. Secondly, the Council did not recognise 
 
that reasonable belief that a victim under the age of 13 years was aged between 13 and 
15 years was capable of amounting to a mitigating factor, only that a reasonable belief 
 
that the victim was aged 16 years can be taken into account as a mitigating factor. 

 

 
28.	 

The Sentencing Guideline Council’s table of starting points and ranges for the offence 
of  rape  at  page  25  embraces  offences  committed  in  different  circumstances  against 
adults, children aged between 13 and 15 years, and children under the age of 13 as 
follows:

29.	 

At  page  26  the  Council  lists  “Additional”  aggravating  and  mitigating  factors.  The 
aggravating factors say nothing about age or lack of consent. Additional mitigating 
features to be considered where the victim is under 16 are: 

“Sexual activity between two children (one of whom is the offender) was 
mutually agreed and experimental, [and/or] 

Reasonable  belief  (by  a  young  offender)  that  the  victim  was  aged  16  or 
over” 

Nowhere in the guideline does the Council recognise ‘consent’ by a victim under the 
 
age of 13, or reasonable belief that a victim under the age of 13 was aged 13 – 15, as a 
mitigating factor in favour of an adult offender. 

 
30.	 

 
These provisions in the guidelines and the statutory purpose behind section 5 of the 
Sexual Offences Act 2003 were considered closely by the court in Attorney General’s 
References Nos. 74 and 83 of 2007 (Fenn and Foster) [supra]. In particular we would 
repeat paragraphs 36 and 48 of the White Paper “Protecting the Public” to which the 
Vice  President,  Latham  LJ,  giving  the  judgment  of  the  court,  drew  attention  at 
paragraph 5: 

 

 
“36. We believe that there is an age below which consent or not 
 
of a child should not be legally significant. Below this age there 
should  be  no  question  that  the  child  agreed  to  the  sexual
--------

activity. We are therefore proposing that children under the age 
of 13 should be deemed incapable of giving legally significant 
consent to any form of sexual activity. The effect of this rule 
would be that anyone found guilty of sexual activity involving 
direct  physical  contact  with  a  child  aged  12  or  under  will  be 
guilty  of  one  of  the  non-consensual  sex  offences  described  in 
chapter  3.  Any  sexual  intercourse  with  a  child  of  13  will  be 
charged as rape. Issues of consent will not be relevant and no 
alternative verdict will be possible… 
 

48.  There  may  be  circumstances  where  sexual  activity  takes 
place with the ostensible consent of both parties but where one 
of the parties is in such a great position of power over the other 
that the sexual activity is wrong which would come within the 
realms  of  the  criminal  law.  The  most  obvious  cases  involve 
children  and  vulnerable  people  with  learning  disabilities  or 
mental  disorders.  The  offences  in  this  chapter  deal  with  such 
cases.” 

 
31.	 

In an important passage at paragraphs 11-14 of his judgment the Vice President gave 
consideration  to  the  assessment  of  culpability  where  ostensible  consent  or  apparent 
age is an issue. Having drawn attention to paragraphs 2.16 and 2.17 of the guideline 
he continued: 

“11.  When considering culpability, therefore, actual consent 
is  recognised  as  being  capable  of  being  a  mitigating  factor. 
However, careful consideration should be given in all cases, but 
particularly where there is a significant discrepancy in age, to 
the  extent  to  which  ostensible  consent  has  been  obtained 
opportunistically,  or  by  means  of  coercion,  which  may  be 
subtle,  or  exploitation,  which  will  be  particularly  relevant  in 
cases where there may have been an element of grooming. In 
those  cases  ostensible  consent  may  well  have  little  value  as 
mitigation.  

 
12. 
We  use  the  word  “opportunistic”  to  describe  those 
occasions when the sexual activity does not occur in any form 
of relationship, which is a matter referred to in [9] of Corran 
[2005]  2  Cr  App  R  (S)  73  (page  453).  These  will  usually  be 
occasions where the sexual activity is likely to be solely for the 
gratification of the offender. Although in such cases there will 
not have been the aggravating feature of planning, the need for 
the protection of the child, from both the predator and from him 
or  herself,  is  particularly  marked.  Then,  as  in  all  cases,  the 
difference in age between the offender and the child will be of 
great significance.  

 
13. 
As  far  as  apparent  age  is  concerned,  the  definitive 
guideline only refers to it as being capable of being a mitigating 
factor. In the case of a young offender, that is an offender under 
the age of 18, where such an offender reasonably believes …
--------

the other person to be 16 or over. This reflects two aspects of 
the scheme of the Sexual Offences Act. The first is that there is 
a  special  sentencing  regime  for  young  offenders  to  which  we 
have  already  referred  but  which  does  not  apply  to  offences 
under section 5. Secondly, in relation to offences against those 
aged between 13 and 16, it is a defence to establish a reasonable 
belief  that  the  other  person  is  16  or  over.  It  seems  to  us  that 
inherent  in  this  approach  is  the  view  that  any  adult  who 
embarks on sexual activity with a young person does so at their 
own risk. Just as anyone in relation to consent has to give due 
consideration as to whether the victim was able to or did in fact 
give  consent,  failure  to  give  due  consideration  to  age  will  in 
itself be a substantial element in the culpability of the offence. 
 
However  that  does  not  mean  that  a  reasonable  belief  that  the 
victim is 16 or over cannot be a mitigating factor for an adult, 
that is a person over the age of 18, but the older the offender the 
less relevant a mistake as to age, even if reasonably held, will 
be. 

 
14. 
In determining the extent to which mitigation relating 
to  consent  or  age  can  justify  departing  from  the  sentencing 
bracket,  it  may  be  helpful  to  consider  the  guidelines  on 
penetrative  sexual  activity  with  a  person  under  the  age  of  16 
contrary to section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act, if the offender 
does not reasonably believe that the other person is 16 or over. 
The  maximum  sentence  for  an  adult  is  now  14  years 
imprisonment. In the definitive guideline, the Council gives 4 
years as the starting point and a sentencing range of 3-7 years. 
Bearing in mind the legislative purpose of creating the absolute 
offence under section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act for victims 
 
under  13,  this  would  suggest  that  4  years  would  be  the 
 
minimum subject to plea and personal mitigation in the case of 
 
a  young  adult  even  where  there  is  ostensible  consent  and 
reasonable belief that the victim was 16 or over. We would not 
wish  however  to  exclude  the  possibility  of  a  non-custodial 
sentence in exceptional circumstances.” 

 

The court in Fenn and Foster was not suggesting at paragraph 14 that, merely because 
the victim gave “ostensible consent” and the offender reasonably believed that victim 
 
was aged 16 or over, the starting point and sentencing ranges for section 9 offences 
would  apply  to  convictions  under  section  5  of  the  Act;  still  less  was  the  court 
suggesting that the guideline for section 9 offences should apply when the offender 
 
reasonably  believed  the  victim  to  be  aged  13-15  years.  The  Vice  President  was 
pointing out only that the guideline for section 9 offences gave an indication that, in 
the case of a young adult who reasonably believed the victim was aged 16 or over, 
 
where  the  sexual  activity  was  consensual,  the  minimum  starting  point  would  be  4 
years. It remained necessary carefully to consider all the circumstances, including the 
nature of the encounter with the victim and the respective ages of the offender and the 
victim (paragraphs 11-13). 

 
32.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

 

The  court  in  Fenn  and  Foster  increased  sentences  for  offences  contrary  to  section 
 
5(1).  The  offenders  were  aged  24  years  and  26  years.  Their  victims  were, 
respectively, aged 10 years 9 months and 12 years 6 months. Both offenders said that 
they believed the girl to be aged 16. A doctor who examined the 10 year old reported 
that “she would easily pass for someone in her late teens”. The other girl had made 
efforts  to  pass  herself  off  as  16.  In  both  cases  there  had  been  preliminary  mutual 
familiarity leading to intercourse. The court regarded the offenders’ behaviour as “an 
opportunistic  piece  of  sexual  gratification”  at  the  expense  of  a  young  girl  which 
 
required the protection of the courts in the form of significant sentences. In both cases 
the minimum starting point before discount for guilty pleas was 6 years custody.  

Discussion 

The  plain  purpose  of  section  5  of  the  Sexual  Offences  Act  2003  was  to  render 
immaterial to criminal responsibility for the rape of a person under the age of 13 years 
 
the actual or ostensible consent of the victim. The maximum sentence for rape of an 
 
adult  or  a  child  who  does  not  consent  and  for  rape  of  a  child  under  13  who  does 
consent is in each case imprisonment for life. While, therefore, an offence contrary to 
 
section  5  will  always  be  a  serious  offence,  section  5  embraces  a  wide  range  of 
seriousness, from forced non-consensual sexual intercourse between an older man and 
a  very  young  victim  to  consensual  experimental  sexual  intercourse  between  an 
immature 18 year old and a sexually experienced victim whom he reasonably believed 
to be aged 16 or over. Such a wide range of seriousness is captured by the section 5 
offence that the Sentencing Guideline Council recognised the need to do justice by 
identifying  the  particular  harm  caused  by  and  the  culpability  of  the  offender.  The 
 
sentencing guideline does not expressly distinguish between the upper and lower ends 
of the range of seriousness, save by reference to the overall range of 8 – 19 years at 
page 25, but it does provide the sentencing judge with valuable assistance as to the 
correct approach to assessment. We would summarise relevant considerations for the 
sentencing judge in a case such as the present as follows: 

 

(1) Careful analysis of the circumstances of a section 5 offence is always required and 
a Newton hearing may be necessary when the claim is made that the victim was 
consenting in fact and/or that the offender believed the victim to be significantly 
older than her chronological age. The prosecutor bears a burden of responsibility 
to ensure that factual concessions to a basis of plea or mitigation of the offence are 
made only when justified and that, if made, the precise import of the concession is 
understood by the offender and the court (see further paragraph (3) below); 

 

(2) There  is  a  strong  element  of  deterrence  in  sentencing  for  sexual  offences 
committed  against  young  children,  whether  they  are  sexually  experienced  and 
‘willing’ or not. They are, by reason of their young age, vulnerable to exploitation 
and  require  protection,  sometimes  from  themselves.  It  can  be  assumed  that, 
whatever  the  circumstances,  there  is  likely  to  be  considerable  long-term  harm 
 
caused by such offences; 

 

 

(3) Exploitative sexual behaviour towards a child under 13 without consideration for 
the vulnerability of that child may be just as serious as submission obtained by the 
 
use  of  force  or  the  threat  of  force.  “Ostensible  consent”  and  “willingness”  are 
terms  which,  in  the  context  of  offences  against  the  young  in  particular,  are 
susceptible to misunderstanding and, even if accurately used, are liable to obscure 

 
33.	 

 
34.
--------

the true nature of the encounter between the offender and the victim (see Fenn and 
Foster at para. 11); 

 

(4) The culpability of the offender is measured in part by his own understanding of 
the harm he was causing or was likely to cause. The guideline does not, however, 
recognise as a mitigating factor a belief by the offender that the victim was aged 
13-15  years.  There  is  a  good  reason  for  this.  Such  an  offender  knew  that  the 
 
victim was not in law consenting. Nevertheless, the younger the victim, the more 
 
serious is the harm likely to result and the greater is likely to be the culpability of 
 
the  offender.  We  repeat  the  advice  of  the  court  in  Corran  at  para.  8  that  the 
respective  ages  of  the  offender  and  the  victim  is  an  important  factor  in  the 
 
assessment of seriousness; 

 

(5) The  starting  point  for  consideration  of  the  appropriate  sentence  for  a  section  5 
 
offence is the table at page 25 of the guideline, and not the table at page 53 which 
applies to offences contrary to section 9. If the judge decides to sentence outside 
the guideline range that decision should be justified and explained. 

 

35.	  We turn to consider the personal circumstances of the present offenders. Channer had 
previous convictions for possession of drugs and possession of an offensive weapon. 
He had been recalled to court on several occasions for breaches of court orders but 
had not served a custodial sentence. The author of the pre-sentence report made the 
 
following assessment of risk: 

“While there is no evidence which would suggest that Roshane 
 
Channer actively sought an opportunity to sexually abuse an 11 
year  victim,  it  is  clear  that  in  spite  of  his  experiences  as  a 
consequence,  there  is  little  or  nothing  that  he  considers  is 
necessary to alter in his conduct to prevent this from occurring 
again  in  the  future.  His  assertion  that  the  blame  lies  with  the 
victim’s  parents  allows  him  to  distance  himself  from  his 
 
responsibility  for  his  actions  and  he  does  not  appear  to 
recognise the seriousness of his current position.” 

 

The author concluded that there was a likelihood of further similar offending. 

 

36.	  Monteiro has previous convictions for assault, a public order offence, possession of an 
offensive  weapon,  burglary,  attempted  robbery  and  possession  of  drugs.  He  had 
previously served periods of up to 5 months detention in a young offender institution. 
The author of the pre-sentence report made the following assessment of risk: 

involved 

in 

this  occasion  Mr  Monteiro  was 

“On 
the 
exploitation of a female child for self-gratification supported by 
his belief that he was not causing harm as she was not resistant. 
 
His willingness to join in and failure to question his action is 
extremely worrying and risky… He has continued to act with 
self-interest with blatant disregard for the likely impact of his 
 
behaviour upon victims, society and ultimately himself.” 

The author concluded that Mr Monteiro represented a high risk of harm to the public 
and vulnerable young females.

37.	  We have received recent reports upon the offenders from their custodial institutions. 

 

They are not yet settling and both are presenting disciplinary problems.  

 

38.	  We  turn,  finally,  to  consider  whether  the  sentences  imposed  upon  these  offenders 
were unduly lenient. In our judgment, as the Attorney General recognised, the learned 
judge  set  about  the  task  of  identifying  the  proper  factual  basis  for  sentence  in  an 
exemplary fashion. He identified accurately those mitigating features of the offences 
which  were  capable  of  permitting  him  to  depart  from  the  guideline  range  and  the 
aggravating features against which they should be balanced. It seems to us that the 
 
Attorney  General’s  submissions  go  primarily  to  the  final  assessment  of  seriousness 
and the application of the guideline. For the reasons we have given, we respectfully 
disagree  with  the  judge’s  conclusion  (see  paragraph  15  above)  that  level  2  of  the 
 
guideline at page 25 was not intended to apply to offences such as the present. We can 
do no better than to resort to the sentencing judge’s own description of these offences 
and to emphasise the following facts: 

(1) 	 These offenders could not have thought that the complainant was older than 14 
 
years of age. It follows that no significant mitigation was available to them on 
the  basis  of  a  mistaken  belief  in  the  girl’s  age.  They  knew  that  the  girl  was 
 
incapable  of  consenting  in  law  to  the  activity  in  which  they  required  her  to 
engage; 

 

(2)	  They did not care how old she was. They did not make any enquiry of the girl. 
The circumstances were such that they must have realised that she was a child 
and, therefore, vulnerable; 

 

(3)	  There was a substantial disparity between their ages and the complainant’s actual 
age; there was a significant disparity between their ages and the complainant’s 
age as they might reasonably have believed it to be. We use these descriptions in 
order to emphasise the gulf in maturity between an 11 or 14 year old victim and 
the 20 year old offenders. Nonetheless these offenders were still young men; 

 

(4)	  The  only  mitigating  feature  available  to  the  offenders  was  the  complainant’s 
willingness  to  engage  in  sexual  activity.  As  explained  in  Fenn  and  Foster, 
however,  such  “willingness”  is  of  little  value  in  mitigation  where  the  offence 
amounts to the exploitation of a young child. The circumstances here were that 
two adults jointly took advantage of a child in degrading circumstances; 

 

 

(5)	  The group nature of the activity (which should not be double-counted) and the 
recording  of  the  event  constituted  serious  aggravating  features  of  an  already 
exploitative offence; 

(6) 	 The harm done by the offenders will be long-lasting, perhaps permanent. 

The  primary  sentencing  objective  in  these  circumstances  was  punishment  and 
 
deterrence. The aggravating factors identified by the judge serve only to identify the 
 
nature of the evil against which the Act and the sentencing guideline seek to achieve 
the  protection  of  children.  In  our  judgment,  the  starting  point  for  these  offences  of 
rape  should  not  have  fallen  below  11  years  custody  and  may  have  been  somewhat 
higher.  We  are  conscious  that  this  must  result  in  a  substantial  increase  in  sentence 
 
even after giving full credit for guilty pleas. We agree with the judge that there is no

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
 

R -v- Majeed and R -v- Westfield 
 

 

These otherwise unconnected appeals against conviction arise in the same notorious 
context,  “spot  fixing”  in  cricket  matches.  For  cricket  betting  is  not  new:  it  has, 
however, become multi-faceted.  Nowadays it is possible to place bets not only on the 
final outcome of a match, but on particular passages of play, such as how many runs 
 
will be scored or wickets taken in an over, or indeed on individual events during the 
course  of  an  over  or  passage  of  play.  Cricket  is  widely  televised,  not  only  in  the 
country where the match is being played, but throughout the cricket playing world, 
and indeed further afield.  The prizes for successful gambling can be very great, and 
the scope for corruption is therefore considerable.  For the health, indeed the survival 
of the game as a truly competitive sport, it must be eradicated. 
  

Following  rulings  by  the  trial  judges  on  issues  of  law  relating  to  the  ambit  of  the 
offences alleged against them, both appellants pleaded guilty, in the case of Majeed in 
the Crown Court at Southwark on 16th September 2011 before Cooke J, and Westfield 
at  the  Central  Criminal  Court  in  February  2011  before  Saunders  J,  The  appellants 
contend  that  these  rulings  were  wrong.    If  they  were  wrong  the  appeals  against 
conviction must be allowed and a retrial would be ordered. 

Majeed  was  charged  on  two  counts.  Count  1  alleged  conspiracy  to  give  corrupt 
payments, contrary to s.1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977.  The particulars alleged 
that  between  15th  and  29th  August  2010  Majeed  conspired  with  Salman  Butt, 
Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Amir, employees of the Pakistan Cricket Board and 
 
persons unknown, corruptly to give Butt, Asif and Amir money as an inducement or 
 
reward for doing acts in relation to the affairs of their employer, the Pakistan Cricket 
Board, namely to identify in advance occasions during the Test Match series between 
  
Pakistan and England, when they would play in a specific, previously agreed, manner. 
The charge, in effect, invoked s.1(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906.  Count 
2 alleged conspiracy to cheat, contrary to s.1(1) of the 1977 Act, when the same four 
conspirators, with other persons unknown, between the same date conspired to do an 
act or acts to enable another or other persons to cheat at gambling by identifying in 
advance occasions during the Test Match series between Pakistan and England when 
they would play in a specific manner. It was agreed on all sides that count 2 involved 
a conspiracy to cheat at gambling contrary to s.42 of the Gambling Act 2005. 

 

Butt  and  Asif  were  convicted  and  Amir  pleaded  guilty  to  conspiracy  corruptly  to 
accepting  financial  inducements  or  rewards  for  these  activities.    The  sums  were 
considerable.  They have not appealed against conviction. 

Mervyn Westfield was also charged on two counts.  Count 1 alleged that he accepted 
or obtained corrupt payments contrary to s.1(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 
1906  when,  as  an  employee  of  Essex  Cricket  Club,  between  1st  January  and  16th 
 
October 2009 he corruptly accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or obtain money, 
 
for  agreeing,  whilst  playing  for  Essex  Cricket  Club  in  a  Nat.  West  Pro  40  cricket 
match to bowl in a manner calculated and intended to allow the scoring of runs.  In 
count 2 it was alleged that he assisted another to cheat at gambling, contrary to s.42 of 
the Gambling Act 2005, when, between 4th and 9th September 2009, he bowled in a 
manner  calculated  and  intended  to  allow  the  scoring  of  runs  for  the  purpose  of 
assisting another person to cheat at gambling.  He pleaded guilty to count 1, and the 
 
prosecution did not proceed with count 2.

Section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 (the 1906 Act) provides: 

“If any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or 
attempts  to  obtain,  from  any  person,  for  himself  or  for  any 
other  person,  any  gift  or  consideration  as  an  inducement  or 
reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having … done or 
 
forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or 
business,  or  for  showing  or  forbearing  to  show  favour  or 
disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or 
business or … he shall be guilty … ” 

 
7.	 

 
8.	 

By section 1(2) the expression “agent” includes any person employed by or acting for 
another; and the expression “principal” includes an employer. 

Section 42 of the Gambling Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) provides: 

“(1) a person commits an offence if he 

(a) cheats at gambling, or 

(b)  does  anything  for  the  purpose  of  enabling  or  assisting 
another person to cheat at gambling”. 

  

 
9.	 

The facts of both cases are notorious, and we need provide only a very brief summary 
of them. 

Majeed 

 

10.	  Majeed  is  a  resident  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  agent  for  a  number  of  players 
 
representing Pakistan, who arrived in England in the summer of 2010 as part of the 
Pakistan Cricket Board’s tour of England.  Salman Butt was the captain of the team. 
 
Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Amir were fast bowlers.  Each of them had signed a 
 
contract with the Pakistan Cricket Board to provide full time services to their country 
as  professional  cricketers.    Their  respective  employments  were  governed  by  these 
contracts. 

 
11.	 

The  central  contract  signed  by  each  of  the  three  cricketers  included  the  following 
 
terms: 

“Whereas 

 

1.	  The Board is vested with the exclusive authority to control, 
 
regulate and manage the game of cricket and related affairs 
in Pakistan; 

2.	  the Cricketer is a professional cricketer who has offered his 

 

services to the Board;

R -v- Majeed and R -v- Westfield 
 

 

2.2.5  The Cricketer acknowledges that he is an ambassador 
of  Pakistan  therefore  his  behaviour  both  in  and  off  the  field 
shall  be  exemplary  and  he  shall  refrain  from  acting  in  the 
 
manner  which  may  damage  the  reputation  of  the  Team  or 
Pakistan  or  the  Board.    When  on  tour,  the  Cricketer  shall 
immediately report to the Manager any incident involving him 
or  any  incident  of  which  he  becomes  aware  or  has  witnessed 
involving  a  team  member  or  any  other  person  accompanying 
the  team  or  otherwise  that  may  cause  harm  or  have  a 
 
detrimental impact to the reputation of the team, or Pakistan or 
the  Board  or  cricket  in  general  or  is  violative  whether  of 
Pakistan  or  of  the  country  of  Tour  or  transition.    In  case  any 
such  incident  happens  when  the  cricketer  is  not  on  Tour,  the 
same shall be informed to the Director Cricket operations. 

 

2.2.8  The  Cricketer  shall  at  all  times  behave  in  a  manner 
 
which promotes harmony within the Team … 

2.2.16  The Cricketer shall at all times play the game with the 
true spirit and in accordance with the rules and regulations of 
the  game  of  cricket.    In  case,  the  Cricketer  is  appointed  as 
captain  of  the  Team  he  shall  be  responsible  at  all  times  for 
ensuring that the Team adheres to such rules and regulations. 

7.1 
The  Cricketer  acknowledges  that  the  ICC  Code  of 
 
Conduct  rules  regarding  betting,  match  fixing  and  corruption, 
are designed to protect the integrity of the game.  The Cricketer 
undertakes that he shall always fully comply with the said Code 
 
of  Conduct  and  other  amendments  or  rules  formulated  in  this 
regard from time to time. 

7.2 
The  Cricketer  shall  be  under  obligation  to  report 
immediately to the Manager, the Captain and to an authorized 
representative of the Board about any person approaching him 
or  to  any  other  Team  member  of  which  he  becomes  aware, 
offering  the  fixing  of  a  Match  or  result  or  a  Match  or  any 
performance in a Match.” 

12.	  Where paragraph 7.1 of the contract recited the obligation of the cricketer to adhere to 

 

the ICC Code of Conduct Article 2.1.2 proscribes: 

“Seeking, accepting, offering or agreeing to accept any bribe or 
other  reward  to  fix  or  to  contrive  in  any  way  or  otherwise  to 
influence improperly the result, progress, conduct or any other 
aspect of any International Match or ICC event”. 

 

13.	  When  offered  their  contracts  the  cricketers  were  also  required  to  sign  and  return  a 
copy of the Code of Conduct Policy along with the contract.  Each of them did.  Four 
particular features of the Code of Conduct were: 

 

  “Para. 3:

R -v- Majeed and R -v- Westfield 
 

 

 
 
 

Any  act  or  conduct  of  a  Player  which  brings 
Pakistan’s and PCB’s image into disrepute shall make 
the player liable to disciplinary action. 

  Para. 13: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
The  Player  acknowledges  that  the  ICC  Code  of 
Conduct contains rules regarding betting, match fixing 
and corruption, designed to protect the integrity of the 
game.    The  said  rules  are  in  the  knowledge  of  the 
Player  and  fully  explained  to  him.    The  Player 
undertakes that he shall always fully comply with the 
said Code of Conduct and other amendments or rules 
formulated in this regard from time to time. 

Para. 15: 

 
 
 
 
 

The Players must meet the requirements of their work 
 
at  all  times  with  due  care,  vigilance,  enthusiasm, 
 
diligence  and  honesty.    The  Board  requires  them  to 
meet  the  highest  ethical  standards  to  establish  and 
maintain our reputation. 

Para. 18: 

 
 
 
 

The Players must abide  by any rules and regulations, 
 
guidelines and instructions PCB may issue from time 
 
 
to  time  and  ensure  that  they  meet  the  Board’s 
 
standards of performance and conduct.” 

 
14.	 

 
15.	 

It is self evident that each of the three Pakistan cricketers was prohibited not merely 
by reason of some unspecific concept of what is or is not, or what was and was not 
cricket, but as a matter of contractual obligation as employees of the Pakistan Cricket 
Board, from accepting any form of bribe to influence or seek to influence not only the 
result of any Test Match, but the progress or conduct of any aspect of the match. 

During the course of the tour, an undercover investigative journalist with the News of 
the  World,  calling  himself  Mazher  Mamood  met  with  Majeed  on  a  number  of 
occasions during August 2010 as part of a “sting” operation.  It was agreed that the 
appellant would arrange with Butt, Amir and Asif for the bowlers to bowl “no balls” 
at  specified  times  during  the  course  of  a  test  match  between  England  and  Pakistan 
which  was  played  at  Lords  Cricket  Ground  between  26th  and  29th  August  2010  in 
return for payment.  In short, specific pre-arranged events occurred during the match, 
not in the course of honest endeavour on behalf of Pakistan, but as part of a deliberate 
 
“fix”, a word which we use colloquially to connote corruption and dishonesty.  These 
activities constituted unequivocal breaches of their contracts of employment. 

 

Westfield 

 
16.	 

Unlike Majeed, Westfield was himself a cricketer, contracted to Essex County Cricket 
 
Club for which he had played, primarily as a bowler, for four years.  His contract of
--------

R -v- Majeed and R -v- Westfield 
 

 

employment  was  in  standard  form  for  a  professional  county  player.    By  it  he 
undertook to abide by all the “Rules, Regulations, Directives and Resolutions of the 
ECB, the Laws of Cricket and any CC regulations in force …”.  By paragraph 5(a) he 
agreed: 

“(i)  play  in  all  cricket  matches  in  which  he  is  selected  or 
directed to play for any side representative of the Employer to 
the  best  of  his  ability  and  obey  the  lawful  and  reasonable 
directions of the captain of the side”; 
 

and by paragraph 6: 

“to (a) use his best endeavours to maintain his form so as to be 
available for regular selection for matches and to perform his 
duties to the best of his ability under the Agreement”. 

 
17.	 

The spot fixing in his case arose on 5th September 2009, when he was offered and 
accepted £6,000 in return for agreeing deliberately to concede more than 12 runs off 
the first over he bowled in the match Nat. West Pro 40 match Essex would play at 
Durham.    Again  this  conduct  represented  a  clear  breach  of  his  contract  of 
employment. 

Count 1 – The 1906 Act – Majeed and Westfield 

 
18.	 

The contention for the appellants is that the Crown’s case on count 1 was defective in 
law because an essential element of the offence based on the 1906 Act could not be 
proved.  The actions of the cricketers on the field were not “aimed at” the Pakistan 
Cricket  Board  or  the  Essex  County  Cricket  Club  (which  for  convenience  we  shall 
describe as “the Boards”.)  The offence could not be complete without some action or 
inaction  (intended  or  actual)  by  the  Boards,  consequent  on  an  agreement  by  their 
employees to accept the bribes.  The Boards did nothing, and nothing was expected of 
them.  The bribes were not intended to and did not influence them in any way.  In 
support of this submission Mr Milliken-Smith focussed our attention on the decision 
of  the  Privy  Council  in  Commissioner  of  the  Independent  Commission  against 
Corruption  v  Ch’ng  Poh  [1997]  1  WLR  1175  He  suggested  that  like  the  dishonest 
solicitor, “A”, in Ch’ng Poh, the way in which Butt, Amir and Asif performed during 
the Test Match, and Whitfield performed in the County Match, was personal to them. 
Like the firm in which “A” was a partner, the Boards did not and were not expected to 
do anything at all by way of response or as a reaction to the giving and the acceptance 
of the bribes. 

 

19.	  We must therefore examine Ch’ng Poh.  He was a dishonest criminal.  He wished to 
appeal against conviction.  His solicitor, “A”, was a partner in a firm of solicitors.  To 
 
improve  the  prospects  of  a  successful  appeal  by  Ch’ng  Poh,  bribes  were  offered 
through “A” by Ch’ng Poh to two individuals.  A warrant based on an alleged breach 
of s.9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance in Hong Kong (effectively in identical 
 
terms to the 1906 Act) authorised officers of the I-C-A-C to search the premises of the 
 
firm where “A” was a partner.  This warrant was based on the assertion that “A” had 
offered bribes to others on behalf of Ch’ng Poh, not that he had received a hidden or 
any  other  benefit  from  Ch’ng  Poh  which  might  have  any  effect  on  the  services 
rendered to Ch’ng Poh by the firm.  He was, in the language of the Court of Appeal of
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R -v- Majeed and R -v- Westfield 
 

 

 
Hong Kong, doing “his client’s dirty work” by engaging in a conspiracy to pervert the 
course of justice by offering bribes designed to improve his client’s prospects.  The 
decision to grant the warrant was quashed by the High Court Judge and his decision 
was upheld in the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong.  It was further upheld in the Privy 
Council.  This was because the bribes offered by “A” were not offered in relation to 
the  affairs  of  his  firm,  but  exclusively  to  the  affairs  of  his  client.    Therefore  the 
warrant, in effect taking effect against the firm, was not supportable.  

 
20.	 

The  judgment  of  the  Privy  Council  in  Ch’ng  Poh  was  given  by  Lord  Lloyd  of 
Berwick.  Explaining the decision he said: 

“… for the section to apply, the person offering the bribe must 
have intended the act or forbearance of the agent to influence or 
affect  the  principal’s  affairs.
  Accordingly  section  9  would 
apply if Ch’ng Poh had bribed Mr. A. to secure him a benefit at 
X Co’s expense, for example, to arrange a reduction in X Co’s 
ordinary professional fees; or if X Co were induced to act in a 
way in which they would not otherwise have acted.  Thus it is 
an essential ingredient of the offence under section 9 that the 
action  or  forbearance  of  the  agent  should  be  aimed  at  the 
principal.    If  it  is  sufficient  for  the  purposes  of  the  person 
offering the bribe that the agent should act on his own without 
involving his principal then, what ever other offence may have 
been committed, it was not a corrupt transaction with an agent 
 
…”. 

 

 
21.	 

This  is  the  passage  in  the  judgment  from  which  Mr  Milliken-Smith  derived  his 
 
“aimed at” argument.  The problem for him is that it was addressing the stark reality 
that “A’s” firm was remote from the bribes paid by Ch’ng Poh, and wholly unaffected 
by  them.    They  were  not  paid  to  “A”  for  any  purposes  associated,  directly  or 
indirectly, with the business or affairs of his firm.  In fact they were not paid to “A” at 
all.  He simply organised their onward transmission to the intended recipients.  It is 
however  clear  from  the  judgment  that  the  transaction  would  have  fallen  within  the 
 
ambit of the legislation if the bribes had been accepted by “A” with the intention or 
 
for the purpose of influencing or affecting the affairs of the firm.  This is why Lord 
Lloyd went on to acknowledge that if the bribe had been offered to “A” by Ch’ng Poh 
in a way which would have led the firm to file an affidavit which both “A” and Ch’ng 
Poh  knew  to  be  false,  the  warrant,  as  issued,  might  have  been  appropriate.    This 
would have been because, although Lord Lloyd did not need to spell it out, the bribe 
 
would then have involved the firm, albeit wholly innocently on the part of the firm, in 
the corrupt activity. 

 

22.	  We cannot find anything in the judgment in Ch’ng Poh which lends support to Mr 
Milliken-Smith’s argument, and if it did, the submission would be wholly inconsistent 
with the clear statutory language. 

Returning  to  these  appeals,  plainly  the  way  in  which  Butt,  Amir  and  Asif,  and 
Westfield  performed  was  personal  to  them  and  clean  contrary  to  and  far  removed 
from the wishes of the Boards which employed them.  Nevertheless, looking at the 
realities of the situation there could on the evidence have been nothing closer to the 
heart of the affairs or business of a cricket Board than the performance the players

selected by them to represent their and his country, or their and his county.  In relation 
to  the  Pakistan  Cricket  Board,  that  is  why,  among  other  provisions  of  the  central 
contract  signed  by  each  cricketer,  he  was  obliged  to  refrain  from  doing  anything 
 
which  might  damage  the  reputation  of  the  team  for  which  he  was  playing,  or  the 
country  he  represented,  or  the  Board  which  employed  him.    He  was  obliged 
immediately to report to the manager of the team any incident which might damage 
 
the  reputation  of  the  team,  or  the  country  or  the  Board,  and  agreed  that  to  seek  or 
accept any bribe or other reward to fix or contrive to influence the result, progress and 
 
conduct  of  an  international  match  was  prohibited.    There  could  not  be  any  clearer 
indication  of  the  simple  proposition  that  the  Pakistan  Cricket  Board  regarded  the 
 
conduct of the players on the field as integral to its affairs and business, and indeed 
that  their  play  was  integral  to  them.    Precisely  the  same  considerations  apply  to 
Westfield and Essex County Cricket Club.  That was the entire point of the agreement 
that he should play on behalf of the county to the best of his ability. 

 
24.	 

In this case the Boards were not involved in the activities of their players.  Indeed 
they were unaware of them.  If they had been aware of them, they would have done 
 
their best to prevent them.  That is because the activities were immensely damaging to 
their  affairs.      In  short,  the  Boards  were  victims  of  these  corrupt  activities.    There 
 
could, in the language of the section be no clearer indication that the actions of the 
 
conspirators in count 1, including Majeed, and Westfield on his own in count 1 of the 
indictment  affecting  him,  arose  in  relation  to  the  respective  Boards’  affairs  or 
 
business. 

 

25.	  Mr Milliken-Smith advanced subsidiary arguments arising from the language of the 
 
Law  Reform  Commission  paper:  Reforming  Bribery,  which  suggested  that  the 
 
legislation with which we are concerned was “riddled with uncertainty and in need of 
rationalisation”, and the recommendations, subsequently incorporated into the Bribery 
Act 2010, which came into force after the activities described in this judgment.  They 
 
do not assist him.  The actions of these cricketers fell fairly and squarely within the 
ambit  of  the  1906  Act,  and  the  conspiracy  count  involving  Majeed,  and  the  count 
 
against Westfield were clearly established. 

 

Count 2 – The 2005 Act – Majeed only 

 

26.	  Mr Milliken-Smith’s submission on this count can be simply explained.  Gambling in 
England  and  Wales  is  now  regulated  by  the  Gambling  Act  2005  which  identifies 
offences which may be committed if its provisions are contravened.  It is an offence to 
cheat at gambling.  The offence is defined in s.42.  It was agreed at trial and accepted 
for the purposes of these appeals that any gambling which might occur or might have 
occurred as a result of the spot fixing which occurred in these cases would have taken 
or took place abroad, outside the jurisdiction.  The offence contrary to s.42 is directed 
to  cheating  at  gambling  which  would  otherwise  be  lawful  and  occurred  within  the 
jurisdiction.  The  gambling  which  took  place  here  was  unlawful  and  took  place 
abroad.  Accordingly there was no jurisdiction to try the appellants for this offence. 

This is a remarkable submission.  The offence contrary to s.42 is committed at the 
 
moment when “anything” is done “for the purpose of enabling or assisting” anyone 
else to cheat at gambling.  It has nothing to do with the proper regulation of gambling: 
it  simply  creates  an  offence  of  cheating.    In  these  cases  the  offence  was  complete 
 
before any bet was placed.  The “fix” was organised in England, the matches which

R -v- Majeed and R -v- Westfield 
 

 

were the target of the “fixing” took place here, and the rewards for participating were 
also paid here.  In short the criminal conduct prohibited by s.42 occurred within the 
jurisdiction. 
 

 
28.	 

Interesting questions of territoriality might arise if it were ever to be the case that an 
individual or individuals who were living abroad and placed their bets abroad on the 
basis  of  the  cheating  which  was  organised  and  took  place  here  were  ever  to  be 
prosecuted in this jurisdiction.  We need not address them.  We are not dealing with 
the criminals abroad who took advantage of the cheating organised in this jurisdiction.  
We are dealing with the criminals who participated in it here.  The respective offences 
of  conspiracy  against  Majeed  and  cheating  against  Westfield  were  properly 
prosecuted.

SHEFFIELD CROWN COURT 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE CRANSTON 

 

1.	  On 14 February this year Casey Kearney was murdered while going on a sleepover 
with a friend in Doncaster.  She was 13 at the time; if she had lived she would just 
have turned 14.  She was a year 9 pupil at McAuley High School in Doncaster and 
was doing particularly well.  She wanted to be a film producer.  She lived with her 
mother, Mrs Day, and the family in Rossington, Doncaster.  Her family have been in 
court throughout the whole of the trial.  They have behaved with enormous dignity 
despite having to listen to the details concerning the horrific death of their beloved 
Casey and facing the attention of the press. 

2.	  In their victim impact statements both parents tell of the devastation caused by 

 

Casey’s murder and how their lives and that of their families have been changed 
 
forever.  As Casey’s mother, Mrs Day says, life will never be the same again and they 
will never come to terms with what happened.  “Casey did not deserve this.  She had 
done nothing wrong”. 

3.	  What happened? Casey had alighted the bus just after 1pm and was on the way to her 

 

friend’s house, through Elmfield Park in Doncaster.  Her last text message to her 
friend, the last text message she was ever to send, as she walked towards the northern 
entrance of the Park, was “XD”, in other words she was excited.  Casey walked south 
through the park.  She reached the fountain in the park and started to walk south along 
the path.
--------
4.	  Coming the other way on the same path, was the defendant, Hannah Bonser.  That 

 

morning Hannah Bonser had purchased two kitchen knives at Boyes Store in 
Doncaster.  As they approached each other Hannah Bonser stabbed Casey with the 
16cm knife she had, once in the abdomen with at least moderate, perhaps severe, 
force.  Casey had been stabbed suddenly, without warning, catching her completely 
unawares.  She did have the presence of mind to call 999, but all she could say was 
“I’ve just been stabbed”.  She was moaning and breathing heavily, and tried to speak 
but couldn’t say any more.   

5.	  People in the park came up to help and comfort Casey, and the police, a paramedic 

 

and the ambulance arrived.  Casey was given attention in the ambulance.  Doctors and 
staff at Doncaster Royal Infirmary conducted an emergency operation and made 
numerous attempts to stop the bleeding.  However, the knife had caused rapid and 
catastrophic blood loss and Casey died later that evening.   

6.	  Why had Hannah Bonser done this to Casey, a young girl, a complete and wholly 

 

innocent stranger?  We still do not know.  Twenty minutes after killing Casey Hannah 
Bonser rang the bell at Rethink, which is the other side of Town Fields, in Doncaster 
and is a project which assists those with mental health problems.  Rethink had 
provided Hannah Bonser crisis accommodation the previous month. 

7.	  Hannah Bonser appeared normal, not distressed or upset, as if nothing much had 

 

happened.  She told the Rethink staff that she felt she had done something “silly”.  She 
had stabbed someone in Elmfield Park, someone she did not know, she thought a 
person in her twenties.  When asked why she had done it she said she was hearing 
voices, a male voice telling her to do evil things and dragging up things in her past.  
She said that she had been unwell for quite a long time.   

 

8.	  The Rethink staff called the police.  Hannah Bonser was taken to the College 
Road police station at Doncaster.  A consultant psychiatrist assessed her that 
evening as being fit to be detained and interviewed.  She was cooperative with 
him but appeared somewhat bewildered, surprised at what had happened.  She 
told him that she knew that she had stabbed a girl in the park with a knife
--------
although she did not know why she had done it. She did not think that she had 
any intention of harming anyone although she could not really remember what 
had happened.  She had been hearing voices in her head ranting and raving.   

 

9.	  Just after midnight, the police told Hannah Bonser that Casey had died and that 
she was to be charged with murder.  At that point there was a change in Hannah 
Bonser’s demeanour and she said to the police “you’re joking”.  At one point 
she appeared visibly upset. 

10. The next day, when she was interviewed by the police, when asked what she had 

 
done the day before, up until the time of her arrest, she said that she got out of 
bed, got dressed, went to get some money and bought some food but then, she 
said, her head had gone blank.  She then asked to consult her solicitor who told 
the police that she was clearly unwell, hearing voices telling her to do things and 
decided she did not want to answer questions.  So she didn’t tell the police what 
had happened. 

11.During her trial we heard expert evidence from two psychiatrists.  For the 

defence Dr Shubsachs prepared a meticulous report.  In interviews with her he 
asked Hannah Bonser about 14 February when she killed Casey.  She said that 
bad thoughts were being put in her head in place of good ones.  However, she 
told him she could not remember buying the knives, being in Elmfield Park that 
day, or killing Casey.  Dr Shubsachs diagnosed Hannah Bonser as schizophrenic 
but observed in his report that her amnesia was unusual.  Later in his report he 
 
says: “I found the matter of her claimed memory loss strange”.  

12.We do know that Hannah Bonser has had a troubled history.  Her mother was an 

educated woman, who became obese, reported as being 30 stone at one point.  
She died when Hannah Bonser was about 10.  Because of his own illness her 
father was unable to cope and she and her brother spent time in foster care.  Her 
father died when she was 16.  When 17 years old, in 2002, she complained of 
hearing voices, was admitted to St Catherine’s in Doncaster and was diagnosed 
as having an emotionally unstable personality disorder.  On a second admission 
later that year she was diagnosed with mental and behaviour disorder due to
--------
abuse of cannabis.  There was then regular contact with out-patient psychiatric
 
 
 
services, and the prescription of medication, until 2007.  


13.From late 2007 until mid 2011 she seemed to have functioned without recourse 
to mental health services.  In 2011, however, there was a qualitative change in 
her presentation.  That was noticed by her friends.  In early October 2011 she 
was sectioned under the Mental Health Act while in London, the UCL doctors 
taking the view that she was psychotic.  On return to Doncaster she spent 5 days 
in St Catherine’s and was discharged.  In the following months she took several 
overdoses.  In the early New Year she said that she was a danger to herself and 
others, but denied any intent to harm.  She then spent 7 days in crisis 
accommodation at Rethink.  On her discharge she reported some improvement.  
She was then in contact with Rethink’s outreach services until the day before she 
murdered Casey. 

 

14.The jury have found Hannah Bonser guilty of murder.  That means that she will 

be sentenced to imprisonment for life.  However, I have to fix the minimum 
period before the Parole Board can order her release.  I emphasise that the term I 
fix is the minimum period.  

 

15. To fix the minimum period I must begin with a starting point.  	In my view the 

 
25 year starting point is appropriate in this case.  Hannah Bonser took the 
kitchen knife to the scene and used it to murder Casey.     

16. Having adopted the 25 year starting point it is then necessary to have regard to 

 
any aggravating and mitigating factors.  The only aggravating factor was 
Casey’s vulnerability, her young age.  However, I accept Mr Fish QC’s 
submission that although Casey was vulnerable she was not targeted as a 
vulnerable person. 

 

 

 

 

 

17.  Let me turn to the mitigating factors.	  To my mind there are four.  The first is that this 

 
was a random attack so there was no premeditation in the ordinary sense.  Secondly, 
Hannah Bonser is of good character and possibly emotionally underdeveloped.  
Thirdly, Mr Reeds QC did not put the prosecution case on the basis of an intention to
--------
kill from the outset.  Fourthly, and most significantly, Hannah Bonser suffers from a 
mental disorder or mental disability.  I accept the submission of both Mr Reeds QC 
 
and Mr Fish QC, that the more significant the mental disorder the greater it will be as 
a mitigating factor.  By their verdict, the jury have decided even if it was mental 
disorder such that it substantially impaired Hannah Bonser’s ability to understand 
what she was doing, to form a rational judgment or lose self-control, it did not provide 
an explanation for her murdering Casey. 

18. Taking all these factors into account, it seems to me that the appropriate minimum 

 
term in Hannah Boner’s case is 22 years.   

19. Hannah Bonser: I sentence you to life imprisonment with a minimum period of 22 

 
years, minus the time you have spent in custody.",2012-07-11 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Michael Kay QC 

 

12 July 2012 

 

Luton Crown Court 

 
 

 
In 1834 slavery was officially abolished in the British Empire pursuant to the Slavery 
Abolition Act.  It did not of course mean that overnight slavery, servitude or the incidence of 
forced labour came to an end.  However the passing of that statute was an important 
milestone in the advancement of basic human rights.  It recognised the right of each human 
being to live a life of dignity free from the worst forms of oppression and exploitation.  Thus 
what was commonplace until the 19th century in countries which presumed they were 
civilised was rendered illegal.  The unqualified right not to be made subject to slavery, 
servitude or forced labour is now enshrined in Article 4 of the European Convention on 
Human Rights.  There was however no statute in the UK after 1998 which specifically 
rendered the violation of that right illegal.  There was some debate in 2009 as to whether 
one was required having regard to the ambit of other criminal charges which prosecuting 
authorities had at their disposal. The view that prevailed in Parliament, which in the light of 
this case was amply justified, was that it was necessary to enact specific offences and so with 
effect from 6 April 2010 the holding of a person in servitude or requiring a person to perform 
forced labour was rendered illegal by section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.  So it 
is that nearly 200 years after slavery was officially abolished, four defendants have stood 
trial over a period of three months and been convicted of holding their fellow human beings 
in servitude and exacting from them forced labour.  I shall sentence two of those Defendants 
today, James John Connors and Josie Connors. 
 
In the course of evidence the court heard that it had long been the practice of Irish travelling 
families to offer food and accommodation in return for labour to vagrants or, as they were 
described, ‘men of the road’ who approached them to strike such a bargain.  Whatever may 
have been the position in the past, it is clear to me that James John Connors realised that 
there was a source of cheap labour available in our towns and cities.  The homeless, 
addicted and isolated men who sleep rough and beg on the streets were potential workers 
who could be exploited for financial gain.  These men were offered the prospect of money, 
food and accommodation in return for work.  The promise of pay in return for work was a 
monstrous and callous deceit.  Those vulnerable individuals who were approached were told 
that they would receive a daily wage for their labour which would be paid in cash.  The
--------
reality was that they were not paid and there was never any intention that they would be 
paid any significant sum and certainly not a regular daily wage.  The offer of pay was made 
so as to entice the men to enter the travellers’ site at which point more insidious methods of 
control and manipulation could be utilised to keep them in servitude and exact forced labour.  
 
Primarily the methods used by you James John Connors were brutality and intimidation.  
Assaults by way of punches, kicks, slaps or beatings with a weapon were committed to mark 
disapproval of insubordination or what was deemed to be an unacceptable standard or 
speed of work or to emphasise the hierarchy of control whether out of bad temper or 
calculated degradation.  Alongside the use of violence there was a constant threat of an 
assault if a worker did not act in the way demanded of him and of retribution if a worker left 
the family.  Threats were made of grave and even life threatening consequences if a worker 
sought to leave.  
 
As well as using physical means to keep workers in servitude, the defendants also acted 
towards them so as to apply and maintain psychological pressure.  In order to increase their 
sense of isolation, to strip them of their identity and degrade them, a number of measures 
were employed.   There was verbal abuse on a regular basis.  They were sworn at and called 
names which demeaned them.  There were not permitted to have any money.  Identity or 
private documents were removed and destroyed.  They were housed in accommodation 
which was markedly inferior to that enjoyed by the defendants and at times was unsuitable 
for human habitation.  Whilst workers lived in squalor in cramped and insanitary conditions, 
the Defendants enjoyed the comforts of their lavishly appointed caravans or static homes.  
Clothes were confiscated and thrown away.  In some cases, contrary to their preference, 
their heads were shaved.  They were required to work very long hours from 5am in the 
morning until late at night either on driveways or groundwork or on cleaning or domestic 
duties at the travellers’ site.  They were constantly at the beck and call of their bosses at any 
time of the day or night to carry out even the most trivial acts of service.  They were ordered 
not to leave the site and not to talk to anyone.  They were instructed that everything they 
needed was on site.  If stopped by the police or trading standards officers, they were 
ordered to say that they were happy, were being paid and did not want to leave.  By way of 
manipulation so as to increase their dependency, they were required to address members of 
the family as father and mother or uncle and aunt and they were indoctrinated to consider 
themselves as travellers and members of the family.  When they were seen at the Leighton 
Buzzard leisure centre being taken by a member of the family for a shower, they were 
described as grubby, unkempt, undernourished and submissive.  They walked silently in a 
line with their heads kept down as if in a chain gang.    
 
Over the years I am satisfied that many workers were recruited from the streets by you 
James John Connors and you Josie Connors were often present and certainly knew of the 
dishonest methods of recruitment.  Many were from abroad and spoke little English.  The 
vast majority, however desperate they were for a roof over their head, realised that the 
conditions were very bad, they were at risk of violence and the promised pay was not going 
to materialise.  They departed by running away during the night or disappearing when they 
were not being observed some of them doing so after a few hours or days.  There were only 
a small number who were so brutalised and degraded that their self esteem and courage to 
take matters into their own hands were wholly undermined.  They stayed for much longer 

Page 2 of 6
--------
periods.  They lost the independence of will required to escape.  Those men were valuable 
because they were a reliable source of essentially free labour for the business operated by 
you James John Connors but also for domestic or cleaning duties which you Josie Connors 
required of them.  They were being ruthlessly exploited for greed.  Substantial sums of 
money were generated as a result of their labour. 
 
The defendants, in particular James John Connors, have contended during the trial that they 
are the victims of a police conspiracy.  Perfectly proper concern for the welfare of the 
workers once they had left the site was characterised as sinister and improper inducements 
to encourage workers to provide false testimony.  The truth is that the genuine care and 
concern for the workers demonstrated by the activities of various voluntary agencies and 
the police contrasted sharply with the motives of the defendants in dishonestly enticing 
homeless men onto their site and exploiting them.  The defendants sought to suggest that 
they had done nothing wrong and the only reason they were on trial was because of racism 
against Irish travellers.  It was suggested they led an honourable and proud way of life which 
this prosecution was seeking to destroy.   They also presented themselves in court as 
religiously committed people.  The truth is this case is not about racism or the way of life of 
Irish travellers.  It is simply about a human being’s capacity to be inhumane to a fellow 
human being.  The way in which these defendants, for their own financial benefit, brutalised, 
manipulated and exploited men who were already plumbing the depths of despair as 
homeless beggars is pure evil.  Their behaviour is profoundly at odds with the moral code of 
the religion they profess and indeed of any moral code whether it is based on religious or 
secular beliefs.  Their complete disdain for the dignity and fundamental rights of their fellow 
human beings is shocking.  They were not good Samaritans seeking to assist their fellow man 
in his hour of need and treating him as they would wish to be treated but violent, cold 
hearted exploiters of his frailties and ill fortune.  
 
The maximum sentence for a single offence of holding another in servitude or requiring 
another to perform forced labour is 14 years imprisonment.  This is the first case that has 
reached a conclusion in the courts of this country concerning these new offences.  There are 
no sentencing guidelines. Unsurprisingly, Counsel have been unable to place before me any 
precedents as to appropriate sentencing levels.  This is a difficult sentencing exercise not 
only because of the absence of guidance but also because the sentences I am required to 
pass are for offences which cruelly deprive a person of his liberty and it is difficult to put a 
tariff on freedom.   
 
I approach the task of sentencing on the basis that I have uppermost in my mind the 
requirements of punishment and deterrence (in a general sense rather than based on any 
local prevalence of this type of offending). I also keep in mind that I am sentencing for 
offences committed between 6 April 2010 and 18 July 2011.  However the evidence has 
been clear that the conduct of the defendants towards their workers and in particular M did 
not suddenly begin or change on 6 April 2010.  It had been going on for many years and 
simply continued into the period when s.71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 came into 
force albeit it may have become worse in the two years or so prior to July 2011.  In so far as 
there is evidence of similar behaviour towards M prior to 6 April 2010 this is a significant 
aggravating factor.  I also have considered the principle of totality in arriving at my 
conclusions as to the appropriate and just sentence in all the circumstances.

James John Connors and Josie Connors 
 
You have been convicted of being jointly responsible for (i) holding M in servitude between 6 
April 2010 and 18 July 2011 and P in servitude between January and 18 July 2011 and (ii) 
requiring each of them to perform forced or compulsory labour between the same dates.  
You James John Connors have also been convicted of multiple incidents of assault 
occasioning actual bodily harm on M committed between 2004 and 2011 amounting to a 
course of conduct. 
 
M was recruited in 2004 when you James John Connors saw him in a distressed state at a 
service station near Tamworth.  He was a registered alcoholic.  Over a period of three 
months he was weaned off alcohol.  Your purpose was to put him to work.  After he had 
been rescued by the police from your car on 18 July 2011 he was initially reluctant to speak 
about the reality of his experiences at your hands.  His mind had been manipulated to 
believe that, even though he was very much older than both of you, you were his surrogate 
parents and he was part of your family.  After a couple of weeks when he had overcome the 
trauma of his release, he spoke more openly about life on the travellers’ site.  He lived in a 
caravan that had no toilet or washing facilities.  He was not permitted to use the facilities 
available to you and was required to go to the toilet in a neighbouring field.  He was taken 
irregularly to have a shower in Leighton Buzzard.  Much of the time the only food available 
was eggs and bread.  He worked from about 5am until anything up to 9pm on driveway work 
and was then required to clean your living accommodation to an immaculate standard.  He 
never had a day off.  He was not paid. He described you James John Connors as a very nasty 
and violent man.  He said that if you James John Connors were in a mood, you would have a 
go at him or other workers.  He got a hiding and was verbally abused if he did anything 
wrong or was not working fast enough.  He said towards the end of the time with you he was 
being beaten and practically starved.  He said he was punched, kicked and hit with a broom 
handle and suffered many black eyes.  He described life as abuse, torture and being treated 
like a slave.  He was scared of you James John Connors and did not have the courage to leave 
for fear of what might happen.  He was expected to talk to new workers to persuade them 
to stay.  He described you Josie Connors as very insulting and abusive.  You reported any 
perceived misdemeanour to your husband who then resorted to violence in your presence.  
On one occasion, for breaking one of Josie’s favourite vases, you James John punched and 
kicked him breaking his finger.  On another occasion, when he went into a neighbouring plot 
to get a cigarette, Josie reported this to you James John and you assaulted him with a broom 
handle and punched and kicked him causing multiple injuries.  These are but examples of the 
many incidents of violence.  When he broke his heel falling through a garage roof he was not 
initially taken to hospital but only when his leg was severely swollen.  He was forced by 

Page 4 of 6
--------
James John Connors to discharge himself and was put back to work when he was still in 
plaster. 
 
P managed to contact the police and make his escape on 18 July 2011.  He alerted the police 
to the whereabouts of M.    He was recruited by you James John Connors in Josie’s presence 
in Wembley in late March 2011.  He was offered £80 per day for his labour.  He received no 
pay throughout his time with you despite working up to sixteen hours a day with very few 
breaks.  His personal possessions and documents were taken from him.  He was forced by 
the two of you to hand over his benefit monies.  He confirmed much of what was said by M 
about the living conditions on Plot 12 at the Greenacres site.  The conditions were squalid 
and at times they were starving.  You Josie Connors told him that if he ever used the toilet 
facilities you and James John had available you would break his arms and legs.  He too had to 
go to the toilet in a field and was taken only occasionally for a shower in Leighton Buzzard.  
He said he was being mentally tortured and felt worse than a slave.  He felt intimidated by 
and scared of you James John Connors in case you became violent. He witnessed violence 
committed against M. He was humiliated on one occasion by being forced to travel for about 
30 minutes in the boot of your car and to sing nursery rhymes from that position to your 
child.  He said that you Josie Connors abused and threatened him. You Josie Connors said in 
front of your husband that if he tried to leave you would get someone to murder him.  To a 
man as vulnerable as P that was and was meant to be a serious threat.   He was too scared to 
leave for fear of being caught and beaten up. 
 
 
You, James John Connors, have previous convictions for an offence of dishonesty in 1995 
and theft in 2011.  You have no convictions for violence.  You have been described as a 
family man concerned principally about your wife and children.  If that was your concern 
then it is alarming that you allowed your children to be raised in an atmosphere of 
intimidation and violence to men held in servitude.  Your treatment of M was particularly 
brutal and inhumane.  It is aggravated by the fact that you treated him in this way for some 
time before 6 April 2010. For each of the two offences relating to your treatment of M the 
sentence is 7 years imprisonment concurrent.  For the offence of assault on him relating to 
multiple incidents which amounted to a course of conduct, the sentence is 3 years 
imprisonment concurrent.  For each of the two offences relating to your treatment of P the 
sentence is 4 years imprisonment concurrent but consecutive to the sentence in respect of 
M.  The total sentence is 11 years.  The days spent on remand for which you will receive 
credit against your sentence are 303. 
 
 
You Josie Connors have no previous convictions.  You are aged 31 and the mother of 3 
children aged 9, 3 and 7 months.  I am conscious of the fact that imprisonment will be a 
particular mental and psychological strain for you.  However my inclination to exercise 
mercy is tempered by the horrific nature of the crimes you have committed. 
You played a less significant role than your husband in keeping M and P in servitude and 
requiring them to perform forced labour.  Nevertheless you issued serious threats which 
undermined their confidence and assisted your husband in overriding their free will.  You 
were quite content to report to your husband any conduct which you regarded as worthy of 
punishment and witnessed your husband mete out such punishment.  You also took the 

Page 5 of 6
--------
benefit of having unpaid workers who could be at your disposal whether to clean or carry 
out other household duties.  For each of the two offences relating to your treatment of M 
the sentence is 2.5 years imprisonment concurrent.  For each of the two offences relating to 
your treatment of P the sentence is 1.5 years imprisonment concurrent but consecutive to 
the sentence in respect of M. The total sentence is 4 years imprisonment.  You will receive 
credit against your sentence for one day spent on remand.

NEIL GREATREX 

 

 
IN THE NOTTINGHAM CROWN COURT 

(SITTING AT BIRMINGHAM) 

27 APRIL 2012 

 
You are 61 years of age. 
 
At the trial it was evident that you had earned the respect of many for your 
work in the Nottingham UDM of which you became President, the union of 
which you also became the National President. 
 
I have heard more this morning of the work you have done on behalf of 
miners over the years, of the respect earned through that work but also of the 
hostility generated when you founded the union. And of the hostility directed 
toward you and your family since your conviction. 
 
I have heard of and take into account the health difficulties you have, in 
particular with your hearing. 
 
I accept that you were through the 1980s and 1990s a hardworking man 
dedicated to the cause of miners and their welfare. 
 
As President of the Union you became a trustee of a registered charity the 
Nottinghamshire Miners Convalescent Home which provided for sick and 
retired miners at a convalescent home in Chapel St Leonards. As the numbers 
of miners declined rapidly in the 1990s so the demand for this home for 
miners in ill health diminished and the decision was taken to operate the 
home as a commercial residential home and to pay a rent from the home and 
any profits from the company that was to operate it into the charity.
--------
A trading company was set up for this purpose, the Phoenix Nursing and 
Residential Home Ltd. It was incorporated in 1998.  It was not a company in 
which shares were issued to profit shareholders, it was a company limited by 
Guarantee. It was set up for the purpose of and intended by all to trade on 
behalf of the charity. 
 
The Directors were Trustees of the charity. The company was incorporated in 
order to provide funds for the charity. 
 
In 1999 a scheme approved by the Charity Commissioners widened the object 
of the charity so that it became the duty of the trustees to provide for the sick, 
disabled or infirm who worked or had worked in the mining industry and their 
families by providing them with residential and nursing care and making 
grants to them. The accounts of the charity through the period of this 
indictment demonstrate it was active and that there were many who could 
benefit from its work and resources. 
 
As a trustee of the charity you were not entitled to profit from your role. I am 
satisfied there was never any intention on the part of the trustees that you 
would be entitled to profit from your role as director of the Company which 
was to serve the charity.  
 
You were the leader of the Nottinghamshire UDM. In that role and as National 
President you drew a salary. In evidence you told the court that as long ago as 
1987 your salary was £67000 and it rose somewhat, you drew additional 
salary in your role as National President and a further salary as a Director of 
Vendside a company incorporated by you and by Mr Stevens and said on the 
face of its notepaper to be acting on behalf of the union of democratic 
mineworkers. The Union also provided a contribution to the costs of your 
mortgage. 
 
The benefits you enjoyed from the Union exceeded on your own calculation 
£110,000. 
 
One of the duties you owed in the post of President was to act conscientiously 
as a trustee for the charity for sick and retired miners without further profit. I 
have no doubt that the work you undertook in administering the Home 
occupied a significant amount of your time. But you were being paid well as a 
full time employee. 
 
After the incorporation of the company you saw an opportunity to make 
personal profit at the expense of those less fortunate than yourself whose 
interest you had agreed as trustee to protect. 
 
I reject as did the jury that you had an honest belief that you were entitled to 
payment for your work at the Home. If you had had any such belief I have no 
doubt that you would have canvassed with advisors how such payment might 
be made. 
 
As works were regularly being done by contractors at the union offices and the 
residential home you saw and seized upon the opportunity to have works done
--------
at your own home and the home of your fellow director and then to charge 
those sums to the business of the charity. 
 
Over the years you wanted works done at your own home and the home of 
your co-director; outside paving, a new kitchen, new windows and doors, 
many supplies of building materials. Works and materials that with the salary 
 
you were paid you could have afforded. 
 
This was calculated and sophisticated greed. You used your influence with 
contractors to persuade them to provide false invoices, each of them knowing 
your position and no doubt hoping for further work. On occasions you used 
your pre-eminent position within the offices to require employees to make 
payments by cheque without supporting invoices. 
 
 
While I accept that you did not have the whole of the benefit, your co-director 
 
was working within another part of the union’s business and providing you 
with benefit from that. Not I stress a benefit which was unlawful. 
 
Over the 5 year period of this indictment you stole very nearly £150,000 from 
 
those you held office to protect. 
 
I look to the guidelines of sentencing for those who steal in breach of trust. 
This was theft in breach of the highest degree of trust. It was carried out over 
an extended period by the person in whom the highest trust had been placed. 
 
It was done for greed; the thefts were covered by invoices procured from 
traders who were persuaded to supply the false invoice in order to secure 
payment. It carried on up to the time the investigation commenced. 
 
So far as the offence is concerned there is no mitigation. You have never 
accepted you have done anything wrong despite the blatant breach of trust 
and procurement of false invoices. You were convicted by a jury. 
 
I have had regard to your previous good character, the contents of the Pre-
Sentence report and to all that has been said on your behalf. 
  
I regard this as a course of offending and so will pass concurrent sentences in 
respect of all offences but the sentence on each offence reflects the 
aggravation of the fact that it was part of a sustained fraud. 
 
The least possible sentence I can pass is one of 4 years imprisonment 
concurrent upon each count. You will serve up to half of the sentence in 
custody before your release on licence, you must then abide by the terms of 
your licence or you will be returned to custody to serve the remainder of the 
sentence. 
 
The determination of issues of costs, compensation and confiscation are 
postponed to 29th June.",2012-04-27 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

MARGARET MORAN
 
 

 

 

27 APRIL 2012 
 

 

 

 

 
JUDGMENT ON WHETHER DEFENDANT IS UNDER A DISABILITY 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.	  It is asserted on behalf of the Defendant that she is unfit to plead and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore under a disability. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

   
 

 
 

 
   

2.	  By virtue of s. 4 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 as amended, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that decision is to be made by me on the basis of evidence given by 
 
registered medical practitioners. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.	  In this case, I have considered reports from Dr. Kelly and Dr. Joseph 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed by the Defence and reports from Dr. Chesterman instructed by the 
 
Prosecution. In addition Dr. Joseph has given evidence in front of me. It has 
 
not been necessary for Dr. Chesterman to give evidence because, while there 
 
is a difference of emphasis between the reports, there is agreement on the 
 
question which the court has to determine. 
  

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

4.	  The issue that I have to decide is whether the Defendant is sufficiently able to 
 
participate in the proceedings to make a proper defence. That requires her to 
 
be able to instruct her lawyers as to her case, to understand the evidence and 
 
to give evidence. These are the relevant parts of the legal test established in 
 
the case of Pritchard in 1836. It is and has been the law of this country for a 
 
very long time that a person shall not be required to plead to allegations 
 
which they are not fit to consider or answer. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.	  Because it is the Defence that have raised the issue it is for them to prove it 
 

 
on the balance of probabilities.  The prosecution however accept that the 
 
 
Defendant is unfit to plead and the evidence from all the psychiatrists 
 
supports that conclusion. 
  
 

6.	  All the psychiatrists who have examined the Defendant agree that she is 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

suffering from a depressive illness which is properly described as a mental 
 
illness. It is not to be confused with what is colloquially called depression 
 
which many of us feel when things are going badly and we are feeling down.
--------
Dr. Joseph in his reports describes the depressive illness suffered by Mrs. 
 
 
Moran as severe. Dr. Kelly, who is the Defendant’s treating psychiatrist, 
 
 
agrees. Dr. Chesterman’s opinion is that the depressive illness is more 
 
 
properly described as moderate. 
  
 

7.	  Dr Joseph in his evidence to me described the Defendant as ‘a broken 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman’ who is a real threat to herself and whose condition has deteriorated 
 
 
significantly with the threat of court proceedings.

career would cause considerable upset to Mrs Moran. However the 
 
psychiatrists have concluded that, at the time, she was mentally fragile 
 
because of her genetic history and episodes in her past which she had been 
 
 
able to keep submerged while she lived a busy and exciting life as a MP but 
 
had now come to the surface. It was the effect of these events combined 
 
with the underlying mental fragility which has caused Mrs Moran to suffer a 
 
mental illness from which she has been unable to recover despite out patient 
 
treatment for a considerable period of time. She is likely always to remain 
 
susceptible to relapse and the symptoms she presently has are unlikely to 
 
 
resolve for some considerable period of time after these proceedings are 
 
 
concluded. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

9.	  All the psychiatrists are agreed that the Defendant is not in a fit state to 
 
 

follow the proceedings, instruct her lawyers or to give evidence on her own 
 
behalf. Dr. Joseph has attempted to discuss the allegations with her and is 
 
 
satisfied that she is not able to give proper instructions. He recorded her as 
 
 
saying ‘I just want to plead guilty and be punished’ but in his view and my 
 
judgement that is unlikely to have been a response reached after a proper 
 
consideration of the allegations and is simply an attempt to get the matter 
 
over with and assuage  feelings of guilt which may  relate to other matters. 
 
 
10. In those circumstances, as the evidence is all one way, and the application is 
 
 
not opposed I find on the balance of probabilities that the Defendant is under 
 
a disability and is unfit to plead. 
 
 
 
 
should be understood that courts act on evidence. In this case all the experts 
 
are well aware of their duty to the court to give objective and unbiased 
 
evidence and reports have been obtained by both sides and are in broad 
 
agreement. While there has not been complete agreement on every detail as 
 
 
I have indicated, all the experts agree that the Defendant is unfit to plead. 
 
 
 
Defendant did the acts alleged by the prosecution.

SWANSEA CROWN COURT 


 

 

 
ON APPEAL FROM THE MAGISTRATES’ COURT
 

 

 
APPEAL JUDGMENT OF MR JUSTICE  WYN WILLIAMS
 

 
SITTING WITH TWO MAGISTRATES 

 
APPEAL NO: A20120033 

 

30 MARCH 2012 

On 19 March 2012 the Appellant pleaded guilty at the Swansea Magistrates’ Court to 
an offence contrary to section 31(1)(b) of the Public Order Act 1986.  By his plea he 
admitted  that  he  used  threatening,  abusive  or  insulting  words  with  intent  to  cause 
 
harassment, alarm or distress to users of the Twitter Internet Messaging Service.  He 
 
also accepted that his offence was racially aggravated.  

Following his plea of guilty the case was adjourned for a Pre-Sentence Report. 

At a sentencing hearing on 27 March District Judge Charles sentenced the Appellant 
to a term of 56 days’ imprisonment.  The Appellant now appeals to this Court against 
 
his sentence. 

It is important to begin by explaining, fully, what it is that the Appellant did. 

During  the  late  afternoon  of  Saturday  17  March  a  football  match  was  taking  place 
between Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur.  42 minutes into the game one of 
the  Bolton  Wanderers  players,  Fabrice  Muamba  collapsed  on  the  pitch.    Almost 
immediately it was appreciated that the player was gravely ill.  

The Appellant was watching the game on television.  Earlier that afternoon he had 
watched the rugby match between Wales and France and he had consumed a great 
deal to drink.  His estimate is that he had consumed 15 cans of Carling lager.  He has 
always maintained that he was drunk and we have no reason to think otherwise. 

About 90 minutes after the Appellant had first seen Mr Muamba lying prostrate on the 
pitch he posted a message on Twitter to the following effect:- 

“LOL fuck Muamba he’s dead” 

LOL is accepted to mean laugh out loud.
--------
As well as posting this message on his own account the Appellant linked the 
message to a site call Ha Ha.  That meant that what he had written was capable 
of being read not just by those persons who followed the Appellant's Twitter 
 
account but by any other user of Twitter. 

 
8.	 

The  Appellant's  message  provoked  very  strong  responses.    The  first  response  was 
from a person who wrote:- 

“You my friend are a grade A cunt heartless bastard.” 

We are told and it is not disputed that this response came from a black man.  The 
Appellant replied:-

“I am not your friend, you wog cunt, go pick some cotton.” 

As we understand it this exchange was available to all persons using Twitter.  Many 
 
further  messages  were  posted  aimed  at  the  Appellant.    The  Appellant  received 
messages  which  were  extremely  critical  of  him  and  written  in  abusive  language. 
 
However,  this  did  not  cause  him  to  desist.    Over  the  course  of  the  next  hour  or 
thereabouts  he  posted  at  least  8  messages  which  were  extremely  abusive  and 
insulting.  All the messages were available to be read by persons who could access 
Twitter.  Two  of  these  messages  were  expressly  racial;  not  only  were  the  messages 
expressly racial but were couched in terms which can only be regarded as extremely 
offensive.  One read, 

“You  are  a  silly  cunt  your  mother’s  a  wog  and  your  dad  is  a  rapist, 
 
bonjour you scruff northern cunt.” 

A second read 

“Go suck a nigger dick you fucking aids-ridden cunt.”

10.	 

 
11.	 

 
12.	 

There came a point in time when the Appellant began to realise the enormity of his 
 
behaviour.  That  occurred  when  one  of  his  friends  sent  him  a  message  urgently 
querying what he was doing.  He then apologised online for what he had done. 

 

The  Appellant's  behaviour  provoked  a  number  of  complaints  to  the  police.    A 
 
complaint  was  made  to  the  Northumbrian  Police  Force  and  we  are  told  that  other 
forces  were  also  contacted  by  members  of  the  public  who  were  outraged  by  the 
Appellant's behaviour.  The Appellant was traced quite quickly.  At 10.18 on Sunday 
18 March two police officers attended at his address in Swansea; they arrested him 
and cautioned him and he immediately admitted that he had posted racist comments 
on Twitter.  He told the officers that he was drunk at the time, that he didn’t mean it 
and that he was really sorry. 

That afternoon the Defendant was interviewed under caution.  He made no attempt to 
hide what he had done. 

The Appellant is aged 21.  He is a student studying biology at Swansea University. 
  
He  has  no  previous  convictions.  However,  it  is  of  some  relevance  that  on  9  April 
2011 he was issued with a penalty notice.  That penalty notice was issued in respect of 
engaging  in  threatening  abusive  or  insulting  behaviour  and  using  words  likely  to
--------
cause  harassment,  alarm  or  distress.    This  penalty  notice  came  about  because  on  9 
April  2011  there  was  a  disturbance  outside  Wetherspoon’s  public  house;  the 
Appellant  was  detained  by  door  staff.    He  engaged  in  a  violent  struggle  and  when 
police  officers  arrived  he  started  swearing  at  them  and  making  threats  at  them  and 
despite their warnings he persisted. 

 
13.	 

An appeal to the Crown Court is an appeal by way of re-hearing.  We have not been 
provided with a transcript of the sentencing remarks of the District Judge.  

 

14.	  Mr  Hobson,  on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  expressly  acknowledges  that  the  Appellant 
deserves  significant  punishment  for  the  offence  which  he  committed.    Mr  Hobson 
does not submit that a sentence of imprisonment was wrong in principle.  He does 
submit, however, that such are the mitigating factors in this case that we can take a 
 
course of action which is alternative to an immediate sentence of imprisonment.  Mr 
Hobson invites us to impose a stringent community order or a suspended sentence of 
imprisonment coupled with appropriate punitive requirements.  We should record that 
Mr  Hobson  expressly  accepts  that  if  a  sentence  of  immediate  imprisonment  is  the 
appropriate sentence a term of 56 days was not too long. 

 
15.	 

The mitigating factors which are pressed upon us are these.  First, this offence was 
 
completely  out  of  character  for  the  Appellant.    We  have  been  provided  with  a 
selection of measured and moderate character references which suggest that this is so. 
 
Second, the Appellant has no previous convictions.  Third, he pleaded guilty at the 
first  available  opportunity  having  earlier  admitted  his  offence  to  the  police  officers 
who interviewed him.  Fourth, the case has attracted a great deal of publicity.  The 
Appellant has been the subject of harsh comment in some quarters and he has become 
 
a figure of some notoriety.  Mr Hobson submits that this is a significant punishment in 
itself.  Fifth, the Appellant is genuinely remorseful. We accept that all these points 
have a degree of validity.  It is not suggested that this offence can be excused in any 
way by the fact the Appellant had consumed a great deal of alcohol. 

 
16.	 

There are no applicable sentencing guidelines.  We have been referred to no previous 
decided  cases  either  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  or  at  the  Crown  Court  to  assist  in 
determining an appropriate sentence for this type of offence. 

 

17.	  We have reached the clear conclusion that a sentence of immediate imprisonment was 
justified in this case.  The words used by the Appellant were extremely offensive.  We 
accept that the express racial content of the words were not aimed, specifically, at the 
stricken footballer but there can be no avoiding the conclusion that the Appellant’s 
offence  was  committed  in  the  context  of  the  grave  illness  which  had  suddenly 
 
afflicted Mr Muamba. 

 
18.	 

 
19.	 

It must also be emphasised that the Appellant has pleaded guilty to a crime of specific 
intent.  He intended to use words which were offensive and he intended that the words 
 
should be racially offensive. 

In our judgment, to repeat, a sentence of immediate imprisonment is justified in such 
 
circumstances even for a young man with no previous convictions and with the other 
personal mitigation available to this Appellant.
--------
20.	 

As  we  have  said  Mr  Hobson  does  not  submit  that  the  length  of  the  sentence  was 
inappropriate if a sentence of imprisonment was otherwise justified.

Accordingly this appeal is dismissed.",2012-03-30 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HIS HONOUR JUDGE ANTHONY RUSSELL QC, RECORDER
 
 

 
OF PRESTON
 

PONTINS LIMITED – DEFENDANT 
 

 
 
 
Pontins Limited are to be sentenced for two offences of infringing the Health and Safety at 
Work etc Act 1974 by failing in their duty to protect persons and their employees against 
risks to health and safety. The case involves two incidents where visitors staying at their 
premises in Blackpool who as a consequence of the company’s failure of its duty contracted 
Legionnaire’s Disease in March and July 2009. Tragically one of those people, Mrs Karen 
Taylor, died and the other, Mrs Margaret Coote was very ill indeed, and fortunate to have 
pulled through her ordeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Before I go further I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Mrs Taylor. Her 
husband had to give evidence in the case because the case had to be proved by the 
prosecution and that was clearly a very distressing experience for him. I also wish to offer my 
sympathy to Mrs Coote and her family. Inevitably everyone will have been subject to strain 
as a result of the regrettably inevitable length of time that these investigations take and the 
 
trial process. 
 
Having heard the evidence with the jury I am satisfied that this is indeed as the prosecution 
submits a shocking and grave case. In 2006 the company was alerted to a potential problem 
of legionella bacteria at the site. Although the illness could not be directly attributed to the 
visit of a patient who contracted Legionnaire’s Disease the investigation that followed should 
have alerted the company to the need for vigilance.  
 
They had the benefit of detailed risk assessments and reports from Western Environmental 
yet despite these specific reports and all the material readily available from the Health and 
Safety Executive they failed to take any or any adequate measures to address the problems.  
 
The evidence revealed that for a considerable period of time the company was aware of the 
water temperature problems not only from these reports but also from their own employees 
 
who expressed their concerns. There was a serious failure of management to address these 
issues. 
 
Serious injury to health was foreseeable – the documentation and the various reports 
 
indicated an obvious risk to health which should have been acted upon. Warnings from the 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
Council, employees and Western Environmental were ignored. The quality of these warnings 
was such that the matter must have been considered at the highest level of management. 
 
Even after the incident involving Mrs Coote was known about no action was taken with the 
consequence that Mrs Taylor was put at risk. 
 
 
As Mr Parrington has pointed out there are many aggravating features to which I have just 
referred and little mitigation other than that the company did take some steps after Mrs 
 
Taylor had died by engaging Western Environmental  and later in 2009 the premises were 
closed down. 
 
There were serious management failings here and those who were responsible should have 
the death of Mrs Taylor and the ill-health of Mrs Coote on their consciences.  
 
The company is in administration and I have been satisfied that there are no assets from 
which any appropriate financial penalty could be met. If I were to impose a fine of the 
appropriate amount all that would happen is that if there are any funds, the distribution to 
others who have suffered at the hands of this company, namely legitimate creditors, would 
be diminished or extinguished because any fine would go to the Exchequer. 
 
I have been informed that the company was properly insured and that insurance claims have 
been met or are being processed in accordance with the law, and it is unusual for a criminal 
 
court to make awards of compensation  in these sort of cases because the defendants are 
usually insured. 
 
This means that the fine I shall impose will be a nominal one. However I do consider that it 
is important for me to indicate the level of fine I would have been considering imposing had 
this company been solvent and able to meet its obligation, because it is important for those 
who operate premises to which the public has access whether as employees or visitors to 
appreciate that there are risks, that reasonable steps must be taken to avoid risks to health 
and that if they fail in their duty to guard against such risks severe financial penalties will 
follow. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 I have considered the Guidelines provided by the Sentencing Guidelines Council and it is 
appropriate to quote from them: 

 
“Level of fines 
 
22. There will inevitably be a broad range of fines because of the range of seriousness 

 

 

involved and the differences in the circumstances of the defendants. Fines must be 
punitive and sufficient to have an impact on the defendant. 

 

 

23. Fines cannot and do not attempt to value a human life in money. Civil compensation 

 
will be payable separately. The fine is designed to punish the defendant and is 
therefore tailored not only to what it has done but also to its individual 
circumstances. 
        

24. 
25. The range of seriousness involved in health and safety offences is greater than for 
 
corporate manslaughter. However, where the offence is shown to have caused death, the 
appropriate fine will seldom be less than £100,000 and may be measured in hundreds 
of thousands of pounds or more.” 
 
Having considered all the factors in this case, it is impossible to set a precise figure for the 
fine because a factor which would also be taken into consideration is the profits of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
company, however assuming that this company was making reasonable profits I would have 
been thinking in terms of a fine of £500,000 with an order that the company should pay the 
whole of the costs of the prosecution which would be considerably more than the £10,000 
figure given in this case. 
 
As it is, given the unusual circumstances there will be a fine of £1,000. There is an order for 
payment of the Victim Surcharge of £15, which must be imposed in every case where a fine is 
ordered. Those sums should be paid within 28 days. There will be an order for costs in the 
 
sum of £10,000 which I take it will not be enforced.

JUDICIARY OF
ENGLAND AND WALES
HHJ GLEDHILL QC
SOUTHWARK CROWN COURT
REGINA -V- JAMES JEFFERV
SENTENCING REMARKS
13 APRIL 2012

Police officers attended your home address in possession of a search warrant in the early hours of
the 9th of March 2012. You were arrested on suspicion of committing computer misuse offences. You
were subsequently charged with the 2 offences | now have to sentence you for, namely, causing a
computer to perform a function with intent to secure unauthorised access to a programme or data
held in a computer, contrary to $1 (1) and (3) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and making
unauthorised access to a computer with intent of impairing the operation of that computer, contrary
to 3 (2) of the Act. You pleaded guilty to both offences at the first appearance before the
Magistrates Court on the 10th of March 2012. You are therefore entitled to maximum credit for
pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity.
At the time you committed these offences you have strong views about abortion —you believe it is
morally wrong. I know that you are now saying that this was not so, but it is confirmed by what you
said to a correspondent on Twitter after you had revealed you had hacked the British Pregnancy
Advice Service web site, by what you said in interview about your disapproval of 2 friends who had
had abortions and by the anti—abortion statement you put on the home page of the website. Just as
many people disagree with the view you held, many do agree. However, those who find abortion
repugnant do not use this as an excuse to justify deliberately committing criminal offences. That is
exactly what you have done.
lam satisfied that you targeted the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. I do not accept your
explanation that the ""Leaning Penetration Software” you used threw up the name simply as a web
site that was susceptible or vulnerable to hacking. BPAS is a non profit making charity and is the
largest abortion provider in the country. Over 60,000 women seek its help every year and of those
about 53,000 women have abortions. It also provides counselling and advice in cases of unplanned
pregnancies, on contraception and sterilisation. Mr Wallace describes you as a computer genius or
whizz kid. Certainly, you have completed 2 years of a software university course. Your skills are so
good that you decided to hack into their website and you succeeded. You stole the records of
approximately 10,000 women. Many of them were vulnerable women, vulnerable, simply because
they had had a termination, for example, or because of their youth or because their family did not
know of their situation. You were proud of what you had done — you boasted about it on Twitter.
You said that you intended to publish the personal details of these women — their names, addresses,
--------
telephone numbers and email addresses. You put the stolen data in what is known as Pastebin so
that anyone could access it. You were able to prove that you could release this highly sensitive data,
and would do it, by tweeting the name and log—on details of one of the BPAS administrators. That act
in itself gave anyone access to the BPAS data base. In my view, it is significant that the online name
you used on Twitter was that of the notorious Columbian criminal Pablo Escobar.
You are a linked to a hacking group called Anonymous. You say in mitigation, that although you knew
what this group was all about you were not a member, though you had been in communication with
a member since the previous February. You say that your communication with that person was not
about hacking but was principally about your mutual interest in music. I do not accept this
explanation. You are distancing yourself from the group. In addition to stealing the details of the
Service's clients, you deliberately defaced its website with Anonymous’s logo and a statement that
made abundantly clear your anti—abortion views. That statement has been seen by the BPAS before
and therefore I can accept that you did cut and paste it from a search engine. But it reflected your
views at the time. Why else would you post it on the home page of the web site so that it would be
seen by anyone logging on. It begins by stating that an unborn child does not have an opinion, a
choice or any rights, and asks why anyone else should have the right to murder an unborn child and
profit from that murder.
The BPAS were aware on the day you committed the offences that their security had been breached
and therefore informed the police. The police acted with commendable speed and they were able
within hours to trace the breach to your address. When they arrived at your home in the early hours
of 9 March 2012 they found that your own computer was in the process of being wiped clean. I
accept that by the time the police arrived you had changed your mind about releasing the stolen
data. But as Mr Wallace says, by then it was too late. It was in the public domain. However it does
not appear to have been accessed.
In terms of culpability you offending is very serious for the reasons I have already set out:

o The unlawful use of your undoubted computer skills,

0 The accessing of the software that allowed you to hack into the BPAS web site,

0 Your moving of the stolen data into Pastebin,

- Your intention to release the highly sensitive personal data without any regard to the

consequences to the individual women or the charity,

0 Your defacing of the home page of the website, which would be seen by anyone logging on

0 Your boasting on Twitter of what you had done,

0 Your publishing the details of the BPAS administrators details to prove what you had done,

0 That those details allowed anyone to access confidential information.
| ask what harm your offending has done. To the charity itself, the fear is that great harm may have
been done — only time will tell whether the consequences of your actions are as grave as is feared.
The fear is that women will have no confidence that their personal details and records are secure
and will stop using the service. To the women themselves, great anxiety will already have been
caused to those who have learned about this case, and no doubt further distress will be caused
when others hear of your wrongdoing.
In these circumstances, lam satisfied that the custody threshold has been passed and that this case
can only be dealt with by way of an immediate custodial sentence.
I take into account the mitigation that is available to you.

0 That you pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity,

0 That you immediately admitted the offences in interview following arrest,
--------
0 That your intention to release the data was relatively short—lived,

- That no one seems to have accessed the data,

0 I accept that you regret what you have done and now realise the potential consequences —I

take into account the contents of the letter I have addressed from you to the BPAS.

As far as your personal mitigation is concerned, the devastating consequences to your education and
a promising career in computers can count as little in the circumstances. I appreciate the effect of a
prison sentence on your partner and your step child, but you bear the responsibility for that. I accept
that you were suffering from depression at the time of the offences, or were at least at a low ebb.
But this cannot mitigate what you have done.
The sentence that I impose are both to punish you for what you have done and to send out a clear
message of deterrence to anyone tempted to commit similar hacking offences.
