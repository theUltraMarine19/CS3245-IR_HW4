2757589,R v RM [2011] NSWSC 861,"Judgment 

1The accused is charged with the murder of her son, BM, on 24 August 2009. The trial of the accused has proceeded as a trial by judge alone after the accused made an election pursuant to s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to be tried in that fashion. The accused indicated that she had received advice from her solicitor before making the election and the Crown indicated its consent to the matter taking the course which was proposed. Section 133 of the Act casts certain obligations upon the judge in reaching a verdict in such a trial. I have had regard to those obligations: Fleming v R (1998) 197 CLR 250. 

2It is common ground that the accused killed the deceased with the requisite intention to constitute the offence of murder. Accordingly, the only issue which I have to determine is whether the accused was mentally ill at the time of the killing. Even upon that issue the evidence is all one way and the parties are in agreement that I should find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. 

Background to the fatal incident 

3The accused, who is aged 34, and her former de facto partner of five (5) years, DW, are the natural parents of BM who was 17 months old at the time of his death. The accused gave birth to BM by way of emergency c-section at John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, on 18 March 2008. He was a healthy child at birth and remained in good health until his death. He was their only child. Although the couple resided together, it appears that for some time they had done so for the sake of their child. Indeed at the relevant time they were occupying separate bedrooms. 

4The accused was a practising psychologist, having graduated from the University of New England. She remained in practice until 2006, at which time she was the subject of a complaint to the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) by one of her former patients, as a result of which she was de-registered in 2008. 

5The police investigation shows that as a child the accused was exposed to sexually inappropriate behaviour by her step-father and her mother. She reported that her step-father was violent and that he made frequent threats to kill himself. The accused's medical records show that she has suffered from mental health issues, particularly anxiety, since her teenage years. The first recorded incident of a panic attack in which medical attention was sought was in 1992 when she was 15. I have been provided with a great deal of material which addresses those issues. Although I have had regard to it, it is unnecessary to refer to every aspect of it. The medical records link her mental health problems to her history of abuse as a child. 

6The accused has been hospitalised on two occasions after taking an overdose of prescribed medications. The first occasion was in May 2004. Her GP, Dr Bailey, reported that the accused was suffering from severe depression, anxiety and panic disorder and had attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs that had been prescribed for her. Dr Bailey arranged a referral to Dr Timothy McDonald, Consultant Psychiatrist. 

7In a report dated 4 June 2004, Dr McDonald observed that: 

[RM] gave a history of longstanding anxiety from childhood, which crystallised into panic attacks from the age of fifteen. She describes classic panic attacks, but no agoraphobic response. In her adult years the tendency has been for the anxiety to become more pervasive and severe. She has been in intensive psychotherapy, dealing with early childhood traumas, but this has not helped stem the flow of panic. 

8A week prior to that admission the accused was upset and crying and told her sister ""that I don't want to be scared anymore"". 

9The second occasion occurred in March 2007 when she was hospitalised for more than a fortnight. She was found to be mentally ill and was detained as a temporary patient. Her medical notes reveal that she experienced ""mood congruent auditory hallucinations"". For nearly three weeks prior to this admission, she reported having heard music which she interpreted as ""time to go"" and having heard voices (mumbling) talking about her. 

10Between 2006 and 2009 the accused had conversations with various people which revealed something of her deteriorating state of mind. For example, DW told police that the accused had battled with anxiety and panic attacks and depression. He noted that her anxiety made her fear things that sometimes were not there. He also informed police that ""something (played) on her mind...like, dark stuff, like things out to get her"". 

11Sharan Taylor first met the accused in 2005/6. They were both working in a healing centre in Cessnock. Several months after they met, the accused told Ms Taylor that she was ""soul mates"" with Eddie Van Halen (a member of the rock group Van Halen) and that he had tricked her by falsely claiming that he was coming to pick her up. 

12Another acquaintance, KG, reported that the accused was ""dealing with things such as aliens, past lives, foreign spirits and other 'weird' phenomena"" and that her behaviour was ""unusual and erratic"". KG said that the accused believed that there was a spaceship that shone a blue light onto her house which protected her and gave her energy. 

13According to her sister, the accused ""really started being weird"" at around about the time she commenced working at the healing centre. For instance, the accused claimed that she was seeing and communicating with dead people; that she was communicating telepathically with a friend of hers and with her sister's cat; that she was seeing ""signs"" and on one occasion that she was communicating with Eddie Van Halen to try and help him get off drugs. The accused's sister commented that ""you'd talk to her and it's like you were talking to three different people at once"". The accused's brother noticed similar behaviour. 

14CC, who had been the accused's partner for many years until they separated in 2006, noticed changes in the accused about the time that she commenced work in the healing centre. He said that in May 2006 the accused began to develop an obsession with the band Van Halen. On one occasion CC saw the accused listening to very loud Van Halen music through headphones. The accused told CC that she was ""listening for the message...the message that Eddie had encoded for me"". The accused also told him about a ""Reptilian Human Conspiracy Theory"" and told him that ""reptilians"" exist in positions of power around the world. 

15Deborah Horsey met the accused in mid 2008. The accused told her that UFOs were hovering over her house and that she had to get away. She said that they were attacking both her and BM. The accused also told her that she heard voices in her head and on one occasion she told Ms Horsey about ""reptilian aliens"". 

16On 9 October 2008 the accused told a long time friend, Brett Stone, that she had aerial surveillance because of a threat upon her life. As they were chatting outside, a light aircraft flew overhead. The accused told Mr Stone ""there are my boys overhead in the plane. Let's just give them a wave so they know I am OK"". The accused asserted that the threat to her life and to BM emanated from the former patient who had lodged a complaint with the HCCC. In an email to Mr Stone dated 4 October 2008 the accused wrote, inter alia, ""...current intel indicates that my former patient is still on the loose & out for blood - she's intelligent, psychotic & is a qualified private investigator - a lethal mix..."" 

17In August 2009 the accused met Andre Coppenrath and they shared some of their personal experiences with UFOs. The accused told Coppenrath that there was a mothercraft over her house and that she was scared of the ""reptiles"". She said that she was worried about them getting into her head and taking her away. She said that she was also worried about what they might do to BM. 

18On the day of the offence, DW was picked up from home by a colleague at about 6.00am. BM was awake at that time and was apparently in good spirits. The accused was also awake. After work, DW along with a number of co-workers, attended a local club before arriving home at about 6.00pm. On his arrival he heard what he believed to be the sound of the accused snoring in her room. He assumed that BM was asleep in his cot. He watched television for about an hour and then proceeded to prepare a bottle of formula for BM. Upon entering the bedroom with the bottle he peered into the cot and noticed a piece of paper across the chest of BM. The note read, ""I am sorry I had to protect [ BM] and I from the asp reptilians. God forgive me "". DW noticed that BM was cold to touch and that he was stiff. 

19DW went into the accused's bedroom and screamed at her to get up. The accused, after some delay, got out of bed but was both incoherent and completely disorientated. DW, in anger, punched the accused's bedroom door a number of times, causing minor injuries to his hands. He also head- butted the wall. According to DW, the accused seemed to be scared of something. She was slurring her words. He said that she told him that something was after her. The accused went to the kitchen where she sat on the floor before lapsing into a state of unconsciousness. DW contacted emergency services and an ambulance officer arrived shortly afterwards. He examined BM and formed the view that he had been dead for some hours. The accused was conveyed under police guard to Wyong Hospital in an unconscious state. 

20A large number of empty blister packs of various prescription medications were located in the kitchen waste bin. These packs were collected by ambulance officers and taken to Wyong Hospital to assist with the treatment of the accused. A blood sample taken from the accused at 11.00 pm revealed the presence of codeine, alprazolam, promethazine and mirtazapine . A urine toxicological screen indicated a positive result for benzodiazepines and opiates. Dr Judith Perl, forensic pharmacologist, expressed the opinion that: 

In summary, there does not appear to be any indication of an overdose resulting in life-threatening effects of any particular medication used by [RM]. However, there is an indication that her higher than expected blood levels were due to higher than prescribed doses of mirtazapine and alprazolam having been used. This would have resulted in some of the symptoms observed in her after the incident and these suggest impairment of her cognitive and motor functions due to the sedative nature of these drugs. Some symptoms also appear to be due to her mental illness, but I cannot elaborate further on this area as it is not my field of expertise. 

21When the accused became coherent, police spoke with her at the hospital at 8.10am on 25 August. The accused was informed that she was under arrest and was cautioned. She remained under police guard until a medical and psychiatric release could be obtained . 

22Shortly after 1 pm that afternoon, police investigators attended the hospital after being informed that the accused was cleared for release pending a psychiatric evaluation. Upon their arrival, police were given an evaluation of the accused which had been conducted by a psychiatrist and two psychiatric registrars. During the course of the evaluation the accused said that she had suffocated BM. She had then written a note and blessed the child before taking an overdose of medication. She said that she wanted to die and that she expected to do so from the overdose. She said, ""Absolutely, it was wrong....I'm the one who fucked up everything and killed my son"". She was tearful and expressed remorse. During the evaluation she reported a four year history of delusions, perceptual disturbances and passivity phenomena. She said that she believed that ""reptilians"" had come to earth from space, mocking her and giving her commands to kill herself and that she was being controlled by them. She explained that this phenomenon had developed over the previous three months and that she had become increasingly worried about her son's safety. She said that she thought that her son would be safer from the ""reptilians"" in heaven. 

23During the evaluation the accused appeared to dissociate for brief periods of time. She reported seeing and hearing ""reptilians"" and experiencing physical sensations when they were near. In their joint report, the consultant psychiatrist and the two psychiatric registrars opined that the accused was mentally ill. They said that she presented with a psychotic illness, which was most probably related to paranoid schizophrenia. She also had a co-morbid Major Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Upon being placed under arrest the accused told detectives, that ""I deserve to be punished for what I've done"". The accused was conveyed to The Entrance Police Station and after being entered into custody, she agreed to be interviewed. During the interview the accused told police that she had killed her son because she did not want him to suffer in this world. She also said ""I've got nothing to hide. I'm guilty."" When asked why she was protecting her son, she said ""Please, I don't want to go there, I can't talk about it any more"". Her answers were lucid and concise although she did state that her son was a product of an immaculate conception and that his father was God. 

24She told police that she had ingested about a half a handful of her medication which included Avanza (an antidepressant) and Xanax (for anxiety). She then became distressed and declined to be interviewed any further. In a subsequent unrecorded interview with police, the accused admitted suffocating BM by using her hands and two white face washers whilst he was on the lounge room floor. Two face washers were found on a cabinet next to the entrance to the lounge room. There is no suggestion that the accused harmed the child in any way prior to this event. 

25The accused, who has no prior criminal history, has remained in custody since her arrest. On 23 June 2010 she waived her right to a committal hearing and was committed to this Court for arraignment. 

The psychiatric evidence concerning the accused's mental condition 

26Dr Olav Nielssen prepared a report, dated 28 October 2009, at the request of the accused's legal representatives. His opinion was expressed in the following terms: 

The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made on the basis of the history of typical symptoms of schizophrenia in the form of auditory hallucinations of several years' duration, giving rise to bizarre delusional beliefs. [RM's] presentation was also typical of a person with an undertreated schizophrenic illness in that she had a very blunted emotional range, appeared distracted as though experiencing auditory hallucinations during the interview, expressed the bizarre belief that I would be in danger if she disclosed the presence of symptoms to me. 

There was characteristic ambivalence in her attitude to her symptoms in that she agreed that her training should have enabled her to consider the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but also seemed compelled to obey the voices and to hold the belief that her son was better off dead because of the fate that he would have faced had she not killed him. 

[RM's] depressive illness appears to be secondary to the effect of very distressing psychotic symptoms, rather than her psychotic symptoms being a manifestation of severe depression. 

Consideration was given to the possibility that [RM] had drawn on her experience as a psychologist working in community mental health to fabricate her symptoms. However, her account of symptoms was thought to be consistent with the presence of severe mental illness and I expect the medical records from James Fletcher Hospital and other corroborative information will confirm the pattern of symptoms. 

There was no history of brain injury or substance abuse. 

Based on the information available and her presentation at the recent interview, I believe [RM] has the defence of mental illness open to her. She has a severe psychotic illness, probably schizophrenia, that gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of the bizarre delusional belief that she and her son were in danger of a tormenting death in the hands of Alien creatures. 

Her illness did not deprive her of the knowledge of the nature or quality of her act which is reflected in her statements to the police afterwards or that the act was illegal. The effect of delusional beliefs arising from ongoing symptoms was to deprive her of the knowledge that killing her son was morally wrong. 

27Dr Richard Furst also prepared a report, dated 20 June 2010, at the request of the accused's legal representatives. His opinion was expressed in the following terms: 

There is well established history of anxiety with panic attacks for which she has been treated over several years with antidepressant medication and Xanax. 

Her clinical history is highly suggestive of a severe disturbance of mood in the form of a Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic symptoms, however the persistence of her delusional beliefs about aliens and various other psychotic phenomena over the last nine months now makes it more likely that she is suffering from a major psychotic illness best classified as Schizoaffective Disorder. She may also have an underlying personality disorder with Borderline features. ... 

In the case of [RM], she was suffering from a psychotic illness at the time in question that was characterised by multiple experiences of hearing and seeing alien figures she called 'reptilians' who she took to be an evil and dark presence over her house. She described increased worry and panic attacks in the period preceding the index offence, felt down and saw an alien ship blocking out the sun. She remembers that it was ""really dark"" and that she experienced nightmares. She told me that she would walk from one room of the house to another and that ""it was like it had been taken over by darkness...it looked darker."" She thought that this dark presence was due to the Reptilians and burnt incense and candle to try and get rid of them. 

She believed that both she and [BM] were being overcome by the reptilians, in that [BM] had changed his appearance, including his facial features and his eye colour. This description is consistent with a Capgras delusion (delusion of imposters), which reinforced her belief that the Reptilians were sucking his soul out and changing him into something else she referred to as a 'Changeling'. It is highly likely that she was panicking about [BM's] safety, as she heard the 'Reptilians' making hissing noises saying ""we're going to get him"". 

Although she could not recall killing [BM] when I interviewed her, there was a verbatim account of a highly emotional, thought disordered and psychotic nature on the morning after the index offence that is outlined in the statements of Dr Minoka Galappaththi and Dr Pashu that included the following exchanges: 

Dr Pashu: Who is [BM]? The accused: ""My son [BM...17 months old...over and over they told me that I need to kill [BM]...he needed to go to heaven."" 
Dr Pashu...What happened to [BM]? 
The accused: ""They are coming and going...'just kill the child and kill yourself'...that's the only way to end the suffering ""I killed him...suffocated him...I think it was the last evening'...I just can't see how I could have done it...may be it's wrong."" 

These responses indicate that [RM] was aware of her actions at the time in question and felt compelled to do this because she was being commanded to by the 'reptilians' and saw no real alternative to end her suffering and the suffering and attack she perceived [BM] to be under. Her act of placing a note on her son's 
body that said ""I am sorry I had to protect [BM] and I from the asp reptilians. God forgive me"" also illustrates her mens rea at the time in question, which led to her killing [BM] and trying to kill herself. 

Although the question of her mental illness at the time of the index offence is a matter for the trier of fact, she was clearly delusional about the victim, perceiving that he was under attack from the reptilians and that his soul was in danger. It is highly likely that her delusions were a product of her schizoaffective disorder, an illness that has been recognised in law as a disease of the mind. In my opinion, her psychotic symptoms deprived her of the ability to appreciate the moral wrongfulness of her actions in killing [BM] and stopped her from reasoning about her actions with a moderate degree of sense or composure. I believe that she has the mental illness defence open to her. 

28Dr Allnutt prepared a report, dated 2 November 2010, at the request of the Crown's legal representatives. He concluded: 

I am however more inclined to accept that she suffered panic attacks for many years and that in the material time leading up to the alleged offences, she was likely suffering depressive symptoms; and as a result , despite my misgivings, I am prepared to conclude that she suffered from, what in legal terms could be regarded as ""disease of the mind"" or an ""underlying condition"", due to a depression and anxiety. ... 

If the court accepts that she was psychotic at the material time of the alleged offence - that is, that she rationalised that she should kill the child because it was in his interest and that she acted with delusional justification - the court could conclude that she was incapable of knowing the wrongfulness of her actions and that she has a mental illness defence because she would have been significantly compromised in that capacity. 

If the court does not accept that she was psychotic at the material time of the alleged offence, but accepts she was suffering a depression with anxiety, then there are grounds to consider that she was to some lesser degree compromised in her capacity to know the wrongfulness of her actions and the (sic) could consider a defence of mental illness. 

29After having been provided with further material Dr Allnutt observed, in a subsequent report, dated 28 March 2011: 

Having regard to that ""timeline"", there is evidence of interest in crystals, Reiki, subliminal messages, commencing October 1987, with evidence of anxiety in the early 1990s and continuing; there appear to be changes occurring in her behaviour in early 2006...it is noted that she started saying ""weird stuff"" like she could see dead people, communicate them (sic), help people transition through death, that she communicates telepathically with a friend and a cat, and sees signs in things like number plates. 

These are symptoms that are consistent with psychosis that seem to emerge at a time where there is little evidence for underlying motive for fabrication or exaggeration, and I regard this as significant. 

While I continue to believe that her presentation is atypical, I accept that it is likely that she suffered psychosis at the material time that the alleged offence (sic). 

My opinion in regard to the defence available to her is explained in my report; that is, depending on how the court interprets the evidence she would be eligible for a defence of mental illness or substantial impairment. 

30To establish the defence of mental illness the accused must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time of the killing she was suffering from such a defect of reasoning arising from a disease of the mind that she did not know the nature and quality of what she was doing, or alternatively if she did know it, that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong (the M'Naghten test). It is the second limb of that test which is of particular significance in the present case. That requirement was described in the following terms by Dixon J (as his Honour then was) in R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182: 

The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. (at 189-90) 

See also Stapleton v R (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367. 

31It is to be observed that the opinions of Dr Nielssen, Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt, particularly in those passages to which I have referred, are directed to the test which I am bound to apply. In light of the evidence which I have set out, which includes the various utterances and actions of the accused at the relevant time, as well as her lengthy history of mental illness, I have no hesitation in accepting the opinions of those experts, each of whom is eminently qualified in the area of forensic psychiatry. 

32I accept the submission made by each of the parties that the accused has established upon the balance of probabilities that she did not know, in the relevant sense, that what she was doing was wrong, and that therefore she was mentally ill at the time she killed the deceased. It is axiomatic that a person who is found to be mentally ill cannot be held criminally responsible for his or her actions. 

Order 

33In accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act) I find the accused not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness. In doing so I have had regard, pursuant to s 37 of the Act, to the practical and legal consequences of that finding. See R v Coleman [2010] NSWSC 177 per Hall J [at para 69-79]. I order that the accused be detained, pursuant to s 39 of the Act, in the custody of Corrective Services NSW until released by due process of law. The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by the court. I direct that the various reports of Dr Nielssen, Dr Furst and of Dr Allnutt be drawn to the attention of Justice Health. 

34Finally, I would like to take the opportunity of extending my sympathy to the family of the deceased, who undoubtedly have been deeply affected by this tragic event.

		12 August 2011",2011-08-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757591,R v Hawi & ors (No 17) [2011] NSWSC 1663,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Stratton SC, on behalf of the accused Menzies, contends that the prosecution witness AL has a tendency ""to act violently and to possess and use weapons"". The evidence that is said to support this contention has already been adduced in the cross-examination of AL. The Crown contends that the evidence is relevant only to the credibility of AL and objects to the jury being directed that it is capable of establishing the tendency asserted. 

2One point may be immediately discarded. There is no suggestion that AL was in possession of a weapon on 22 March 2009. The only suggestion is that he picked up an item and used it as a weapon. So, use of a weapon is relevant whilst possession of a weapon is not. 

3The relevant provision of the Evidence Act 1995 that falls for consideration is s 97: 

""97 The tendency rule 

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and 

(b the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party."" 

4The fact that the evidence has already been admitted, upon the Crown's concession that it is relevant to credibility, does not mean that the section has no work to do. It is concerned with whether evidence is ""admissible to prove..."". Section 95, in effect, prohibits the use of the evidence as tendency evidence unless the test in s 97 is met. 

5Notice of the intention to adduce the evidence was provided to the Crown and so there is no issue concerning s 97(1)(a). The issue for determination is whether the evidence has ""significant probative value"". 

6The relevant factual background is that the trial is concerned with two episodes of violent activity between members/associates of the Comanchero and Hells Angels motorcycle gangs that occurred at the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009. The Crown contends that unlawful violence, constituting an affray, occurred in the vicinity of Gate 5 and that further unlawful violence, constituting a riot, occurred minutes later in the departure hall. The latter culminated in the death of the deceased. 

7AL was a nominee member of the Comanchero. He was charged with riot, affray and murder. When he agreed to assist authorities by giving evidence for the prosecution, the charge of murder was withdrawn and a reduced sentence was imposed after he pleaded guilty to the other charges. He was called by the Crown and gave evidence over a number of days (T2149 - 2510). He was extensively cross-examined concerning his reliability and his credibility. 

8AL's account, in very brief terms, was that he attended the airport with a number of other Comanchero members/associates in connection with the arrival of the president and other Comancheros on a flight from Melbourne. They met up at Gate 5 where there was a confrontation with some Hells Angels. Fighting broke out in the course of which AL admitted to throwing a single punch in response to having been hit himself (T2158). AL gave evidence of the involvement of others in the fighting, and he specifically nominated the accused Menzies as having thrown two punches (T2159). 

9When the fighting had ceased the Comanchero group walked out into the departure hall where further Hells Angels were waiting. Another fight broke out. AL said that he was hit by somebody from behind so he turned and pursued this person but did not catch up to him. In cross-examination he said that he threw a punch at this person (T2199). AL then returned to the area of the fighting where he claimed to have seen the accused Menzies striking the deceased on the floor with a metal object which he thought was a rubbish bin. The Crown case is that this amounts to evidence that the accused Menzies was directly involved in the fatal assault. Heavy metal bollards were being used as weapons by a number of participants in the fighting and the Crown case is that the extensively fractured skull that the deceased sustained was caused by one or more blows with such an implement. AL said that he then left the terminal. On his way out he picked up a bollard but only to throw it away. (T2160-2165) 

10In cross-examination it was put to AL, but he denied, that he had tried to play down his role in the two fights and that he had attempted to shift the blame for some things he had done onto others (T2198). He denied that he was more involved in the fighting at Gate 5 than he had admitted (T2232). He denied swinging a bollard at someone in the departure hall, or using a bollard as a weapon (T2199; T2235; T2250; T2384). He denied striking the deceased and denied that he was directly involved in killing him (T2217). He denied fighting in front of the check-in counters (T2235; T2250; T2384). 

11The notice given on behalf of the accused Menzies refers to the following evidence which is said to establish the asserted tendency: 


Evidence that the witness AL assaulted his wife TS on 14 December 2002; resulting in a conviction in Liverpool Court on 11 May 2005. 

Evidence that the witness AL was convicted of a demand money with menaces, with a count of robbery taken into account on a Form 1, at the District Court at Campbelltown on 10 November 2005. 

Evidence that the witness AL was convicted of possessing a shortened firearm at Penrith Local Court on 7 February 2000. 

Evidence that when the witness AL was arrested in relation to this matter, a knuckleduster was found at his home. 

Evidence that on 26 April 2002 the witness AL had a knife in a public place, Pateete Avenue Lethbridge Park. 

12The evidence actually adduced in the cross-examination of AL may be summarised as follows: 


He implicitly acknowledged that he had experienced a problem with violence in the past (T2217.28). 

He was convicted of robbery and demanding money with menaces in the District Court on 10 November 2005. This related to him having robbed a drug dealer who he acknowledged had handed over money out of fear (T2217 - 2218). 

He was convicted of assault on 1 May 2005. This related to him having assaulted his wife in December 2002. He had raised his hand and threatened to slap her. He had then slapped her in the face with the back of his left hand and then slapped her in the face with his right hand. His wife walked away but he went after her. He picked up a rock and told her to go away. A neighbour tried to intervene but he told this person, ""I'm coming back for you, you motherfucker"" . He was very angry at the time. He was not sure if he had said to his wife, ""I'm going to kill you, you bitch"" . He was upset, and would say anything when he was upset. (T2218 - 2220). 

On 4 April 2000 he was charged with possessing a shortened firearm. It was a cut-down shotgun that belonged to a friend who had brought it to his house in three pieces and asked him to mind it. It had been put under a dressing table. AL did not touch it (T2221 - 2223). 

Some knuckle-dusters were found in his house when he was arrested in September 2009 in respect of the incident at the airport (T2223). It is significant that he was not asked, and there is otherwise no evidence, as to whether they were his or whether he knew they were there. Knuckle-dusters are a prohibited weapon: Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, Schedule 1. It is an offence against s 7 of that Act to possess a prohibited weapon without a permit. This is a serious offence, given that there is a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. There is no evidence that AL was charged with such an offence. 

13The tendency notice also refers to AL being found in possession of a knife in a public place in April 2002. No evidence was adduced in respect of that. 

14It is necessary to identify the facts in issue, the probability of the existence of which is said to be affected by the evidence under consideration: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) 156 A Crim R 308, per Simpson J at [34]. 

15It is Mr Stratton's contention that AL downplayed his role in respect of both incidents. He will submit to the jury that AL played a greater role in the fighting in both incidents than he was prepared to admit. In relation to the Gate 5 incident, he will submit that AL had attributed to Mr Menzies certain acts of violence that he committed himself. In relation to the departure hall incident, he will submit that there is evidence that supports a proposition that AL was wielding a bollard as a weapon and that there is evidence suggesting that he may well have been involved in the fatal assault upon the deceased. Further, it will be submitted that by virtue of the greater involvement that AL had in the violent conduct that occurred in the departure hall, he cannot have had the opportunity to observe the acts of others as he had claimed. 

16Mr Stratton relies upon various eyewitness descriptions of the events, and the participants, in support of these propositions. The Crown Prosecutor, on the other hand, submitted, in effect, that upon closer analysis the evidence really does not support such propositions at all. 

17Initially I had thought that consideration of these competing submissions would require a close analysis of the evidence. In the end, however, I have come to the view that this is unnecessary. The fact of the matter is that Mr Stratton asserts that there is an evidentiary basis for him to make the submissions to the jury that he foreshadowed. Whether such submissions have merit is unnecessary for me to determine. I am prepared to assume, for present purposes, that it would be open to the jury to accept that there is merit in what has been foreshadowed will be contended. Indeed, the fact that there is a dispute between the Crown and Mr Stratton as to the strength of the evidence upon which Mr Stratton relies for asserting that AL played a greater role than he was prepared to admit, probably serves to elevate the importance of the tendency evidence. If it is capable of lending weight to a proposition that is otherwise of debatable merit, then its probative value is probably greater. The point may be illustrated by the converse: if the proposition that AL played a greater role in the violence was overwhelmingly established by the eyewitness evidence, then there would be no point that would be served by establishing that AL had a tendency to act violently. 

18Does the evidence have ""significant probative value""? The actual probative value of the evidence is a matter for the jury. The question I have to determine is whether it is capable of having that degree of probative value. This involves an assessment of the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the probability of the existence of the facts that are in issue. As to these matters, see Fletcher , per Simpson J at [33]. 

19The adjective ""significant"" has been held to mean ""important"" or ""of consequence"": R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459. The requirement is that the evidence is more than merely relevant, but it is not necessary that it have a ""substantial"" degree of relevance: Lockyer at 458. See also R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356 at 361; R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 709; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at [370]. 

20Mr Stratton referred me to the more recent expression of the requirement by Latham J in R v AW [2009] NSWCCA 1: 

[47] ... The evidence must have significant probative value, that is, it must be evidence that is meaningful in the context of the issues at trial. The provision is concerned with the qualitative aspects of the evidence, not quantitative ones. The extent to which such evidence is objectively proved, as in MM , has less to do with s 97(1) than it has to do with s 101(2). It must be more than merely relevant, but may be less than substantially so: R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457. The question for the trial judge was whether the evidence was important in establishing the facts in issue, namely whether the appellant committed the charged sexual offences against the complainant. 

21I have come to the view that the evidence is incapable of being regarded by the jury as being important, or of consequence, in determining the issues that Mr Stratton has raised on behalf of the accused Menzies that I have outlined earlier. 

22There was a single act of relatively minor physical violence, in a domestic context, over six years before the events in question. There was the intimidation of a drug dealer, without physical violence, some four or five years before the events in question. Those two incidents cannot establish that AL's character was such that he had a tendency to act violently. There was the possession, without use, of a weapon nine years before the events in question. There is no evidence that he had a tendency to use weapons. 

23So, in terms of the first of the alleged tendencies of AL, ""to act violently"", what is relied upon are two incidents, quite some years earlier. One involved actual violence and the other, threatened violence. The contexts in which they occurred were quite different to the situation which pertained at the Qantas domestic terminal on 22 March 2009. The circumstances of the earlier incidents were quite dissimilar to the latter, although I should not be taken to be suggesting that a high degree of similarity is required. In terms of the second of the alleged tendencies, ""to possess and use weapons"", I am unable to see how the jury could regard a single incident in which AL allowed a shortened firearm, broken down into pieces, to be stored at his home in 2000, as having any bearing at all on whether he picked up a bollard and used it as a weapon in 2009. 

24The foregoing analysis involves looking at the two tendencies separately. Looking at them in combination does not add anything to the probative force of the evidence. I am not persuaded that the capability of the evidence to have ""significant probative value"" has been established. 

25I note that the Crown concedes that the evidence is relevant to AL's credibility. It is not clear how some of it is. How could the fact that AL had assaulted his wife, on a single occasion, or possessed a shortened firearm, on a single occasion, both quite a number of years ago, have a bearing on whether he should be believed (which is the real issue) in respect of the evidence he has given? It might be contended that a person who has committed any type of criminal offence in the past is less trustworthy. That is a very broad generalisation. It might be relevant that a person with AL's record would expect to receive a greater sentence than a person who did not, and thus there was a greater incentive for him to ""cut a deal"" with the authorities. But he was not cross-examined to that effect; the cross-examination was confined to the bare fact that he had committed those offences. 

26With those reservations noted, it will nonetheless be necessary to direct the jury that the evidence of AL's previous offences are relevant only to his credibility and cannot be used as a basis for any tendency reasoning. I will hear counsel as to the terms of any such direction. 

27The case of the evidence as tendency evidence is rejected.

		13 February 2012",2011-08-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757601,Ali v R [2011] NSWCCA 184,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agreed with the orders made by the Court on 14 July 2011 for the reasons provided below by Harrison J. 

2BUDDIN J : For the reasons given by Harrison J, I joined in the orders made by the Court on 14 July 2011. 

3HARRISON J : The applicant, who appeared in this Court unrepresented, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him by her Honour Ashford DCJ on 15 December 2010. At the end of the hearing of the application the Court made the following orders: 

1. Grant the applicant leave to appeal. 

2. Appeal allowed in part. 

3. Quash the sentence in relation to count 2 and in lieu thereof impose a non-parole period of 9 months to date from 16 November 2010 and to expire on 15 August 2011. The head term of 18 months in respect of that count is confirmed. The first day on which the applicant is due for release is 15 August 2011. 

4My reasons for joining in these orders are as follows. 

5The applicant had pleaded guilty to two counts of reckless wounding and one count of being an accessory after the fact to the discharge of a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He was sentenced on the accessory count to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment from 16 February 2010 expiring on 15 August 2010. On the reckless wounding of the first victim he was sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 15 months from 16 May 2010 expiring on 15 August 2011 with a balance of term of 5 months commencing on 16 August 2011 expiring on 15 January 2012. On the reckless wounding of the second victim he was sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 11 months from 16 November 2010 expiring on 15 October 2011 with a balance of term of 7 months from 16 November 2011 expiring on 15 May 2012. The applicant was sentenced to an effective total term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 16 February 2010 and expiring on 15 May 2012 and an effective non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months from 16 February 2010 expiring on 15 October 2011. 

6The applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal: 

1. The learned sentencing Judge erred in the manner in which she discounted the sentences for the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty. 

(a) The learned sentencing Judge erred in giving regard to the timing of the guilty plea entered when assessing the utilitarian value of the guilty plea. 

(b) The learned sentencing Judge erred in not allowing an appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 

2. The learned sentencing Judge erred in her approach to the application of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ss 3A, 21A and 44. 

(a) Her Honour erred when she found aggravating factors under s 21A(3)(d) and (j). 

(b) Her Honour erred by sentencing for specific deterrence for this offence under s 3A. 

(c) Her Honour erred by granting special circumstances under s 44(2) but failed to act upon her finding. 

3. The learned sentencing Judge erred in her approach and application to the applicant's sentences. 

(a) Her Honour erred when she failed to backdate the sentences to the date the applicant was taken into custody. 

(b) Her Honour erred when she failed to order the sentences to be served concurrently. 

(c) Her Honour erred when she found no evidence of knife injury to Hassan Al Jebori, which formed the basis for count 2, but imposed a sentence notwithstanding her finding. 

4. The learned sentencing Judge erred when she considered all possible alternatives to imprisonment by finding counsel for the accused did not submit to the contrary. 

5. The sentences are manifestly excessive. 

7The offences of reckless wounding carry a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. The accessory after the fact offence carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment with no standard non-parole period. 

Background 

8The circumstances out of which the offences emerged were long and bizarre. In brief the applicant became involved in a motor vehicle pursuit across the suburbs around Lidcombe in Sydney during the course of which he twice alighted from the vehicle in which he was travelling and stabbed passengers in other vehicles involved in the chase. Her Honour's remarks on sentence contain a detailed recitation of these facts to which it is presently unnecessary in detail to refer. Much of what happened is captured in recorded telephone conversations between the occupants of the vehicles as events unfolded. They concluded effectively when a co-accused Mr Tarek Zahed, who the applicant had apparently enlisted to assist him, discharged a firearm striking an occupant of one of the other cars. 

Subjective features 

9The applicant was aged 34 when sentenced. He originally came to Australia from Fiji in 1987 and lived with his mother and stepfather. He did not get on with the latter and entered into a period of juvenile delinquency which continued on into long periods of incarceration in adult gaols. A psychological report from Mr Watson-Munro indicated that the applicant had engaged in some drug use but there was no history of alcohol abuse. The applicant was deeply concerned about deportation and had spent some time at Villawood detention centre. In gaol he had completed courses on cognitive behaviour, stress and anger management. He came with a letter of support from his mother and expressed remorse in writing to the sentencing judge. 

Consideration 

10In sentencing the applicant, her Honour found special circumstances. However, it became apparent during the course of the proceedings in this Court that the sentence that she imposed upon the applicant failed to give effect to that finding. In her remarks on sentence her Honour said, ""The total effective sentence therefore is twenty-nine months with an effective non-parole period of twenty months."" That was wrong. The total effective sentence was in fact 27 months. The difference is important because the respective ratios of non-parole period to total term are 70 per cent in the case of the miscalculated sentence and just over 74 per cent in the case of the actual sentence. It is unclear from her Honour's remarks on sentence what allowance she intended to make for special circumstances, but it is clear that the sentence she imposed in fact made no appreciable allowance at all. The statutory ratio was effectively not varied. 

11As I have already mentioned, the sentencing judge ordered the sentence to commence on 16 February 2010. However, the applicant had been in custody since 30 September 2009. During the intervening period of 4 months and 16 days he had been serving the balance of parole in respect of an earlier sentence. During the course of the hearing in this Court it emerged that the sentencing judge had not considered that period when dealing with the issue of ""special circumstances"". In fact, when regard is had to the 4 months and 16 days during which the applicant was in custody before the commencement of the sentences imposed by her Honour, the ratio which the non-parole period of approximately 24.5 months bears to the total term of approximately 31.5 months in fact becomes one of just under 78 per cent. In those circumstances, the Crown very properly conceded that error had occurred and that a reduction of 2 months from the non-parole period in respect of the sentence for count 2 would produce a sentence that more accurately reflected her Honour's finding of ""special circumstances"". 

12The orders that were made give effect to that adjustment. 

13I have considered the applicant's specified grounds of appeal supported by his written submissions and oral presentation in this Court. I am unable to conclude that any of these grounds of appeal is made out. I am not of the opinion that her Honour made any errors of the type contended for by the applicant. I would not in any event have been satisfied, apart from the limited way dealt with in the orders that have been pronounced by this Court, that some sentence other than that imposed by her Honour is warranted in law.

		16 August 2011",2011-08-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757613,Dyer v R [2011] NSWCCA 185,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Johnson J. 

2HIDDEN J : I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J and, generally, with his Honour's reasons. 

3It is regrettable that the issue ventilated in this Court was not raised in the sentence proceedings. If it had been, it would have called for careful consideration. While this Court is a court of error, I would not question its discretion to intervene when the significance of evidence before the sentencing court was not perceived by the parties or the judge and the sentencing process thereby miscarried. 

4However, I agree with Johnson J that in the present case no lesser sentence was warranted for this serious offence and, in particular, that a shorter non-parole period would not have reflected the applicant's criminality. As Johnson J has pointed out, the sentence still leaves him with the benefit of a significant period of parole eligibility. 

5JOHNSON J : This is an application for leave to appeal by Eric John Dyer with respect to the sentence imposed in the Parramatta District Court by his Honour Judge Keleman SC on 25 June 2010. 

6The Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of entry of a building with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Stephen Franks, in circumstances of aggravation (being in company), contrary to s.111(2) Crimes Act 1900 . The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 14 years. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence. 

7In sentencing the Applicant for this offence, the Court took into account, on a Form 1, an offence of assault (upon Mr Franks) occasioning actual bodily harm whilst in company, contrary to s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900 , an offence bearing a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment. 

8Taking into account the Form 1 offence, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and four months, commencing on 20 April 2009 and expiring on 19 August 2012, with a balance of term of one year and two months commencing on 20 August 2012 and expiring on 19 October 2013. 

9The single ground of appeal is that, in declining to find ""special circumstances"" , the sentencing Judge failed to take into account a material consideration, namely the totality of the Applicant's custodial history. 

Facts of Offence 

10There was no dispute in the District Court concerning the facts of the offence. 

11The Applicant and the victim, Stephen Franks, had been acquaintances since 2007. 

12There had been an earlier criminal attack by the Applicant against Mr Franks. On 6 October 2007, the Applicant had committed an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against Mr Franks, causing a cut to the right side of his face, bruising and swelling to his right eye, and a bloody nose. On 18 March 2008, the Applicant was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for that offence. During the sentencing proceedings in March 2008 for that offence, the Applicant turned to the public area and mouthed in the direction of Mr Franks the words ""You're dead"" . 

13On 29 September 2008, the Applicant was released on parole. 

14On the evening of 14 October 2008, Mr Franks was at his home in Werrington with his brother and a friend. At about 11.00 pm, the victim was asleep on a chair in the lounge room. His brother and an acquaintance were dozing elsewhere in the room. 

15At this time, the Applicant, accompanied by two unidentified males, entered the premises. The three men went into the lounge room and turned on the lights. The Applicant approached the victim's brother and asked where the victim was. The victim's brother replied and the Applicant approached Mr Franks who was still asleep. 

16The Applicant produced a golf club from his sleeve and began hitting the victim over the head. A number of blows were struck with the club. During the attack, Mr Franks woke and the Applicant took him by the front of the shirt and dragged him off the lounge into a spare room in the house. 

17As the victim was dragged away, his brother noticed the presence of the other two males. These men wore dark clothing and had their faces covered to conceal their identities. After dragging the victim to the spare room, the Applicant punched him to the head several times with his fist. The Applicant then kicked Mr Franks to the back of the ribs and the legs. At one point, he kicked Mr Franks on the right side of his forehead. 

18The Applicant then tipped a cupboard onto the victim and ran from the premises with the other two men. Soon after, the Applicant returned and retrieved the golf club that he had left lying near the victim, before leaving the premises for a second time. 

19The victim was helped to the lounge room by his brother. He was bleeding heavily from a head injury. According to his brother, the victim lost consciousness for a few seconds after being hit on the head with the golf club. 

20Police were called and arrived soon after. The victim was taken by ambulance to Nepean District Hospital where he underwent scans and received treatment for his injuries. He suffered a number of soft-tissue injuries, bruising and swelling to the head and body. He also received a split injury to two sections of his head where he was hit by the golf club. 

21Police processed the crime scene. As a result, a fingerprint of the Applicant was located on an architrave in the lounge room. 

22On Wednesday, 3 December 2008, the Applicant attended Mt Druitt Police Station at the request of police. He declined to be interviewed and was charged. 

23On 18 December 2008, the Applicant's parole was revoked. He was ordered to serve a balance of parole of four months and 18 days commencing on 3 December 2008 and expiring on 20 April 2009. 

24Since 20 April 2009, the Applicant's custody has been solely referable to the present offences. 

25On 1 March 2010, an indictment was presented charging the Applicant with offences under s.112(1) and s.111(2) Crimes Act 1900 . The Crown accepted a plea of guilty on the s.111(2) count in discharge of the indictment. The Applicant asked that the s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900 offence be taken into account on sentence. 

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances 

26The Applicant was born in October 1984. He was almost 24 years' old at the time of the offence and was 25 years' old at the time of sentence. 

27The Applicant has a lengthy criminal history, mainly for offences of dishonesty. There are some offences of violence. In 2002, he was dealt with in the Children's Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In 2005, he received a custodial sentence for robbery in company, a sentence against which he appealed unsuccessfully to this Court: Dyer v R [2006] NSWCCA 274. As mentioned earlier, in March 2008, he was sentenced for assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed against Mr Franks. 

28Reports of Dr David Greenberg of Justice Health dated 22 April 2010 and Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, dated 16 April 2010 and 21 June 2010 were tendered on sentence. In addition, the Applicant gave short evidence at the sentencing hearing. 

Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge 

29The sentencing Judge referred to the reports of Dr Greenberg and Dr Furst in his remarks on sentence. 

30His Honour was satisfied that given the Applicant's ""mental health issues and other problems, his rehabilitation prospects are at best poor and that he is likely to reoffend in the future"" (ROS9). 

31His Honour found that the present offence was ""objectively most serious"" and was clearly a premeditated and planned offence, involving the Applicant arming himself with a golf club to assault the victim. His Honour concluded that the offence fell into the upper end of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. Further, the offence was aggravated as it was committed in company and whilst the Applicant was on parole. 

32His Honour observed that general deterrence and punishment were of particular importance, as was personal deterrence for the Applicant. 

33A discount of 10% was allowed for the utilitarian value of the Applicant's late plea of guilty. 

34His Honour was not satisfied that the Applicant was truly remorseful for his conduct. 

35The sentencing Judge had regard to evidence concerning the Applicant's mental health, and the relevant principles in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]. His Honour concluded (ROS10-11): 

""As I am satisfied on the material before me that the offender in carrying out the present offence and the offence on the Form 1 acted with full knowledge of what he was doing and with full knowledge of the gravity of his actions, I do not propose to moderate in any significant way considerations of general and personal deterrence. Indeed, on the material before me largely flowing from the psychiatric reports, I am satisfied that the offender presents an actual danger to the community and is likely to be so dangerous for some considerable time."" 

36His Honour declined to make a finding of ""special circumstances"" (ROS11): 

""I am not satisfied that any of the offender's subjective circumstances, considered either individually or in combination warrant a finding of special circumstances."" 

The Ground of Appeal 

37Mr Nash, counsel for the Applicant, submits that error is disclosed in that his Honour failed to take into account, on the issue of ""special circumstances"" a material consideration, namely the totality of the Applicant's custodial history. 

38The submission made to this Court is that the Applicant has had an extensive custodial history which, upon analysis, indicates that for a period from November 2003 (when the Applicant was 19 years' old) to August 2012 (when he will be 27 years' old), the Applicant would have spent all but six months of the previous eight years and nine months in custody. 

39Reliance is placed upon the decisions of this Court in R v Gower (1991) 56 A Crim R 115 and R v Binnie [2000] NSWCCA 483 in support of the proposition that this factor is capable of giving rise to a finding of ""special circumstances"" , so as to call for a variation of the statutory ratio for the purpose of s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

40It was acknowledged that this express submission had not been put to the sentencing Judge. It was said that there was passing reference to the Applicant's custodial history during the sentencing hearing, so that the issue had been exposed for consideration in the District Court. 

Decision 

41The only issue advanced by the Applicant's legal representative in the District Court on the issue of ""special circumstances"" was an argument that, having regard to his Honour's then stated concern about dangerousness, a longer period on parole would be required to address that question (T15, 25 June 2010). His Honour's immediate response to that submission indicated that he did not accept it, and this position was confirmed in the remarks on sentence. 

42No further submissions were made to the sentencing Judge in support of a finding of ""special circumstances"" . 

43The Applicant's custodial history had been tendered, together with the agreed facts and the Applicant's criminal history, during the sentencing hearing. Upon enquiry from the sentencing Judge as to the purpose of the tender of the custodial history, the Crown representative invited his Honour to consider that part of the document which recounted punishment details in custody (T3, 25 June 2010). No argument was put on behalf of the Applicant that the custodial history should be used for any other purpose. 

44In approaching the ground of appeal in this case, it is necessary to keep in mind the nature of an application for leave to appeal to this Court against sentence. This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108. 

45If material error is demonstrated, before the Court would proceed to resentence the Applicant, the Court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 720-721 [79]. 

46It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. 

47In Quayle v R [2010] NSWCCA 16, it was contended (at [40]) that there was material before the District Court capable of amounting to ""special circumstances"" , and that the Judge should have made such a finding and reduced the proportion of the sentences represented by the non-parole period. RA Hulme J (Grove and Simpson JJ agreeing) said at [41]: 

""It is difficult to say that a judge was in error for not doing something that he or she was not asked to do. A finding that there are, or are not, special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact: see R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25 per Howie J at [103]. In a case in which there are compelling circumstances for making such a finding, and the judge is in fact asked to do so, one might expect that if the judge declines to do so he or she would provide reasons: R v Novakovic [2004] NSWCCA 437 at [39] per Sully J. Cf R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 2001 53 NSWLR 704 Spigelman CJ at [86]-[88]."" 

48Here, his Honour was not asked to find ""special circumstances"" on the basis advanced in this Court. The sentencing Judge responded to the submissions made on the issue of ""special circumstances"" . An applicant faces real difficulty in this Court in contending that a sentencing Judge has fallen into error by failing to take into account a material consideration, when that consideration was not advanced to the primary Judge as being a matter which should be taken into account. 

49A wide range of considerations are capable of constituting ""special circumstances"" for the purposes of s.44(2): R v Simpson at 722 [88]. There is a practical expectation that an offender's legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in the case at hand: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11]. 

50There is no question that the risk of institutionalisation may, in a particular case, warrant a finding of ""special circumstances"" : Jackson v R [2010] NSWCCA 162 at [24]-[25]. Where such a submission is made, a sentencing Judge is not bound to make such a finding. It will be a factor to be taken into account with other factors, in the exercise of discretion, to determine whether a finding of ""special circumstances"" should be made. 

51If such a submission was made here, no doubt his Honour would have considered that factor together with other factors, including the finding of dangerousness (and the need to protect the community), the Applicant's prior poor history of compliance with conditional liberty and the need for the non-parole period to properly reflect the minimum period which the Applicant should spend in custody for this offence (including the Form 1 matter). 

52I am not persuaded that the Applicant has demonstrated error on the part of the sentencing Judge in this case. 

53Even if the Applicant's custodial history was to be taken into account as a factor capable of giving rise to a finding of ""special circumstances"" , such a finding would not necessarily follow. Whilst on parole, the Applicant had entered the victim's house for the purpose of attacking him with a golf club. He did so in company. This offence followed on from an earlier attack against the same victim, where the Applicant threatened the victim during the course of the sentencing hearing. His Honour's finding of dangerousness was understandable and is not challenged on appeal. 

54Having regard to all the elements of punishment, including protection of the community, rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the Applicant's subjective circumstances, the non-parole period fixed by the sentencing Judge constituted the minimum period that the Applicant ought spend in custody: R v Simpson at 717 [59]. The current sentence provides, in any event, for a parole period of 14 months, a significant period of conditional liberty in the case of this Applicant. 

55Even if error was disclosed (and it is not), I would not be satisfied, in any event, that any lesser sentence was warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 

56I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

		16 August 2011",2011-08-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757616,R v Chong [2011] NSWSC 914,"Judgment  1On 18 August 2011 I determined pursuant to s 10 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act"") that the accused was unfit to be tried on an indictment charging him with the murder of Jing Hwa Park on 17 May 2009.  I also made orders in accordance with s 14 of the Act.  2I am obliged under s 11 of the Act to identify the principles of law I applied in making that determination and the findings of fact upon which I relied.  What follows are my published reasons for so doing.  3The charge of murder was laid in October 2009 following an extensive police investigation into the brutal killing of the deceased.  The accused was a person of interest in that investigation as a result of what police learned of his working relationship with the deceased and the very considerable and sustained conflict between them as revealed by conversations between the deceased and a friend in the weeks leading up to his death.  It was also the accused who alerted police to the severely beaten body of the deceased in the work premises apparently some hours after his death.  4The evidence tendered on the fitness inquiry comprised a Crown case statement and police facts prepared in support of the charge of murder.  An affidavit of Ms Robyn Clark, the accused's solicitor, was read without objection.  It annexed a report of Dr Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, dated 12 September 2010 obtained on behalf of the accused; a report of Dr Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, dated 18 July 2011 obtained by the Crown; and a report dated 29 June 2011 prepared by Dr Sim, a consultant physician and geriatrician holding the position of Clinical Director of the Aged Care and Rehabilitation Unit within the Long Bay Correctional Centre.  5In so far as the discrete question of the accused's fitness to be tried is concerned, Drs Nielssen and Allnutt were of the joint opinion that by reason of severe cognitive impairments under which the accused currently labours he could not meaningfully participate in a criminal trial.  In particular, after considering the test results of the accused's orientation undertaken by Dr Nielssen, short-term memory, concentration, verbal fluency and visuo-spatial skills showed impairment across all domains and what Dr Allnutt described as poor performance on cognitive testing, I am satisfied his capacity to follow trial process and to be able to provide instructions to his legal representatives would be severely compromised.  This, together with his age of 69 years and to some extent the cultural difficulties presented by the fact that he was born in Korea, also compromise his capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings and the effect of the evidence led against him which in turn would severely compromise his capacity to exercise an informed and rational decision as to whether he should exercise his rights as an accused in defence of the charge.  6These findings are in accordance with the test of fitness to be tried in R v Presser [1958] ALR 248.  7Neither Dr Nielssen nor Dr Allnutt was unable to determine whether the accused had any underlying psychiatric disorder.  The very substantial brain damage from which he suffered was sustained consequent upon a traumatic head injury on 13 July 2009, which occurred within days of the accused being interviewed by police and invited to account for material discrepancies between the version of events he gave to the investigating police on the day of the murder, including his movements that day and for a number of days thereafter.  8On the morning of 13 July 2009 independent witnesses saw the accused veer onto the incorrect side of a major thoroughfare in Western Sydney into the path of an oncoming truck into which he collided head on.  He was transported to Liverpool Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a number of injuries, inclusive of the head injury related to his current brain damage.  The Court Attendance Notice was served on the accused in Liverpool Hospital after which he was remanded in custody.  9It would appear that his condition remains unchanged from when last seen by Dr Allnutt.  I am satisfied that his current deficits are likely to be permanent although he has shown improvement in his functional skills such that he is currently independent in servicing his daily needs in custody.  The report of Dr Sim does reflect the fact, however, that the accused is currently only partially orientated and that he has no meaningful understanding of why he is in a prison hospital frequently requesting to leave to return to Perth.  In that connection I note that he has no family support and that a Limited Guardianship Order made in November 2009 remains in force.  **********

2757619,R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186,"Judgment 

1MACFARLAN JA : I agree with Johnson J and also with the additional observations of Garling J. 

2JOHNSON J : This is a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to sentences imposed upon the Respondent, Brian William Achurch, at the Sydney District Court on 6 August 2010 for a number of serious drug supply offences.

4The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of six years commencing on 16 August 2006 and expiring on 15 August 2012, with a balance of term of eight years' imprisonment commencing on 16 August 2012 and expiring on 15 August 2020. 

5The Respondent was acquitted by the jury of the third count on the indictment. 

The Crown Appeal 

6A Notice of Appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was filed by the Crown on 6 September 2010, asserting that the sentences passed were manifestly inadequate. In accordance with the usual practice ( R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 15-16 [33]-[38]), the Crown filed a document on 29 April 2011 giving notice of additional grounds of appeal. The Crown relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) Ground 1 - his Honour erred in failing to determine the objective criminality of Count 1; 

(b) Ground 2 - his Honour erred in failing to determine adequately where Count 2 lay in the range of objective seriousness for offences of that type; 

(c) Ground 3 - his Honour erred in failing to determine adequately where Count 4 lay in the range of objective seriousness for offences of that type; 

(d) Ground 4 - his Honour failed to have adequate regard to the standard non-parole period for Count 2; 

(e) Ground 5 - his Honour failed to have adequate regard to the standard non-parole period for Count 4; 

(f) Ground 6 - his Honour gave excessive weight to the Respondent's medical condition; 

(g) Ground 7 - the sentences are individually, and as aggregated, manifestly inadequate. 

Facts of Offences 

7The Respondent was convicted of the offences at trial. A summary of facts was tendered by the Crown as part of the sentencing proceedings and was relied upon for the purpose of sentence. The statement of facts revealed the following. 

8The Respondent's offences were detected as a result of a police investigation into drug trafficking in south-western Sydney. The investigation initially targeted the activities of a street dealer, Andrew Massey (""Massey""), using an undercover police officer who conducted a number of controlled purchases of indictable quantities of methylamphetamine. 

9Massey's mobile telephone was intercepted. It was apparent that Massey's primary source of methylamphetamine and MDMA was a second offender, Dean Mahanay (""Mahanay""). 

10On the afternoon of 7 March 2006, Mahanay and a third offender, Troy Kearines (""Kearines"") attended the Respondent's residence at Horsley Park. Mahanay met with the Respondent and collected from him a quantity of pills containing the prohibited drug MDMA. Mahanay's usual practice was to collect prohibited drugs from the Respondent just prior to meeting with customers, to minimise the risk of being discovered by police or being ""ripped off"" . For the same reasons, it was also Mahanay's practice to provide the proceeds of the sale to the Respondent following the transaction. 

11At about 6.50 pm on 7 March 2006, Mahanay and Kearines met an undercover police officer at the Casula shops and supplied him with three types of MDMA pills, totalling 400 pills, for the price of $4,600.00 (Count 1). 

12At the same time, the undercover officer was supplied with a further seven pills as a free sample of other drugs available for purchase. Mahanay told the undercover officer that he knew a man who was producing a large number of these pills, and that he currently had a number of pills with that particular design motif in stock. 

13At about 7.15 pm on 7 March 2006, Mahanay and Kearines met with the Respondent at his home in Horsley Park and gave him an amount of money from the earlier drug supply. 

14After leaving the Respondent's home, and without attending any other location, Mahanay contacted the undercover police officer and offered to supply him with 1,000 MDMA pills (Count 2). 

15Intercepts on Mahanay's telephone confirmed that Mahanay worked as a drug runner for the Respondent. 

16On about 8 April 2006, the Respondent and his family moved to a property at Harrington Park. The Respondent arranged with the landlord of his former Horsley Park residence for a further offender, Julian Howard (""Howard""), to lease the Horsley Park property. In an intercepted telephone conversation on 9 April 2006, Howard described himself as being ""an employee"" of the Respondent, stating that he and Mahanay did the leg work whilst the Respondent sat back and did the organising. 

17On 20 March 2006, the undercover police officer contacted Mahanay and placed an order for 500 MDMA pills. Intercepted conversations between the Respondent and Mahanay showed that the Respondent was directly involved in the chain of supply of those drugs to the police officer. Further, the Respondent was familiar with the business arrangements to the point that he referred to the undercover police officer by name during these conversations. 

18The Respondent was implicated in the large commercial supply of prohibited drugs in subsequent lawfully intercepted telephone conversations with Mahanay. Those conversations showed that the Respondent was the employer whilst Mahanay was the employee. On numerous occasions, the Respondent directed Mahanay to perform certain tasks, such as the collecting of sums of money owed by persons in relation to the supply of prohibited drugs. Collected monies were then delivered to the Respondent. 

19A number of names (including ""Church"" , ""Brian"" , ""Pops"" and ""Old Mate"" ) were used by Mahanay to refer to the Respondent in his conversations with other criminal associates. In several lawful intercept conversations, Mahanay was heard to tell other criminal associates that he was to collect a certain amount of money before he could go and see the Respondent. 

20On 30 May 2006, five search warrants were executed simultaneously across south-western Sydney. During the execution of the search warrant at the Respondent's address, police located the mobile phone used by the Respondent during the intercepted telephone conversations. Also located during this search in the laundry area were a set of electronic scales and a quantity of unused ""Glad"" resealable plastic bags and two large bottles containing acetone. Police also found a notebook which constituted a drug ledger recording amounts of monies and drugs. The ledger referred to amounts of up to $130,000.00, and named both Mahanay and Howard. 

21A search warrant was executed upon the Horsley Park premises previously occupied by the Respondent, but then occupied by Howard. The rear garage was opened. Located in the garage were several dogs belonging to Howard. During the course of the search of the garage area, police discovered (at two different locations within the garage) six individual ""Glad"" resealable plastic bags containing 2.6 kilograms of methylamphetamine (Count 4). 

22The large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine was one kilogram, so that the quantity located was two-and-a-half times the large commercial quantity. 

23The Respondent was arrested on 16 August 2006 and has remained in custody since that time solely with respect to these offences. As will be seen, the delay between conviction on 24 June 2008 and sentence on 6 August 2010 resulted from defence applications to allow evidence to be obtained concerning the Respondent's medical condition and his medical management in custody. 

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances 

24The Respondent was born in September 1958. He was 47 years' old at the time of the offences and 51 years' old at the time of sentence. 

25The Respondent has a prior criminal history. He has convictions for stealing (1984), assault occasioning actual bodily harm and malicious injury (1986), receiving (1991), three counts of armed robbery and larceny motor vehicle (1992), drive whilst licence cancelled (2000), receiving, goods in custody and possession of a prohibited weapon (2002) and possession of a prohibited drug (2002). 

26The Respondent was sentenced to imprisonment by way of periodic detention for receiving offences in 1991, full-time imprisonment for the armed robbery and larceny motor vehicle offences in 1992 (reduced on appeal to this Court in 1994) and imprisonment for receiving and other offences in 2002 (with the sentences confirmed on appeal to the District Court in May 2004). 

27On 24 June 2004, the Respondent's parole was revoked by the State Parole Authority, and he was required to serve a term of imprisonment for one year and four days commencing on 14 May 2004 and expiring on 17 May 2005. 

28As mentioned above, the Respondent's offences were committed between 7 March and 30 May 2006, and he was arrested on 16 August 2006 and has remained thereafter in custody. 

29The Respondent's sister and ex-wife gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. In addition, a number of medical reports were tendered, including reports of Dr Grant Luxton, renal physician, dated 16 June 2010 and 1 July 2010. A report from Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, dated 2 June 2010 was also tendered at the sentencing hearing. The Respondent did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing nor apparently at trial. 

30The evidence on sentence revealed that the Respondent had been a heavy drinker from his mid-teens until his mid-30s, and had also been a regular amphetamine user during this time. After being diagnosed with diabetes at 33 years of age, the Respondent stated that he ceased drinking and taking drugs. 

31The sentencing Judge accepted that, at the time of sentence, the Respondent had the following medical conditions: 

(a) Type 1 diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependant) with associated medical complications of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy and chronic kidney disease due to diabetic nephropathy; 

(b) hypertension; 

(c) left ventricular hypertrophy (due to hypertension); 

(d) congestive cardiac failure (due to hypertension and possible ischaemic heart disease); 

(e) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to smoking; and 

(f) peripheral vascular disease and dyslipidaemia (elevated cholesterol). 

32According to Dr Luxton's report of 16 June 2010, it was anticipated that within the next few years, the Respondent would require dialysis treatment for his chronic kidney condition. Dr Luxton's report of 16 June 2010 concluded with the following statement (AB154): 

""It is therefore reasonably likely that prolonged incarceration will significantly reduce his life expectancy although due to the number of variables it is not possible to quantify this."" 

Some Findings of the Sentencing Judge 

33Given the issues raised by the grounds of appeal in this Court, it is appropriate to set out a number of statements in the remarks on sentence. 

34After referring to the history of the proceedings and the jury verdicts, the sentencing Judge referred to the standard non-parole periods applicable to the second and fourth counts and the maximum penalty for the fourth count (AB12-13). His Honour referred to the Respondent's criminal history, observing that there was no prior offence of drug supply (AB13). 

35His Honour then made a number of significant findings concerning the Respondent's role in the offences (AB13): 

""Various co-offenders have been dealt with in relation to the matters - the offender Dean Mahanay, Troy Kearines - but since it is clear that the offender here was a principal, none of the other offenders are directly comparable. I accept the characterisation of the role played by this offender as being that of a principal in relation to counts 1 and 2 and, in relation to count 4, at least a co-principal. The Crown put before the jury the proposition that the accused's role was central, that he was in effect the boss or director of the exercise and that the others involved - Mahanay, persons called Howard and Tina Cobbs - were subordinate to him. While precisely what role Howard played is impossible to tell (perhaps he was a co-principal with the offender) certainly the offender was a principal in relation to the large quantity of materials found in the house at Horsley Park on 30 May 2006. Accordingly, utilising the authorities applicable, nothing other than a substantial sentence of full-time imprisonment is applicable in a case such as this."" 

36Soon after, the sentencing Judge referred to the relationship between the Respondent and the Horsley Park property (AB14-15): 

""In the trial proceedings there was evidence of the involvement of the offender with that property in the form of a rental agreement, and exhibit X set out very plainly the position Mr Brian William Achurch as the person having control in effect of the relevant property where the drugs were eventually found. The offender was not himself living there at that stage but his connection with that property was clear and clearly proved to the satisfaction of the jury and, though it is not necessary to say it, to my satisfaction. One of the items found at the property was a very neatly prepared account book in the form of exhibit V, which set out various cash deposits into the Westpac Bank for Michael Achurch. It is plain that not all of income from the drug dealing exercise was being wasted, so to speak - some of it was being used for normal family domestic purposes. But in any event the involvement of the offender, Mr Brian Achurch is clearly proven."" 

37After referring to other aspects of the evidence at trial, the sentencing Judge described the Respondent as having ""a principal role and principal culpability"" (AB15). His Honour then stated (AB15): 

""The courts have repeatedly said that for a business enterprise where drugs, unlawful drugs, are sold on a substantial basis, nothing other than a substantial sentence of imprisonment is appropriate, and I accept and I will be guided by that general principle. The offences were all organised and planned, these were not 'one-off' activities. The sequence of events points to planning, although it does not always point to competence - the tape recordings reveal conversations between Brian Achurch and Mahanay with various complaints about people trying to rip them off, not paying and so on, of a kind which are characteristic of this kind of bumbling enterprise. Nonetheless it was not on the 'spur of the moment' and it was organised activity. 

So far as damage to the community is concerned, in cases like this one cannot point to specific individuals who are adversely affected or would be adversely affected by these kinds of crimes. Nonetheless plainly if the drugs had been sold to people willing to take them, there would have been injury and damage."" 

38The remarks then turned to the Respondent's subjective circumstances. His Honour characterised the Respondent's criminal history in the following way (AB16): 

""... I have referred to his history of his contact with the courts. It stands in his favour to a limited extent, particularly that there has been no major drug dealing beforehand in his activities, but it is a life of regrettably persistent minor criminality (noting however that he has served a term for armed robbery previously)."" 

It must be said that this was a somewhat generous depiction of the Respondent's criminal history, which had seen the Respondent imprisoned several times, the last of which had expired on 17 May 2005, 10 months before the offences committed on 7 March 2006. 

39Following reference to the delay in the sentencing proceedings, his Honour set out, in some detail, aspects of the reports of Dr Luxton and Mr Watson-Munro (AB16-19). The sentencing Judge then observed (AB19): 

""Counsel have put before me a number of the leading authorities dealing with the imprisonment of people suffering from illness. One principle is clear; the mere fact that somebody happens to be sick does not mean that they get a free ride or a lighter sentence. Summarising the authorities, my understanding is that that principle is qualified where there is a multiplicity of very serious illnesses so great that it would be a threat to life and a grave impairment of the quality of life to impose a longer period of imprisonment than is minimally necessary to serve purposes of punishment. I am satisfied on all the medical material before me that this is an exceptional case. It is not so exceptional that Mr Achurch gets straight out of gaol, but it is sufficiently significant for me to take it into account as an exceptional reason why I should, in sentencing for the principal offence, set a non-parole period which is significantly lower than otherwise would be the case."" 

40His Honour indicated an intention to impose concurrent sentences for the first and second counts and to commence the sentence on the fourth count one year after the commencement of the sentences for the other counts. His Honour then imposed a fixed term of imprisonment on the first count, observing that he declined to set a non-parole period ""for the obvious reason that that sentence has already been served"" . 

41His Honour then moved to the second count and imposed initially a fixed term of four years' imprisonment, stating that he declined to set a non-parole period ""for the reason that the structure of the sentences imposed overall makes it inappropriate"" (AB20). 

42The transcript reveals that the following discussion ensued immediately after his Honour made that statement (AB20): 

""BROWN [for the Crown] : Sorry your Honour, I think you have to fix a non-parole period with a standard non-parole period offence. 

HIS HONOUR: Well I need to explain why I am setting the sentence don't I? I don't need to ... 

BROWN: Yes but I think it's part of the legislation that with standard non-parole period offences there needs to be a non-parole period and a parole period set, that's all, to comply with the legislation. 

HIS HONOUR: What section's that? 

BROWN: I haven't brought my practice. I think it might be under s54. 

HIS HONOUR: Very well, thank you. For count 2 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for four years to date from 16 August 2006 and to expire on 15 August 2010. I set a non-parole period of four years. My reason for setting a non-parole period which is less than the standard non-parole period is because in my view this offence is significantly less substantial in terms of culpability than a mid-range offence for such an offence."" 

43The notation on the back of the indictment, signed by his Honour, said with respect to the second count ""I find special circumstances - criminality of offence is well below mid-range of seriousness"" (AB5). 

44His Honour then turned to the fourth count and imposed a non-parole period of five years with a balance of term of eight years. His Honour explained this sentence as follows (AB20-21): 

""In my view, this is not a matter which I should set the objective seriousness of the offence as being mid-range for the reason that the offender has no history of drug supply and because the offence was 'nipped in the bud' and nothing in effect came of it. There was no actual supply to members of the community; albeit the offence itself is serious in the grave potential danger it poses the community."" 

45Before concluding his remarks on sentence, the sentencing Judge said (AB21): 

""As I explained, there are medical considerations which I regard as being exceptional to a point where I have reduced what would otherwise be the justifiable retributive punishment to a lower level. The offender will be eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period on 15 August 2012. I recommend that in considering the grant of parole or otherwise, the Parole Board take into account these remarks on sentence and the medical condition of Mr Achurch at the time when parole is being considered. 

That means Mr Achurch that the non-parole period is not an automatic point at which you may be released from custody. It's possible that you may be released from custody at that time. But for your accumulation of serious medical conditions, your actual sentence, your actual non-parole period, your minimum time in custody, would have been longer, and whether or not you will be released to custody in 2012 or some later date, remains a matter for the Parole Board in the light of its consideration of the matters I have mentioned."" 

46The notation concerning the fourth count on the back of the indictment, signed by his Honour, said ""I find special circumstances - medical condition"" . 

Evidence in the Court of Criminal Appeal 

47Before this Court, the Crown sought to read the affidavit of Magdalen Clements sworn 13 May 2011, which annexed reports of Dr K Suresh Badari, senior staff specialist with Justice Health. The Court allowed the affidavit to be read upon the basis that it would only become relevant in the event that the Court found error and determined to resentence the Respondent. Dr Badari gave evidence and was cross-examined by Mr Brady, counsel for the Respondent. 

48In addition, an affidavit of the Respondent affirmed 12 May 2011 was read at the hearing in this Court, upon the same basis as evidence was received from Dr Badari. 

49I will return to the evidence of Dr Badari and the affidavit of the Respondent after considering the grounds of appeal. 

Ground 1 - Failure to Determine Objective Criminality of First Count 

Submissions 

50The Crown submitted that it is axiomatic that, to determine the appropriate sentence for a particular offence, it is first necessary to assess the gravity of the crime. Without such an assessment, it was submitted that it is not possible to reliably impose a sentence that is reasonably proportionate to the criminality of the offending. 

51The Crown submitted that the first count was a very serious example of an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. The sentencing Judge recited the facts relating to the supply of 108.7 grams of MDMA, and noted that the Respondent was a principal in the organised drug syndicate that affected the supply and that it was part of an ongoing operation for commercial gain. His Honour recited the Respondent's subjective circumstances and then pronounced sentence. 

52The Crown submitted that his Honour made no finding as to the objective gravity of this offence and gave no reason for the sentence that he imposed. Had his Honour considered the objective criminality of this offence, it was submitted that given the Respondent's role as the principal of the drug operation, the level of planning, the commercial gain and the quantity of drugs involved, together with the fact that the Respondent was not a drug user and was dealing for commercial gain, that this was a very serious example of such an offence. 

53It was submitted for the Crown that this error served to explain why a manifestly inadequate sentence was imposed for this offence, an argument developed further with respect to Ground 7. 

54Mr Brady submitted that his Honour specified the factual basis upon which he sentenced the Respondent, including factors which aggravated or mitigated the seriousness of the offence. Whilst acknowledging that the sentencing Judge did not specifically state where the offence fell in the range of objective seriousness, Mr Brady submitted that his Honour clearly considered the seriousness of the offence. 

55Mr Brady submitted that a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and three months, in view of the objective criminality and the Respondent's subjective circumstances, was not outside the range of available sentences for an offence of this type. Bearing in mind the finding that this was an exceptional case, he submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the manner complained of in this ground. 
 
Decision 

56The maximum penalty for the first count, an offence under s.25(1) DMT Act is imprisonment for 15 years. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence. 

57In Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118, Simpson J (Davies J and Grove AJ agreeing) observed at [71]: 

""Assessment of the objective gravity of any offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. It should not be doubted that any sentencing decision calls for attention to be paid to the objective gravity of the offence: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357."" 

58It is the case that the sentencing Judge adverted, in a somewhat global fashion, to factors which bore upon the objective seriousness of the three offences for which the Respondent stood to be sentenced. The second and fourth counts carried standard non-parole periods and the arguments with respect to these counts will be considered under separate grounds of appeal. 

59In my view, the principles of sentencing required at least some assessment of the objective gravity of the first count on the indictment. The principles referred to by Simpson J in Khoury v R called for such an assessment. It was not done in this case. 

60Errors of this type with respect to standard non-parole period offences have been characterised by this Court as errors of process, with the question remaining whether the sentence actually imposed discloses error with which the Court should interfere on a Crown appeal under s.5D, or on an offender's application for leave to appeal under s.6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 

61In my view, a similar approach is appropriate here. The Court should mark the fact that no finding or conclusion was made with respect to the objective gravity of the first count, but then consider what flows from that in the context of determination of the seventh ground which alleges manifest inadequacy. 

Grounds 2 and 3 - Suggested Errors in Failing to Determine Adequately Where Counts 2 and 4 Lay in the Range of Objective Seriousness for Offences of that Type 

Grounds 4 and 5 - Suggested Failure to Have Regard to the Standard Non-Parole Periods for Counts 2 and 4 

62The written submissions of the parties addressed these four grounds of appeal together and it is appropriate for this Court to take the same course. 

Submissions 

63As the sentences were imposed after trial, the Crown submitted that the standard non-parole period provisions had direct application on sentence in this case with respect to the second and fourth counts. The Crown submitted that it was necessary to assess the objective seriousness of these offences to determine whether each offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of the relevant kind. 

64The Crown submitted that this is a basic rule of sentencing and is no idle formality: R v Green; R v Quinn [2010] NSWCCA 313 at [72]-[73]. 

65The Crown submitted that at no time prior to the announcement of the sentences, did the sentencing Judge assess the objective seriousness of these offences or state where in the relevant range they lay. It was only after his Honour had pronounced the sentences on the first and second counts and had already determined the sentence on the fourth count, and only after the Crown lawyer raised the issue with his Honour, that the sentencing Judge provided a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period with respect to the second count. 

66It was submitted that his Honour gave no reasons at all for the finding with respect to the second count and that the reasons provided with respect to the fourth count were misguided. It was submitted that the Respondent's criminal history could not bear upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, nor could the fact that police had intercepted the supply of methylamphetamine involved in the fourth count before it was disseminated into the community. 

67The Crown submitted that matters which rendered the second and fourth counts at least mid-range offences, if not higher, included the Respondent's role as the principal of a highly organised drug operation, the fact that he was not a drug user, and was supplying for commercial gain only, the fact that the quantity involved in the fourth count was 2.6 times the large commercial quantity and the fact that the offences were part of an ongoing drug operation. The Crown submitted that the Respondent's criminality was at the highest level for offences of this type: R v Green; R v Quinn at [82]ff. 

68It was submitted that the greater the departure from the standard non-parole period, the greater is the requirement for reasons to be given to explain the departure. It was submitted here that there was, in reality, a massive discrepancy between the standard non-parole period for the second count (10 years) and the non-parole period imposed (four years) with no balance of term. With respect to the fourth count, the standard non-parole period was 15 years and the non-parole period imposed was five years. 

69The Crown submitted that both the content of the remarks on sentence, and the actual non-parole periods imposed, revealed error as asserted by the Crown in Grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5. 

70Mr Brady submitted that the sentencing Judge did advert to the standard non-parole periods with respect to the second and fourth counts, and did have regard to them in passing sentence. 

71Concerning the second count, whilst acknowledging that the sentencing Judge gave no specific reasons for the assessment that the offence was less than the mid-range, Mr Brady submitted that his Honour was entitled to come to that view because, whilst the crime was organised, it was a ""kind of bumbling exercise"" , and by reference to the amount of drug involved in the second count and the fact that the offence involved an offer to supply only. 

72With respect to the fourth count, Mr Brady accepted that the sentencing Judge did err in stating that the objective seriousness was reduced by the Respondent's lack of history for drug supply. He submitted, however, that the sentencing Judge was entitled to consider the fact that the drug was not actually supplied as a matter reducing its objective seriousness: Fahs v R [2007] NSWCCA 26 at [29]. He submitted, as well, that the amount of the drug lay at the bottom end of the range of large commercial quantity and that this served to reduce the objective seriousness as well. 

73Mr Brady noted that the Crown submission in the District Court was that the fourth count was ""above mid range but not substantially so"" , and that the sentencing Judge had concluded that the offence was at the mid-range of seriousness. He pointed to the discussion during the sentencing hearing concerning the role of the standard non-parole periods. 

74Mr Brady acknowledged that there was a radical departure from the standard non-parole periods in this case. He submitted that this must be considered in the light of all his Honour's reasons, which included an assessment of the seriousness of the offences, as well as an assessment of the Respondent's subjective circumstances. 

75Whilst acknowledging that there was error demonstrated in taking into account the Respondent's past history in considering the objective seriousness of the fourth count, Mr Brady submitted that this was not such as would lead this Court to resentence the Respondent. 

Decision 

76As the Respondent had been convicted after trial, the standard non-parole periods with respect to the second and fourth counts had direct application by force of statute, and not merely as a guidepost on sentence following a plea of guilty: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 184 [68]. 

77When sentencing for offences for which Parliament has provided a standard non-parole period, it is necessary for Judges to specify where the offences lie on the range of objective seriousness for those crimes: R v Sellars [2010] NSWCCA 133 at [12]; R v McEvoy at [87]. 

78The sentencing Judge imposed non-parole periods for the second and fourth counts which were very significantly below the standard non-parole period for each offence. The further downwards the sentencing Judge moves from the standard non-parole, the greater the need for close examination of the findings, in particular concerning the objective seriousness of the offence: R v Knight [2007] NSWCCA 283; 176 A Crim R 338 at 341 [4]. There is, of course, a statutory obligation to give reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period: s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

79With respect to the second count, a standard non-parole period of 10 years was prescribed. The sentencing Judge initially imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for four years. After the inability to make such an order had been raised by the Crown, his Honour stated that a non-parole period of four years would be fixed. 

80In reality, his Honour set a fixed term of imprisonment, an approach which was contrary to statute: s.45(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ; Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 at [7]. 

81Accordingly, error has been demonstrated concerning the sentence imposed on the second count. Further, I am satisfied that error has been demonstrated with respect to the reasons given by the sentencing Judge concerning the role of the standard non-parole period on sentence. His Honour explained why such a non-parole period (effectively a fixed term) was imposed because ""this offence is significantly less substantial in terms of culpability than a mid range offence for such an offence"" . 

82The sentencing Judge had made no specific findings concerning the offence contained in the second count. As a result, this conclusion was opaque. Although Mr Brady made submissions by reference to the facts of the second count in support of a contention that this finding was open to the sentencing Judge, these were not findings made by his Honour and, in my view, do not leave reasonably open the conclusion expressed by his Honour to explain the sentence passed on this count. This error was compounded by the finding of ""special circumstances"" recorded on the back of the indictment, said to be because the criminality of the offence was ""well below mid range of seriousness"" . Such an approach involved a clear and impermissible double counting of this factor. More to the point, his Honour did not fix any balance of term. The sentence was, in reality, a fixed term. 

83I am satisfied that error of process, and error in substance, has been demonstrated concerning the sentence passed on the second count. 

84With respect to the fourth count, counsel for the Respondent conceded that one of the two factors referred to by the sentencing Judge did not bear upon the objective seriousness of the offence so that error was demonstrated in this respect. There was a live issue in the District Court as to whether the fourth count lay above the mid-range (the Crown submission) or below the mid-range (the defence submission). His Honour did not refer to this controversy or resolve it. An analysis of these submissions, in my view, could not place this offence below the mid-range. 

85It is clear that the fact that the Respondent had ""no history of drug supply"" did not bear upon the objective seriousness of the fourth count. 

86In any event, the statement was factually incorrect. By the time the Respondent committed the offence contained in the fourth count on 30 May 2006, he had committed offences on 7 March 2006 of supplying a prohibited drug (the first count) and supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (the second count). 

87In relation to the fourth count, the sentencing Judge provided as one of the two reasons as to why he should not ""set the objective seriousness of the offence as being mid range"" was that the offence was ""nipped in the bud"" and there was no actual supply to members of the community. However, his Honour acknowledged that the offence itself was serious in the ""grave potential danger it poses the community"" . 

88It was the case that the large commercial quantity of 2.6 kilograms of methylamphetamine was located in six individual resealable plastic bags in the garage of the Horsley Park premises. Mr Brady contended that the fact that the drug was not supplied, and would never reach the public (as any supply would be to an undercover police officer) reduced the objective seriousness of the offence. He relied upon Fahs v R in this respect. 

89A number of decisions of this Court have considered the relevance of this factor on sentence for a drug supply offence. 

90In R v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103 at [21], Smart AJ (Sheller JA and Studdert J agreeing) said at [21]: 

""In assessing the sentence to be imposed it is relevant to take into account that the prohibited drugs supplied to undercover agents will not be disseminated into the community. Of itself this is usually unlikely to lead to other than a very minor diminution of culpability. The offender had the intention to supply and in supplying knew and believed that the drugs would be likely to find their way into the community. The fact that they did not do so was not due to the offender."" 

91In R v Way , the Court (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J) said at 198-199 [172]: 

""We also consider that it was appropriate for his Honour to have regarded the offence as one committed without regard for public safety (another s 21A(2) factor). The applicant was not to know that the buyer was an undercover operative and that the drugs would be seized and destroyed. What was relevant in this context was his motivation or understanding, so far as that went to an assessment of his moral culpability. He undertook the transaction expecting a considerable personal profit, and in the understanding that the drugs would be resold, heedless of the consequences to those who purchased and consumed them, or of the fact that users commonly resort to property offences to feed a habit, leaving other victims in their wake. The observations of Smart AJ in Regina v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103 [at para 21] as to the limited relevance of the fact that drugs which are supplied to undercover agents will not reach the community, apply. As his Honour pointed out, that circumstance was not due to any act of the offender."" 

92Later in R v Way , the Court said at 200-201 [181]: 

""We are not however persuaded that the applicant can properly suggest that his objective criminality was in any way reduced by reference to the conduct of the undercover officer. While the applicant could lawfully have been arrested after the first supply offence, there were very good reasons for the police to pursue the operation in order properly to investigate any suspected distribution network in Coffs Harbour and its supply sources. That could not be done without the undercover operative expressing a continuing interest to make further purchases, in a context where the applicant had indicated both a willingness, and a capacity, to oblige. The present case was distinguishable from the case of a reluctant offender who was encouraged to commit an offence, or 'pushed' to supply larger quantities of a drug which he would not have done absent pressure or persuasion from police, in which some mitigation of sentence would be warranted, as was the situation in R v Rahme (1991) 53 A Crim R 8."" 

93In R v Gao [2007] NSWCCA 343, Latham J (Basten JA agreeing) said at [22]: 

""In Fahs v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 26, Howie J (with whom Simpson and Buddin JJ agreed) expressed the view at [29] that the fact that a commercial quantity of ecstasy did not reach the public, because of the supply of that quantity to an undercover police officer, reduced the objective gravity of the offence in that case below the mid-range. I do not understand his Honour to have been expressing any matter of principle. Clearly, there may be cases where a combination of factors, including a plea of guilty and supply to undercover operatives, will nonetheless justify a finding that the offence falls within the mid-range of objective gravity and warrants the imposition of a non parole period approaching the standard non parole period. That is, as I understand it, the Crown's argument in the instant case."" 

94Rothman J agreed with Latham J in R v Gao , and made the following additional comments, at [47]-[48], which are pertinent to this issue: 

""47 No principle establishes as a general proposition that the fact, simpliciter, that the drugs are sold to undercover police and do not, therefore, reach the public, diminishes the culpability of the offending. 

48 In such an undercover operation, it is beneficial to the community that the drugs are not able to be used. But that benefit is the result of the actions of law enforcement agencies, and not the result of any intention or action of the person charged. That there are no victims to such a sale may be a factor, like many others, that a sentencing judge takes into account, but for my own part, I would not generally consider it significant."" 

95In Ly v R [2008] NSWCCA 262. Hislop J (Beazley JA and Harrison J agreeing) said at [26]-[27]: 

""26 That the drugs were not disseminated into the community is a relevant factor, the weight of which will vary from case to case: see R v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103 at [21]; Fahs v R [2007] NSWCCA 26 at [29]; R v Gao at [22]. 

27 Whilst the drugs found in the applicant's possession were not actually disseminated by the applicant into the community, the applicant was to be sentenced for deemed supply in circumstances where it was clear that this was not an isolated occasion of the possession of drugs for the purpose of supply. In the circumstances, little, if any, weight can be attached to the fact that these drugs were not actually supplied."" 

96In Hristovski v R , with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J, I said at [41]: 

""The fact that the drugs actually supplied would not be disseminated to the community because the supply took place to an undercover police operative does not materially assist the Applicant. The Applicant fully intended that the drugs would be disseminated to the community, and it was no act of the Applicant which stood in the way of such dissemination: Ly v R [2008] NSWCCA 262 at [27]."" 

97These authorities make clear that, although the fact that drugs are not disseminated into the community may be a relevant factor on sentence, the weight to be given to that factor will vary from case to case. A primary consideration remains that an offender intended to supply the prohibited drug to members of the community, and that it was no act of an offender that resulted in this not happening. 

98It is also relevant to consider whether the offence in question is an isolated occasion of possession of drugs for the purpose of supply, or was a supply made in the course of an established commercial activity: R v Way at 197 [163]. 

99I return to the facts of this case. The large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, bagged in six separate packages, was located by police upon the execution of the search warrant in the garage of the Horsley Park premises. There is no doubt that the Respondent intended to supply this quantity of prohibited drug, through his distribution network, to ultimate end users in the community. It was no act of the Respondent that caused this dissemination not to happen. If any actual supply of this drug was to an undercover police officer, then it would not reach the public. However, the Respondent did not know this. He intended the drug to reach end users, and he planned and expected to make a substantial profit from this crime. Further, this was not an isolated offence on the Respondent's part. It was part of an established commercial activity. 

100In my view, this factor was of very limited assistance, at best, to the Respondent on sentence. It was not reasonably open to the sentencing Judge to take this into account in a way that provided anything more than a modest reduction in the objective seriousness of the fourth count. 

101The principal role of the Respondent, taken with the substantial quantity, the profit motive and the fact that the offence was part of an ongoing drug supply business, placed the fourth count at the mid-range for this type of offence. 

102I am satisfied that the Crown has demonstrated error with respect to both factors which the sentencing Judge referred to as reducing the fourth count below the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

103I am satisfied that the Crown has made good Grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 and that the impact of these errors on sentence was significant in this case. 

Ground 6 - Suggested Error in Giving Excessive Weight to the Respondent's Medical Condition 

Submissions 

104The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge was clearly very sympathetic to the Respondent's poor health, but that his Honour had failed completely to consider the appropriate balance between the criminality of the conduct in question, and any damage to the Respondent's health or shortening of life, in accordance with the principles in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589; R v Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570 at 573-574 and R v Anastasiou [2010] NSWCCA 100 at [22]. 

105The Crown submitted that it should be kept in mind that, if an offender's health deteriorates during the course of his sentence, the executive is empowered to order release on humanitarian grounds. 

106It was submitted that the sentencing Judge referred, in a truncated way, to the applicable principles, but then failed to make any factual findings about the Respondent's medical condition. Rather, his Honour merely stated that this was an exceptional case. 

107The Crown submitted that given his Honour's failure to make any findings as to the objective criminality of the offences, it is difficult to ascertain what weight had been given to the Respondent's ill health. Absent such findings, it was submitted that the sentencing Judge could not, and did not, conduct the balancing exercise referred to in R v Sopher . 

108It was submitted that, had his Honour correctly considered the evidence, he would have noted Dr Luxton's opinion that Justice Health can and does provide regular dialysis treatment to inmates (AB153). The Crown submitted that the only shortcoming in treatment provided by Justice Health identified by Dr Luxton, was that fluid and dietary management in prison can be difficult (AB153). 

109The Crown submitted that Dr Luxton's conclusion that prolonged incarceration will ""significantly reduce"" the Respondent's life expectancy was not supported by the balance of his report. Dr Luxton had stated in his second report (dated 1 July 2010) that he did not know whether the mortality rate for patients on dialysis is greater in the prison population than in the general population (AB168). It was submitted that it was the Respondent's medical condition (not his treatment) that put him at risk of severe illness and early mortality, and that the only potentially adverse factor from imprisonment identified by Dr Luxton was the possible difficulty in managing fluid and dietary needs (AB168). 

110Whilst acknowledging that the Respondent's medical condition, and its impact on his conditions of custody, were relevant factors to be taken into account on sentence, the Crown submitted that the very low sentences imposed indicated that the sentencing Judge had allowed these circumstances to overwhelm the objective gravity of the offences. 

111Mr Brady submitted that the Respondent's medical condition was a significant issue throughout the sentencing hearing and that it was apparent that his Honour was alive to the balancing exercise required. He submitted that the sentencing Judge made factual findings on sentence in relation to the Respondent's health and the effect of his health on sentence. 

112Counsel submitted that the sentencing Judge had recited and accepted the evidence contained in the reports of Dr Luxton (AB17-18). 

113Mr Brady submitted that, contrary to the Crown submission, the sentencing Judge had noted that part of Dr Luxton's report where he observed that there had usually been no obstacle to providing regular dialysis to Long Bay Gaol inmates (AB18). 

114It was submitted that Dr Luxton was well placed to form the opinion that prolonged incarceration would significantly reduce the Respondent's life expectancy, and that Dr Luxton's reports were admitted without objection and he was not required for cross-examination. It was submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to accept the opinion of Dr Luxton. 

115Having accepted Dr Luxton's opinion, Mr Brady submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to find that this was an exceptional case which allowed for a substantial departure from the standard non-parole periods and that the sentencing Judge made this clear in his remarks on sentence. 

116Mr Brady submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the reasoning of the sentencing Judge concerning the relevance of the Respondent's medical condition on sentence. 

Decision 

117Where illness is seen as relevant to the determination of sentence, its weight must be assessed in light of all the circumstances of the case, and an appropriate balance has to be maintained between the criminality of the offender and any damage to health or shortening of life: R v Sopher at 573; R v BJW [2000] NSWCCA 60; 112 A Crim R 1 at 6-8 [23]-[31]. 

118In R v Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395, Wood CJ at CL (McClellan AJA and Smart AJ agreeing), at [9]-[11], summarised the principles applicable where an offender's medical condition was sought to be taken into account on sentence: 

""[9] It was held in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589, an authority to which the Applicant made express reference, that while the health of the offender is relevant to the type and length of any sanction imposed, generally speaking it will only be a factor tending to mitigate punishment when there is evidence to show that there is a serious risk that imprisonment will be a greater burden on an offender, by reason of ill health, or where there is a serious risk that imprisonment will have a grave adverse effect on the offender's health. 

[10] That decision was applied by the High Court in Bailey v DPP (1988) 62 ALJR 319, and by this court in R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 and R v L NSWCCA 17 June 1996: see also R v Burrell (2004) 114 A Crim R 207 and R v Azar [2000] NSWCCA 26. 

[11] It remains the responsibility of the Corrective Services Authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for prisoners: R v Vachalec , and R v Krasser NSWCCA 2 September 1993. Most conditions can be adequately managed by those authorities without the need for mitigating the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate, and it is only in relatively rare cases that the Smith principle is applicable."" 

119It is the case that persons with serious health problems are managed within the prison system. This Court has considered this factor on sentence in different contexts, including, for example, offenders with the HIV virus ( R v Higgins [2002] NSWCCA 407; 133 A Crim R 385), asthma and angina ( R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193) and ischaemic heart disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes ( R v Way ). 

120In R v Higgins , Howie J (Wood CJ at CL and Smart AJ agreeing) said at 391 [32]: 

""Unfortunately for the applicant, this Court cannot give priority to his health and well being as the medical profession is required to do. The criminal justice system has at its heart the welfare of the community generally and its protection. The courts must tailor their sentences with an eye to that overriding concern so far as common humanity will allow."" 

121In R v Wickham , Howie J (Bell and Hislop JJ agreeing) said at [18]: 

""It may be accepted that the applicant's physical condition was poor and that prison would be difficult for him in that regard. It is trite that poor physical health and its impact upon the severity of an offender's imprisonment are relevant factors in sentencing. R v Kier [2004] NSWCCA 106 is a recent authority for that proposition if any is needed. But it is clear that ill health does not necessarily require that a sentence be mitigated from that which would otherwise be appropriate: R v L (NSWCCA, unreported, 17 June 1996); Kier at 65. One of the relevant considerations in determining what, if any, weight to give to that factor will be the seriousness of the offence. Another will be whether the medical condition existed at the time of the offence and whether it has deteriorated in the period between the offence and sentence. Common humanity will sometimes require a court to consider a life-threatening physical illness as a matter of mitigation even though the offender was suffering from such an illness at the time of the commission of the offence. However, where as here, the issue is one of the protection of the community, it may be that common humanity for the offender gives way to concern for potential victims."" 

122In R v Way , this Court allowed an offender's appeal against sentence, and resentenced the offender. The Court referred at 199 [173] to the fact that the middle-aged offender (47 years' old) had ""ischaemic cardiac disease and non-insulin dependent diabetes which were less likely to be treated appropriately, or managed as effectively, within a prison environment, particularly during a sentence of the length imposed, which would have had him confined for 10 years, than on the outside"" . 

123Having taken the offender's medical condition and a range of other objective and subjective factors into account, the Court resentenced the offender, but declined to find ""special circumstances"" justifying a departure from the statutory ratio ""since all the relevant circumstances have already been taken into account in setting the non-parole period"" and no other factor had been identified to justify further variation (at 201 [185]). 

124The State Parole Authority may direct the release of an offender on parole before the offender's eligibility date if the offender is dying, or if the State Parole Authority is satisfied that it is necessary to release the offender on parole because of exceptional extenuating circumstances: s.160(1) Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (""CAS Act""). Further, the prerogative of mercy is preserved: s.270 CAS Act. 

125Justice Health is a statutory health corporation, with functions including the provision of health services to offenders and persons in custody: s.236A CAS Act. The Chief Executive Officer of Justice Health has a statutory right to have free and unfettered access at all times to correctional centres, medical records and offenders to ensure that statutory provisions relating to Justice Health are being complied with: s.236B CAS Act. 

126Accordingly, the Court should approach an appeal such as this upon the basis that the contemporary statutory regime entrusts and empowers Justice Health to take all necessary steps to provide health services to an inmate such as the Respondent whilst in custody. Further, clause 47 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 (""CAS Regulation"") makes provision for diet, and clause 47(3) requires the diet of an inmate having special dietary needs to be planned having regard to those needs. Where, as in this case, the special dietary needs relate to the care, management and treatment of a medical condition, then Justice Health is in a position to ensure that the diet is being provided to the inmate. 

127This ground of appeal should be considered without regard to the evidence of Dr Badari and the affidavit of the Respondent read at the hearing of this appeal. That evidence will become directly relevant should the Court move to resentence the Respondent. 

128There is a risk in a case such as this that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; R v BJW at 8 [31]. In substance, this is what the Crown contends has happened in this case. 

129The starting point is to fairly read the two reports of Dr Luxton which were before the sentencing Judge. I accept the Crown submission that, fairly read, these reports did not suggest any difficulty arising from the likely need for dialysis for the Respondent at some time in the future whilst in custody. Rather, the reports suggested that the potentially adverse factor related to the possible difficulty in managing the Respondent's fluid and dietary needs. 

130I accept that there is something of a disconnect between the particulars contained in Dr Luxton's reports and his conclusions. It is reasonable to approach the present Crown appeal upon the basis of a complete reading of Dr Luxton's reports, including his conclusions. 

131Having undertaken that task, I am satisfied that the sentencing Judge has given excessive weight on sentence, to a marked degree, to the Respondent's medical condition. His Honour has allowed this aspect of the Respondent's subjective case to distract from the need to give adequate and proper weight to the objective seriousness of the offences. Quite simply, the sentences imposed for the second and fourth counts (in particular) are well below the range for the offences found, and do not reflect the objective seriousness of those offences: R v BJW at 8 [31]. Those sentences do not meet a fundamental purpose of sentencing, namely that the Respondent be adequately punished for his crimes: s.3A(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . 

132Although his Honour observed that the seriousness of the offences had been balanced with what were said to be the exceptional circumstances of the Respondent's health, there was a very substantial underweight on the objective seriousness side of the scales and a very substantial overweight on the subjective side of the case. 

133It must be kept in mind that the Respondent had a long history of diabetes with the consequences of that condition having affected him for many years. The other conditions which affected him at the time of sentence had more recent origin in the early 21 st century. 

134The Respondent was subject to these conditions at the time when he engaged in the very serious crimes for which he was convicted by the jury. These were offences of organised drug supply in which the Respondent was a principal or co-principal. The crimes were carried on for commercial gain over a period of months between March and May 2006. It may be taken that the Respondent was well aware that the consequence of his arrest and conviction for these serious crimes would be a lengthy period of imprisonment. He had recent experience of his medical conditions being managed in custody up to May 2005, yet 10 months later he was organising and profiting from substantial drug supply offences. 

135As the Courts have stated repeatedly in this context, ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor should offenders expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health, with it being the responsibility of the correctional services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners: R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 at 353-354; R v Smith at 589. Common humanity will operate in the sentencing discretion, but the welfare and protection of the community is important, as is the need for adequate punishment to be imposed for serious crimes. 

136Where an offender with serious health problems engages in serious and protracted criminality, knowing that the consequence of detection is a substantial period of imprisonment, then this consideration is also relevant to the weight to be given to an offender's medical condition on sentence. 

137The Respondent had a prior criminal history and had served sentences of full-time imprisonment between 1991 and 1997 (for armed robbery) and in 2004-2005 (for receiving and other offences). 

138Having been released from prison in May 2005, he committed these serious drug supply crimes in March to May 2006. 

139The Respondent was entitled to have the sentencing Court give appropriate weight to his medical condition, including the prospect of dialysis (which could be managed in custody) and the possibility of some difficulty in the management of fluid and dietary needs. Dr Luxton's reports pointed to adverse factors related to incarceration, but did not permit any accurate assessment concerning the likely impact on the Respondent as a result of his incarceration. 

140In my view, it was not reasonably open to the sentencing Judge to find that this was an exceptional case which permitted, in reality, the Respondent's medical condition to become the dominant and controlling factor on sentence at the expense of the objective seriousness of his crimes. 

141I am satisfied that Ground 6 has been made good. 
 
Ground 7 - The Sentences are Individually and as Aggregated Manifestly Inadequate 

Submissions 

142The Crown submitted that the sentences ultimately imposed failed to reflect the criminality involved in the offences and were manifestly inadequate. It was submitted that the first count was an objectively serious offence and that the second and fourth counts were at least in the mid-range of offences of their type. As the Respondent was sentenced after trial, the standard non-parole periods were of very great significance to the second and fourth counts, as were the maximum penalties. 

143The Crown submitted that nowhere in the remarks on sentence did his Honour refer to any of the purposes of sentencing. In particular, there was no reference to considerations of deterrence. 

144Whilst acknowledging that the Respondent's health problems constituted a factor calling for some mitigation of sentence, the Crown submitted that adequate weight was required to be given to the criminality of the offences and considerations of general and personal deterrence. 

145The Crown submitted that the total concurrency of the sentences on the first and second counts and the accumulation of only one year of the sentence on the fourth count was also suggestive of error. It was submitted that there was no considered assessment by the sentencing Judge of the totality of the offending, or the extent to which the aggregate sentence could accommodate the totality of the Respondent's criminality. 

146It was submitted that the first and second counts, although committed on the same day, were discrete supplies of substantial quantities of MDMA and were not part of a single offence so that complete concurrency was not appropriate. Further, it was submitted that the fourth count related to an entirely separate event, involving a different drug, separated in time and location from the first and second counts. 

147The Crown submitted that the imposition of an aggregate non-parole period of six years, with a balance of term of eight years, was manifestly inadequate. 

148Mr Brady submitted that the sentencing Judge accepted that those who involve themselves in trafficking of illicit drugs for profit can expect to receive substantial custodial sentences so that his Honour had not overlooked this principle. 

149Further, Mr Brady submitted that his Honour had given effect to the principles of deterrence and that attention had been given to the issues of concurrency and accumulation. 

150Although Mr Brady acknowledged that his Honour's reasoning with respect to concurrency and partial accumulation was condensed, it was clear that his Honour had regard to the relevant principles. He submitted that this was a discretionary matter and that it had not been demonstrated that the discretion had miscarried. 

151Mr Brady submitted that the sentences were not manifestly inadequate. 

Decision 

152To make good this ground, it is necessary for the Crown to demonstrate that the sentences were manifestly inadequate in the well-recognised sense that they are unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]; Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [8]-[9]. 

153It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because (if it be the case), the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v the King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 85 ALJR 195 at 207-208 [58]. 

154The first count involved an actual supply of 400 MDMA pills to an undercover police officer in exchange for the sum of $4,600.00. The Respondent was convicted at trial. He has not demonstrated remorse. Apart from his medical condition, his subjective circumstances did not provide any real assistance to him. Although I regard a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and three months as being a lenient sentence for this offence, I am not persuaded that that sentence is manifestly inadequate having regard to the relevant principles. 

155I am persuaded that an effective fixed term of imprisonment for four years on the second count is manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of this case. Although that offence involved an offer to supply 1,000 MDMA pills without an actual supply being involved, it is important to bear in mind that agreement to supply or offers to supply prohibited drugs each constitute transactional activities that play an important and central role in the chain of drug trafficking: Vu v R [2006] NSWCCA 188 at [88]. The sentencing Judge found that the Respondent was a principal in relation to the second count and that he was motivated by profit. The Respondent was convicted after trial and the standard non-parole period had direct application. In my view, it was appropriate to place this offence at the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The Respondent was entitled to a measure of mitigation because of his medical condition. Beyond that, there was really nothing operating in the Respondent's favour on the subjective side of the case. 

156A further question concerns the imposition of completely concurrent sentences for the first and second counts. In the circumstances of this case, this approach was generous to the Respondent. As I propose that the Respondent should be resentenced on the second count, it is not necessary to say more at this point. 

157The fourth count involved a very serious offence where more than two-and-a-half times the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine was to be supplied. I am well satisfied that a non-parole period of five years is manifestly inadequate for this offence. 

158In reality, the sentencing Judge appears to have given a very substantial double counting in favour of the Respondent by reference to his medical condition. Firstly, his Honour appears to have brought that factor into account to very substantially reduce the appropriate non-parole periods (on the second and fourth counts), and then the factor has been taken into account again to justify a finding of special circumstances, so as to vary greatly the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence on the fourth count. This approach is erroneous: R v Way at 201 [185] (see [123] above). This erroneous approach serves to explain how manifestly inadequate non-parole periods came to be passed for these offences. 

159It is necessary to give weight, and proper weight, to the very significant factors of general and specific deterrence applicable to this class of crime. The Respondent had some experience in other serious types of crime for which he had served sentences of imprisonment, as recently as 10 months before the offences of 7 March 2006. As a man of experience and maturity, he embarked upon this serious course of drug supply for profit as a principal in an organisation effectively controlled by him. All of this happened at a time when he was aware of his own health difficulties. He took the risk of being sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment, no doubt because of the substantial profits to be made. 

160In my view, clear error is revealed in this process giving rise to a manifestly inadequate sentence for this count. 

161The Crown has established Ground 7. 

Resentencing the Respondent 

162Error has been demonstrated in accordance with each of the grounds of appeal relied upon by the Crown. This Court retains a residual discretion to reject the Crown appeal for reasons other than double jeopardy: R v JW at 515 [150]. No discretionary basis has been demonstrated for this Court to decline to intervene in the circumstances of this case. 

163In determining to resentence the Respondent, I have had regard to the reports of Dr Badari dated 9 and 11 May 2011, together with his oral evidence given on 27 May 2011, and also the affidavit of the Respondent affirmed 12 May 2011. That evidence provides an up-to-date account of the treatment available to, and provided to, the Respondent in custody by Justice Health. The evidence demonstrates that, in the likely event that dialysis is required, the Respondent will receive appropriate treatment at the Long Bay Prison Hospital and, if need be, at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The evidence also reveals that Justice Health takes steps to inform relevant officers within the Department of Corrective Services of the special diet required for the Respondent, given his condition. There is the possibility that the relevant diet may not be provided consistently to the Respondent, although it ought be expected that the Respondent, together with relevant Justice Health staff and correctional officers, will have an understanding of what is required in this respect. 

164In summary, the evidence before this Court provides a firmer foundation than that before the District Court with respect to the provision of appropriate treatment to the Respondent whilst in custody. I have taken this evidence into account for the purpose of resentencing the Respondent. 

165In my view, having regard to the objective seriousness of the second offence and after taking into account the Respondent's subjective circumstances, a non-parole period of six years ought be imposed for this offence. As the Respondent's medical condition has been taken into account in the determination of sentence, it is not appropriate to double count that factor in his favour by way of a finding of ""special circumstances"" under s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 : R v Way at 201 [185]. Accordingly, for this offence, the appropriate sentence is one of a non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of two years. 

166In my view, the fourth count may be properly characterised as lying in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The Respondent is entitled to have his subjective factors, principally his medical condition, taken into account to mitigate penalty. In my view, a non-parole period of 12 years is appropriate for this offence. Once again, the Respondent is not entitled to have his medical condition double counted in his favour by way of a finding of ""special circumstances"" . For this offence, I would impose a non-parole period of 12 years with a balance of term of four years. 

167I turn to issues of concurrency, accumulation and totality. The principles to be applied are those stated by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47 [27]: 

""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both."" 

168Applying these principles, I am satisfied that accumulation for one year should occur with respect to the sentences imposed on the first and second counts. The fourth count involves separate and very serious criminality with respect to a different prohibited drug and the commission of a substantially more serious offence. In my view, the sentence with respect to the fourth count should involve a further measure of accumulation of one year. 

169Allowing for accumulation, the proposed sentences would see a total effective non-parole period of 14 years with an effective balance of term of four years. The effective non-parole period would represent 78% of the effective full term. 

170I find ""special circumstances"" on the fourth count, arising from the process of accumulation and application of the totality principle: Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [36]. The non-parole period on the fourth count will be a period of 11 years, with a balance of term of five years. 

171Accordingly, the total effective non-parole period will be 13 years, with an effective balance of term of five years. 

172In my view, an effective non-parole period of 13 years represents the minimum period that the Respondent should serve in custody, having regard to all the objective and subjective factors relevant to the determination of sentence for the three offences. 

 
Orders 

173I propose the following orders: 

(a) Crown appeal allowed; 

(b) sentences imposed on the Respondent in the District Court on 6 August 2010 quashed; 

(c) in their place, the Respondent is sentenced as follows: 

(i) on the first count, sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and three months commencing on 16 August 2006 and expiring on 15 November 2008, 

(ii) on the second count, sentenced to a non-parole period of six years commencing on 16 August 2007 and expiring on 15 August 2013 with a balance of term of two years commencing on 16 August 2013 and expiring on 15 August 2015, 

(iii) on the fourth count, sentenced to imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of 11 years commencing on 16 August 2008 and expiring on 15 August 2019, with a balance of term of five years commencing on 16 August 2019 and expiring on 15 August 2024. 

(d) the Respondent will be eligible for release on parole on 16 August 2019. 

174GARLING J : I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J and with his reasons. 

175I desire to add some observations about the fourth count on the indictment, namely, the Respondent was guilty of supplying 2.6 kg of methylamphetamine. The quantity was in excess of the larger commercial quantity. 

176On this count, after a jury finding of guilty, the Respondent was sentenced to a five-year non-parole period with a balance of term of eight years. The first available date for release on parole is 15 August 2012, namely, a little over one year. The total sentence imposed was two years less than the standard non-parole period. 

177The consequence of the sentence proposed by Johnson J, and which I agree is appropriate, is that the Respondent will not be released before 16 August 2019, namely in a little over eight years' time. 

178The offence of which the Respondent was found guilty carried a maximum of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

179The difference in the sentences imposed by the trial judge and that thought appropriate by this Court, focuses attention on the existence of, and role to be played by, standard non-parole periods. 

180A standard non-parole period is to be considered together with the maximum penalty imposed by the legislature for an offence: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 182 [50]. The statutory maximum, here life imprisonment, reflects the seriousness of the offence in the eyes of the public and the policy of the legislature: Way at [53]. 

181The standard non-parole period, here 15 years imprisonment, is the legislature's expression of its intention as to the minimum period of actual imprisonment: Way at [53]. 

182The consequences of the prescription of a standard non-parole period is, or may well be, to change, by increasing, an established sentencing pattern: Way at [54], R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575. 

183Whilst the existence of a standard non-parole period is not again a mandatory sentence, nevertheless where the relevant offence, as was here the case, falls within the mid-range of objective seriousness, and the conviction follows a trial, then proper attention must be paid by a sentencing judge to the legislation, and to the two statutory benchmarks and reference points, namely the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. 

184In this case, insufficient weight was given by the learned sentencing judge to these matters with the result that his sentence was to a significant degree manifestly inadequate. 

185This case serves as a reminder that proper care and attention must be paid by sentencing judges to the relevant maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods fixed by the legislation.

		16 August 2011",2011-08-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757622,R v Niazi [2011] NSWSC 907,"Judgment  1On 17 July 2010 the accused was charged with the murder of his mother, Mrs Gulghutaie Niazi.  She died from multiple stab wounds to her head, neck and chest inflicted by the accused in a frenzied attack against which she had no defence.  2On the morning of 17 July 2010 the deceased left the family home at Regents Park with her daughter at around 7.30am to share the morning meal with her elderly mother at Auburn, as was her custom.  The accused did not accompany his mother and sister that morning.  He arrived at his grandmother's home around 11.30am armed with a knife.  When his mother went outside to speak with him she was fatally attacked.  She was attended by an ambulance at 12.02pm after a call was placed to emergency services by those who witnessed the attack.  She was not able to be revived.  3The accused left the scene immediately thereafter on foot but was arrested by police soon after wearing blood stained clothing.  His description was broadcast over the police radio. He was taken to Auburn police station where he agreed to be interviewed.  He declined the assistance of a support person.  He admitted to killing his mother with murderous intent.  4It is not necessary to extract any part of the extensive questioning by police.  Suffice to note that the accused described a fraught relationship with his mother infused with what I am satisfied was a persistent and delusional belief that she had caused him sexual harm as a child and that she was intent on causing him sexual harm in the future and that he decided to kill her to stop her from harming him.  5The accused denied to police that he was hearing voices or that he acted subject to others directing him to kill his mother.  In effect he claimed a genuine belief that his mother had sexually mistreated him and would continue to do so.  This was later contradicted in the course of clinical conferences with both Dr Nielssen, retained to prepare a psychiatric report on behalf of the accused, and Professor Greenberg who was retained by the Crown.  When confronted by Professor Greenberg about his denial to police that voices were directing him to kill his mother he said he did not tell the police on his arrest, or other health care professionals before the killing, because he did not want to be detained again as a mental patient.  6The questioning by police over some hours was careful and measured in obvious recognition of the fact that the accused was, or was likely to be, mentally ill given the account he gave of the killing and his florid state at the arrest and throughout the interview and therefore in need of urgent medical intervention upon being remanded in custody pending his trial.  7The accused has been treated for schizophrenia with antipsychotic medication as a forensic patient at Long Bay Hospital since his arrest.  8With the consent of the Crown, the trial of the accused was set down without a jury pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  9On his arraignment he pleaded not guilty to the murder of his mother.  Through his counsel he maintained that plea before me on the grounds of mental illness as provided for in s 22 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.  10The sole issue in the trial before me was whether I am satisfied he should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to the provisions of s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act .  11No oral evidence was called in the proceedings by either the Crown or the accused.  By consent, and without objection, their respective cases were the subject of the joint tender of a volume of material comprising recorded interviews with the accused conducted on 17 July 2010, a recorded interview with the accused's older brother conducted on 27 July 2010 and a post mortem report.  Statements from a number of doctors and community heath care workers were also tendered in connection with the accused's previous admission as a scheduled patient to a psychiatric care facility between March and May 2010, together with a review of his conduct whilst subject to a Community Treatment Order upon his release from that facility over successive months leading up to the day of the killing in July 2010.  12Given the nature of the proceedings, the critical documents were the reports of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 9 February 2011 and the report of Professor Greenberg dated 25 March 2011.  These reports reflect a uniformity of opinion that when the accused killed his mother he was suffering from a mental illness - namely acute paranoid schizophrenia - which deprived him of the capacity to consider the moral or legal consequences of his behaviour.  13It would appear that he was first diagnosed with schizophrenia after his admission into a psychiatric facility as an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act 2007 in March 2010 after assaulting his mother and threatening her with a knife.  The accused was detained until his release subject to a Community Treatment Order on 5 May 2010.  This was his second admission to the same facility.  In an earlier admission for two days in February 2010 he was also detained subject to the Mental Health Act .  He was treated on that occasion as a mentally disordered person and provided with intensive psychiatric care as a result of a high risk of aggression and absconding.  Chronic cannabis abuse was identified to be a likely contributor to the accused's mental illness.  There is also a family history of mental illness.  14Until relatively recently the medication prescribed by Justice Health following his remand was consistent with what he was prescribed upon his release from the mental health facility in May 2010, albeit in an elevated dose and administered orally on a daily basis.  While the accused was subject to supervision under a Community Treatment Plan between May and July 2010, a plan which was designed to facilitate his assimilation into the community and his reintegration into family life, the drug was administered in a light dose on a fortnightly basis and by injection.  15I note that in discussing the potential for her son to be released into the community in May 2010 that the accused's mother met with treating doctors within the facility and expressed her desire to have her son returned to the family.  She was optimistic that he had made good progress in the hospital, that he was making plans for future study and that he would maintain drug counseling and adherence to a medication based treatment program.  It would appear that his progress was appropriately monitored by a team of community health workers on a fortnightly basis between May 2010 and July 2010, that he was reviewed at appropriate intervals by his treating doctor and that he was compliant with his treatment regime.  16His last injection prior to the killing was on 14 July 2010.  On that day the accused reported to a health care worker being worried about a forthcoming court appearance and fearful of going into jail.  He was asked whether he was using drugs.  He is reported as walking away, smiling.  17On the same day his mother attended the Community Mental Health Service at Auburn and expressed her concerns about her son's mental state.  She reported that he was angry and agitated and withdrawing from family meals.  The day prior to her death she reported that her son was ""making fun of her"", ""not wanting to help"" and that he was out all hours of the night without telling her of his whereabouts.  She expressed a well-founded fear that his deteriorating or changed mental state might be because he had resumed illicit drug taking.  She was advised to call for assistance in the event that his mental state deteriorated further over the forthcoming weekend.  Tragically, she died at around midday on Saturday 17 July 2010.  The accused's sister told police that having seen the accused arrive at his grandmother's house and being desirous of encouraging him to join with the family for breakfast, her mother went out to greet him.  18On the materials available to me, in particular the considered professional views of both forensic psychiatrists, there is no obvious explanation for the onset of the acute psychotic episode on the morning of 17 July 2010 which, accompanied by the paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations which both experts found active at the time, gives context to the accused killing his mother in such a brutal and frenzied fashion.  19At the time of preparing his report in February 2011 it was Dr Nielssen's view that the accused's condition was chronic and partly treatment resistant.  He noted however that the accused had recently commenced treatment with a new antipsychotic medication that was likely to result in a reduction in the severity of his symptoms and an improvement in his intellectual functioning over time.  At the time of the consultation with Professor Greenberg some weeks later, the accused reported compliance with the new pharmacological regime and gave an account of his then current mood and insight into the circumstances surrounding the killing of his mother that would suggest that the new treatment might be effective in the way that Dr Nielssen predicted.  I note, however, that while he reported to Professor Greenberg that he now appreciates that the voices that had directed him to kill his mother were ""just in his head"" he went on to report that ""the voices were now telling him that he is going to die"".  In the course of the proceedings before me his counsel informed me that his client was unable to meaningfully participate in the proceedings because of ""hearing voices"".  The accused also persisted in recounting to Professor Greenberg the delusional belief that he was a victim of child sexual abuse by female family members with the connivance or agreement of his mother.  20At the time of her death the deceased was aged 54.  The accused was aged 24.  The accused's parents migrated to Australia from Afghanistan in 1985.  He was born in Australia the following year.  His parents divorced in 1997. The accused was educated in a State primary school and then a State high school after which he obtained work repairing chainsaws for a short time before he was terminated for a lack of diligence.  He did not adapt well to a working life.  He was unemployed for lengthy periods.  21There is an added dimension to the tragedy that has befallen the Niazi family by the death of Mrs Niazi in the circumstances that I have outlined.  It would appear from the detailed information the accused's brother gave to police, that after the accused was released from the mental health facility in May 2010 the violent and threatening displays of aggression directed at his mother, the very conduct that had precipitated his admission, was replaced by a loving dependence upon her and heartfelt expressions of deep regret at having hurt her.  It would also appear that he was reunited with his grandmother, who regarded the accused as her favourite grandson.  It was of course outside his grandmother's home that he killed his mother exposing his grandmother and his sister not only to the shock of her death but the horrifying manner in which she died.  I am informed by counsel that his family have abandoned him and he has no retained friendships from his youth.  That is an added tragedy.  22In accordance with established principle and as expressly provided for in s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act , I find the accused not guilty of murder by reason of mental illness.  23I make the following orders by consent:  1.  I order that the accused be detained at the Long Bay Prison Hospital in accordance with s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act , or such other place as may be determined appropriate by the Mental Health Review Tribunal in accordance with Part 5 Division 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act until released by due process of law.  2.

2757629,R v Peter Francis STATHAM [2011] NSWDC 128,"SENTENCE 

1On 29 October 2008, the Australian Federal Police received information linking Peter Francis Statham with the use of child pornography. A search warrant was issued and executed at his house at North Manly. Computers were confiscated and information was received about images depicting child pornography. 
2Mr Statham was charged with three offences: two of them were Commonwealth offences and one a State offence. The two Commonwealth offences were using a carriage service, namely the internet, to access child pornography. That is a crime against s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 of the Commonwealth. The other Commonwealth offence was using a carriage service to make child pornography material available. That is an offence against the same provision, but subclause (iv). The State offence was possession of child pornography, which is a crime against s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for each of the offences is ten years imprisonment. 
3Mr Statham was arrested on 7 October 2009 and has not spent any time in custody. 
4It is important for a judge to make some reference to the material involved in a case. It disclosed that Mr Statham had forwarded via his email images of child pornography and had images of child pornography on his computer which he accessed. The computers were analysed and there were a total number of almost 2,600 images and video files which could be classified as child pornography material. They depicted children aged between six months and fifteen years. 
5There is a scale called the Oliver Scale, by reference to which child pornography can be classified. Most of the material comprised images in the lowest category, which involved erotic posing; there were some 1,500 of those images. Over 600 of the images were in the second lowest category and involved solo masturbation or sexual activity between children. Just over 120 of the images were in the middle category and involved nonpenetrative sexual activity between children and adults. Three hundred of the images were in the second highest category, involving penetrative sexual activity between children and adults. Nearly twenty of the images were in the worst category, depicting sadism and bestiality. Examples of the images were described in the facts which were part of exhibit A. It is not necessary to cite those examples. 
6Mr Statham was interviewed by the police and then charged with the offences which I have referred to. There was a presentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Office about Mr Statham. Mr Statham is now fiftyfive and lives in a steady relationship in a suburb of Sydney. He presented as cooperative to the Service, and had a stable background and a very stable employment history, including twentyone years working in a responsible position for a major airline. Those contacted, according to the Probation and Parole officer, "" expressed their shock and disbelief when Mr Statham informed them of the reason for his arrest, as in their presence he has never exhibited any signs of aberrant behaviour."" 
7His partner continues to offer him emotional support. The report noted that after his arrest he sought counselling to address his offending behaviour. The author of the report was unable to gain a clear understanding of his motivation for the offending. She thought that Mr Statham would be suitable for a high to medium level of intervention by the Service. He was assessed as suitable for a community service order. 
8Mr P J Gow of counsel, who appeared for Mr Statham, made available as exhibit 1 a number of character references. The referees all knew Mr Statham well and knew about the offences. Mr Statham is highly regarded as a person, as an employee and as a mentor. He has evidently acted out of character so far as these offences are concerned. 
9Mr Statham has himself written a letter to the presiding judge who would sentence him, indicating his deep remorse and the impact which his access and use of child pornography must have had on the children who were depicted. 
10Mr Gow called his client to give evidence when he first appeared before me on 14 July 2007. He was an impressive witness. He is currently employed as a duty manager at a hotel, and has been seeing his GP, Dr Reid, and a psychologist, Dr Seidler. He commenced a sex offenders program in January this year and, at the date that he gave evidence, had completed some twentythree of the sessions and was continuing to engage in that course. He said that he had a much better understanding of the destructive nature of child pornography and how his own behaviour had contributed to the market for child pornography. He was keen to address his behaviour and found that the course he was undertaking enabled him to honestly confront why he was engaged in that sort of behaviour. He said that he would never engage in such behaviour again. 
11There are reports from Dr Seidler and Dr Reid. Dr Reid indicates that Mr Statham has a number of health issues, including things such as hypertension and diabetes. Dr Seidler has provided a series of very helpful reports which have monitored Mr Statham's progress in the sex offender program which he is engaged in. In her report of 11 July 2010, Dr Seidler confirmed "" Mr Statham's positive engagement and participation in treatmen t"". She said that he is "" a positive group member, who is well engaged and demonstrates a high motivation for change. He is supportive and challenging of other group members appropriately, and impresses as highly committed to the treatment process and other group members ."" He was at that date about halfway through the treatment and she thought that he "" will require a further nine months or so to complete the program requirements "". She confirmed that he is "" a committed, motivated, insightful and participatory group member, who appears to have gained considerably from treatment "". In one of her first reports she had expressed a view that it would be "" likely that Mr Statham would be quite vulnerable in gaol, in addition to which, this would necessarily expose him to the highly antisocial environment of gaol, whereby he would probably also be forced to associate with more deviant and paedophilic offenders "". He has various certificates from his employment which demonstrate his qualifications and value as an employee. He cooperated with the police so far as their enquiries were concerned. 
12On 14 July 2007, I referred Mr Statham for an assessment for his suitability for an Intensive Correction Order. The assessment was returned, marked exhibit C, and indicated that he was suitable in all categories except a category described as the availability of suitable work and programs. Mr Gow made further enquiries about the negative result from that, and it seems that there was some innocent failure to consider the availability of some form of work. A fresh report was issued which indicated that suitable work and programs were available for Mr Statham. The problem seems to have been where that might have been available. It noted that "" to his credit, Mr Statham continues to participate in therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing his offending behaviour "". It indicated that the Probation and Parole Service "" holds little concern regarding the offender's ability to successfully complete an Intensive Correction Order "". He was assessed as suitable, and a factor which would be targeted was his inappropriate use of carriage services. 
13I have been assisted by both Mr Gow and Ms M Grimes - who appeared for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and also on behalf of the New South Wales Director - in their written and oral submissions. Ms Grimes made her position clear, that the only appropriate penalty in this case would be a term of full-time imprisonment. She referred to the nature of the images which were involved and the number and highlighted that the offending included the transmission of images to other people. She pointed out that hundreds of different children were probably the subject of abuse so far as the images which Mr Statham had access to. 
14Mr Gow pointed out that the images in the higher category were fewer in number and the majority of the images were in the lowest category; indeed, almost ninety per cent appeared in categories 1 to 3. He argued that his client had taken steps to rehabilitate himself beyond those which the Court usually sees and his client had taken the initiative to undertake that program himself. (The later assessment report which was favourable became exhibit D in the proceedings.) 
15Ms Grimes also emphasised the significance of general deterrence and the importance of members of the community who would be thinking of engaging in child pornography offences to know that they are at risk of going to gaol full time. The offending behaviour is obviously becoming more prevalent, with more people having access to online services. She reminded me of the age range, which commenced as low as six months for some of the children involved. She conceded that he would be entitled to some discount for his plea of guilty, but that the case against him was a strong one. She correctly reminded me that I had to reach the view that, having considered all other available sentences, no other sentence than imprisonment would be appropriate and she submitted that I could reach that conclusion. She helpfully provided a document, which became MFI 1, which indicated the range of sentences which have been imposed in cases such as this. 
16The parties also provided me with statistics from the Judicial Commission regarding these kinds of offences. 
17I would regard an appropriate sentence, initially, as two and a half years imprisonment, but I propose to discount that to two years imprisonment, given that Mr Statham has pleaded guilty. Mr Gow submits that I should direct that that prison sentence be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order in accordance with s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Ms Grimes resists that, pointing out that the only appropriate sentence is one of full-time imprisonment. 
18I have determined that the sentence is appropriate for Mr Statham to serve it by way of Intensive Correction Order. My reasons for that are fourfold. 
19The first is that it appears from the statistics that not all offenders convicted of these sorts of offences serve fulltime prison sentences; just under fifty per cent are penalised in ways that do not involve fulltime sentences. 
20The second reason is that I accept Mr Gow's submission that his client has taken steps towards his rehabilitation beyond that which a Court usually sees. In particular I am impressed by Dr Seidler's reports in this regard. Mr Statham was arrested in October 2009 and commenced his rehabilitation course in January 2011. It is a substantial course. I accept Mr Gow's submission that in this case it would not be in the public interest to interfere with that rehabilitation program. 
21The third reason is that I am impressed by Mr Statham's genuine remorse and his insight and the steps he has taken to deal with what was obviously a personal problem producing serious criminal behaviour. When he gave evidence before me in July he had completed, as I said, some twentythree sessions. I was impressed by him as a witness and by his letter to the Court. 
22Finally, I have regard to Dr Seidler's opinion about the impact which prison may have on Mr Statham. I think this is a case, exceptionally so, where a fulltime prison sentence is not warranted at this stage, but the sentence can be performed by an Intensive Correction Order. I say "" at this stage "" in case, of course, there is any breach of the Intensive Correction Order. I propose to impose sentences of two years to be served by Intensive Correction Order. HIS HONOUR: Mr Gow and Ms Guillen, that's the result. I have to sentence him for each of the three offences, is that right? 
GUILLEN: Yes, your Honour. 
GOW: Yes, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: I don't have the Criminal Code in front of me, Ms Guillen. Do I just impose sentences of two years in respect of each of the Commonwealth offences and then direct that they be served by Intensive Correction Order? 
GUILLEN: Yes, your Honour. 
HIS HONOUR: Mr Statham, if you would stand up. 

23In respect of each of the three offences you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for two years in respect of each of the three crimes. Under s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I make an Intensive Correction Order, directing that the sentences be served by way of intensive correction in the community. 
HIS HONOUR: Have a seat, Mr Statham. Now I have to look at Part 5. 
24Under section 71(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , the date of commencement of the sentence will be next Friday, 26 August 2011. Under regulation 175(b) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008, Mr Statham is to report to Corrective Services on 26 August 2011 or such later date as may be advised by the Commissioner, to such local office or other location as may be advised by the Commissioner for Corrective Services. 
HIS HONOUR: Do I have to set an end date? GUILLEN: Yes, your Honour, you do. HIS HONOUR: I don't think I specify-- GUILLEN: No, you haven't as yet. HIS HONOUR: And I don't think I do GUILLEN: I think, your Honour, for Commonwealth offences you do need to specify the expiry date. 
25The sentence starts on 26 August 2011 and expires on 25 August 2013. 
HIS HONOUR: Now I have to go through regulation 175. What I'm going to do is explain the sentence to your client, Mr Gow, as I'm obliged to, which involves me going through regulation 175. Whilst I'm doing that I'll just ask you and Ms Guillen to look up what are the consequences of failure to comply - because I'll need to explain that to your client. Stand up, Mr Statham. 
26The Intensive Correction Order which I have imposed has a lot of conditions. You have got to be of good behaviour, you have got to stay out of trouble and not be convicted of anything, so no drink driving or things like that. You have got to report next Friday or, if the Commissioner for Corrective Services gives you a later date, then that date you report at whatever office he directs you to. You have got to live only at premises approved by a supervisor. Hopefully that will be your home, but it has got to be approved by the supervisor. 
27There will be a condition which prohibits you from leaving or remaining outside New South Wales without the Commissioner's permission. There is a condition which prohibits you from leaving or remaining out of Australia without the permission of the Parole Authority; you cannot leave Australia without the Parole Authority's permission. There is a condition which requires you to receive visits by your supervisor at your home at any time, for any purpose connected with the administration of the order. So I assume what they can do in a case like yours is turn up and check that the computer has not got any child pornography images. In a drug case they would check and do urinalysis and things like that, but yours is different. 
28 A condition requires you to authorise your medical practitioner, therapist or counsellor to provide the supervisor information about you that is relevant to the administration of the order. So if they want a report from Dr Seidler you authorise her to give it, as you have done already. A condition requires you to submit to searches of places or things under your control, as directed by your supervisor. So they are able to check your computer, for example. A condition prohibits you using prohibited drugs, obtaining drugs or using them or abusing them; that goes without saying. A condition requires you to submit to breath testing, urinalysis, other medically approved procedures. That would seem to be unlikely, but in your case, a condition prohibits you from possessing or having in your control any firearm or other offensive weapon. A condition requires you to such surveillance or monitoring, including electronic surveillance or monitoring, as a supervisor may direct, and complying with your supervisor's instructions in relation to operating the system. A condition prohibits you tampering with, damaging or disabling any surveillance or monitoring equipment. A condition requires you to comply with any direction given by a supervisor that requires you to remain in specified place during particular hours or which otherwise restrict your movements. So it may be that they say, look, there is a curfew overnight, you cannot go out, or you can go to work on that particular day, but no other days. They will work that out with you. A condition requires you to undertake a minimum of thirty-two hours of community service work a month as directed. You know about that and that has been sorted out, you are doing it on a Thursday. A condition requires you to engage in activities to address the factors associated with your offending as identified in your assessment report or that become apparent during the term or as directed by your supervisor when you are doing your course. A condition requires you to comply with all reasonable directions of the supervisor. So the supervisor's in charge of you. 
29Now, the idea is you have got a two-year gaol term. You must not forget that. You have got a two-year gaol term. You are serving it by way of Intensive Correction Order, so that means you are monitored closely and your freedom is significantly restricted. You may have to stay at home, just be able to go to work, either your paid employment or your voluntary work, which they will direct you about, but that is the idea. Your freedom has to be significantly restricted over the next two years, that is the punishment. The alternative is it is severely restricted by you being in Long Bay or Lithgow or somewhere like that, so it has got to be a punishment; that is why it is called an Intensive Correction Order. But the idea at the same time is that your offending behaviour is addressed, as you have already started to do yourself, to your credit. 
HIS HONOUR: Now, I'll just ask Mr Gow and Ms Guillen, what's the consequence of him breaching the orders? 
GUILLEN: Your Honour, I've got a copy of the Sentencing Bench Book and it states that in breaches of ICO dealt with by the Commissioner of Corrective Service and the Parole Authority pursuant to sections 88 to 91 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. 
HIS HONOUR: What paragraph are you looking at? 
GUILLEN: 3.670(?) and that the courts do not deal with the breaches, and then I can hand up this document that tells you what those breaches would be. 
HIS HONOUR: 3.670? 
GUILLEN: Yes, that's correct. 
HIS HONOUR: All right. 
30Now, Mr Statham, in the unlikely event that you breach what is called an ICO, Intensive Corrections Order, the breach is dealt with not by me, by the Court, but by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, or the Parole Authority. If you breached it, the Commissioner of Corrective Services could just warn you. It could more stringently apply the conditions. It could decide to refer a serious breach to the Parole Authority and that body, the Parole Authority, could give you seven days home detention, or revoke the order. The consequence of the revocation would be that you would have to serve the sentence full time in gaol. 
HIS HONOUR: I think that covers it, Ms Guillen and Mr Gow. GOW: Yes, your Honour. GUILLEN: Yes, your Honour. HIS HONOUR: I don't think there are any other orders I need to make, or explanations I need to give to Mr Statham. 
GOW: Just a couple of matters. I think it's implicit in your Honour's remarks that the sentences for the three offences will be concurrent. 
HIS HONOUR: Correct, yes. 
31The sentences are concurrent, yes. 
GOW: Yes, thank you, your Honour. I think my client will have to perhaps visit the Registry at the Downing Centre after. 
HIS HONOUR: Yes, you both will because there's no facility up here, and, as happened with one of the previous cases, you'll be given custody of the order which I'm about to sign, and the file, which has to go with you back to the Downing Centre where you present it to the Registry, which can then have whatever steps are taken in the Registry. 
GOW: Yes, I'll certainly do that, your Honour. The other matter is my friend has got a consent order to hand up to your Honour. 
GUILLEN: It's in relation to the forfeiture of the computers, your Honour. 
GOW: That's consented to, your Honour. 

32By consent I make the orders and the notations referred to in the short minutes of orders signed and sealed, and dated by me today. 
HIS HONOUR: Thanks for your assistance, Mr Gow; and if you'd convey my thanks to Ms Grimes as well please, Ms Guillen. Good luck, Mr Statham.

		13 April 2012",2011-08-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757632,AA v Magistrate Mulroney [2011] NSWSC 953,"Judgment


	
	This matter comes before me by way of a summons seeking relief in respect of a decision in the Children's Court that cross-examination of a witness, W1, would not be directed pursuant to s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The summons seeks relief in an inappropriate form but it is clear enough that the case made by the plaintiff is that the learned Magistrate took into account an irrelevant matter that significantly affected his Honour's decision and erred in law by disregarding a relevant matter. Since the question in issue is, although important, a simple one, in order to save costs and inconvenience, I have not required amendment of the summons and I understand that counsel on behalf of the defendant does not object to my dealing with the matter by way of determining whether there is an error of law, leaving any question of relief to follow that determination.
	
	
	The plaintiff is one of a number of young persons before the Children's Court at Parramatta charged with murder. Those committal proceedings are part heard. Counsel for three of the young persons, of whom two are plaintiffs before me, sought a direction under s 91 to have W1 called for cross-examination. The Crown case is that W1 was an eyewitness to very significant events surrounding the killing of the victim. Other co-offenders have also been charged and were committed for trial by the Local Court being adults.
	
	
	It was conceded by the Crown in the proceedings in the Local Court that it was appropriate that a direction be made under s 91 in respect of W1 and, indeed, he was cross-examined. However, in the Children's Court, it was submitted, in brief, that the interests of justice did not require W1 to be called again. Tendered before the Magistrate were the statements of the witnesses, which is conventional of course, together with the evidence of W1 in the Local Court (by agreement), but only in this latter respect for the purposes of determining the s 91 application. The tender of that material was by agreement.
	
	
	The solicitor for the third plaintiff, Mr Voros, who is the subject of another summons (as it happens not before me), was principally responsible for making submissions on the point to the learned Magistrate. Mr Corr of counsel for the plaintiffs before me contented himself, quite reasonably, with adopting Mr Voros' submissions. Mr Voros submitted firstly that it was unfair for the Crown, having agreed in the Local Court to a s 91 direction, to adopt a different approach in the Children's Court. He also submitted that there were significant matters not covered by cross-examination in that court.
	
	
	It was also contended that the jurisdiction of the Children's Court as to whether to commit the plaintiffs or not was entirely independent of and separate to any decision that had been made in the Local Court. At all events, the demeanor of the witness when answering questions might be a matter which could have relevance to the decision to commit and the plaintiffs should be given the same opportunity to rely on this factor as the defendants in the Local Court..
	
	
	The learned Magistrate considered the question whether the interests of justice required W1 to be called for cross-examination and, with the assistance of counsel's submissions on the point, identified the particular areas in respect of which it was argued were not adequately covered by the cross-examination in the Local Court. His Honour concluded that none of those matters warranted the calling of W1, observing that many of them were already the subject of, at least, information available to the plaintiffs for the purposes of conducting any trial that might ensue.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate's approach to the question demonstrates to my mind no error of law. His Honour was invited to consider what had occurred in the Local Court and that was plainly material to the enquiry as to whether there were substantial reasons for requiring W1 to be called again in the interests of justice. In brief, his Honour approached the issue by asking whether it was likely that the plaintiffs would be significantly better off in terms of their understanding of the case or answering the prosecution case were a s 91 direction made.
	
	
	Mr Corr for the plaintiff adds an additional consideration and that is the appearance of injustice. He points out that the other adult co-offenders had the advantage of cross-examining W1 and the ability therefore to put to the Local Court submissions as to the impact that that evidence might have had on whether they should be committed for trial. The plaintiffs were denied that advantage. As I understand Mr Corr, he concedes that if the plaintiffs had been charged alone, and there had been no parallel proceedings against other co-offenders, this argument could not be made since no comparison of the way in which the two groups were treated would arise.
	
	
	To my mind the different procedural courses taken in the Local Court, on the one hand and in the Children's Court on the other, do not give rise to any apprehension of unequal treatment or other injustice. I point out that this particular argument was not made, at least in terms, to the learned Children's Court Magistrate and, not surprisingly, his Honour did not think it necessary to deal with it. There was no application made on behalf of the plaintiffs to tender the evidence of W1 in the substantive proceedings, a course to which the prosecution could not reasonably have objected.
	
	
	The question to my mind is whether any substantive injustice was done to the plaintiffs by the decision of the learned Children's Court Magistrate by way of making any significant error of law. In my view, the learned Magistrate did not err in his approach to the question whether a s 91 direction should be given in respect of W1.
	
	
	It is unnecessary therefore to consider the question of any potential relief. Accordingly, the summons must be dismissed. I make no order as to costs.

		14 November 2016",2011-08-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757635,R v Binh Trong NGUYEN [2011] NSWDC 120,"SeNTENCE 

1. I am sentencing Binh Trong Nguyen for importing heroin into Australia. He has been charged with the crime called importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin. That is a crime against s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code of the Commonwealth . It carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. 

2. Mr Nguyen pleaded guilty to the crime when he was charged and he pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. 

3. It is important for a judge to set out briefly what happened to cause a person to be charged with a crime that they are being sentenced for. In this case Mr Nguyen arrived at Sydney Airport on 25 September 2010. He was interviewed by Customs who obviously suspected he was concealing drugs. He was sent to St George Hospital where a CT scan showed that he was concealing some objects in his rectum or lower bowel. He passed these objects later in the day. There was a large cylinder shaped pellet and two smaller ones. The pellets contained heroin. The heroin weighed just under ninety grams and had a purity of just over sixty-six grams and a street value of between $66,000-$77,000. 

4. Mr Nguyen was interviewed by the Federal Police and admitted making arrangements to contact the suppliers of the heroin in Vietnam. He was a heroin addict and agreed to traffic the largest of the pellets so that the two smaller pellets would be for his own use. He also acknowledged that he had a debt of some $5000. 

5. Mr Nguyen already had a criminal record in New South Wales. It included driving offences, but more importantly crimes of possessing and supplying prohibited drugs. He was given a gaol sentence for supplying a prohibited drug. It was a suspended sentence but he breached the bond and went to gaol. He also had a conviction for malicious wounding. 

6. There is a pre-sentence report about Mr Nguyen prepared by the Probation and Parole Service. He was born in Vietnam and raised by his mother because his father died in the war over there in the 1970s. He came to Australia in 1993 and has been a citizen since 1997. His wife and three-year-old child live in Vietnam. He has had limited education and has been using the time in custody to attend educational courses. But his English is limited. He has been a heroin addict for many years. Sometimes he has stopped but he has started again. He has never done a formal course to help with this but he has been off drugs whilst he has been in custody. 

7. There is a report from a psychologist, Mr Anthony Diment, which was tendered by Mr S Siva of counsel who appeared for Mr Nguyen. The report concludes that he appears to have a major depression and post traumatic stress disorder from his background of an escape to Thailand as a refugee on a boat when many of the people on the boat died. 

8. His long term outcome depends upon his treatment and management of his depression and post traumatic stress disorder. He told the psychologist he regretted his involvement in the importation of drugs. He acknowledged in his interview, I should have said, that he was aware that he was trafficking in heroin. 

9. Mr Siva pointed to his client's personal background which he said I could accept. He pointed to his client's cooperation in being interviewed and to material contained at tab 8 in exhibit A. His client has hepatitis C because of his drug use. He argued that his client was no more than a courier. He argued that his client should receive a discount for his plea of guilty and for the other material which I have referred to. He argued that his client was at a crossroads at this stage of his life and that his ability to participate in courses was limited because of his English. 

10. Ms H Armstrong who appeared for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions argued that Mr Nguyen obviously knew how much heroin he was importing because it was internally concealed. I accept that argument. She questioned the reliance I could place on the personal background because it was not verified by any sworn evidence in Court. In that regard I accept Mr Siva's argument that they are matters which are known to the Court. 

11. I take into account, as Ms Armstrong has argued, that his mental condition has been diagnosed following one relatively recent consultation and I would not regard there being much benefit in treating Mr Nguyen as a person with a mental disability. 

12. It is clear from the statistics published by the Judicial Commission that full-time gaol is the only sentence which can be imposed. I have been assisted by Ms Armstrong providing some examples of sentences imposed in New South Wales for these kinds of cases. 

13. It seems to me that an appropriate sentence would be eight years gaol but Mr Nguyen has pleaded guilty and I take into account the other material. The assessment regarding the other material is limited. I regard an overall discount for those two matters as twenty-five per cent as appropriate. 

14. I regard his role in importing drugs into Australia as significant. He is not being sentenced as a principal in a large drug importing syndicate but, as Ms Armstrong pointed out, his role was obviously an important one in bringing the drugs into Australia. 

15. He does not get the benefit of having no criminal convictions and I take into account the need for him to be stopped from dealing with prohibited drugs, either by supplying or importing them. 

16. I regard an appropriate sentence after the discount as being six years imprisonment. Having regard to the authorities that Ms Armstrong has referred me to in exhibit A I think an appropriate non-parole period is four years imprisonment. 

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Hazelton I just need your assistance here. The sentence is going to be six years with a minimum of four years. I just don't have the Commonwealth legislation in front of me. I Ms Armstrong, let me address this, so it's more than three years so I fix a non-parole period or make a recognisance release order. Do you want to be heard on which option I will ask both of you? 

HAZELTON: As stated in the submissions your Honour we consider a non-parole period is appropriate. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay a non-parole period, Mr Siva do you have anything to say on that? 

SIVA: No your Honour. 


17. The sentence will be six years with a non-parole period of four years. The sentence will commence when Mr Nguyen was arrested on 25 September 2010. So the sentence of six years will commence on 25 September 2010 and expire on 24 September 2016. The non-parole period of four years will commence on 25 September 2010 and expire on 24 September 2014. 

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Hazelton, Mr Siva I will explain that to Mr Nguyen in a moment, although it is fairly straightforward. Are there any other orders I need to make apart from imposing that sentence? Am I right in thinking that his release depends upon the Parole Authority for Commonwealth matters, the State Parole Authority or not? 

SIVA: I think so your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Are there any other orders that I need to make? 

HAZELTON: No your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Siva? 

SIVA: Just in relation to tab 8 if that could be placed in a sealed envelope. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes. 

18. I remove from exhibit A the document behind tab 8 including the tab bar. It is to be placed in a sealed envelope which I will endorse "" Binh Trong Nguyen "" and I am putting not to be opened except by order of a judge of the District Court of New South Wales or a judge of a higher jurisdiction and that will go on the Court file. 

19. Mr Nguyen you have a six year gaol term. It started when you were arrested on 25 September 2010. It will expire on 24 September 2016. There is a non-parole period - for which you must stay in gaol - of four years. That also commenced on 25 September 2010 and that will expire on 24 September 2014 and you will then be considered whether or not you will be eligible for parole. 
20. I formally officially convict Mr Nguyen of the crime.

		06 September 2011",2011-08-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757636,R v MAZZITELLI [2011] NSWDC 129,"Judgment 
HER HONOUR: 

1The offender is before me for sentence following his pleas of guilty on 7 April 2011 to a number of different charges. He was charged with 12 armed robbery charges and one charge of escape from lawful prison custody. Ultimately he was committed for sentence on four of those aggravated armed robbery charges, each of which has two additional offences of either armed robbery or similar charges on Form 1 documents to be taken into account. He was also at the same time committed for sentence on the escape charge. 

2He pleaded guilty early in the Local Court and is subject to the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act . Both because of that, and the general utilitarian value that arises from early pleas, he is entitled to a discount of 25% from what would otherwise be the appropriate sentences. 

3He is to be sentenced for the following offences: 

4The first is Sequence 2, the offence of escaping from lawful prison custody on the 23rd of April 2010 when he was a sentenced prisoner and inmate at Long Bay Correctional Centre. That is an offence contrary to S310B of the Crimes Act and as such carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The sentence for this offence is also subject to the provisions of S57 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . 

5The relevant facts for this offence are that as at the 23rd of April 2010 the offender was serving a 3 year non-parole period with an overall sentence of 5 years for an offence of robbery in company. That sentence commenced on the 13th of March 2009. He was at that stage being held as a minimum security prisoner and was doing work within the larger Long Bay Prison complex. He was with three other prisoners who were being supervised by officers. At about noon the officers left for a lunch break leaving the offender and the other prisoners in the workshop. The prisoner took the opportunity to climb over the two perimeter wire fences to escape. The first of these was topped with razor wire. 

6Near the workshop as he was on en route to escape he saw a rubbish skip which had a discarded mattress in it. He used that to throw over the razor wire to reduce the chance of being cut. He then scaled over the outside wire fence, which was topped with barbed wire. He jumped to the ground and stole the car parked outside which he hot wired and drove away. 

7The facts, apart from those which I have recited, are relatively scant and have been expanded by the prisoner in his oral evidence. I accept that on this day he had not made any real plans to escape. Not long beforehand, during some routine medical examinations, doctors in the prison had found a lump on his chest under his ribs which he was told ought to be tested to determine whether or not it was cancerous. That made him scared, I accept, because his grandfather had died of cancer when the offender was about 15 and his mother was at the time of his escape undergoing chemotherapy for cancer herself. He was frightened that he was going to die in prison, so he took the chance of what would appear to be relatively light security to escape. 

8I accept that the fact that there was a mattress available to assist in his escape was not known to him in advance, and not planned. 

9All escapes from prison custody are serious offences, particularly in relation to minimum security prisoners who thereby exploit the special trust placed in them. The prisoner and the community generally benefit from the system of incarceration that allows for a proper classification of prisoners so that those who can be trusted are allowed a more relaxed level of supervision, which is both cost effective to the community and of ultimate benefit to the prisoners and the community therefore indirectly. As a result, general deterrence is a significant consideration in sentencing for these offences. 

10That having been said, it seems to me that this escape offence is not a serious example of offences which can be charged under this section. There was no planning. It was not a sophisticated method that was used. There were no threats made to prison officers, and on the evidence before me nothing that put the rest of the prison population in any danger or at any risk. 

11The remaining four substantive charges for which I must sentence the offender are all them offences of aggravated armed robbery contrary to 97(2) of the Crimes Act, which therefore carry maximum penalties of 25 years imprisonment. 

12The first in time is Sequence 14 and it is a charge that on the 27th of June 2010 at a Kensington the offender robbed the named victim of property, being money in the sum of $500 and personal items, whilst armed with a firearm. He asks that when sentencing him for that offence I take into account two further offences which are Sequences 6 and 13. 

13Sequence 6 is also a charge of aggravated armed robbery on the same day and place and involves his robbing the Kensington Pharmacy of an unknown quantity of money whilst being armed with a firearm. The remaining Form 1 offence relevant for Sequence 14 is Sequence 13 and is an offence of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) that on the same date, 27th of June he robbed Alexandra Martine of a sum of money and personal items whiles armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife. 

14The relevant facts are that that just after 6pm on Sunday the27th of June 2010 the offender and two males co-offenders went into the Kensington News Agency and Pharmacy. The offender was wearing ordinary clothes including a hooded jacket. He was not disguised. All offenders went into the shop, walked to the rear where the on-duty pharmacist, a 29 year old man, was working. The offender approached him, told him to open the safe and told him he had a knife and a gun and demanded the money. He was carrying a bag at the time and as he made the demand he lifted up some items in the bag and showed the pharmacist the brown wooden handle of the knife and the black gun handle or grip. The pharmacist initially asked whether it was a joke. The offender may it clear it was serious and told him to open the till unless he wanted to be stabbed or shot. 

15Not surprisingly the pharmacist feared for his life and was frightened. He took the offender to the front counter area, opened the till tray and told him to take the money. The other offenders were telling him to take out the cash tray and open the safe. The pharmacist went to the second register and opened it. The offenders took the money from the register and one of them continued to demand that the safe be opened. The victim told them that the safe was locked on a time delay. The offenders took coins from the register. Then the second offender took the wallets from the pharmacist and the young 18 year old female shop assistant who also worked there. All three left the store. All of this was captured on closed circuit television and clearly depicts the offender as one of those involved. 

16The pharmacist had $500 in his wallet, which is the subject matter of that offence, being the substantive offence, Sequence 14. The young shop assistant only had twenty cents in her wallet, but I accept was no doubt very frightened at being involved in this offence. Each of these victims was put in fear. The young shop assistant had been crouching down when the demand was made of her and she heard one of the offenders threaten that they would be stabbed, she thought that they were armed with a knife. That would appear to be the reason behind the charge involving her being an offence under S97(1). That is the second additional offence taken into account. 

17There is no evidence that any of the property that was stolen from either of these two people or money taken from the shop was returned. There is no evidence about how much in fact was stolen from the cash register. That is the first of the additional offences, but as I have said, there was $500 in the pharmacist's wallet. The amount of property stolen is not particularly large in those circumstances. 

18The offence is aggravated in addition to the statutory circumstance of aggravation, that is, being armed with a firearm, by the fact that the offender was in company with two others and also because he was armed, not just with the firearm, but with an offensive weapon, namely a knife. There is no evidence in relation to the firearm as to whether or not it was a genuine firearm capable of being used to fire a bullet. It has never been recovered. But in some of the other offences there is an indication from one victim that he thought this particular firearm looked like it was a either toy or a replica. 

19The offender himself has given evidence under oath that in fact it was not a genuine firearm but in fact a toy belonging to a friend's brother. In the circumstances I accept his evidence. No doubt this would have been of small comfort to any of the victims who it seems to me in all cases thought that the firearm was real and that there was a real risk that they might be shot if they did not comply with the directions. But in terms of assessing the objective criminality as a matter of fact I accept that the offender was using a replica or toy firearm and that in fact it was not capable of any serious harm to the victims, except as a result of their being frightened. 

20The second substantive offence in time occurred on the 4th of July 2010 and it is a charge, namely, Sequence 7, that on the 4th of July 2010 at Matraville the offender robbed the named victim of the sum of $350 whilst armed with a firearm. When sentencing for this matter the offender asks me to take into account two additional offences, being Sequences 3 and 5. 

21Sequence 3 is also an aggravated armed robbery offence, which occurred on the 6th of June 2010 in which the offender robbed the named victim of the sum of $700 whilst armed with a firearm. The second Form 1 offence relevant for this matter is Sequence 5 and is contrary to S97(1), that on the 27th of June at Balmain he robbed the named victim of $300 whilst armed an offensive weapon, namely a knife. 

22The relevant facts for the substantive offence are that about 5.45 on Sunday the 4th of July the offender and another male went into a pharmacy in the Bunnerong Road at Matraville. The offender was wearing ordinary clothes and sunglasses. He was carrying a black firearm in his right jacket pocket. He approached the 47 year old female pharmacy manager at the front counter and turned his body so she could see the handle of the gun sticking out of his right pocket. He told her that he wasn't going to hurt her but he just wanted the money. She handed over a bag of money that was in her hand which totalled about $350. The co-offender at the same time went to the other female employee working in the store and she saw the knife protruding from the sleeve of his jacket. She screamed, but the offender then shouted, ""Don't hurt her. I've got the money."" They both ran from the store. All of this is captured on closed circuit television, as were all of these offences, and in all cases this depicted the offender as being involved. 

23The facts for the first Form 1 offence, that is, Sequence 3 are that about 1pm on Sunday the 6th of June the offender went into a convenience store in Military Road Neutral Bay. He approached the victim, the owner of the store, a 35 year old woman who was working there alone behind the counter. He told her that he had a gun and the victim saw that he was holding on to the handle of the gun tucked inside the top of his pants. He demanded money from her. She opened the cash register and took out all of the notes in the till, namely $700 and threw it at him. He picked it up after she did so and then he left. The victim was understandably very frightened and crying. 

24The facts for the other Form 1 offence, Sequence 5, are that at about 2.25pm on Sunday the 27th of June the offender and a co-offender went into a news agency in Balmain. The 46 year old owner was working behind the counter at the time. The second offender walked around behind the counter and stood near the victim while the offender stood in front of the counter opposite her. The offend produced a knife that appeared to have a silver blade and showed it to the victim by keeping it near the right side of his body, hidden, but so she could see it. He told her that he wouldn't hurt her and that he just wanted the money and to open the till. She did so. Both offenders reached into the drawer and removed the notes. The offender asked for more money and the victim, who was scared, pointed to the coins section, which was lifted up showing more notes underneath. The two offender took the additional notes and then ran from the news agency. They are the 2 Form 1 offences connected to this substantive offence, Sequence 7. 

25The substantive offence is, similarly to first substantive offence, aggravated beyond the statutory circumstance of aggravation by the fact that the offender was in company at the time. That aggravates it beyond the main circumstance of aggravation, that is, being armed with a dangerous weapon. 

26The third substantive offence is Sequence 10, an offence which occurred on the 26th of July 2010, being an aggravated armed robbery offence contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act charging that the offender committed the offence at Ermington whilst armed with a firearm. 

27This offence occurred at 5.45am on Monday 26 July 2010, when the offender went into the Ermington news agency. He was carrying a shoulder bag, the same as used in many of the other offences for which I sentence him, and depicted on CCTV footage. He approached the counter and produced a black gun from the shoulder bag. He held it at stomach level and pointed it towards the shop assistant and said he didn't want to use it, he only wanted her to give him the money. He then put the gun back into the shoulder bag. 

28The victim pretended to open the cash register but pressed the emergency button. She pretended there was a problem with the cash register, the offender kept telling her to open the till, but she didn't. The defendant then demanded her wallet and grabbed her bumbag, which he saw on the counter. She tried to stop him and there was a short struggle before he was able to take the bumbag and he ran from the store. 

29It contained various personal items belonging to the victim, including credit cards, store cards, club cards, a licence, and her unopened wage envelope and other cash, with a total of $736. This too was depicted on CCTV showing the offender involved in the offence. 

30In assessing the objective criminality of that offence, it seems to me that it is elevated to an extent because of the actual physical contact that occurred between the offender and the victim at the time. It was however not of any seriousness amounting to a struggle, and as I understand it, on the facts put before me, of very short duration. 

31Not only however was this victim understandably distressed, but she was put at considerable personal inconvenience, it must be assumed, having lost not only her own personal wages and money, but also a licence, credit card, and the like, with all of the attendant difficulties in having them replaced. 

32The relevant additional offences for this substantive offence are Sequences 4 and 8. Sequence 4 is another aggravated armed robbery offence, which occurred at about 12.25pm on Sunday 27 June, when the offender went into the Meadowbank convenience store. He was carrying the same shoulder bag used in other offences. 

33The 55 year old store manager was working alone there. The offender approached the victim, opened the bag and partially pulled out the black gun. The victim froze in shock and the offender pulled the gun out again. The victim also saw a knife in the same bag. The offender said he did not want to hurt her, but to give him the money. He leant over the counter and took notes from the till amounting to about $200. He put the money in the bag and asked for money from under the counter. She said she didn't have any, and he then demanded cigarettes. She didn't reply and didn't give him any, and he then left the store, and she rang the police. She was understandably very frightened. 

34The additional offence, Sequence 8, is an armed robbery offence contrary under S97(1). It occurred on Thursday 8 July 2010 at about 3.20 in the afternoon when the offender entered a pharmacy on Lyons Road in Five Dock. He approached the 39 year old owner and manager, who was working at the back of the pharmacy. He told him to stand up and open the till. The offender was holding a kitchen knife at the time. He told the victim he didn't want to hurt him, but just to open the till. The victim was scared and asked that he not be hurt. The offender said he wouldn't as long as he went and opened the till. The offender took the victim's arm and led him to the till. He complied and opened the till and the offender took about $300 from it. He told the victim to go and get his wallet. At that stage the victim saw that the front door was open so he ran out and yelled for help. The offender ran from the premises. All of this too is captured on the CCTV depicting the offender committing the offence. 

35The fourth and last substantive offence for sentence is Sequence 11. This is also an aggravated armed robbery offence. It occurred at 4.50pm on Monday 26 July 2010. That is the afternoon of the day on which the offender committed substantive offence number 3, Sequence 10. The offender went into a news agency in Marion Street Leichhardt and approached the 40 year old store owner, who was working behind the counter at the time. He selected some lollies and placed them on the counter with some cash. As the victim began to process the transaction and open the till, the offender produced a black gun and put it on the cash register in front of the victim and demanded money. The victim took a step away in shock. The offender leaned over the counter and removed the money from the cash register, using both hands. While still holding the gun in one hand, he put everything in his pocket, said thank you to the victim, and ran outside. This too was all captured on the CCTV clearly depicting the offender. In all, as I understand the evidence, $3,000 was stolen during this robbery. 

36The relevant additional offences for this substantive offence are Sequences 9 and 10. Sequence 9 is an offence for assault with intent to rob whilst armed. This offence occurred at about 11.20am on Saturday 24 July 2010 when the offender entered a tobacconist in Glebe Point Road, Glebe. The 42 year old store owner was working behind the counter. The offender produced a knife and pointed it towards her, demanding that she open the till and give him the money. The victim backed away from the till and yelled out for help to passers-by and to people in the park across the street. As a result the offender ran away. This is all captured on CCTV. 

37This is not a completed robbery, it is an assault with intent to rob, and the assault, it seems to me, did not involve actual violence. To that fairly limited extent, it means that this form 1 offence is not objectively as serious as some of the other form 1 offences that I must take into account for the other substantive offences. 

38The remaining form 1 offence is Sequence 12, and it is an offence to steal from a person. It occurred on 24 July 2010 whilst the offender was running from the tobacconist shop in Glebe Point Road. He ran past a bus stop where the 22 year old female victim was waiting for a bus. She had her wallet out of her handbag holding it in her hand. As he ran past her, he grabbed it and kept running. She screamed and then started chasing him across the road. She lost sight of him momentarily and asked a member of the public to help her. They both went to a driveway in a nearby block of units and saw the offender there. The offender walked to the victim and the male who was assisting her, and the victim said ""Give me my wallet"". He said to take it and gave it back to her, and then turned and ran away. 

39In the circumstances of this offence, and also because of the section under which this offence is charged, it is true, while being a serious offence, it is not as serious as some of the other form 1 offences that I take into account on the substantive matters. As I understand the facts, whilst no doubt the victim was frightened and shocked, in fact, her property was recovered and nothing was stolen. 

40That as I understand it, deals with all of the relevant facts for all of what are in effect the 13 offences for which I sentence the offender. 

41The offender was arrested on 6 August 2010. When police tried to stop the car that he was in. It accelerated away from the police and then stopped. The offender got out of the passenger side and tried to hide between some parked cars and the vehicle then drove off. The police found him hiding in between the parked cars. He initially gave them a false identity, but was arrested and taken to a police station where his true identity was confirmed. 

42He engaged in a record of interview shortly after his arrest, where he was shown a number of CCTV images, from some, but not all of the 12 offences for which I sentence him. He confirmed that it was him on all of them. He engaged in a further record of interview on 26 August 2010 and was shown CCTV images for the remainder of the 12 offences, and again confirmed that it was him depicted in each of them. He made therefore admissions in relation to each of the 12 armed robbery or similar offences, for which I sentence him. 

43He thus, having escaped on 23 April 2010, was returned to custody on 6 August 2010 the day of his arrest, and has remained in custody ever since. He is now serving the balance of a non-parole period for a sentence which he was serving at the time of his escape. 

44He has a lengthy criminal record, which I will refer to again shortly. It includes offences of armed robbery or robbery in company with periods of imprisonment. His criminal record commenced in 1994 with offences of larceny. There were then some drug supply charges, an offence of violence, and some motor vehicle offences. He received a prison term for a number of counts of aggravated armed robbery and armed robbery in 1995. That was a term of 12 years with a nine year non-parole period. He was again convicted for robbery in company for an offence occurring in 2008 and sentenced to an overall sentence of five years with a three year non-parole period. That was the prison sentence he was serving at the time of his escape. 

45After being returned to custody from 6 August 2010, his sentence has been adjusted, and his current non-parole period for these pre-existing sentences does not now expire until 26 June 2012 with a two year parole thereafter. The sentences I impose for the aggravated armed robbery offences must therefore commence either on that day, that is from 26 June 2012, or some time beforehand. I will in fact be commencing those sentences from a period six months before 26 June 20012, that is, from 26 January 2012, to take into account in a very small way the totality overall represented by the armed robbery offences for which I sentence him, and the pre-existing sentences. I do not propose to backdate any further than that because, as will become clear, I propose an aggregate sentence for all of the armed robbery offences, which of itself takes into account some degree of totality, at least as relevant to those offences. 

46I now turn to deal with the subjective circumstances surrounding this offender. I will deal with that in fairly brief detail. I have had access to a psychologist's report, and also the offender gave evidence under oath. In that evidence he confirmed the history and other personal details recorded in the psychologists report. 

47He is now 36. He is the middle of three children. He was raised in Sydney in what I accept was a supportive and stable environment. Neither of his siblings have had problems with the police and it would appear that his parents and family generally have always been hard working respectable members of the community. 

48A defining moment in his life appears to have been the death from cancer of his grand-father when he was 15, a death which occurred fairly shortly after the cancer was discovered. He was very close to him, and I accept he was devastated. In fact, even when recounting this in the witness-box during the sentence, he was either close to tears or was crying, and this is an event which must have occurred now some 15 or 16 years ago. 

49Shortly after this event he started to get into trouble and ran away from home. He lived on the streets for about six months. He would go home for a while and his mother in secret would assist him by washing his clothes and giving him some food. He returned to his family home for a year before he went to prison for the first time at the age of 17. After that prison term he again went to live with his parents, but continued to have problems because his family, particularly his father, and not surprisingly, did not approve of his friends, and in particular, his drug use. 

50He went back into prison at the age of 22 and, as I said, served a nine year non-parole period. He was released in 2007 and reincarcerated not long afterwards. He stayed in prison until he escaped in April 2010, and, as I said, since 6 August 2010 has been back in custody. 

51Sadly, it would appear from the comments he made to the psychologist, that he feels to a very large extent institutionalised and feels normal whilst inside prison, as opposed to feeling an outsider when released into the community. The fact that he is now able to enunciate that to the psychologist indicates, it seems to me, a degree of insight, which provides some hope for his prospects of rehabilitation. 

52He has had ongoing contact with his family since going back to prison in August last year. I accept that he feels ashamed at having brought his family name into disrepute as a result of his crimes over the years. He continues to have a close relationship with his mother, but at present that is somewhat strained. She is currently suffering from cancer and is receiving chemotherapy. As I understand his evidence, he believes she has removed herself from him for the time being because she has become tired of dealing with his criminal offences and the incarceration. He anticipates regaining that relationship in due course, which it seems to me is likely to be the case. He has however regained a relationship with his father since being in custody on this occasion. I accept that his father and family generally will continue to support him whilst in custody, and on his release, which will increase his prospects of rehabilitation. 

53He has been educated to year 10 and has done two years of a carpentry apprenticeship. It was some time ago, however, and he did not finish that apprenticeship because he was sent to prison. He has worked casually in labouring jobs with family and friends on occasions when he has been out of prison. 

54It would appear to me there are some issues in relation to his health, perhaps not that which he feared when he escaped from prison, but in relation to his neurological health. He was involved in a car accident at the age of 15. He had bleeding on the brain and was in a coma for three months. There is no formal evidence before me of any brain damage, but I accept from the history that he gave to the psychologist, there is at the very least an indication of the possibility of some frontal lobe damage, which at some stage or other in his future he would benefit from having investigated. No doubt, his extensive use of drugs since then, will make any formal assessment of any brain damage rather difficult. 

55He was diagnosed with ADHD at nine years of age and prescribed medication, but his mother did not wish to give it to him, and as I understand, he did not use that medication. As I understand, he still has some problems along these lines. He started to use drugs, and his use of illegal drugs, it seems me, is the major issue surrounding this offender, both involving his commission of these offences and also any prospect of rehabilitation. 

56He started to use cannabis at 15, and at 17 he started to use amphetamines, including cocaine and ecstasy. Initially it was social use, but as is so often seen in these Courts involving criminal offenders, it escalated to a habit sometimes involving $3,000 a day. He was not able to pay that from legal sources and started to commit the criminal offences which are on his record to pay for his drug habit. 

57He started to use heroin whilst in prison custody in 2007 and became addicted to it in prison. It seems to me that is a sad state of affairs, and an indictment on the way in which our prison system is administered, but that is the case. I do accept that to be the case. I accept that on the evidence given by the prisoner, evidence of a similar nature given to me by prisoners over 15 years, and also the history that he gave to the psychologist. 

58It is a matter of great concern, and ought be a matter of great concern to the community, that people who are already drug addicts become addicted to yet another form of drugs whilst in prison custody under the care and control of the State of New South Wales. Nonetheless, I accept that to be the case. 

59After he escaped in 2010, it was not long before he started to use drugs again, including cocaine, amphetamine, and heroin, and he was continuing to use these drugs, particularly heroin, at the time he committed all of the armed robbery offences before me. I accept that he committed these offences in order to obtain funds to buy these drugs. That does not operate as an excuse, but provides an explanation for his behaviour, and also assists to an extent in determining his prospect of rehabilitation. 

60I accept that since going back into custody on this occasion he has not used prohibited drugs. Of course it must be said that he is now back in maximum security as an escaped prisoner, and I accept his evidence that access to the drugs is not so readily available in maximum security as it was when he was in minimum security. 

61He has been given the opportunity before to address his longstanding drug problem, but has not used it. I have before me the remarks on sentence of three other judges who sentenced him for armed robbery offences, all of whom have taken into account his longstanding drug addiction, and the sentences have attempted to give him an opportunity to address it. 

62In those circumstances his prospects of rehabilitation are guarded, but I accept that at least at present he demonstrates considerable insight into the connection between his drug use and his criminal offending, and also the fact that he would need to remain free of illegal drugs in order to effect true rehabilitation. I accept that he wants to undertake the drug rehabilitation program, both whilst he remains inside gaol and when he is ultimately released. His real prospects of rehabilitation, however good or poor they might be, are entirely dependent on his being able to remain free of drugs, and it seems to me with his longstanding drug problem he will need a longer than normal period of supervision in the community to do so, including the consideration of some residential drug rehabilitation on his release, should that be thought appropriate and if it is available. 

63Whilst he is not eligible for the compulsory drug rehabilitation program in prison, I accept that if it were ultimately to become available, or something of that type were available to him in custody, he would be involved in it, and it seems to me that his prospects of rehabilitation would be considerably enhanced if he were able to engage in some form of structured drug rehabilitation of the type offered by that compulsory program. 

64I also accept from the evidence that he has given that he is genuinely sorry, that is contrite and remorseful, for having committed these offences. 

65Having recited all of the relevant facts then for the substantive offences of aggravated armed robbery, and in fact for the additional two offences relevant for each of them, that is 12 offences in all, it seems to me clear that whilst none of the substantive offences is absolute identical, each of them is quite similar. 

66There are common features of aggravation, most significantly being the fact that he was an escaped prisoner at the time. 

67There are other common factors, which point towards lower objective criminality, including what I find to be relatively poor planning and the spontaneous and apparently random nature of the offences. There are also different and additional features of aggravation relevant for each of them, including for some the fact that he was in company with others, and the fact that he was armed additionally with a knife. 

68I have also made a finding that the gun he was using was not in fact a genuine firearm, and that is a factor to be taken into account, but it is common to all of the offences. 

69Whilst there are different features of aggravation relevant to each of them, it seems to me that they are not so different that any one of these four substantive offences stands out as being either less or more serious as the charge of aggravated robbery. Obviously the subjective case is the same for each, given that they were committed around the same time. 

70In these circumstances it seems to me that the same term of imprisonment would be appropriate for each of them. 

71The Henry guideline judgment is a relevant matter which I must take into account for each of these offences as a guideline. Each of the substantive offences is more serious than the typical case envisaged by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that decision. To start with, they are aggravated offences under S97(2). Further, the offender is neither young, nor does he have either no or only a limited criminal record. Also he was an escaped prisoner at the time, and for each case there are two additional offences to be taken into account in a meaningful way, each of which in their own right was a serious offence. These are differences which make these offences more serious than those referred to in the Henry decision. 

72There are some similarities, however, including the fact that, except for one where there was some wrestling, there was no actual violence and limited threats. Further, except for the offence where the sum of $3,000 was stolen, the money stolen was either small or minimal, and there is some similarity to the Henry guideline in that the offender was a drug addict, who committed the offences to obtain funds to satisfy that addiction. 

73The other distinction between these offences and the Henry guideline case is that these are early pleas of guilty, unlike the Henry guideline situation. Using the Henry guideline of 4 to 5 years overall as a guideline these are more serious, but in using that as a guideline to obtain the appropriate starting point for these sentences, it is appropriate that I reduce it by a further amount of about 15 percent to take into account the fact that these are early pleas of guilty and so that the offender is given the benefit of a full 25 percent discount for the pleas, both to take into account of course their utilitarian value, but also because they come under the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act . 

74In these circumstances it seems to me that for each substantive armed robbery offence, taking into account the Form 1 offences, a starting point of 8 years for each is appropriate, and when that is reduced by a further discount of about 15 per cent that gives rise to an overall term for each of 7 years, which it seems to me is the appropriate overall sentence for each of these substantive offences. I indicate that if I were sentence him for these separately I would set an overall sentence of 7 years for each of the substantive offences. 

75Section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act allows me to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in relation to two or more offences. This cannot include for this matter the escape offence, but is available for each of the armed robbery offences. Given the nature of all of the offences, particularly the similarities amongst them which I have already referred to, it seems to me that this is an appropriate case to do so. During submissions it was raised with counsel and no submission contrary was made. 

76I indicate to the offender therefore that for each of the armed robbery offences I will be imposing an aggregate sentence pursuant to S53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . Further, pursuant to S3A(2), and for the reasons I have set out above, I indicate that I would have imposed a separate overall sentence for each of them of 7 years, had I not been imposing these aggregate sentences. Taking into account issues of totality it seems to me that the aggregate overall sentence for each should be 10 years imprisonment. 

77There are special circumstances, including that to which I have already referred, namely that the offender will need a longer than normal period of supervision in the community to make good his rehabilitation, both in relation to his long standing drug addition and also because he will have served a very long period of time in prison by the time he is released and so is likely to become further institutionalized. Further, there is in effect a degree of partial accumulation. 

78It seems to me that on that finding of special circumstances, a non-parole parole period overall of 6 years is appropriate. 

79I then must impose a sentence for the escape charge which, pursuant to S57, must commence at the expiration of the non-parole period for the other armed robbery offences. Having characterised it as I have earlier in these Reasons for Sentence, it seems to me there should be an overall sentence of 2 years imprisonment for that offence and on a finding of the same special circumstance, I will be setting a non-parole period of 12 months to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period for the armed robbery offences. That will in effect mean an overall period of imprisonment for this prisoner of 7 years and an overall parole of 3 years. 

80I will commence these sentences, as I have said, from the 26th of January 2012, by backdating 6 months from the date at which he is otherwise eligible for release to parole on the existing sentence. 

81For each of the offences the offender is convicted. Pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the offender is sentenced to aggregate sentences for the offences of aggravated armed robbery, being Sequence 7, committed 4th of July 2010, (taking into account Form 1 offences Sequences 3 and 5), Sequence 10 committed 26th July 2010 (taking into account Form 1, Sequences 4 and 8), Sequence 11, committed 26 th July, 2010 (taking into account Sequences 9 and 12 on the Form 1), and Sequence 14, committed 27 th June, 2010 (taking into account Form 1 Sequences 6 and 13). 

82The aggregate sentence for each of the substantive offences is a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on the 26th of January 2012 and expiring on the 25th of January 2018, with a parole period thereafter of 4 years commencing on the 26th of January 2018 and expiring on the 25th of January 2022 giving rise to an overall aggregate sentence of 10 years commencing on the 26th of January 2012 and expiring on the 26th of January 2022. 

83For the offence of escape lawful custody, Sequence 2 committed 23 rd April, 2010, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of twelve months commencing the 26th of January 2018 and expiring on the 25th of January 2019, with parole thereafter of twelve months commencing from 26 January 2019 expiring 25 January 2020, giving rise to an overall term in prison of 2 years commencing 26 January 2018 and expiring 25 January 2020. 

84I direct that he be released to parole at the expiration of that non-parole period.

2757644,R v Hawi & ors (No 22) [2011] NSWSC 1668,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: The Crown has closed its case. In the time between then and now the Court has been concerned with a number of legal issues, including a submission made on behalf of the accused Padovan to the effect that he has no case to answer in respect of the two charges for which he stands trial. I indicated earlier this morning that I did not propose to direct verdicts of acquittal in respect of either of those charges. 

2Mr Conwell, on behalf of Mr Padovan, has now made an application commonly referred to as a Prasad application. That is a reference to R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161. It has been said that the power to invite the jury to consider returning a verdict of not guilty at any time after the close of the Crown case should be used sparingly and only where the evidence lacks cogency: see R v Pahuja (1987) 49 SASR 191. 

3In the course of making the no case submissions, Mr Conwell identified a considerable number of what he asserted were deficiencies in the evidence in respect of his client and I acknowledge that there are many arguments available which may persuade the jury that there should be a reasonable doubt in respect of Mr Padovan's guilt in relation to both charges. 

4A Prasad invitation is most appropriate in cases where little or no explanation of the law is required; the issues are straightforward and there is no need for there to be any detailed review of the evidence. For example, such an invitation to the jury may most commonly be found in cases involving alleged personal or sexual violence where the only evidence upon which the prosecution relies is that of the alleged victim and where there is a real issue as to whether the victim can be believed. 

5In the present case, Mr Padovan is but one of seven accused who are the subject of this trial. The trial has been proceeding for three months before the jury and there is a substantial body of evidence that has been adduced in the course of the prosecution case. In my view, it would be impossible for the jury to fully understand amongst that volume of evidence what aspects of it are relied upon by the Crown, on the one hand, and by Mr Padovan, on the other. 

6It would be inappropriate for addresses to be made by counsel for either party so as to appraise the jury as to those matters and it would be similarly inappropriate for me to take the jury through the competing arguments that were presented to me in the course of considering the no case submissions. 

7There is another factor that is relevant as well and that is that the case for Mr Padovan appears to raise significant issues as to self-defence. To properly consider those issues, the jury would need to have an explanation as to the matters mentioned in s 418 of the Crimes Act 1900 and would require an explanation of the necessity for the Crown, in order for the Crown to succeed, to negative either of the two limbs of self-defence. 

8In my view, there are too many complications of the nature that I have just briefly outlined to make this a situation in which giving the jury a Prasad invitation appropriate. 

9The application is refused.

		14 February 2012",2011-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757645,R v Hawi & ors (No 20) [2011] NSWSC 1666,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: On 22 August 2011 I announced that I refused an application to direct the jury to return verdicts of not guilty in respect of the accused, David Padovan. These are my reasons. 

2On 24 May 2011 Mr Padovan was arraigned before a jury panel and pleaded that he was not guilty in respect of the following alleged offences: 

Affray : On 22 March 2009 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales used or threatened unlawful violence towards other persons such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 

Riot : On 22 March 2009 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales together with at least 11 other persons assembled together used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them taken together was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 

Alternatively, affray : On 22 March 2009 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales used or threatened unlawful violence towards other persons such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 

3The trial has proceeded with six other accused who are charged with murder, alternatively riot, four of whom are also charged with affray. The charges concerning Mr Padovan are, respectively, counts 3, 4 and 5 in the indictment. 

4The Crown closed its case on 11 August 2011. Mr Conwell, counsel for Mr Padovan, foreshadowed making a no case to answer submission. Such submissions were made on 15 and 16 August 2011. A question arose as to the correct construction of s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900 during no case submissions that were made on behalf of a co-accused. I deferred giving judgment until I had heard submissions on that subject by the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for each of the accused. Those submissions were made on 18 August 2011. In the end, the Crown was granted leave to amend the indictment in respect of counts of riot so as to delete the averment that the accused ""threatened"" unlawful violence: see R v Hawi & ors (No 18) . 

Principles 

5Whealy J (as he then was) helpfully set out the relevant principles that I must apply in R v Keli LANE [No 18] [2010] NSWSC 1545: 

[2] The principles in relation to the correct approach to be taken by a trial court where such an application is made are not in doubt. They were recently stated in R v PL (2009) NSWCCA 256 by Spigelman CJ with whom the other members of the Court agreed. Those principles draw in turn upon the well known statements in Doney v R (1990) 171 CLR 207; (1990) 50 A Crim R 157 at 162 and other established authorities which I need not cite for the purposes of this judgment. 

[3] The relevant principles may be shortly summarised as follows: 

(a) The Crown case must be taken at its highest and it is for the jury, not for the judge, to resolve conflicts of evidence. 

(b) Where there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberation, and that evidence is capable of affording a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left for the jury for its decision. 

(c) It is not the task of the Court to form any view as to whether a conviction would be unreasonable having regard to the evidence. That is a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal under the appeals system in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It is not a matter for the trial judge, whatever may be his views. 

(d) It is not sufficient in a circumstantial case for a judge to conclude that there may be a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence (see R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39). Indeed, the presence of competing hypotheses, a not unusual situation in a criminal trial, and the question whether they have been excluded by the Crown, is a matter for the jury to resolve. It is not a matter that is determinative, or even relevant, to the application with which I am dealing. 

Overview of the case 

6The trial is concerned with two episodes of violent activity between members or associates of the Comanchero and Hells Angels motorcycle gangs that occurred at the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009. The Crown contends that unlawful violence, constituting an affray, occurred in the vicinity of Gate 5 (count 3), and that further unlawful violence, constituting a riot, or alternatively an affray, occurred minutes later in the departure hall (counts 4 and 5). The latter culminated in the death of Mr Anthony Zervas but it is not alleged that Mr Padovan is criminally liable for that. 

7It is the Crown case that the catalyst for these events was the chance encounter between five members of the Comanchero and the president of the Hells Angels, Mr Derek Wainohu, on a flight from Melbourne. There is evidence of telephone communications to fellow members of the respective groups in Sydney which brought about the attendance of a further seven Comanchero members and seven Hells Angels members, including Mr Padovan, at the airport. 

Some general matters concerning the Crown case 

8The Crown relies upon an agreed fact that there was ongoing hostility between the Comancheros and the Hells Angels and that the accused was aware of this. 

9There is evidence that Mr Derek Wainohu, the then president of the Hells Angels, was on Qantas flight 430 from Melbourne to Sydney on Sunday 22 March 2009. By chance, so too were five Comanchero members: Mahmoud Hawi, Christian Menzies, Ishmail Eken, Pomare Pirini and Maher Aouli. There is evidence of some animosity being exhibited by at least Mr Hawi towards Mr Wainohu. There is also evidence of telephone communications made by Comanchero members, and by Mr Wainohu, to members of their respective clubs in Sydney. 

10As I indicated earlier, seven Comancheros attended the airport: Fares Abounader, Usama Potrus, Zoran Kisacanin, Tiago Costa and Francesco LaRosa, as well as two men who have become prosecution witnesses, SP and AL. The seven Hells Angels members and associates who attended the airport were Peter Zervas, Anthony Zervas, Elias Khoury, Peter Martin, Tom Baker, Musa Ovalle and Mr Padovan. 

11Security camera footage that is before the jury depicts these men entering and walking about the terminal. The Comancheros aside from Messrs Abounader and Potrus, proceeded through security screening and went to Gate 5 where QF 430 was due to arrive. Most of the Hells Angels waited out in the departure hall but Messrs Padovan and Baker went through to Gate 5. It was shortly after those who were on the plane had disembarked that the events that are in issue occurred in the vicinity of the gate. 

Affray at Gate 5 

12To establish the charge of affray, the Crown must establish that Mr Padovan either used or threatened unlawful violence towards another person. It must also establish that such conduct would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 

13No question was raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the latter point. There is an abundance of it. The critical issue is whether the Crown case is capable of establishing that Mr Padovan used, or threatened to use, unlawful violence. 

14It is unnecessary to go into great detail in relation to all that occurred at Gate 5. Evidence has been given by a large number of airline staff, staff who were working in shops in the vicinity, and members of the general public about what they saw and heard. Given that the events were unusual, unexpected, chaotic and relatively short-lived, it is unsurprising that there is a wide divergence in what each of these witnesses were able to observe and recall. It is sufficient to say that it would be open to the jury to conclude that after an initial confrontation between, at least, Messrs Wainohu and Hawi, there was a violent brawl involving members of two opposing groups. 

15It is not controversial that the attention of the Comancheros, or some of them, was then focused upon Mr Padovan. The Crown does not contend that Messrs Wainohu and Baker were aggressors in the fighting at Gate 5 (or later in the departure hall). It also seems to be uncontroversial that Mr Padovan was chased in a westerly direction down the concourse and assaulted. The clothing on his upper body was removed. Witness descriptions frequently made reference to ""the man without the shirt"" or similar. Some of the witnesses describe Mr Padovan on the ground being kicked and punched (for example, T241; T275; T385). 

16The pursuit and assault of Mr Padovan is the major, but not the only, component of the evidence at Gate 5 upon which the Crown relies in contending that the offence of affray occurred. The Crown relies upon evidence of events which occurred from the initial confrontation involving Messrs Wainohu and Hawi through until the physical violence had ceased and a man (there is evidence suggesting it was Mr Hawi) called out something like, ""you're a dead man, you're fucking dead, you've got bullet holes in you"" (T580.43). (See similar witness descriptions of the threat at T386 and T833). 

17The Crown accepts that self-defence is an issue in respect of Mr Padovan in relation to the events at Gate 5. It contends that, in contrast to Messrs Wainohu and Baker who did not respond and join in the fighting, Mr Padovan exercised the choice to do so. On the other hand, Mr Conwell submitted that ""at Gate 5 [Mr Padovan] was given a hiding by a large number of men. His only options there were to run away and get away which is exactly the option that he took"" (T3727.37). Written submissions by Mr Conwell included excerpts from the evidence of quite a number of witnesses which support the proposition. However, as will shortly be seen, there is also evidence which supports the Crown's proposition. 

18Mr Conwell has submitted that ""words alone"" are incapable of establishing a threat of unlawful violence. The Crown accepts that. So much is succinctly stated in s 93C(3) of the Crimes Act . The Crown, however, relies upon more than words uttered by Mr Padovan. It relies upon his actions which were submitted to have included ""fist waving, running and to some extent fighting"" (T3714.30). In this respect the Crown relies upon the observations of some of the eyewitnesses. 

19One witness (McKay) observed a man, who on the evidence must have been Mr Padovan, on the ground and being assaulted. She said, ""He sprang to his feet ... and he was then quite provocative and aggressive in his actions and his speech"" . The man said ""fuck"" repeatedly and ""his gestures were ... very provocative"" (T445). In cross-examination by Mr Conwell, she agreed that he was taunting his assailants who at that point were about five metres away from him (T450). It was clearly the case that this witness gave evidence of Mr Padovan being assaulted and Mr Conwell referred me to this. But I have to look at the Crown case at its highest and so it is significant that she also gave evidence of the above matters. 

20Another witness (Dunn) described a person, who it is open to the jury to conclude was Mr Padovan, ""generally approaching the vicinity of ... two men with an open stance and perhaps aggressively"" (T555.31). A little later he described this man ""approaching the area where fighting was occurring, and I think he did have clenched fists. It seemed to me that he was, well, just approaching into an area of a fight. That is what I meant by aggressive"" (T556.21). 

21In cross-examination by Mr Dunn QC, on behalf of the accused Hawi, the witness adopted the description of this man ""coming in a fighting stance or fighting position towards that incident"" (T557.35). Mr Conwell played the security camera footage which demonstrated, he submitted, that the witness' evidence could not be correct, or could not be interpreted as indicating aggression displayed by Mr Padovan towards any of the Comancheros. That is an available submission, but the footage is not so clear that the jury could not accept the witness' evidence. 

22That witness' wife gave evidence that she saw two men fighting, punching each other (T424.50). Her descriptions of them were such that it would be open to the jury to conclude that the shorter of these two men was Mr Padovan. 

23The Crown Prosecutor referred to the evidence of a Qantas employee (Searle) who saw what was, on the Crown case, Mr Hawi punching Mr Wainohu to the ground. The witness said that ""after this happened a fight erupted between the two groups"" (T436.7). Reference was made to evidence that after Messrs Wainohu and Baker were punched to the ground at the beginning of the fight they played no further role. Thus, it was contended that the "" fight ... between the two groups "" could be interpreted as fighting between the Comancheros and Mr Padovan. 

24Another eyewitness (Auton) said that he saw a man without a shirt (Mr Padovan) ""shaking his fist at someone"" and shouting (T672). In cross-examination by Mr Dunn, he agreed that he had told the police that he could not tell whether this man was being pursued or was pursuing; that he appeared to be very angry; and that he was shouting and gave the witness the impression he was swearing (T673). 

25A passenger from the flight (Youssef) went to the bathroom as soon as he entered the terminal building. When he emerged he saw a group of about 10 men, 4 of whom were fighting. By that he meant ""punching, kicking and swearing back and forth"" (T634.40). In cross-examination, however, he agreed that there were ""about five or six guys on the one guy and they were throwing kicks and punches ... Two guys tried to hold him but he broke free ... by the jumper being taken off him"" (T646). 

26Mr Conwell made other submissions relating to the evidence to which I have just referred. I have not referred specifically to them because it is sufficient to say that they served to highlight that there are competing inferences available, or that they are simply arguments as to why the Crown's interpretation of the evidence should not be accepted. These, however, are matters for the jury to consider. 

27The Crown Prosecutor acknowledged the potential self-defence issue but argued that, on the evidence taken at its highest, it could not be said that the jury would be compelled to find in favour of Mr Padovan. 

28There is no direct evidence presently before the jury as to the accused's beliefs and perceptions on issues concerned with self-defence. That, however, is not essential: Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2006] NSWCA 293 at [19] per Hodgson JA. His Honour added, however, that: 

[19] ... in the absence of other evidence suggesting the contrary, inferences have to be drawn on the basis of what beliefs and perceptions a person in the position of the accused could reasonably hold in the circumstances. 

29Having regard to the principles to which I have earlier referred, as well as to the terms of s 418 of the Crimes Act 1900, it seems to me that what I must now consider is whether, on the evidence presently available, the jury cannot do otherwise than to find both that Mr Padovan believed that what he did was necessary in order to defend himself, and that his conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them. Having regard to all of the evidence to which I was referred by the Crown Prosecutor, but most particularly to that of the witness who described a man (who on the evidence it is open to the jury to conclude was Mr Padovan) approaching two men, with clenched fists, in a fighting stance, I do not believe that conclusion is available. 

30I am satisfied that there is a case to answer in respect of the count of affray. 

Riot, or affray, in the departure hall 

31In relation to the events in the departure hall concerning Mr Padovan, the Crown particularly relies upon three aspects of the evidence: Mr Padovan running towards the fighting; his blood found in an area where the fighting occurred; and an eyewitness who identified him as being involved in the fighting. 

32First, as to Mr Padovan running towards the fighting. There is security camera footage that shows that Mr Padovan emerged from the bi-fold doors, out of the secure area, and into the departure hall at a time when, on the Crown case, the fighting between the Comancheros and the Hells Angels further into the departure hall was still behind the check-in counters. (The fighting soon moved between the counters towards the front of the terminal building). Mr Padovan can be seen to immediately run in a straight line along the back of the counters in the direction of where the fighting had erupted. This, the Crown contends, establishes a willingness and an intention to involve himself in the melee. 

33There is evidence that the witness AL pursued a Hells Angels member, Peter Martin, away from where the fighting had started, in a direction back towards the bi-fold doors. That is, back in the direction from which Mr Padovan was about to appear. Mr Conwell submitted that Mr Padovan was running towards an altercation between those two men in order to defend Mr Martin. Mr Conwell referred to certain security camera footage in support of this proposition. 

34On the evidence presently available, that is a matter of speculation, or an inference that is not the only available inference. Simply because there was fighting between AL and Peter Martin in the direction in which Mr Padovan ran, it does not follow that it was to those two men that Mr Padovan was intending to go. There is no evidence from Mr Martin, because he has not been called, and there is no support for the proposition from AL. Further, AL denied that he fought with Mr Martin. He said that he chased after him after Mr Martin had punched him, but could not catch him. He denied seeing Hells Angels running towards him as he chased Mr Martin (T2506.39). The inference that he was running towards the general fighting that was occurring further away, but in the same direction, is equally available. 

35Mr Conwell submitted that ""David Padovan delayed his exit from the sterile area by one minute"", citing the times on security camera footage in support of this proposition (T3720.20; T3738.35). The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the time difference between the Comancheros and Mr Padovan emerging from the bi-fold doors was more in the order of about 45 seconds, and that the gap had reduced to about 33 seconds at the point at which the Comancheros and Mr Padovan had passed the back of check-in counters 24 and 25 (T3726-7). 

36Whatever the precise timing may be, the fact remains that once he emerged from the bi-fold doors, Mr Padovan immediately ran in the direction of where the fighting had commenced. 

37As to the first part of Mr Conwell's proposition, that Mr Padovan ""delayed his exit"", there is no evidence that this was a deliberate choice made by Mr Padovan. On the evidence presently before the jury, all that can be said is that the Comancheros who had been at Gate 5 came through the bi-fold doors before the Hells Angels. The Comancheros had immediately walked towards the exit as soon as the fighting at Gate 5 had ceased. The Hells Angels took some time to regroup before they commenced to exit the secure area of the terminal. 

38The second aspect relied upon by the Crown was blood found in front of counter 14, in an area fairly central to where the fighting occurred once it had moved through to the front of the check-in counters. Various items identified in the crime scene investigation as having relevance to the incident were found in that general area (for instance, knuckledusters and fallen bollards). Through DNA analysis, this blood was found to be consistent with having come from Mr Padovan. It was the Crown's contention that, on this evidence, the jury could reject the proposition that Mr Padovan went only in aid of Mr Martin in an area behind the check-in counters since evidence of his blood was found in an area in front of the check-in counters where the fighting between the two groups had continued. 

39Mr Conwell submitted that Mr Padovan must have come through that area at some stage; there was really no dispute about it. However, he also submitted that this did not mean that Mr Padovan was in that location at the time that fighting was occurring. The submission amounts to an assertion that there exists an alternative explanation for an item of circumstantial evidence. It does not mean that the inference for which the Crown contends, when viewed in the light of all of the evidence and not just in isolation, is not available. 

40The third matter to which the Crown referred was the evidence of a witness who had been a passenger on the flight from Melbourne (Curtain). It is unnecessary to describe the detail of this evidence. In short, it was that a man he described (consistent with being Mr Padovan) was seen to be involved in the fighting at the front of the terminal. He said that this man was both kicking and punching (T3108). 

41There are a number of reasons why the jury could conclude that this evidence is unreliable. Mr Conwell referred to them in the course of his submissions. However, for me to reject the possibility of the jury having regard to the witness' evidence because of those matters would be to usurp the jury's function. In accordance with the principles I outlined earlier, that is not a course I am able to take. 

42There were some other matters referred to by the Crown Prosecutor in her submissions. She asserted that Mr Padovan running from the bi-fold doors towards the area of the fighting was consistent with him acting on feelings of revenge. It may be that the jury could consider that Mr Padovan had come off second best in the incident at Gate 5 and was likely to be angry as a result. 

43Then there was the contention that Mr Padovan's departure from the terminal evinced a consciousness of guilt. I accept that an argument is available for the jury to consider on this topic. The jury could well consider it a telling point that immediately leaving the terminal, and the airport generally, was inconsistent with a man who had been purely a victim of an assault at Gate 5 and had played no part in the subsequent fighting in the departure hall. This is particularly so when it is considered that Anthony Zervas, the brother of one of his Hells Angels companions, Peter Zervas, was lying unconscious on the ground receiving urgent medical attention. Peter Zervas was hovering about in a most agitated and distressed state. Mr Padovan did nothing to assist Anthony Zervas and did not stay to support and console Peter Zervas. He simply walked out. 

44Mr Conwell submitted that on the evidence presently before the jury, the proposition that Mr Padovan was acting in self-defence could not be negatived. It is, as I understand the position, not the defence case that Mr Padovan did anything in defence of himself or another person in the departure hall. Notwithstanding this, the proposition was maintained in the event that the jury accepted the Crown's contention that Mr Padovan was involved in using violence. If that was the case, it was submitted that it could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt that he used unlawful violence because the evidence was incapable of satisfying the jury that Mr Padovan did not believe that it was necessary to do what he did in defence of another person and was also incapable of satisfying a jury that his conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them. Reference was made to the cross-examination of the witness Curtain in which he agreed that he could not say whether the man without the shirt was an aggressor or defending himself (T3112.19). For present purposes, however, that evidence is neutral. 

45I cannot accept Mr Conwell's submission on the issue of self-defence. Evidence that Mr Padovan ran towards the fighting, and that he was seen to be fighting, could be regarded by the jury as disproving beyond reasonable doubt either, or indeed both, of the two limbs in s 418 of the Crimes Act . 

46My conclusion is that there is a case to answer in respect of the charge of riot, and the alternative charge of affray. 

Conclusion 

47It was for the foregoing reasons that I refused the application to direct the jury to return verdicts of not guilty.

2757648,R v Hawi & ors (No 19) [2011] NSWSC 1665,"Judgment 

Background 

1HIS HONOUR: On 24 May 2011 the accused Zoran Kisacanin was arraigned before a jury panel and pleaded that he was not guilty in respect of the following alleged offences: 

Murder : On 22 March 2009 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales did murder Anthony Zervas; in the alternative 

Riot : On 22 March 2009 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales [six named accused] together with at least six other persons assembled together used or threatened unlawful violence for a common purpose and the conduct of them taken together was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 

Affray : On 22 March 2009 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales used or threatened unlawful violence towards other persons such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness then being present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 

2The trial has proceeded with five other accused who are charged in identical terms. A sixth co-accused is charged with riot and affray but not with murder. 

3Putting it very broadly, the trial is concerned with two episodes of violent activity between members/associates of the Comanchero and Hells Angels motorcycle gangs that occurred at the Qantas domestic terminal at Sydney airport on 22 March 2009. The Crown contends that unlawful violence, constituting an affray, occurred in the vicinity of Gate 5, and that further unlawful violence, constituting a riot, occurred minutes later in the departure hall. The latter culminated in the death of the deceased. 

4It is the Crown case that the catalyst for these events was the chance encounter between five members of the Comanchero and the president of the Hells Angels, Mr Derek Wainohu, on a flight from Melbourne. There is evidence of telephone communications to fellow members of the respective groups in Sydney which brought about the attendance of a further seven Comanchero members and seven Hells Angels members at the airport. Mr Kisacanin was one of the Comanchero who was contacted in Sydney and who subsequently went to the airport. 

5The Crown closed its case on 11 August 2011. Mr Gordon, counsel for Mr Kisacanin, foreshadowed making a no case to answer submission. Such submissions were made on 15 and 16 August 2011. A question arose as to the correct construction of s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900. I deferred giving judgment until I had heard submissions on that subject by the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for each of the accused. Those submissions were made on 18 August 2011. 

Principles 

6Whealy J (as he then was) helpfully set out the relevant principles that I must apply in R v Keli LANE [No 18] [2010] NSWSC 1545: 

""[2] The principles in relation to the correct approach to be taken by a trial court where such an application is made are not in doubt. They were recently stated in R v PL (2009) NSWCCA 256 by Spigelman CJ with whom the other members of the Court agreed. Those principles draw in turn upon the well known statements in Doney v R (1990) 171 CLR 207; (1990) 50 A Crim R 157 at 162 and other established authorities which I need not cite for the purposes of this judgment. 

[3] The relevant principles may be shortly summarised as follows: 

(a) The Crown case must be taken at its highest and it is for the jury, not for the judge, to resolve conflicts of evidence. 

(b) Where there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberation, and that evidence is capable of affording a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left for the jury for its decision. 

(c) It is not the task of the Court to form any view as to whether a conviction would be unreasonable having regard to the evidence. That is a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal under the appeals system in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It is not a matter for the trial judge, whatever may be his views. 

(d) It is not sufficient in a circumstantial case for a judge to conclude that there may be a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence (see R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39). Indeed, the presence of competing hypotheses, a not unusual situation in a criminal trial, and the question whether they have been excluded by the Crown, is a matter for the jury to resolve. It is not a matter that is determinative, or even relevant, to the application with which I am dealing."" 

Some general matters as to the Crown case 

7The Crown relies upon an agreed fact that there was ongoing hostility between the Comanchero and the Hells Angels and that the accused was aware of this. It also relies upon evidence that the Comanchero motorcycle club was an organisation with a hierarchical structure. Evidence was given by Detective Sergeant Groenewegen that it was governed by strict rules setting out the behaviour expected from members. Such rules reinforce a strong culture of loyalty of members towards one another and to the club. Punishments are prescribed for breaches of the rules. 

8Those rules included: 


Any display of cowardice will not be tolerated. 
A nominee will at all times, regardless of the circumstances, be directed by members in authority. 
A nominee shall carry out whatever the club may deem to be a fair task which applies to being on-call 24 hours a day. This is unless it has some detriment to his character or his self-esteem. 
A nominee is an emissary of the club and will conduct himself as a Comanchero. Their actions will reflect the Comanchero. They will be held directly responsible and accountable for their actions. 

9There is evidence that Mr Kisacanin was a nominee member (T2612) and so the latter three of those rules applied to him. 

10There is evidence before the jury by SP to the following effect (T2611 -2615). After contact had been made by Comanchero members on the flight before it departed Melbourne, SP received a call from the accused Usama Potrus who asked him to come around and pick him up. SP did so. He then rang Mr Kisacanin and AL and they proceeded to pick up those two. Mr Kisacanin had told him on the phone that he was not at home and that he was busy, but nonetheless he agreed to go. 

11I interpolate in this account of SP's evidence that the telephone records show that Mr Kisacanin received a call from SP at 12.09pm. He made a call back to SP at 12.15pm. He received a call from Mr Rui Antao (see below) at 12.17pm. Then, between 12.28pm and 12.48pm, there was a series of telephone contacts between Mr Kisacanin and Mr Abounader, Mr Kisacanin and SP and Mr Kisacanin and Mr Potrus. Mr Gordon referred to the lack of evidence as to the content of these communications. Apart from the evidence of SP, to which I have just referred, that much is true. However, it would be open to the jury to conclude from the totality and timing of these calls and texts (together with the evidence to which I am about to refer) that most, if not all of them, had something to do with the perceived need for Comanchero members to gather in numbers and quickly get to the airport. 

12SP said that when he had first seen Mr Potrus, he had been told that they were ""going to the airport to pick up Mick [a reference to the accused Mahmoud Hawi] and some of the other boys on the plane ... there was maybe some Hells Angels on the same flight or going to be at the airport at the same time"". Mr Potrus repeated as much to Mr Kisacanin and AL when they were in the car. 

13The carload of now four Comanchero members then proceeded towards the airport. On the way, Mr Potrus received calls from the accused Farres Abounader. As a result, the car was redirected to Brighton. At Brighton, there was gathering of other Comanchero members. In addition to the four in the car that included Mr Kisacanin, there was Mr Daux Ngakuru, the commander of the accused's chapter of the Comanchero; Mr Rui Antao, the ""nom boss"" (in charge of nominee members); and there was another car which contained Mr Abounader, the ""road captain"", Mr Tiago Costa, the club secretary, and Mr Frank LaRosa, the club treasurer. Mr Kisacanin was not privy to the discussion that ensued but the two carloads of Comanchero (but not Messrs Ngakuru and Antao) then proceeded to the airport. 

14It would be open to the jury to conclude that these seven men proceeded to the airport with some haste. The two cars were parked illegally in front of the terminal. Mr LaRosa suggested that he would stay with the cars but he was told by Mr Abounader to come inside. All of the occupants immediately proceeded inside. Five of them, including Mr Kisacanin, passed through security screening and went to Gate 5 where the arriving flight was due. Two waited outside, it being the Crown case that Mr Abounader could not go through the metal detectors because he was carrying a knife. Mr Potrus waited outside in the departure hall with him. 

15What I have outlined thus far is the background upon which the Crown relies for the assessment of the evidence of the events that then occurred, first at Gate 5, and then a short time later in the departure hall. A number of inferences are open to the jury to draw from this background. Mr Gordon submitted that the evidence supports an inference that what was within contemplation was the need to go to the airport to act ""as it were, as a guard to Mr Hawi"" and that ""nothing arises as a further inference than that"" (T3690.15). 

16In my view, however, it would be open to the jury to conclude that Mr Kisacanin knew that there was a possibility of something occurring between the members of the Comanchero and the Hells Angels at the airport. He, and six other Comanchero members had been summoned to attend. The seven who were to attend the airport were first required to go to Brighton where there was a meeting involving senior Comanchero members. The jury could well conclude that it was apparent to Mr Kisacanin that this was not just an exercise in going to the airport to pick up some friends who had been away on a trip. The fact is that there were only two cars taken to the airport; they were occupied by seven men; and they were to meet five men arriving on the flight to Melbourne. Even if the jury were to accept a submission that Mr Kisacanin contemplated that there was a need to ""guard"" Mr Hawi, they could infer from this that the need for a guard was because there was a prospect of a violent confrontation. 

17The Comanchero club, with its rules and structure, required Mr Kisacanin, as a nominee member, to be loyal and obedient to more senior members. Whilst there is no evidence that Mr Kisacanin was ordered or directed to do anything in particular on 22 March 2009, as Mr Gordon submitted, there is an inference available that he understood that there was an expectation upon him to support his fellow members, particularly in respect of any conflict with members of the Hells Angels. 

The Gate 5 affray 

18When Mr Wainohu and the five Comancheros disembarked from the flight at Gate 5 they were met, respectively, by two members of the Hells Angels (David Padovan and Tom Baker) and five members of the Comanchero (Messrs Kisacanin, Costa, LaRosa, SP and AL). 

19It is unnecessary to go into great detail in relation to all that occurred in the vicinity of Gate 5. Evidence has been given by a large number of airline staff, staff who were working in shops in the vicinity, and members of the general public about what they saw and heard. Given that the events were unusual, unexpected, chaotic and relatively short-lived, it is unsurprising that there is a wide divergence in what each of these witnesses were able to observe and recall. It is sufficient to say that it would be open to the jury to conclude that after an initial confrontation between, at least, Messrs Wainohu and Hawi, there was a violent brawl involving members of two opposing groups. 

20It is not controversial that the attention of the Comancheros, or some at least, was then focussed upon Mr Padovan. The Crown does not contend that Messrs Wainohu and Baker were aggressors in the fighting at Gate 5 (or later in the departure hall). It also seems to be uncontroversial that Mr Padovan was chased in a westerly direction down the concourse and assaulted. The clothing on his upper body was removed. Witness descriptions frequently made reference to ""the man without the shirt"" or similar. Some of the witnesses describe Mr Padovan being on the ground being kicked and punched (for example, T241; T275; T385). 

21The pursuit and assault of Mr Padovan is the major, but not the only, component of the evidence of the events at Gate 5 upon which the Crown relies in contending that the offence of affray occurred. A specific item of evidence upon which the Crown relies for an assertion that Mr Kisacanin was involved is footage from a security camera from within the Watermark bookstore. The Crown Prosecutor played this footage during the course of her submissions on the no case application. It is her contention that it shows that when a group of Comanchero men can be seen in what must be the pursuit of Mr Padovan in the direction that had been described by various witnesses, Mr Kisacanin can be seen as one of those men. It is also evident from that footage that at least some of the pursuers then engaged in an assault upon the man who must have been Mr Padovan. 

22It must be noted that none of the footage from the many security cameras at the airport provides clear images of the activity of the Hells Angels and Comanchero men in the events in question. The resolution of the images is quite low and the figures depicted are often grainy and blurred. In many cases it is a matter of perspective or deduction in piecing together footage from different cameras and marrying it with eyewitness descriptions. 

23In relation to the footage from the Watermark bookstore to which my attention was invited by the prosecutor, I am satisfied that it is sufficiently clear to enable the jury to draw the inference, in the context of other evidence, that the person she indicated was Mr Kisacanin. The image is insufficiently clear to enable discernment of facial features. Clothing and footwear worn by the person is, however, sufficiently distinctive for the jury to conclude that the person was Mr Kisacanin. It would appear that the person leading the pursuit, or near to the lead of the pursuit, of Mr Padovan is AL. He is a man of distinctive appearance, not only in terms of his build, but also because of his bright blue Hawaiian shirt. The Watermark footage shows a person who the Crown asserts is Mr Kisacanin following closely behind AL. 

24I am satisfied that it is open to the jury to conclude that Mr Kisacanin was involved in at least the pursuit of Mr Padovan for the purpose of continuing the assault upon him. If accepted, this would be sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Kisacanin was a party to the affray at Gate 5. There is a case to answer in respect of this count. 

The departure hall riot and murder 

25It is common ground that after the events at Gate 5 came to an end, the 10 Comanchero men proceeded down a corridor and out through some security bi-fold doors at which point they emerged into the departure hall. In the centre of this very large area there were 14 pairs of check-in counters, all in a row. There was a significant space between the back wall of the departure hall and the back of the check-in counters and also between the front of the counters and the front wall and entry/exit doors of the terminal. 

26When the 10 Comanchero men emerged from the bi-fold doors they were met by Messrs Abounader and Potrus. They had the geographical option of proceeding immediately to their right, down some escalators to the arrivals hall and the baggage collection carousels. Four bags had been checked in on the flight. They were in the name of the accused Eken. It would be open to the jury to conclude that this path would have been the one they most likely would have taken in order to retrieve the bags. 

27The Comanchero men did not, however, proceed down the escalators but straight ahead into the space between the back of the check-in counters and the back wall of the terminal. There was a group of five Hells Angels at the time, loitering around 60 to 70 metres away, at around the back of some of the furthest check-in counters. 

28There has been some suggestion in cross-examination that the Comanchero men were simply proceeding to the escalators at the furthest end of the terminal in order to proceed down to the arrivals hall to collect their luggage. This, I take it, is designed to suggest that there was nothing sinister in the Comanchero group of now 12 men proceeding in a direction that would bring them unwittingly into the presence of the loitering 5 Hells Angels. That might be a possibility for the jury to consider. But it would be well open to the jury to consider that the Comanchero group advanced in that direction because it was intended to confront the Hells Angels. In this regard, I note that there is evidence that Mr Hawi was no stranger to arriving on Qantas flights at the Sydney domestic terminal (T3265). Even if none of his companions were familiar with the layout of the terminal, it might seem to the jury to be odd that he would happily walk with them a distance of about 150 metres to the escalators at the furthest end of the terminal rather than going downstairs via the escalators immediately outside the security doors. 

29The events which ensued in the departure hall need only be described briefly. It is uncontroversial that fighting erupted when the two groups came together at the back of the check-in counters. The fighting continued as men moved between the check-in counters to the front of the terminal. There is no dispute that the deceased was the first to strike when the fighting commenced. As the men moved through to the front of the terminal it was necessary for them to negotiate their way between members of the public who were queuing to check-in. Witness descriptions include that bollards used in the queue control system were detached and used as weapons. The fatal assault upon the deceased occurred near the front wall of the terminal. There is evidence that he was struck at least once by the base of a bollard. There is also evidence that he was stabbed a number of times. 

30The Crown referred to evidence from a witness to the events at Gate 5. She was the manager of one of the stores in that area and saw certain aspects of the fighting that occurred in that location. She referred to one of the men's jumper being on the ground and a man picking it up. That man said, ""Is that your jumper? Get up, the cops are coming, let's go, we'll finish it outside"" (T790). The jury may well think that there is some inaccuracy in this evidence, but I understand the Crown to rely upon the latter aspect, ""we'll finish it outside"" as an indication of a desire of the speaker to continue the fighting, but elsewhere. There is security camera footage that is well capable of persuading the jury that the person who subsequently had possession of what was probably Mr Padovan's jumper was Mr Kisacanin. 

31Mr Gordon's submissions in relation to this evidence included that even if the jury were to consider that Mr Kisacanin did have possession of Mr Padovan's jumper, there is no evidence that he was the person who actually picked it up. Somebody else may have picked it up and handed it to him. Therefore, the words uttered, according to the shop manager, could not safely be attributed to him. 

32Mr Gordon also referred to some contradictory evidence that the witness gave. In her evidence in chief she said that she could not describe the person who picked up the jumper (T790.36). In cross-examination she said that it was the man without the shirt (Mr Padovan) who picked up the jumper (T794.20; T800.19). At another stage in cross-examination she said she was not sure who picked it up (T795.50). When I asked her for clarification of this inconsistency, she confirmed that she was not sure (T798.32). 

33Mr Gordon's submission was that the witness should be understood to be asserting that it was the man without the shirt (Mr Padovan) who picked up the garment. That is unlikely to be accepted by the jury. Mr Padovan can be seen on security camera footage leaving Gate 5 without a shirt on and not carrying anything. Mr Kisacanin, on the other hand, is seen to leave Gate 5 with a garment in his hand. It is hardly likely that Mr Padovan picked up his own jumper and then gave it to Mr Kisacanin. 

34The evidence in chief of the witness as to who made the statement that she heard was as follows: 

""Q. And then you heard someone say, ""Is that your jumper, get up, the cops are coming, let's go, we'll finish it outside"", are you able to describe the person who said those words? 
A. No, I didn't see any of them in the face or I don't really remember much of what they were wearing, it just happened as fast as it did and finished as fast as it did. 

Q. Are you able to say, when you heard those words, who these were being said to? 
A. No. 

Q. After you heard those words said, did you see something or hear something? 
A. No. They pretty much - whoever it was picked it up and they just all went into that direction. 

Q. Picked what up? 
A. The jumper. 

Q. Can you describe the person that picked up the black jumper? 
A. I wouldn't be able to, no."" (T790) (Emphasis added) 

35In cross-examination she said that she was not sure who made the statement (T796.8). 

36For the Crown's contention to be made good, the jury would need to be persuaded that the reference to ""whoever it was"", was a reference to whoever made the statement that the witness heard, and that it was this person who picked up the jumper. The alternative inference is that ""whoever it was"" was confined to whoever it was who picked up the jumper. It seems to me that it would be highly unlikely, if not impossible, that the jury could draw one inference in preference to the other. 

37For what is to follow it is necessary to say something more about the layout of the check-in counters. There were 14 booth structures with a counter on each side of the booth and conveyer belts for checked-in luggage on the inner side of each counter. Looking at the terminal from the street, the counters were numbered from right to left (east to west), 1 to 28. Counters 1 to 8 were for business class check-in. They were separated by an aisle from the economy counters which proceeded, from right to left, as counters 9 to 28. When the Comancheros proceeded from the area of the bi-fold doors into the departure hall, the closest counter to them was number 28. 

38The security camera footage displays the Comanchero group proceeding in a straight line, in an easterly direction, along the back of the check-in counters. However, after they had passed two booths (counters 25 to 28), Mr Kisacanin is clearly seen to peel away from the group, run through the gap between counters 24 and 25 and then immediately turn to his left (east). At the same time as he is seen to run in that direction, it would be open to the jury to conclude that the remaining Comanchero group hastened their pace in the direction of the Hells Angels group which was near to the rear of counters 9 to 12. 

39The vision to which I have just referred includes that from which the jury could well conclude that Mr Kisacanin was still in possession of Mr Padovan's jumper. That has two points of significance. I have referred to the Crown's contention that it was Mr Kisacanin who uttered the words back in the vicinity of Gate 5, ""we'll finish it outside"" , an indication of a preparedness to engage in further fighting. That point is very dubious. The second aspect of significance is that a black jumper was found in the subsequent police investigation on the ground in front of counters 12 and 13. After the fighting commenced at the rear of about counters 9 to 12 or so, the participants, as I have earlier noted, moved towards the front of the terminal between counters which were likely those numbered about 9 to17. Various items found on the ground between and in front of those counters support that conclusion. 

40The Crown submission is that it would be open to the jury to conclude that Mr Kisacanin peeled off from the Comanchero group when they were behind counters 24 and 25. He was not fleeing perceived danger, because he immediately turned to his left (east) when he emerged at the front of the counters. This invites the inference that the jury may draw that Mr Kisacanin was simply taking an alternative route to join in an anticipated melee. He was circling around to enter it from a different angle. The garment he carried was later found in front of the check-in counters, in the vicinity of where the brawl behind the counters moved through to. 

41It was submitted for the accused that if the jumper was dropped exactly where it was found, in front of counters 12 and 13, then this was consistent with it having been dropped when Mr Kisacanin was in imminent danger from, and fear of, the fighting men coming through from behind the counters to the front. That is a submission that could be made to the jury but it is not the only conclusion that they could draw. 

42Mr Gordon submitted that the security camera footage indicates that Mr Kisacanin departed from the Comanchero group and proceeded through the check-in counters at the very point in time when the deceased commenced to attack Mr Hawi. Something was said by Mr Abounader at about that time to the effect that the deceased had a gun. Thus, it was submitted, Mr Kisacanin was simply taking action to avoid a dangerous situation. Such a submission could be made to the jury but it is unlikely to be accepted. The Comanchero and Hells Angels groups did not come together until they were in the vicinity of about counters 9 to 12. Mr Kisacanin made his move to the front of counters when the Comanchero group was still about 30 metres away from the Hells Angels and still advancing in their direction. 

43The Crown also referred to the evidence of a witness who, from a position at the back of the terminal, observed the brawl commence behind the counters (T1206ff). She referred to two men approaching the brawl from the other direction, from between the counters. She said that these two men blended in and that they were fighting (T1209 - 1210). The Crown Prosecutor submitted that this was consistent with Mr Kisacanin coming in to join the fight. Mr Gordon submitted that the evidence of this witness as to the two men was consistent with her describing Peter and Anthony Zervas. I am satisfied that it would be open to the jury to conclude that she described those two men separately to her description of the two men to which the Crown referred. 

44Further evidence which the Crown relies upon for the contention that Mr Kisacanin was a participant in the fighting came from a witness who was a Qantas staff member (T945ff). She was working at counter 3. Her attention was caught by the noise of men yelling. She saw "" a rush of men coming through the little gaps between the counters"" which she estimated were counters 13 to 18. She gave evidence of a number of specific incidents that she observed, including a man picking up a bollard and swinging it. She did not see what happened as a result because she looked away in order to press a duress button. She described the man who picked up the bollard as having a ""big build, in a dark grey singlet, tattoos"". Asked to describe the tattoos, she said, ""I was too far away to give any detailed description of his tattoos but there were tattoos on his arms"" (T948.4). Mr Kisacanin does not have tattoos. The Crown contends that this witness was mistaken about that aspect of the description but contends that the description of the man having a big build and a grey singlet is a match for Mr Kisacanin. 

45Mr Gordon submitted that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the man the witness described was Mr Kisacanin because of the inclusion in the description of tattoos. In my view it would be open to the jury to accept that witnesses may be correct about some things whilst being incorrect about others. It would be open to the jury to accept that the witness was correct in describing the clothing of the man, whilst also accepting that there was inaccuracy in the description of him having tattoos, particularly given that many of those involved in the melee in the same vicinity had prominent tattoos. 

46SP gave evidence of Mr Kisacanin with a bollard: 

""Q. Did you see Zoran Kisacanin at all during this time? 
A. Yeah, he was on the right-hand side of me, near the glass doors. 

Q. And did you see him do anything? 
A. No. 

Q. Did you see him touch anything? 
A. I just saw just the hand on a bollard but he didn't pick it up, just more resting on it."" (T2628) 

47In cross-examination by Mr Gordon, SP confirmed that he had given the following answers in a police interview on 24 August 2009: 

""Q402. Okay, you said that you saw Zoran had his hands, Zoran Kisacanin, sorry, had his hands on the bollard but he didn't pick it up? 
A. Yeah. 

Q403. Did you have like a view of Zoran Kisacanin the whole time, were you watching him the whole time? 
A. Downstairs, yeah, I was - we were fairly close."" (T2925-2926) 

48It would be open to the jury to doubt that SP was entirely accurate when he said that he was watching Mr Kisacanin for the ""whole time"", given that SP's evidence was that he observed quite a number of other aspects of the incident. The Crown does, however, rely upon his evidence for confirmation of Mr Kisacanin's involvement with a bollard. Further, as I understand it, the Crown contends that SP cannot be taken to be correct when he said that Mr Kisacanin was ""more just resting on"" a bollard. It could be taken to be rather unlikely that Mr Kisacanin was casually resting on a bollard while mayhem was going on around him. 

49Another witness who observed the fighting in the departure hall said that she saw a man pick up a bollard and start swinging it violently at people. She said other men also picked up bollards and that she counted five bollards in the air at any one time, being swung and hit at people (T2294). 

50Other evidence relating to the contention that Mr Kisacanin had a bollard is within the security camera footage and the footage taken by a tourist. Security camera 404 was focused to the north down the aisle between the business and economy check-in counters. In a very short segment of the footage from that camera, Mr Kisacanin is seen to come into vision, from the area where the fighting occurred, and put a bollard down. This is in an area in which there were no bollards and so it would be open to the jury to conclude that Mr Kisacanin carried the bollard from the area where the fighting was occurring and put it down at a point when he felt he had no further need for it. This footage, at least, may further persuade the jury that SP's evidence referred to above cannot be taken to be entirely correct. It may also be taken by the jury as tending to confirm Mr Kisacanin's use of a bollard in the course of the fighting. 

51The video footage taken by the tourist (T2346ff) was very short, some 16 seconds. The tourist was standing quite a distance away from the action, just to the west of counter 28. Four hundred and five still images have been produced from the footage (Exhibit GB). The Crown Prosecutor referred me to images that commence 2.36 seconds into the recording and submitted that there is depicted a man with a white cap, a singlet and black shoes, all items that were worn by Mr Kisacanin. It was submitted that it can be discerned that this man was holding a bollard. Whether that is so is a matter for the jury but I am satisfied that the submission is available to the Crown to make. 

52My own perception of the images (from 1.88 seconds to 2.88 seconds) is that they depict a bollard being picked up by a man who is very difficult to make out, probably because he is wearing dark clothing. That man then moves towards the front of the terminal, very closely followed by the man, who the Crown asserts is Mr Kisacanin, who is also carrying a bollard. This person comes into view with the bollard already held, at an angle that is close to horizontal. 

53Mr Gordon submitted that the man depicted is in fact Mr Padovan. He, like Mr Kisacanin, wore a white baseball cap and dark shorts. Mr Padovan, however, had no shirt on and wore lighter coloured shoes, whereas Mr Kisacanin wore a grey singlet and had dark shoes. It seems to me that it would be open to the jury to make an assessment as to the clothing and shoes worn by the person in the still images and it is possible that they could conclude that the appearance is more likely to be Mr Kisacanin than Mr Padovan. 

54To summarise, the Crown contends that the foregoing evidence is capable of persuading the jury that Mr Kisacanin went into the area where the fighting occurred and that he used a bollard in the course of the fighting. I am satisfied that such a case is available to be made and is open to the jury to accept. Whether the jury might accept it, of course, is a completely different matter about which I express no view. 

Other submissions on behalf of the Accused Kisacanin 

55I have interspersed the foregoing discussion of the evidence upon which the Crown relies with references to submissions which were made on behalf of the accused. Other submissions were made that I have not referred to. It is a sufficient response to those submissions to say that, like many of those I have referred to, they represent alternative arguments that may be put to the jury as to the inferences that should, or should not, be drawn. Some of them are concerned with highlighting what evidence is not before the jury; for example, there is no eyewitness evidence to the effect that a man wearing a distinctive white baseball hat was seen to be doing anything in the course of the fighting in the departure hall. However, on a consideration of whether there is a case to go to the jury, attention must be given, not to what evidence is absent, but on what evidence is present. None of the submissions to which I have not made specific reference have the effect that the conclusions for which the Crown contends are not available to the jury at all. 

56Despite what I have just said, there is one further submission that warrants a response. The Crown Prosecutor made reference in her submissions to evidence that upon his arrest at 2.08pm on 22 March 2009, Mr Kisacanin did not have a wallet or a driver's licence and only $5.00 in cash and a telephone. This supported the Crown's contention that he ""very hastily heeded the call ... to go to the airport"" (T3681.32). Mr Gordon asked, rhetorically, ""so what?"" (T3700.23). He referred to the evidence of SP who had confirmed that there had been conversation in the car on the way to the airport to the effect that Mr Kisacanin was intending to fly to Brisbane that afternoon. Mr Kisacanin was working in Queensland at the time. It was submitted that he had a free lift to the airport; he had no need for his driver's licence; and he had no need for any money. 

57Mr Gordon referred to evidence that was anticipated would be given in the defence case. It is not appropriate to consider that on the present application. On the evidence that is presently available, it would be open to the jury to reject such a contention. They could well ask themselves why a person intending to catch an interstate flight would carry with them very little money, and no luggage, ticketing documents or any form of identification. All this does is enhance the prospect of the jury drawing the conclusions that (a) Mr Kisacanin did attend the airport in haste, and (b) he fled the airport because of consciousness of guilt. 

Murder 

58The Crown case in respect of Mr Kisacanin on the count of murder is that he was either a party to an agreement to inflict grievous bodily harm upon someone in the Hells Angels group, or that he was a party to an agreement to assault someone in the Hells Angels group with the contemplation that a possible incident of that occurrence was that grievous bodily harm would be inflicted by one of the parties to such agreement. Mr Gordon has submitted that there is no evidence of this. 

59The short answer is that upon the evidence I have reviewed above, and upon consideration of all of the circumstances that are capable of being regarded by the jury as having been established, there is a case of murder to go to the jury on each of the bases for which the Crown contends. 

60There is evidence from which the jury could conclude that Mr Kisacanin was actually involved in the fighting that occurred in the departure hall. There is evidence from which the jury could conclude that at least by the time he entered the departure hall, Mr Kisacanin must have realised that he, and/or his fellow Comancheros, were about to embark upon an assault of considerable ferocity. From his perspective, he had just seen a violent assault upon one Hells Angels member in the vicinity of Gate 5. He was in the vicinity when extremely violent threats were uttered by the president of his club at the conclusion of events near Gate 5. The jury could conclude that when he was part of the group of Comancheros who were advancing through the departure hall towards the Hells Angels group, he was well aware that his group outnumbered the opposition by 12 to 5. It is open to the jury to conclude that there was, by at least this stage, a tacit agreement to which Mr Kisacanin was a party that Hells Angels would be assaulted. It would also be open to the jury to conclude that Mr Kisacanin was a party to an agreement that grievous bodily harm would be inflicted. The simultaneous actions of persons can sometimes be the measure of whether they share a common purpose. It would be open to the jury to draw conclusions based upon the actions of Mr Kisacanin and the members of his group, particularly by their use of heavy metal bollards as weapons. The jury could well conclude that the infliction of grievous bodily harm was contemplated, and perhaps intended. 

61In my view, there is sufficient evidence for the case of murder as propounded by the Crown to go to the jury. 

Riot 

62Mr Gordon submitted that the Crown cannot establish the offence of riot. In his submission, it is necessary for the Crown to be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that all 12 of the Comancheros used unlawful violence for a common purpose. Attention was invited to Anderson v Attorney-General for New South Wales (1987) 10 NSWLR 198. 

63Anderson was a case in which the Court of Appeal was concerned with an application for a declaration that an indictment was bad in law. Thirty-one accused had been jointly indicted for a single count of riot in respect of events which occurred one Easter at the Bathurst bike races. It was alleged that a ""riotous assembly"" took place between 8.07pm on 6 April and 4.30am on 7 April 1985. The offence alleged against each accused occurred at different times during that period and the location where the offence was alleged to have occurred varied from person to person. Some accused were removed, by having been arrested, before other accused were said to have become involved. 

64The issue raised for consideration was whether it was permissible to jointly charge the accused in a single count, when participation in the alleged riot took place at varying times and places. This called for an examination of the elements of the common law offence. McHugh JA referred to authorities going back centuries and concluded (at 210) that the elements were as set out in Field v Metropolitan Police Receiver [1907] 2 KB 853 at 860: 

""(1) Number of persons, three at least; (2) common purpose; (3) execution or inception of the common purpose; (4) an intent to help one another by force if necessary against any person who may oppose them in the execution of their common purpose; (5) force of violence not merely used in demolishing, but displayed in such manner as to alarm at least one person of reasonable firmness and courage."" 

65Mr Gordon submitted that it was the prosecution case that there was one purpose that was common to the Comancheros and another purpose that was common to the Hells Angels. He submitted that there could be no common purpose shared between the members of the two groups. He focused upon the element numbered four in the extract above, about which McHugh JA also said (at 210F): 

""Accordingly, the authorities strongly support the proposition that it is an essential element in the offence of riot that each of the participants had the intention to help each other, by force if necessary, against any person who might oppose them in the execution of their common purpose. It necessarily follows that, if a number of persons are charged with the one offence of riot, they must have each had both a common purpose and an intention to help each other, by force if necessary, against any person who might oppose them in execution of that common purpose."" 

66The Crown Prosecutor responded by reminding me of the position stated in her opening address (T83). In referring to the count of riot with which Mr Padovan is charged, she said that it was unnecessary for him to have been on the same side as the Comancheros for there to be a common purpose. The common purpose alleged by the Crown was ""for them to fight each other"". She also informed the jury that if they were not satisfied that Mr Padovan ""was in that common purpose with the Comancheros"", then there was the alternative count of affray to consider. The Crown alleges that the Comanchero accused, including Mr Kisacanin, were parties to that same common purpose. I understand this to mean that the common purpose alleged to have been shared by all of the Comanchero and Hells Angels members who were present at the airport was ""to fight each other"". 

67The Crown Prosecutor submitted that s 93B did not require there to be a common purpose against a mutual enemy. Anderson predated the creation of the statutory offence and was only concerned with the now abolished common law offence. In a judgment I gave on 18 August 2011 ( R v Hawi & ors (No 18 )) on an application by the Crown to amend the indictment, I referred to the history of s 93B which was enacted in 1988, subsequent to the decision in Anderson . There I observed that the section corresponds with an almost identically worded statutory expression of the offence of riot enacted in the United Kingdom in 1986. On that occasion, Mr Gordon handed up a copy of an extract from Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence & Practice , (2000), Sweet & Maxwell. The first page of the extract (p 2383) includes the following cautionary note after reference is made to the 1986 enactment and corresponding abolition of the common law offence: 

""In view of the wholesale abolition of the old law ... it is submitted, apart from one or two instances where words or expressions have plainly been taken from earlier legislation, there is no justification for referring to authorities on the old law: judges should direct their attention to the wording of the Act."" 

68Another point raised by Mr Gordon in written submissions was that the evidence must be capable of establishing that the accused ""in fact used unlawful violence for the common purpose"". That is to say, threatening unlawful violence was insufficient; there must be evidence of the use of such violence. The Crown has accepted the validity of this point and it was in this respect that it sought, and was granted, leave to amend the indictment. 

69I am not persuaded that it is inappropriate for the Crown to particularise the common purpose as it has. It is an agreed fact that there was mutuality in the hostility between members of the two clubs. It is open to the jury to conclude that there was also mutuality in a desire to engage in fighting with each other. There is nothing in the terms of s 93B that requires that the common purpose be directed at ""a mutual enemy"". 

70There is a case to go to the jury on the alternative count of riot. 

Conclusion 

71The submission that there is no case to answer in respect of each of the counts to which Mr Kisacanin has pleaded not guilty is rejected.

		14 February 2012",2011-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757649,R v Hawi & ors (No 23) [2011] NSWSC 1669,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Earlier in the trial it was indicated by the representatives of the accused Hawi that there was an intention to lead tendency evidence in respect of the deceased, Mr Anthony Zervas. A tendency notice dated 20 May 2011 has been served in relation to that proposal. 

2I first heard submissions on this issue on 15 August 2011 (T3658ff). Ultimately it was determined that it was not appropriate to conclude my consideration of the issue until Mr Hawi had given evidence in his own case. 

3Mr Hawi gave evidence over the course of 22 and 23 August 2011. Further submissions were then made by the parties on this question of tendency evidence. I indicated that I proposed to allow one part of the evidence, but not another part. To avoid inconvenience to the jury, the Court then resumed with the jury in order to hear the evidence that I was prepared to allow. Once that occurred, I then took the opportunity to provide reasons for my ruling. I now amplify my reasoning in this revised judgment. 

4I will first outline the nature of the evidence in question. It takes two forms. First, there is the evidence of Sergeant Matthew Fotopoulos set out in the statement made by him on 31 March 2009 concerning an event which occurred at his home on 20 March 2009. Secondly, there is the deceased's criminal history. 

The evidence of Sergeant Fotopoulos 

5Sergeant Fotopoulos' evidence, to paraphrase and summarise, is that two days prior to the incident at the airport there was an unannounced calling by Anthony Zervas and a companion at the home unit complex at which Sergeant Fotopoulos lived. Mr Zervas was, apparently, trying to make contact with the occupant of another unit in the complex but without success. The behaviour of the two men was such that they were creating a nuisance. Sergeant Fotopoulos went to the front door of the complex and spoke to them. This resulted in Mr Zervas attacking him with a knife and cutting or stabbing him. There were two separate attacks a short period apart. Following the second attack, Sergeant Fotopoulos was able to repel Mr Zervas and endeavoured to close the front security door of the complex. Mr Zervas was undeterred and put his foot in the door. Ultimately Sergeant Fotopoulos succeeded in having Mr Zervas remove his foot from the door. Mr Zervas then proceeded to kick the lower glass door panel causing it to break. Shortly after that Mr Zervas and his companion left. 

6The incident in the departure hall on 22 March 2009 included a group of 12 Comancheros coming into contact with a group of 5 Hells Angels behind the check-in counters. As the two groups came together it is common ground that Anthony Zervas initiated an attack upon Mr Hawi by attempting to stab him with a pair of scissors. Mr Hawi blocked that attack and suffered, he says, a wound to his arm and some injury to his eye. It is from that point that the Crown and the defence cases take on a different complexion. 

7According to the Crown case, as opened to the jury, Anthony Zervas was immediately chased by Comancheros from the back of the check-in counters to the front of them as fighting erupted (T65.13). The Crown Prosecutor also referred to the Crown case being that the fighting group moved through the check-in counters to the front of the terminal where separate fights took place, one of which involved the deceased. Mr Zervas was on the ground and was there fatally assaulted (T66). 

8This is to be contrasted with the evidence given by Mr Hawi which was to the following effect (T3790ff). As the two groups neared each other behind the check-in counters, he heard someone in his group call out, ""he's got a gun"" . Mr Hawi said that he ran for his life. He turned and saw that he was being chased by Anthony Zervas who swung at him. Mr Hawi blocked that swing with his hand and suffered a cut. He said that the swing occurred as he was heading through the check-in counters towards the front of them. He also said that as he was going in that direction, he was fighting off both Anthony Zervas and Peter Zervas. 

9Mr Hawi said that when he got to the front of the check-in counters, Anthony Zervas dropped his weapon. Mr Hawi did not know where Anthony Zervas went. Mr Hawi then went on to say that later, and towards the front of the terminal, he was attacked again by Anthony Zervas with another weapon, with some assistance apparently from Elias Khoury, and in the course of this second attack by Anthony Zervas, he suffered a cut on his tricep and shoulder. 

10Those competing cases for the Crown and for Mr Hawi set the context for assessing whether the evidence of Sergeant Fotopoulos could have significant probative value. The facts in issue are whether Anthony Zervas was pursued through the check-in counters and assaulted and killed near the front of the terminal, as opposed to whether after his initial attack upon Mr Hawi, he continued his attack through the counters and then, after a short period during which they were apart, he returned and attacked Mr Hawi a second time with another sharp instrument. 

11According to written submissions by counsel for Mr Hawi, the evidence of Sergeant Fotopoulos was said to demonstrate a number of tendencies. 


(a) Be armed in company 
(b) Be armed in company in public areas 
(c) Have a weapon secreted to avoid detection of the weapon 
(d) Behave in an aggressive manner 
(e) Behave unexpectedly 
(f) Behave violently 
(g) Use violence in a public place 
(h) Use a weapon in a lunging motion 
(i) Use the right hand when using the weapon 
(j) Swinging the weapon with the right hand and aiming it at the head of the person attacked 
(k) Swing the weapon a second time at the head of the person attacked 
(l) Be affected by drugs at the time of launching an attack 
(m) Continue the assault until there is an intervening cause breaking the assault. 

12It was submitted on behalf of Mr Hawi, in effect, that the evidence was ""vital and important"" in that it would establish, or have the potential to establish, a tendency of the deceased to behave irrationally and violently and to be persistent with such behaviour. 

13Submissions were made on behalf of other accused supporting the admission of the evidence. Submissions were made by Mr Stratton SC for the accused Menzies, and Mr Trevallion for the accused Abounader, which included that the evidence of Sergeant Fotopoulos would provide the jury with an explanation for injuries apparent from the body of the deceased that are not alleged to have been sustained in the course of the events at the airport. I note, however, that there is no suggestion that any other wounds or injuries on Anthony Zervas' body were sustained on 22 March 2009. For that reason, the cause of those other injuries is not a ""fact in issue"". It is unnecessary for there to be an explanation for them. 

14Other submissions were made by defence counsel, including by Mr Driels for the accused Potrus. He submitted that the conduct of Anthony Zervas on 20 March 2009 could be used to show that the actions attributed to him on 22 March 2009 had nothing to do with any alleged pre-emptive strike by the Comancheros upon the Hells Angels but were the conduct of an irrational man prepared to behave violently and to kill. However, given that there is no suggestion that the presence of Anthony Zervas was known to the Comancheros until some time after they were proceeding east across the rear of the check-in area, anything Anthony Zervas did could have no bearing on whether the Comancheros approached already with a mind to assault the Hells Angels. 

15If the Comancheros were already parties to a joint criminal enterprise to assault the Hells Angels prior to being aware that Anthony Zervas was present, the evidence would not be relevant for the reason advance by Mr Driels. If they reached an agreement to participate in such an enterprise virtually spontaneously upon coming into contact with the Hells Angels, then the relatively immediate actions by Mr Zervas would have no bearing upon that issue either and so I cannot see that the evidence would be relevant upon this basis. 

16The Crown objected to the evidence. The Crown Prosecutor referred to a number of significant facts in issue in relation to events which are said to have occurred in the departure hall of the terminal on 22 March 2009 and, as I understood it, indicated that there was only one of a significant number of facts in issue which this tendency evidence could possibly affect. Therefore, the evidence did not have significant probative value. 

The relevant law 

17The evidence in question was sought to be led pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995, which is in the following terms: 

97 The tendency rule 

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and 

(b the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party. 

18It is necessary to identify the facts in issue, the probability of the existence of which is said to be affected by the evidence under consideration: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) 156 A Crim R 308, per Simpson J at [34]. Having done so, it is then necessary to consider whether the evidence in question has ""significant probative value"". The actual probative value of the evidence is a matter for the jury. The question I have to determine is whether it is capable of having that degree of probative value. This involves an assessment of the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the probability of the existence of the facts that are in issue. As to these matters, see Fletcher , per Simpson J at [33]. 

19The adjective ""significant"" has been held to mean ""important"" or ""of consequence"": R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459. The requirement is that the evidence is more than merely relevant, but it is not necessary that it have a ""substantial"" degree of relevance: Lockyer at 458. See also R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356 at 361; R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 709; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at 370. 

Consideration 

20There is a marked difference between the cases for the Crown and Mr Hawi on the question of what Anthony Zervas did, or what happened to him, following the initial attack by him upon Mr Hawi. According to Mr Hawi, Anthony Zervas persisted in his attack upon Mr Hawi. There was not just the initial assault with a weapon, which is not in issue, but that attack was sustained and then there was a second and separate assault with another weapon. It seems to me that evidence of similar persistent conduct of Anthony Zervas on 20 March 2009 has the potential to have significant probative value, depending upon the view the jury took of it. It could be of importance in the resolution of a significant fact in issue. For these reasons, I held that the evidence of Sergeant Fotopoulos was admissible. 

21I am not persuaded that the evidence is capable of establishing each and every one of the tendencies that are set out in paragraph 7 of the written submissions of counsel for the accused Hawi. I am, however, satisfied that the evidence is capable of establishing that Anthony Zervas had a tendency to engage in, and persist with, violent conduct with the use of a weapon. Of course, whether the jury accept that to be the case is another matter. But because I am satisfied that such a conclusion is available, and that it could have importance in the resolution of the fact in issue I have referred to, the evidence does have significant probative value. 

Anthony Zervas' criminal history 

22The second category of evidence was the deceased's criminal history. It contains multiple entries for offences of violence, but they are, relatively speaking, of a minor nature and the convictions themselves say nothing about the conduct that underlay them. The Crown has provided a very short summary of the facts relating to those matters. It cannot be said that any significant similarities can be drawn between any of those matters and the conduct of Anthony Zervas on 20 March or 22 March 2009 (on any view of that conduct). In the main, they are assaults of a domestic nature. My view is that there could be no significant probative value in relation to them. 

Conclusion 

23It was for the foregoing reasons that I held that the evidence of Sergeant Fotopoulos was admissible while the evidence of the deceased's prior convictions was not admissible.

		14 February 2012",2011-08-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757651,Turner v R [2011] NSWCCA 189,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : When a court sentences a person to imprisonment it exercises an important, but invasive, governmental power to deprive the person of his or her liberty. Because it is a judicial act, reasons must be given. The reasons, together with the sentence, constitute a judgment: the practice of referring to the reasons as ""remarks on sentence"" undermines their constitutional significance. The historical usage, which arose in different circumstances but remains commonplace, may need to be reconsidered. To the extent that a sentence involves an element of retribution and public deterrence of future criminal behaviour, the reasons given in the judgment are of central importance to the exercise of power. 

2As appears from the extracts from the judgment of the sentencing judge, Payne DCJ, set out by Simpson J below, her Honour placed significant weight on the fact that the offender acted ""deliberately and with purpose"". She referred to the submission that the conduct was ""not a matter of personal choice, the addiction arising from an event clearly that the prisoner was not responsible for and which ended his life or the way he could lead his life as he had previously done"": Judgment, p 10. The submission also noted that the medication to which he had become addicted was prescribed for him. Her Honour expressed difficulty with the submission because ""at certain points he must have had a choice"". She also relied upon the reasoning in Bichar v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 1 for the proposition that ""in any event self medication by the use of prohibited drugs to overcome psychological or physical trauma is not a mitigating factor"". 

3The language of free choice invokes the fundamental principle that, so far as the individual is concerned, punishment is a function of moral responsibility. To the extent that freedom of choice is restricted, other considerations being equal, a lesser penalty is indicated: see cases referred to by Simpson J, together with R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 and Courtney v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]. However, that is not the only basis upon which severity of punishment should be tempered in such a case. The public expectation of retribution, as discussed by McHugh in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [46], and general deterrence may also be satisfied by a lesser sentence in respect of a person suffering a mental illness or disability relevant to the offending. 

4As the sentencing judge recognised, the offender suffered from an addiction to opioid drugs which limited his degree of moral responsibility. Her Honour appears to have accepted the psychiatric evidence of Dr Ellis that his condition significantly impaired his ""ability to control impulses and marshal his emotional response to situations"". However, she failed to give proper weight to the mitigating effect of his addiction, which was not in any sense related to use of illicit drugs. 

5At some stage, it may be necessary to give closer attention to the basis on which it is said that addiction to illegal drugs is not generally a ""mitigating"" factor in relation to offending. For example, to recognise the medical explanations of addiction is not to condone the use of illegal drugs. However, that question does not arise in this case: there can be no doubt that addiction to prescription drugs, albeit that they may properly be described as ""illicit"" in circumstances in which they are not appropriately prescribed, falls into a different category. While there is usually an assumption that addiction to illegal drugs commenced with unlawful activity resulting from personal choice, the same cannot be said of the offender's addiction in the present case. His circumstances should evoke a degree of sympathy which, while not excusing serious criminal misconduct, diminishes the level of his moral responsibility to an extent and the need for a response involving retribution or a significant level of general deterrence. 

For these reasons, as well as those provided by Simpson J, I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J. 

6SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Tamworth on 28 October 2010 following his plea of guilty to a single count of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (committed on 15 March 2010) which, pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum penalty for imprisonment for 20 years. Also taken into account, on a Form 1 pursuant to Part 3 Division 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), was an offence of stealing (committed on 12 March 2010), which (if charged separately) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. 

7Payne DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months, commencing on 15 March 2010 (the date of the applicant's arrest) and expiring on 14 September 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, expiring on 14 December 2012. 

The facts 

8The armed robbery offence is a very serious one. In order to put it in context, it is necessary to set out some chronology. 

9The applicant (in circumstances that will be more fully recounted when I come to deal with his personal circumstances) was, in early 2010, somewhat itinerant. He arrived in the town of Gunnedah and, early in March of that year, took up residence in a local hotel. He was still suffering from the effects of a very serious injury he had sustained in an accident in the Northern Territory in 2003. He had had prescribed for him pain relief medication called a ""Durodesic Patch"". In Gunnedah he obtained (whether from a doctor or a nurse practitioner is not clear) a prescription for a single patch. On 8 March 2010 (a Monday), he presented the prescription to the local pharmacist. The pharmacist was reluctant to fill a prescription for a single patch, because the medication came in packs of five and, he said, he could not sell the remaining patches. After some discussion, he gave the applicant the single patch, and accepted the applicant's assurance that he would obtain a prescription for the remaining four patches on the following Wednesday (10 March). 

10By 10 March the applicant had not returned to the pharmacy with the promised prescription. The pharmacist called on the applicant at the hotel where he was resident. He had with him the box containing the remaining four patches, and the prescription. The applicant told him that he had not returned to the doctor for a prescription. The pharmacist told the applicant that he had to have a prescription, and be paid for the remaining four patches, or he would go to the police. The applicant snatched the box and the prescription from the pharmacist, and ran off, saying that he would take them to the police himself. This constituted the Form 1 offence of stealing. 

11At 12.20 pm on Monday, 15 March 2010, the applicant went to the Emergency Department of the Gunnedah Hospital. After completing some paperwork, he was seen by a triage nurse. He told the nurse that he had ""Staph in the throat"" and other ailments. The triage nurse invited the applicant to have a seat and said that the doctor would see him shortly. The applicant was somewhat agitated, and moved around in the waiting room. He told the nurse that he had chest pain. The nurse approached him, intending to take him into a resuscitation room. The applicant took hold of her arm and forced her into a treatment room that was occupied by a doctor. The applicant produced a needle. He pointed the needle towards the doctor. He said: 

""I have a needle and AIDS. Now I want what's in that cupboard"", 

indicating a cupboard that contained certain drugs. He pushed the nurse towards the cupboard. She told him that she needed a key to open it. The applicant let the nurse go, but stood nearby as she opened the cupboard. The applicant said: 

""I just want to die."" 

12The nurse opened the cupboard and she and the doctor left the treatment room. The applicant removed a quantity of drugs from the cupboard and left the hospital. He had in his possession 230 mg of morphine sulphate, and 2900 mcg of a drug called Fentanyl. This was the armed robbery offence. The ""offensive weapon"" was the syringe. 

13The applicant drove away. At about 5.00 pm his vehicle was stopped by police about three kilometres from Gunnedah. In the vehicle were a number of unopened boxes of morphine and Fentanyl, and a syringe. Also in the vehicle was a length of rope that the applicant had earlier fashioned into a noose. The applicant was arrested and interviewed, and the interview electronically recorded. He indicated that his intention in creating the noose had been to use it to commit suicide. He said: 

""I just thought well, this is the time I came into the world, it may as well be the fucken time I go out ... I don't want to do this any more."" (A 92) 

[15 March was the applicant's birthday.] He said that his intention in taking the syringe into the hospital had been, not to use it as a weapon, but to show the doctor ""how bad it's getting"", and that he had been injecting. He was referring to the aftermath of the accident to which I have already referred, and to which I will return. 

The applicant has remained in custody since the date of his arrest. 

14Also before the sentencing judge was a Victim Impact Statement made by the triage nurse. She wrote of her anxiety working in the Emergency Department, particularly when a patient became angry or frustrated. She spoke of her loss of trust in patients presenting to the Emergency Department and her loss of compassion and empathy. 

15The facts recounted confirm, as indicated above, that, in objective terms, this was a particularly serious instance of a s 97(1) offence. 

The applicant's personal circumstances 

16Evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances was put before the sentencing judge by means of a pre-sentence report, a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Andrew Ellis, and oral evidence of the applicant. A letter written by a woman who lived at the hotel where the applicant had stayed was partly read onto the record. As there is some factual dispute about some aspects of the applicant's personal history, I will deal in some detail with that evidence. 

17The applicant was born in March 1973, and grew up in southeast Queensland. He was therefore 37 years of age at the time of the offences. His childhood appears to have been unremarkable. He had a close bond with his stepfather, but the stepfather left when the applicant was about 21, after separating from the applicant's mother. It was said that his mother's drug consumption was the reason for the separation. 

18The applicant claimed that this event had a significant emotional impact on him, and left him with a strong ""anti-drug attitude"". He thereafter steered away from close relationships, although he did live for about five years (from age 22 to 27) in a de facto relationship. For some years he worked as a carpenter and a heavy machine operator in Brisbane. In Brisbane he incurred his only criminal record which is relatively minor, but does include two entries for possession of dangerous drugs, and one for possession of utensils or pipes (used in drug consumption), and one of stealing. Neither of the drug offences resulted in the recording of a conviction. 

19At about the time of the cessation of the de facto relationship the applicant left Brisbane and travelled to the Northern Territory where he obtained employment on cattle stations. He has lost contact with his family. 

20It was in the Northern Territory, in 2003, that the applicant suffered the serious accident I have mentioned. He was kicked in the face by a bull, and trampled. He suffered a variety of very serious injuries to his face and body, requiring extensive facial reconstruction and other surgery. His injuries included various broken bones. 

21The extent of the applicant's injuries, and the sequelae, are central to the case in mitigation made on behalf of the applicant. Regrettably, the evidence concerning the accident, and the injuries and their aftermath was confined to the applicant's own accounts, to the author of the pre-sentence report, to Dr Ellis, and to the court in his own evidence. No independent medical evidence was provided to the sentencing judge. What follows is therefore to be read as an account of what the applicant himself has reported on various occasions, unconfirmed by objective evidence. It was not challenged. 

22After the completion of surgery, the applicant continued to suffer significant pain, and severe migraines. He continued to be prescribed medication. He was assessed as having 49% loss of overall physical mobility. He has been treated at a Melbourne pain clinic. The applicant told Dr Ellis that, at the time, he became a heavy consumer of alcohol (having previously been an infrequent social drinker). He ceased this use of his own accord. 

23He experienced intrusive recollections of the accident, and severe insomnia; when he slept, he had recurring dreams and would wake in a ""cold sweat"". 

24The applicant reported to Dr Ellis that he became addicted to opioid painkillers. These were drugs that had been prescribed to him. He was unable to withdraw from the drugs, and began to suffer depression. He experienced difficulties finding ""an understanding source of treatment"" for his opiate dependency and emotional pain. He lived for a time in Orange, where he embarked on a relationship, but that failed. In his evidence he said that he had undertaken rehabilitation at a facility in Canowindra, funded by the insurance company responsible for compensation for his injuries. This was ""to get me off all the medications"". He developed a frame of mind in which he blamed the medical profession for his situation. On two occasions during 2009 he admitted himself, as a voluntary patient, to a psychiatric facility. It was while he was living in Orange that the patches were prescribed. 

25In early 2010 he moved to Gunnedah, sometimes living in his car. He became suicidal. He obtained the prescription for the single patch, the effect of which ought to have lasted three days. When he obtained (by stealing) the remaining four patches, he used them on the same day. This was an attempted overdose. It was after that that he went to the hospital to seek help. He reiterated in his evidence that he had taken the syringe to the hospital in order to demonstrate the depths of his emotional agony. 

26Dr Ellis reported that the applicant denied using illicit drugs, and said that he had never entered into formal substance abuse treatment. Both these statements are inconsistent with other evidence before the court. The applicant's Queensland criminal record includes two offences for possession of a dangerous drug, in 1995 and 2000, one accompanied by an offence of possession of relevant utensils. The denial of formal substance abuse treatment may be seen as inconsistent with the evidence he gave in the sentencing proceedings. 

27To the extent that it is necessary to resolve these factual inconsistencies, it is, perhaps, of some significance that neither of the Queensland offences resulted in a recorded conviction. In each case a fine was imposed. However, the present significance of this is that Dr Ellis recorded a denial of the use of illicit drugs. The applicant said in his evidence that the drugs were amphetamine and ""pot"" (marijuana). He said that, in a discussion with Dr Ellis, he (the applicant) had said that he ""did not get into the drugs scene"", and that he did not like ""the drug industry"" (AB 108). 

28Importantly, Dr Ellis reported: 

""At the time of the offence there is significant evidence to suggest that he was suffering from severe symptoms of a major depressive disorder, pain disorder and opioid dependence. 

He describes a pervasively depressed mood with three months of suicidal ideation, and distorted cognitive processes such as attributing blame for his situation on the health profession and a wish to die in a symbolic manner by overdosing on the medication he was addicted to. In addition he was experiencing insomnia, weight loss, poor concentration and apparent intoxication and withdrawal from pain killing opiates, accompanied by intermittent control of his pain. It is likely that his ability to control impulses and marshal his emotional response to situations was significantly, but not totally impaired. It is likely that he was able to determine that his actions were wrong, however his mood state was such that he was not considering the consequences of his actions at the time. This described motive for the behaviour was to obtain sufficient medication in order to complete a suicide. 

The fact that there was an overdose immediately subsequent to the threatening behaviour and theft of the medication, and the finding of a noose in the rear of his car are more objective measures of his depressed mental state at the time."" (AB 57) 

29In this respect the statement of the hotel employee is of significance. She said that, on the Friday prior to the armed robbery, the applicant had approached her and asked if he could talk to her. She told him she was very busy and subsequently forgot about it. She said that, on the following Monday morning, she knocked on the door of his room and asked if he still wanted to speak to her but he told her that he did not. She said that the applicant followed her to the kitchen, and told her that he was taking a lot of the drug called Oxycontin but did not wish to take it any more because it was addictive. She advised against suddenly ceasing the medication without medical supervision, that he should reduce the dose gradually, and discuss it with a doctor. He told her that he could not obtain an appointment to see a doctor and she suggested that he go to the hospital. She then said: 

""[The applicant] went on talking about his medication and then he said, 'I should just get in the car and drive into a brick wall or get a gun and just shoot myself'. He walked out of the room."" 

She described him as ""agitated"". 

30Other than in the passage I have extracted above, Dr Ellis did not make a specific diagnosis. However, under the heading ""Future Recommendations"" he suggested investigation of possible post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and examination of the applicant's medical records ""which are located across the country"" to determine whether he had suffered any brain injury or cognitive impairment in the accident. 

31The applicant gave evidence of his remorse. When asked how he viewed what he had done on the day of the offence he said: 

""Horrifying. I hate it ... I hate it, the fact it happened. There's not a day goes by I don't think of ... the nurse. There's not a day goes by I don't think of the doctor. I've never hurt anybody in my life, ever. On the station I used to do a lot of work with kids who had drug problems and that, and they'd come up to the station and stick to get away from all that stuff you know; teach them everything from shoeing horses to peg testing cattle ..."". (AB 105) 

32The applicant also gave evidence that, while he had been in custody on remand, he had been assigned positions of responsibility in the prison. He has been provided with medication, which has substantially alleviated his insomnia. 





The remarks on sentence 

33Payne DCJ began by recording the facts of the stealing offence. She concluded, correctly, that it was itself a serious offence to which weight must be given in the ultimate sentence for the armed robbery offence. Of the latter offence, she said that it ""displayed a significant degree of objective seriousness"" and referred to ""the very real terror characteristic of armed robbery"". She referred to the Victim Impact Statement. Her Honour dealt with all relevant factors, both aggravating and mitigating, itemised in s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, in a way which is not the subject of criticism. 

34She noted that the plea of guilty had been entered at the earliest opportunity and allowed, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, a reduction of 25% in the sentence she otherwise would have imposed. She accepted the applicant's expressed contrition and remorse as genuine. 

35An important aspect of the sentencing remarks concerns the manner in which her Honour dealt with the evidence of the applicant's psychiatric condition. She quoted extensively from the report of Dr Ellis. She accepted that, at the time of the offences, he was suffering from a mental disorder, but added: 

'It is the position though that this mental state did not prevent him from acting deliberately and with purpose. He went to the hospital, in particular into the treatment room, knowing exactly what he wanted to do what he wanted to achieve. As it turned out, despite the significant amount of opioids or narcotics that he took, he was still able to drive a vehicle at 5.00 pm that afternoon."" 

She followed this with: 

""In my view there should be some limited modification of the requirement for general deterrence in this case: R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267."" 

36She considered a submission that the applicant's addiction was, in the circumstances of the case, a mitigating factor. She quoted a passage from the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346, at [273], and then said: 

""The difficulty is that at certain points he must have had a choice. He had an option to gain treatment, which he in fact did, for his addiction, but despite this found himself leaving a location where he had access to the opiates that he required and in a position where he was in country town in respect of which he had no ties or connection and suffering severe withdrawal. 

As is noted in Bichar [ Bichar v R [2006] NSWCCA 1] in any event self-medication by the use of prohibited drugs to overcome psychological or physical trauma is not a mitigating factor. And further, nor can it be said that the applicant did not make a choice to continue to use the drugs rather than to remain in rehabilitation or seek further rehabilitation. It is the position that he did not start taking this medication as a result of personal choice but over a period of some seven years, or some greater proportion of seven years, he continued to abuse it."" (AB 19) 

37She found special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act justifying departure from the statutory proportions between non-parole period and the head sentence and reduced what would otherwise have been a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months (based on the head sentence) to 2 years and 9 months: approximately 61% of the head sentence. 

38She concluded her remarks by expressing the view that the non-parole period was ""the least possible custodial component in this case given the objective seriousness"". 

The grounds of appeal 

39The grounds of appeal are formulated as follows: 

""1. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the mental state of the applicant as relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 

2. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account as a subjective factor that the applicant's addiction to prescription medication was not a matter of 'personal choice'. 

3. In the circumstances of this case, the sentence was manifestly excessive."" 

Ground 1: mental 'state' 

40Although s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act provides an extensive catalogue of features, both aggravating (s 21A(2)) and mitigating (s 21A(3)), a psychiatric condition ""or mental disorder"" does not feature as a mitigating factor. However, in subs (1) it is provided that that catalogue is in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any ""rule of law"". 

41There is a long history of cases in which it has been held that the mental illness or disability for an offender may be a significant factor in sentencing. I discussed some of these in R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267. I do not propose to restate what I there said. I did not then refer to the decision of this Court in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346, which had been delivered three months earlier. There, Wood CJ at CL stated the general principle as: 

""253. ... Whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap. In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may produce the result that considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors. In every case it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise."" 

In this paragraph, Wood CJ at CL was adopting a statement of Badgery-Parker J in R v Letteri , unreported, NSWCCA, 18 March 1993, which had, in turn, been adopted by Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. 

42Wood CJ at CL went on to explain why this is so. His Honour said: 

""254. The reason for this approach lies in the circumstance that the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing. Moreover, such a condition is inherent and its presence does not depend on any element of choice"". 

43Subsequently, Spigelman CJ also considered the principles, in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255. His Honour said: 

""21. The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercised [sic] has long been accepted ... 

... 

23. To the extent that mental illness explains the offence ... then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law."" 

44His Honour went on to quote the passage from Henry that I have extracted above, and then expressed his agreement with the observations of Malcolm CJ in R v Lauritsen [2000] WASCA 203; 114 A Crim R, as follows: 

48. ... mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assess the level of danger the offender represents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of an imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence."" 

45Spigelman CJ went on to say: 

""25. Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise, than it may other have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal but it: 

' ... specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such.' [R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398, at 400]. 

26. Finally, a custodial sentence may weight more heavily on a mentally ill person and that may be a material consideration in determining the length of sentence to be served ..."" 

46The principles have most recently been reaffirmed in R v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at 177. 

47The difficulty with reliance upon these decisions is that they predate the enactment of Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which took effect from 1 February 2003, and, with respect to the offences to which it applied (of which the present is one) quite radically altered the sentencing process. In a Table to Division 1A are listed a number of offences for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed. Section 54A(2) (part of Division 1A) provides: 

""54A(2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division."" 

It is this provision that created the radical change to sentencing with respect to ""Table"" offences. 

48Essential to the sentencing process in respect of those offences (and those offences only - see R v Georgopolous [2010] NSWCCA 246 at [30] - [32]) is an assessment of where, in the range of objective gravity of offences of its kind, a particular offence under consideration falls: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168; R v Knight ; R v Biuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283; 176 A Crim R 338 at [39]; R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110. 

49The enactment of Part 4 Div 1A prompted, for the first time, this Court to analyse with some particularity those facts and circumstances that are relevant to the assessment of objective gravity (as distinct from other relevant sentencing considerations): see [84] - [89]. One of these is mental illness: [86]. That is so whether the offence under consideration is or is not a ""Table"" offence. 

50That an offender's mental illness is relevant to the assessment of objective gravity does not exclude its use also as a relevant subjective circumstance. The principles stated in the pre-2003 cases remain valid in that respect. Since 2003, however, mental illness has, in respect of Table offences, an additional significance. 

51The solicitor who represented the applicant at sentencing appears to have been clearly aware of the principles. In her submissions she said: 

"" ... there are a number of ways that your Honour can use the evidence of his mental state at the time of the commission of the offence. Your Honour can use that to view the objective seriousness of his act. Your Honour can use that to consider his subjective circumstances as well. 

Your Honour can, and there is plenty of case law to say that this man does not need to be used as a vehicle for general deterrence because of the state of his mental health at the time, before and at the time ... 

... 

And it is there that the Court of Criminal Appeal pronounces the relevance of mental illness in the three ways. The first, of course, it contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way; the offender's moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation; and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced, and they refer to Henry as well ... may render he, the offender in this case, an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence; and moderate that consideration; and a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on him as a mentally ill person ..."". (AB 116) 

52At this point it is appropriate to focus precisely upon what is complained of in ground 1, which has been formulated with some care. The complaint is not that the sentencing judge failed to take into account, in the determination of the sentence, the applicant's ""mental state"". That she clearly did, allowing ""some limited modification of the requirement for general deterrence"". The complaint is that she failed to take the applicant's mental state into account when making her assessment of the objective gravity of the offence, and that that omission resulted in an erroneous, and inflated, assessment of objective gravity. In my opinion, that is correct. 

53Indeed, although her Honour (correctly) said: ""... this was very serious criminal behaviour"", she made no explicit finding of where on the scale of objective gravity the offence fell. Nor, since this was not a ""Table"" offence, was she obliged to do so (see Georgopoulos , supra; R v Khoury [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [67] and following). Indeed, on the authority in Georgopoulos , it may have been an error had she done so. 

54But it does seem to me that it was erroneous to leave the applicant's mental state out of consideration in the assessment of objective gravity. 

55The error complained of in ground 1 is established. That, of course, does not conclude the application. It is also necessary, pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that the applicant establish that some other sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed. I will return to this consideration. 

Ground 2: drug addiction 

56The complaint made under this ground is that the sentencing judge did not take into account the circumstances of the applicant's drug addiction, in particular that she did not recognise that it came about other than by way of personal choice. Indeed, the passages I have cited indicate that her Honour rejected that proposition and considered that the applicant did act as he did from choice. This notion, too, stems from Henry : see [198], in the judgment of Spigelman CJ and [257] (per Wood CJ at CL). 

57Drug addiction does not equate with mental illness, at least where the drugs to which the offender is addicted are illicit drugs: Henry [255] - [259]. In her consideration of the applicant's drug addiction her Honour referred to R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291, R v CJP [2004] NSWCCA 118 and Bichar v R [2006] NSWCCA 1, and on the basis of her reading of those cases, held that the applicant's addiction was not a mitigating feature. Her Honour quoted extensively from Henry , at [273], and it is worth reproducing those passages. In Henry , Wood CJ at CL stated the relevant principles as follows: 

""(a) the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit, even a severe habit, is not an excuse to commit an armed robbery or any similar offence, and of itself is not a matter of mitigation; 

(b) however the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence insofar as it may throw light on matters such as: 

(i) the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning for it: cf R v Bouchard (1996) 84 A Crim R 499 at 501-502 and R v Nolan (VSC Court of Appeal, 2 December 1998, unreported); 

(ii) the existence or non-existence of any alternative reason that may have operated in aggravation of the offence, for example, that it was motivated to fund some other serious criminal venture or to support a campaign of terrorism; 

(iii) the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment, for example, if he or she was in the grips of an extreme state of withdrawal of the kind that may have led to a frank disorder of thought processes or to the act being other than a willed act; 

(c) it may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance, insofar as the origin or extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it, might: 

(i) impact upon the prospects of recidivism / rehabilitation, in which respect it may on occasions prove to be a two-edged sword: eg, R v Lewis (Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 July 1992, unreported); 

(ii) suggest that the addiction was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, for example, where it arose as the result of the medical prescription of potentially addictive drugs following injury, illness, or surgery (cf R v Hodge (Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 November 1993, unreported) and R Talbot [(1992) 34 FCA 100]); or where it occurred at a very young age, or in a person whose mental or intellectual capacity was impaired, so that their ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete; 

(iii) justify special consideration in the case of offenders judged to be at the 'crossroads': R v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212; 5 A Crim R 294."" 

58The principle stated at (c)(ii) is of particular present significance. The applicant's case fell squarely into that principle. It is a case precisely of the kind in the contemplation of Wood CJ at CL as an exception to the general principle that drug dependence does not operate as a mitigating factor. 

59Two of the other cases to which her Honour referred, and on which she based her conclusion that the applicant's drug addiction was not a relevant circumstance concern addiction to illicit drugs. The offender in SY had initially used heroin when a member of the Iranian Army; he ceased that use, but on migration to Australia he began to use cannabis and then heroin. Whealy J (as his Honour then was), with the concurrence of Ipp JA and Howie J, did not accept that what he described as ""the unusual or rare circumstances under discussion"" in principle (c)(ii) of [273] of Henry applied ""other than in the most general way."" 

60In Bichar the drug in question was also heroin. Howie J, with whom Basten JA and Hall J agreed, said: 

""25. There was no evidence in the present case that paragraph (c)(ii) [of [273] of Henry ] applied or that in any other way that applicant's use of heroin was not a matter of personal choice notwithstanding that it might have helped him overcome the effects of his personal experiences or the results of the injury he suffered ... in any event self-medication by the use of prohibited drugs to overcome psychological or physical trauma is not a mitigating factor ... nor can it be said that the applicant did not make a choice to continue to use the drug rather than to remain in rehabilitation ... he had been given numerous opportunities and extensive support to overcome his addiction but had failed to take advantage of them."" (internal references omitted) 

61In CJP the offender had been ""abusing liquor as a form of self-medication for grief and depression"". 

62In my opinion, the sentencing judge was in error in considering that the applicant's drug addiction had any parallels with the addictions in SY and Bichar . His addiction was to drugs that had been legitimately prescribed for very serious pain. 

63In these circumstances, I am also satisfied that the findings made by the sentencing judge that ""at certain points [the applicant] must have had a choice"" and that, over a period of seven years, he continued to abuse the prescribed drug, were unfair. The applicant had sought assistance and had taken what steps were available to him to overcome his addiction, which was not to prohibited drugs but to legal drugs prescribed to enable him to cope with a serious pain condition resulting from injury. There was no evidence that (except on the occasion when he had stolen the patches from the pharmacist, and had taken an overdose) he had ""abused"" the drug. 

64In my opinion this ground of the application ought to succeed. 

Ground 3: manifestly excessive? 

65I am satisfied that, in the circumstances, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and re-sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months. 

66The orders I propose are: 

(i) leave to appeal granted; 

(ii) appeal allowed, sentence imposed in the District Court quashed; and 

(iii) the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months commencing on 15 March 2010 and expiring on 14 September 2013, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months, expiring on 14 December 2011. 

67GARLING J: I agree with Simpson J.

3Counts 1, 4 and 6 alleged offences proscribed by s 24(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (C'th). So far as is presently relevant that section provides that ""A person shall not open an account with a cash dealer in a false name."" The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence is 2 years imprisonment. The sentence imposed for each of the three offences was imprisonment for 6 months commencing on 6 January 2012. 

4Counts 2 and 3 alleged offences proscribed by s 32(2) of the Australian Passports Act 2005 (C'th) . The sub-section simply provides:- 

A person commits an offence if: 

(a) the person uses an Australian travel document in connection with travel or identification; and 

(b) the document was not issued to the person. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years or 1,000 penalty units, or both. 

5A penalty unit is $110. The sentence imposed for each offence was imprisonment for 14 months commencing on 6 January 2011. 

6Count 5 alleged an offence proscribed by s 32(4) of the Australian Passports Act 2005 (C'th) . That sub-section is also expressed in simple terms:- 

(4) A person commits an offence if: 

(a) the person has possession or control of an Australian travel document; and 

(b) the person knows that the document was not issued to the person. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years or 1,000 penalty units, or both. 


7The sentence imposed for the offence was ""a period of non-parole of fourteen months to commence on 6 May 2012 to commence on 6 May 2012 and to conclude on 5 July 2013. I order your release under s 20(b) Crimes Act 1914 (C'th) after 14 months upon entering a recognisance of $1.00 to be of good behaviour for a period of 10 months to conclude on 5 May 2014"". 

8Count 7 alleged an offence proscribed by s 471.1(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (C'th) . So far as is presently relevant, the terms of that section are:- 

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 

(a) the person dishonestly appropriates: 

(i) a mail-receptacle; or 
(ii) an article in the course of post ...; or 
(iii) ... ; and 

(b) the person does so with the intention of permanently depriving another person of the mail-receptacle, article or postal message. 

9The maximum penalty prescribed by that sub-section is 10 years imprisonment. The sentence imposed was imprisonment for 10 months commencing on 6 September 2010. 

10Count 8 alleged an offence proscribed by s 6 of the Crimes (Currency) Act 1981 (C'th) . So far as is presently relevant, that section provides that ""A person shall not make, or begin to make, counterfeit money ..."". The maximum penalty prescribed by the section is 14 years imprisonment. The sentence imposed was imprisonment for 10 months commencing on 6 January 2010. 

11Counts 9 to 13 alleged offences arising under s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900 . So far as is relevant that section provided:- 

Whosoever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years 

12The sentence imposed for each of the five offences was imprisonment for 10 months commencing on 6 July 2009. 

13The offence of failing to appear was the subject of a Court Attendance Notice and is proscribed by s 51 of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW) . The maximum penalty prescribed is the penalty for the offence in respect of which the Applicant failed to appear, not exceeding 3 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $3,300. The applicable imprisonment limit here was 3 years. The sentence imposed was imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 6 January 2009. 

14The effective sentence was thus of 5 years and 4 months commencing on 6 January 2009 and concluding on 5 May 2014, the last 10 months of this period being release on recognisance. (I should add that in stating the sentences imposed for the various offences, I have generally adopted what his Honour clearly intended rather than his formulation of them. That formulation is a matter I consider later in these Reasons.) 

15A number of offences were taken into account. In summary, the Commonwealth offences listed on two s16BA schedules were:- 

(i) On 22 February 2007 operating an account with St George Bank in the false name of Brett Murray. 
(ii) On 18 May 2007 operating an account with Westpac Bank in the false name of Jolyon Fairbairn. 
(iii) On 23 August 2007 operating an account with St George Bank in the false name of James Frances Kennedy. 
(iv) On 12 October 2007 operating an account with St George Bank in the false name of Raymond Lynch. 
(v) On 16 June 2008 operating an account with St George Bank in the false name of Raymond Murray. 
(vi) On 16 April 2008 operating an account with National Australia Bank in the false name of Mark Stephen Godleman. 
(vii) On 15 July 2008 improperly using an Australian Passport in the name of Raymond Murray. 

16The schedule listing the first six of these envisaged they would be taken into account in the sentencing of the Applicant for count 4 and his Honour certified on the document that they were. 

17The schedule listing the seventh of these offences envisaged that it would be taken into account in the sentencing of the Applicant for count 3 and his Honour certified on the document that it was. 

18In summary the offences against New South Wales legislation taken into account and listed on a Form 1 were:- 

Five of obtaining money by deception, viz:- 

(i) On 15 February 2008, $2,500 by purporting to be Mark Godleman; 

(ii) On 16 February 2008, $3,000 by purporting to be Mark Godleman; 

(iii) On 10 March 2008, $2,100 by purporting to be Mark Godleman; 

(iv) On 2 March 2007, $2,006.05 by using a GE Mastercard in the name of Brett Murray; 

(v) On 11 July 2008, $8,500 by obtaining a personal loan from GE Money in the name of Raymond Murray. 

Four of using false instruments, viz 

(v)(a) On 17 June 2008, a Victorian Driver's licence in the name of Raymond Murray in support of a car rental agreement; 

(vi) On 29 August 2007, fraudulent pay advices in the name of Raymond Mason in support of a lease application;

(ix) On 30 to 31 July 2008, having false instruments with intent to use, viz. 57 documents of identity. 

19The Form 1 listing these 10 offences envisaged they would be taken into account in the sentencing of the Applicant for count 9 and his Honour certified on the Form 1 that they were. 

Circumstances of Offending 
20I have set out above the relevant statutory provisions so as to illustrate that, judged by that criteria, offences 1 to 6 committed by the Applicant must be regarded as relatively serious. Although issues of motivation and the connection between instances of offending are relevant, it is not simply a case of seeing how much the Applicant obtained by a series of illegal steps and punishing him for obtaining that money. His offending by, for example, opening a bank account in a false name, and using a passport not issued to him for the purposes of identification also merit punishment. Of course, in the case of offences 7 to 13 much more serious offences than those committed by the Applicant, e.g. involving much larger sums of money, could be committed and accordingly his offences against the applicable provisions are not high in the scale of such offences. By contrast, in terms of objective acts, his offending in the case of some of the earlier offences was as serious as it could be. 

21The circumstances of the Applicant's offending and the charges or offences taken into account to which that offending related were as follows. So far as possible, I have endeavoured to refer to the offences in chronological order.

s 16BA(v) 

(a) On 16 June 2008 the Applicant opened an account with St George bank in the name of Raymond Murray. In support of the Application the Applicant produced a fraudulent Victorian driver's licence in the name of Raymond Murray, an identification card issued by UCLA, and a National Australia Bank visa card. 


Form 1(v)(a) 

(b) On 17 June 2008 the Applicant attended the offices of Ever-Ready Rentals and leased a motor vehicle. In support of his application the Applicant produced a Victorian driver's licence number 092512580 in the name of Raymond Murray. Later this licence was located in the possession of the Applicant. It contained an image of the Applicant. 

Count 3 

(c) On 10 July 2008 the Applicant made application to a GE Money branch in the name of Raymond Murray for a loan in the amount of $8,500. In support of the application he presented a number of fraudulent identity documents, including an Australian passport M3178843 in the name of Raymond Murray but bearing his photograph, and a tenancy agreement. 

Form 1(v) 

(d) This entry on the Form 1 alleges that the Applicant obtained $8,500 from GE Money on 11 July 2008 although the Statement of Facts does not assert actual receipt as distinct from making application. 

s 16BA(vii)(f) Form 1(viii) 

(e) On 15 July 2008 the Applicant made application for a lease in the name of Raymond Murray. In support of the application the Applicant produced Passport M3178843 and a United Kingdom motor vehicle licence 016432331 in the name of Raymond Murray. At the time of the Applicant's arrest he was found in possession of licence number 016432331 which contained an image of the Applicant. (It may that the number of this passport was wrongly referred to in the Statement of Facts.) 

31A group of offences using the name James Franklin were:- 
Count 4 

(a) On 28 July 2008 the Applicant opened an account with St George Bank in the name of James Franklin. In support of the Application the Applicant produced a fraudulent NSW birth certificate and a Dutch International driver's licence;; 

Count 5 

(b) On 30 July 2008 at the time of his arrest, the Applicant was found in possession of an Australian passport in the name of James Franklin and containing an image of the Applicant. The passport was numbered M3179843. Passport M317983 was that of Sophie Godleman and the number in the evidence I infer to be a mistake. 

32Offence 14: Form 1(ix) The circumstances of the breach of bail offence were that following his arrest on 30 July 2008, a substantial number of false documents were found in his possession and he admitted a deal of his offending. On the following day he was granted bail to appear at the Downing Local Court on 16 September 2008. On 15 August police attended at 5 Valley Road, Springwood, the address he had provided. Inspection of the premises revealed that the Applicant had vacated them. On 16 September the Applicant failed to appear. 

33Count 6 On 19 November 2008 the Applicant opened a bank account with St George Bank in the name of Danny D'Cruz. In support of the application he presented a number of documents, including a Belgium International driver's licence and a NSW Birth Certificate. Both documents were found in the Applicant's possession on his arrest, as was Visa card in the name of Danny D'Cruz. 

34Count 7 On 6 January 2009 the Accused was re-arrested. He told police he had been living at a bed-sit located at Randwick. A search of the premises revealed, in addition to several fraudulent Belgium and Dutch international driver's licences each containing a photograph of the Applicant, a large number of mail articles not addressed to him but to persons residing elsewhere, some in close proximity to the Applicant's former address. These items included Immigration applications, bank statements, utility statements, Australian Taxation correspondence including a tax refund cheque addressed to Mr Danny A D'Cruz and a fraudulent NSW Birth Certificate in Mr D'Cruz's name. 

35Count 8 A search of the premises at Randwick and of the Accused's vehicle conducted revealed also some $6,750 in counterfeit Australian bank notes, together with paper, printer and other equipment suitable for the production of such notes. 

36The preparation of the forged or fraudulent documents was effected by the Applicant, often using as raw material documents he had stolen. His offending thus involved a deal of initiative and planning. 

37Apart from the documents which the Applicant had appropriated, the only losses arising from the depredations the subject of the offences for which he was sentenced by Sorby DCJ and the offences taken into account were in an amount of approximately $73,500 suffered by GE Money and loss by those who had entered into rental agreements with the Applicant. 

38At the time of the offences, the Applicant, who was born in February 1973 had no criminal record in New South Wales. However, on 9 November 2005 in the Frankston Magistrates Court in Victoria, the Applicant had pleaded guilty to 10 counts of theft, 9 counts of burglary, 11 counts of obtain property by deception and 13 counts of making a false statement. He had been sentenced to 9 months imprisonment, partially suspended, but with 4 months required to be served. He was granted bail pending an appeal of severity but absconded. Following his failure to appear on 15 February warrants were issued for his arrest, and it seems clear that when released from custody in New South Wales he will have to serve the sentence imposed in Victoria. 

39Tendered on the Applicant's behalf at his sentencing hearing were references from his parents and sister, together with a report from Dr Furst, a psychiatrist. None of these persons was cross-examined. Evidence was given by a Mr Baines, a prison chaplain, and the Applicant. Mr Baines was not cross-examined. 

40The Applicant said that he had been honest in answering Dr Furst's questions. The tenor of his evidence was that he had had a good upbringing and work history until 2005 when he commenced a relationship with a woman ""Tori"". Initially her mother was battling cancer and then died. Her father very quickly took to another woman. Tori was devastated by all this, had a psychological breakdown, indulged in self-mutilation and wanted to commit suicide. The Applicant gave up work in order to help Tori and prevent the suicide. He then felt his arrest in Victoria as a punishment for preventing Tori from committing suicide. He himself became very depressed and ran away (to Sydney) in the belief his problems would disappear. 

41On arrival at Sydney he commenced work. He said that he would work himself to distraction and then return to his accommodation where he would basically sit in a room with a couple of photos of his parents and of Tori and fall apart. Then he formed a relationship with another woman Amy. In due course her family relationship commenced to fall apart. He gave up work in January 2007. His offending thereafter was because he needed money although he said that the counterfeiting had a therapeutic value in a sense of achievement. He said that he bought no equipment to effect this but merely used a basic home computer and printer he already possessed. Prior to any offending he had been involved in making films and in that activity had acquired some skills in making, as props, imitation documents. The stealing of the mail items and the Goldman passport were for the purposes of creating false identities. The funds he obtained were spent on basic needs. 

42He said that during this time he himself became suicidal, going to the edge of a cliff at Coogee but was unable to jump off. 

43When leaving Melbourne he had not told his parents of what he was doing. He returned to see them in July 2008 but did not and was arrested. He returned to Melbourne on Christmas Eve 2008 to speak to his parents for the first time, ""1,102 days"" after his original departure from Melbourne. 

44The Applicant said in evidence that going to prison was the best thing that ever happened to him because it facilitated him seeking the help he needed. He said that he had returned to being the person he was before the events in Victoria in 2005 and there was no risk of his re-offending. He said that he was no longer depressed. 

45The Applicant was cross-examined. He conceded that in July 2008 he had said during an interview that he was remorseful yet had then absconded and continued to offend. The Applicant's evidence included:- 

Q. I put it to you that your conduct back from 2005 through to when you were re-arrested in January 2009 shows a complete lack of insight and remorse into what you had done and that that was truly seen when you attempted to run from police and you were arrested, you were not remorseful were you? 

A. I completely agree with you, it has only been through this 10 month period where I have been able to deal with my depression, get back in touch with my family, get back in touch with God that I've actually becoming to understand what I did, how serious it was what I did and how incredibly sorry I am for doing those things. But certainly at the time I don't think I was in a state of mind where I was able to rationalise that as true remorse, no, but I certainly l do now. (sic). 

46A letter from the Applicant's parents, his father being a former police officer, confirmed that on Christmas Eve 2008 when the Applicant arrived he was in great distress and depression. Mr Krol senior said that he had seen a great change in the Applicant since his incarceration. The Applicant's sister provided a letter to similar effect, confirming also some of the Applicant's account of events involving Tori. 

47Mr Baines gave evidence of a deal of contact with the Applicant, that the Applicant was horrified at what he had done, had been forthcoming about it, had shown concern about, and had made efforts to help, other prisoners who were experiencing difficulties. The witness also said that he believed the Applicant's remorse and contrition were genuine and he would not re-offend 

48In his report Dr Furst observed:- 

Mr Krol described feeling depressed during the period in question, struggled to sleep, felt guilty, hopeless and suicidal on occasions. He found it hard to decide what to do, stopped worked in his bakery job in January 2007 because of the pressure he felt to look after Sophie... 

He told me he had financial difficulties after stopping his work and his motivation in taking out the loans was to obtain enough money to support himself and Sophie, to provide for food and accommodation. There was no suggestion that he was psychotic or unaware of the wrongfulness of his actions 

... (The Applicant) appears to have a tendency to engage in unhealthy, dysfunctional and enmeshed relationships with the expressed intent of ""helping"" women in emotional distress, which have only compounded their problems and his own. It is highly likely that the interpersonal difficulties he has endured over the last 4 years led him to develop a serious depressive condition, stopped him from functioning effectively and ultimately contributed to his offending behaviour. 

... 

Mr Krol is a man who has a solid family background, worked independently and successfully for the majority of his adult life, and has no history of substance abuse. He has made significant efforts to seek the help available to him in custody through the Prison Chaplains, and is likely to learn further skills if he engages in the psychological treatment I have proposed. In my opinion he has very strong prospects of successful rehabilitation and a good prognosis. 

... 

Mr Krol presents as remorseful, took responsibility for his actions, and felt he deserved to be punished. 


49After a very brief reference to the matters to which I have just referred Sorby DCJ remarked that ""... on the basis of Dr Furst's opinion the offenders' mental state at the time of the offending entitled him to some mitigation as to the weight given to general deterrence, but it still must be given considerable weight ..."": 

50His Honour referred also to the offender having provided some assistance to investigating officers and making frank admissions, adding ""I accept that he is contrite and has developed some insight into his behaviour"". Later his Honour referred to Dr Furst's view that the Applicant has strong prospects of successful rehabilitation and a low chance of recidivism, but without going on, as his Honour should have, to make any findings on those matters. His Honour said that he was allowing the Applicant ""a full twenty-five per cent discount"" for his pleas. 

Grounds of Appeal 
51There were originally 17 grounds of appeal that appear to have been drafted by the Applicant. The Crown conceded that Sorby DCJ had erred in a number of respects and counsel who appeared on the hearing pressed only the following grounds:- 

3 The failure by the sentencing judge to set a balance of term (a head sentence) for 13 of the 14 sentences imposed as required by common law and in accordance with the principles set out in the High Court decision in the case of Pearce v The Queen; 

4 Concurrency and accumulation of multiple sentences has been applied contrary to law and accumulation in general is unfounded and excessive; 

6 The setting of a ratio of the overall non-parole period to the overall balance of sentence being contrary to common sense, the evidence and the law; 

11 The failure to find ""special circumstances"" where the evidence discloses material that might amount to ""special circumstances"" and the failure by the sentencing judge to consider the question of ""special circumstances"" generally; 

13 Despite the appellant's exceptional degree of remorse and contrition, no additional discount was considered in sentencing the appellant; 

15 The sentencing judge failed to take into account time to serve in the State of Victoria upon conclusion of matters in New South Wales; 

16 In determining a just and appropriate sentence in sentencing the appellant, the sentencing judge has accorded too much weight in consideration of the elements of general deterrence and of specific deterrence; 

17 As a direct result of a vast number of serious errors of law, in conjunction with an unexplained and extreme deviation from both well-established sentencing principles and the law itself, the sentencing judge has imposed upon the Appellant a sentence that is submitted as being manifestly excessive. 

52The grounds were grouped for the purposes of making submissions and it is convenient to follow a similar course in dealing with them. 

Grounds 3, 6 and 11 
3 The failure by the sentencing judge to set a balance of term (a head sentence) for 13 of the 14 sentences imposed as required by common law and in accordance with the principles set out in the High Court decision in the case of Pearce v The Queen; 

6 The setting of a ratio of the overall non-parole period to the overall balance of sentence being contrary to common sense, the evidence and the law; 

11 The failure to find ""special circumstances"" where the evidence discloses material that might amount to ""special circumstances"" and the failure by the sentencing judge to consider the question of ""special circumstances"" generally; 

53The Crown conceded that Grounds 3 and 6 were made out. The Crown conceded also that there was error in the determination of the non-parole period albeit not in the precise respects asserted in Ground 11. 

54When dealing with the offences I have numbered 1-4, 6-8 and 14, his Honour employed a formula to the effect, ""I sentence you to a period of non-parole of ..."". His Honour made no reference to any balance or longer term in connection with these sentences, nor did he make any reference to a ""fixed term"" or expressly decline to set a non-parole period. 

55When dealing with the offences I have numbered 9 to 13 his Honour said, ""I sentence you to five concurrent terms of imprisonment of ten months to commence on ..."". In the case of these sentences his Honour made no reference to non-parole periods, or any balance or longer term and expressly declined to do so. Nor did he express the sentences as fixed terms. 

56For the offence I have numbered 5 his Honour imposed sentence in the terms quoted in the sixth paragraph of these reasons. 

57At the time the Applicant was sentenced, ss 44 and 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), so far as is relevant, provided:- 

44 Court to set non-parole period 

(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 

(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision). 

(3) The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2) does not invalidate the sentence. 

45 Court may decline to set non-parole period 

(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence (other than an offence set out in the Table to Division 1A of this Part), a court may decline to set a non-parole period for the offence if it appears to the court that it is appropriate to do so: 

(a) because of the nature of the offence to which the sentence relates or the antecedent character of the offender, or 

(b) because of any other penalty previously imposed on the offender, or 

(c) for any other reason that the court considers sufficient. . 

(2) If a court declines to set a non-parole period for a sentence of imprisonment, it must make a record of its reasons for doing so. 

(3) ... 

(4) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence. 

58It is obvious that in sentencing for the New South Wales offences, viz. those the subject of counts 9 to 14, his Honour did not comply with these requirements. He did not set a non-parole period and a balance of term and, if he meant to adopt the course envisaged by s 45 he did not provide reasons as required by s 45(2). Of course, pursuant to s 44(3), failure to comply with s 44 (2) does not invalidate any sentence imposed although it must be noted that s 101A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:- 

A failure to comply with a provision of this Act may be considered by an appeal court in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence. 

59At the time the applicable Commonwealth legislation was contained in the Crimes Act 1914 (C'th) . So far as is presently relevant that Act provided:- 

19AB(1) Subject to subsection (3), where: 

(a) a person is convicted of a federal offence, or of two or more federal offences at the same sitting; and 

(b) a court imposes on the person a federal life sentence, or a federal sentence that exceeds, or federal sentences that, in the aggregate, exceed 3 years; and 

(c) at the time the sentence or sentences are imposed, the person is not already serving or subject to a federal sentence; 

the court must either: 

(d) fix a single non-parole period in respect of that sentence or those sentences; or 

(e) make a recognisance release order. 

(2) ,,, 

(3) Where, but for this subsection, a court would be required by this section to fix a non-parole period, or make a recognizance release order, in respect of a person, the court may decline to do either if, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence or offences concerned and to the antecedents of the person, the court is satisfied that neither is appropriate. 

(4) Where the court decides that neither a non-parole period nor a recognizance release order is appropriate, the court must: 

(a) state its reasons for so deciding; and 

(b) cause the reasons to be entered in the records of the court. 

19AH (1) ... 

(2) A court shall not, for the purposes of subsection (1) be taken to have failed to fix a non-parole period in respect of a sentence or sentences in respect of which it has made a recognisance release order or to have failed to make a recognisance release order in respect of a sentence or sentences in respect of which it has fixed a non-parole period. 

20(1) Where a person is convicted of a Federal offence or Federal offences, the Court before which he or she is convicted may, if it thinks fit:- 

(a) ... 

(b) Sentence the person to imprisonment in respect of the offence or each offence but direct, by order, that the person be released, upon giving security of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) either forthwith or after he or she has served a specified period of imprisonment in respect of that offence or those offences that is calculated in accordance with subsection 19AF(1). 

60By virtue of s 16, a ""recognisance release order"" is defined to be an order made under s 20(1)(b). 

61His Honour did not adhere to the strictures of these Commonwealth statutory provisions either. He did not impose a sentence for each offence (as distinct from a ""non-parole period""). He did not fix a single non-parole period or a recognisance release order in respect of the sentences as required by s 19AB(1) (d) and (e). 

62Turning to Ground 6, the period to be served on recognisance was 10 months pursuant to the sentence imposed for the fifth offence was less than 16% of the total sentence of 5 years and 4 months - an unusually small proportion whether compared with the 75% envisaged in s 44 of the New South Wales Act or the 60-66% commonly fixed for Commonwealth offences or the period fixed by sentencing judges generally when an offender is to be eligible for parole. His Honour gave no reasons for adopting this unusual course beyond saying that he regarded the periods as appropriate. 

63Ground 11 alleges a failure to find ""special circumstances"". The concept arises pursuant to the terms of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . His Honour was asked to make a finding of special circumstances upon the grounds of what were said to be the Applicant's excellent prospects of rehabilitation and that this was his first time in custody. His Honour's reasons contain no reference to the topic. Given the possible significance of a finding of special circumstances and the argument presented to him, his Honour's remarks on sentence should have referred to the issue and they did not. 

64Certainly s 44(2) has no counterpart in the Commonwealth legislation and the period that the Applicant is eligible for parole was fixed by his Honour under that legislation. However, the factors that may inspire a finding of special circumstances are also relevant to the determination of the appropriate proportions of a sentence to be served in custody and to be served when parole (or a recognisance) is available and should have been addressed. 

Grounds 4 and 15 
4 Concurrency and accumulation of multiple sentences has been applied contrary to law and accumulation in general is unfounded and excessive; 

15 The sentencing judge failed to take into account time to serve in the State of Victoria upon conclusion of matters in New South Wales; 

65There can be no doubt that the number and nature of the offences for which the Applicant stood to be sentenced required that there be a degree of both accumulation and concurrency of the sentences imposed - accumulation because the sentence on one offence could not reflect the criminality in the others, concurrency because the simple accumulation of all of the sentences would result in one that was too harsh for the Applicant's criminality looked at in totality. 

66Putting aside the complaint as the ultimate result, one of the Applicant's complaints under ground 4 was that in consequence of grouping sentences made concurrent by offence type rather than by transaction, the result has been to impose excessive sentences for transactions. By way of example the Applicant drew attention to the fact that for counts 13, 2 and 5, the Applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment for a total period of 48 months, including 38 months non-parole when the offences - dishonestly obtaining money in the name of Mark Godleman, by the use of the Godleman passport, which the Appellant still possessed at the time of his arrest, albeit then in the name of Franklin, - were essentially incidents of the one transaction. 

67This argument ignores the fact that the earlier transaction involved 2 offences and the retention of the passport was no part of either. Furthermore, one might readily infer that the passport was kept against the possibility of use in the future. Possession of someone else's passport does not cease to be an offence once it has been improperly used. There remains the potential for misuse in the future. Furthermore, while Sorby DCJ could well have dealt with the matters, transaction by transaction, his Honour would then logically have had to consider accumulating the sentences, transaction by transaction. It does not follow that the Applicant would have been better off. 

68There was nothing inherently erroneous in his Honour's methodology of grouping offences by their type. Whether the result was excessive, is a matter that conveniently can be left until I consider grounds 16 and 17. 

69So far as ground 15 is concerned, the Crown conceded that Sorby DCJ was required to take into account that, upon his release from the sentences his Honour imposed, the Applicant will be obliged to serve further incarceration in Victoria. The principles of totality so require as do the terms of s16B of the Crimes Act 1914 (C'th) . Although his Honour was conscious of the Victorian sentence, his remarks provide no indication that he did take into account as he should have done. The inescapable inference is that he did not. 

70On behalf of the Applicant it was submitted that the Victorian offending shared common elements with that in New South Wales, being of the same nature and influenced by the same mental condition. Indeed the submission went so far as to suggest that, but for the events in Victoria in 2005, no criminal offences would have eventuated in New South Wales. 

71The last proposition is not self evidently true, is not supported by evidence and amounts to no more than speculation. Furthermore, when one has regard to the fact that the Victorian offences were committed in 2005 or earlier and the first of the New South Wales ones in May 2007, it is not sensible to regard them all as but incidents of the one period of criminality. If, contrary to this view, they should be so regarded, appropriate weight should be given to the duration of the extended period of the Applicant's criminality. 

72Some reduction in the sentence otherwise appropriate to the New South Wales offences may have been appropriate in light of the Applicant's future incarceration in Victoria and Sorby DCJ should have directed attention to the issue. However, given the extent to which discretionary judgment is involved in applying the principle of totality, it cannot be said that his Honour would have erred had he made a conscious decision not to reduce the effective sentence he imposed on account of the Victorian sentence. Certainly, any reduction made would not have been great. 

Ground 16 and 17 
16 In determining a just and appropriate sentence in sentencing the appellant, the sentencing judge has accorded too much weight in consideration of the elements of general deterrence and of specific deterrence; 

17 As a direct result of a vast number of serious errors of law, in conjunction with an unexplained and extreme deviation from both well-established sentencing principles and the law itself, the sentencing judge has imposed upon the Appellant a sentence that is submitted as being manifestly excessive. 


73In its written submissions the Crown submitted that the length of the individual periods specified by Sorby DCJ were appropriate as sentences, (although elsewhere submitting that the sentence for count 13 was unduly lenient) but conceded that the errors made by Sorby DCJ made it proper to grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and re-sentence, that adjustment of some of the starting dates was appropriate to give greater concurrency, and a non-parole period should be set at 60% of the head sentence. The Crown submissions said also ""The Respondent concedes that the aggregate head sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge is not a sentence justified by the proper application of the principle of totality"" and ""was not justifiable or warranted according to the relevant circumstances of the offending and offender"". 

74In light of these concessions, counsel for the Applicant did not seek to address the individual grounds, contenting himself with addressing what the Court should do on re-sentence. He did however say that no complaint was made about the overall length of the total sentence. 

75Given the number of errors made by Sorby DCJ, the conclusion is inevitable that this Court must quash his Honour's orders and re-sentence. However, what sentences should be imposed are matters for the Court which is not bound by concessions made by the Crown or Defence counsel. 

76Before turning to the topic of re-sentencing, reference should be made to some other features of the sentencing below. The individual sentences imposed for the offences other than that the subject of count 5 were for periods of 6, 9, 10 and 14 months and the aggregate sentence was for 5 years and 4 months including an effective non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. His Honour said that the Applicant would receive ""a full twenty-five per cent discount"" for his plea. Adding back that discount would suggest that in the determination of the second and third of the periods stated, his Honour must have commenced with pre-discount periods of 13 1/3 and 18 2/3 months, periods that are inherently unlikely. His Honour could certainly have done some rounding, particularly in the case of the full term but he did not say so. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that, despite saying that he proposed to give the Applicant the full benefit of a 25% discount for his plea, his Honour did not do so. 

77Another feature of the sentencing below that bespeaks error is that, although his Honour certified that he had taken into account in the case of counts 3, 4, and 9 the offences on the s 16BA Schedules and the Form 1, he imposed sentences for these offences no different than the sentences imposed for virtually identical offences. Nor did he provide any reasoning for such a result. In fact, particularly in the case of count 9 and the Form 1 offences many of which had no connection with the offences charged and involved different victims, no reasoning could have justified what his Honour did. 

78The next matter to be mentioned falls into a different category. It is clear that Sorby DCJ intended to impose for the offence the subject of count 5 a sentence that included a non-parole period of 14 months followed by a period of 10 months when the Applicant was subject to a recognisance release order, a total period of 24 months. Having regard to the terms of the Commonwealth legislation it may be that his Honour did not effect this intention. In that event, by the combined effect of s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (C'th) and s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act it would have been open to his Honour to re-open the proceedings and by amendment achieve what he intended. His Honour also had implied or inherent power to do so - see the cases cited in R v Green and Quinn [2011] NSWCCA 71 at [21]-[25]. 

79It does not follow that this Court has the same power of correction as distinct from allowing an appeal and it may be - I do not need to decide - that it would not be a proper exercise of power under s 7 of the Criminal Appeal Act to effect such a correction. However, once this Court is seized of an appeal under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6 of that Act empowers it to impose a higher sentence. Normally of course that power would not be exercised in the absence of a Crown appeal but in this case during the course of argument the Court gave notice to counsel for the Applicant that, subject to the other issues in the appeal, it was minded to proceed on the basis that a sentence of 24 months, including a non-parole period of 14 months and a period of 10 months when the Applicant was subject to a recognisance release order, was imposed for count 5, if necessary making whatever order was appropriate to reflect his Honour's intention. Subject of course to the principal arguments in support of the appeal, counsel for the Applicant did not seek to argue that the Court should not do so. Reflection has confirmed my view that the course foreshadowed is one that the Court is free to adopt. (Although I do not need to rely in it, it may be noted that in Okeke v R [2010] NSWCCA 266, in an appeal by an offender this Court felt free to increase individual sentences.) 

80The major difficulty faced by the Applicant in challenging the effective sentence and non-parole period imposed lies in the extent of his offending, both in terms of the number of offences committed and their seriousness judged by the relevant statutory provisions. That difficulty is exacerbated by the fact he chose to commit the offences with which this Court is concerned in the face of the sentences imposed for similar offences in Victoria and bail granted pending an appeal and, in the case of offences the subject of counts 6, 7 and 8, after he had been arrested and then granted bail in New South Wales. This Court has pointed out on innumerable occasions that offending whilst on conditional liberty is a seriously aggravating circumstance. 

81After those events the Applicant can have been in no doubt that his conduct was regarded with grave disfavour by the community. But he continued with it. Thus, subject to what follows, the case is one where the need for specific deterrence was unusually great. Furthermore, this Court has made it clear that in cases of identity fraud, considerable weight should be afforded to considerations of general deterrence - see Stevens v R [2009] NSWCCA 260; (2009) 262 ALR 91 at [1], [6]. 

82It is appropriate that there be some amelioration of the sentences that would otherwise be imposed on account of the Applicant's mental condition at the time. His previous exemplary record to age 32 does tend to confirm that his offending was in consequence of the circumstances and mental state into which he has allowed himself to fall. Clearly he did not adopt obvious and sensible steps to improve his situation and, although the analogy should not be taken too far, there was an element of the mad about his actions, in addition to them being bad. 

83I turn then to consider the individual sentences that, if I am not constrained by the sentence imposed by Sorby DCJ, I would favour. In that connection, account must be taken of two affidavits filed on behalf of the Applicant. One was from his solicitor and attached copies of gaol records. These records and the Applicant's own affidavit show that the Applicant has not been the subject of disciplinary action since he was sentenced, has applied himself to work and has self referred for psychological issues that may arise on his release. The Applicant says that he has derived appreciable benefit from chaplaincy services. He says also that he is in protection. 

84Because all of the sentences for the New South Wales offences are to be accumulated, it is appropriate to make them fixed terms rather than sentences involving non-parole periods and further terms. I make it clear that in the determination of all sentences, I have allowed the Applicant the 25% discount for his pleas that Sorby DCJ thought appropriate. 

85For count 14, failing to answer his bail, a fixed term of 4 months should be imposed. 

86For each of counts 10 to 12, a fixed term of 9 months should be imposed. I do not regard the differences in the amount obtained in these offences as justifying different sentences. As these three offences involved separate transactions, with additional losses to their victim, the sentences should not be completely concurrent. 

87Given in the case of count 9 the offences on the Form 1 had to be taken into account, and, in the case of count 13, the amount involved was significantly more than it was in the case of offences 10 to 12, a fixed term in excess of those for counts 10 to 12 should be imposed. I would fix these at 13 months, i.e. 18 months less 25%, for each of counts 9 and 13. Again, as these offences involved separate transactions, with additional losses to their victim, the sentences should in principle not be completely concurrent with themselves or those imposed for counts 10 to 12. 

88The remaining offences arise under Commonwealth legislation, and accordingly it is not appropriate to talk of fixed terms or non-parole period for individual offences. 

89Offence 7, the stealing of mail articles, was committed while on bail. Against the statutory maximum of 10 years imprisonment, a sentence of less than 9 months would not be appropriate 

90Offence 8 was also committed whilst on bail. Given that there is no evidence that the Applicant sought to put the counterfeit notes into circulation, for this offence also I would impose a sentence of 4 months. 

91The offences the subject of counts 1, 4 and 6 - opening a bank account in a false name - would seem to have been committed as a step towards offences like those the subject of counts 9 to 13. Nevertheless they were offences in their own right and, putting aside the fact that in the case of offences 4 and 6, there has to be taken into account the offences of the s 16BA Schedules, sentences of 4 months for each of these offences is appropriate. In light of the limitations on the use to which the offences on such schedules can be put - see Attorney General's Application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 - and to the fact that the totality of the sentences being imposed are likely to meet the demands of personal deterrence and retribution, in the circumstances I would not increase any of those 4 month periods on account of the offences in the s 16BA Schedules. Had counts 1, 4 and 6 been incidents of more serious offences charged and punished, it may be that a deal of concurrency with such more serious charges would have been appropriate, but the more serious charges here involved unrelated transactions. Prima facie there should be some accumulation of the sentences for counts 1, 4 and 6. 

92Offences 2, 3 and 5 had similarities. Certainly offences 2 and 3 involved improper use of a passport while offence 5 merely involved improper possession. However, it is clear that the Applicant's possession was so, the passport remained available for use in the future in a similar way to the way he had used those, the subjects of counts 2 and 3. Against the statutory maximum of 10 years imprisonment, it is difficult to see how the sentence for each of these offences should have been less than 16 months, reduced by 25% for the Applicant's plea. As I have indicated, judged by the statutory specification of the offence, the Applicant's offending cannot be regarded as other than serious. Again, the mere fact that offences 2, 3 and 5 were of a same or similar nature does not justify complete concurrency. 

93The principle of totality means that the sentences for the 14 offences should not simply be aggregated. On the other hand, one must also recognise that all of the offences involved additional criminality, and in many cases additional victims or loss. Were there not so many sentences to be imposed, there would be much to be said for the view that there should be some degree of accumulation in the case of each sentence. However, simplicity argues for not adopting that course. 

94For each of offences 11 and 12, I favour an accumulation of 4 months on the sentence imposed on count 10. For each of offences 9 and 13 there should be further accumulation to the extent of 5 months. In the interest of simplicity, these results can be achieved by making each pair of sentences concurrent with each other but accumulating them by double the periods stated. 

95Purely on totality grounds, I would make all of the sentences on counts 1, 4 and 6 concurrent with each other. However, the sentences on those counts and on each of counts 14, 7 and 8 should be accumulated on each other and on other sentences. 

96The sentences for each of counts 3 and 5 should be accumulated by 4 months on the sentence imposed on count 2. 

97Shortly stated, the accumulation of imprisonment resulting from the above would be as follows:- 

Count 10 9 months 
Counts 11 and 12 8 months (in total) 
Counts 9 and 13 10 months (in total) 
Count 14 4 months 
Counts 1, 4 and 6 4 months (in total) 
Count 7 9 months 
Count 8 4 months 
Count 2 12 months 
Count 3 4 months 
Count 5 4 months 

98The result is a total sentence of 5 years and 9 months, 5 months longer than that imposed by Sorby DCJ. Subject to one matter, I regard the principle of totality as sufficiently taken into account by the extent of concurrency I have incorporated in the sentences I have proposed but, there being no Crown appeal, nor argument that any sentence should be increased it is preferable that not only the total sentence but also the individual ones not exceed those imposed by Sorby DCJ. Some further concurrency or reduction in sentences is therefore required although it is somewhat arbitrary how this is effected. 

99I expressed a reservation in the early part of the immediately preceding paragraph. In the determination of the periods selected, I did not take into account the impact of the sentence yet to be served in Victoria. Having regard to the further concurrency or reductions referred to in that paragraph, I do not regard any further reduction needed to take account, under the principles of totality, of the Victorian sentence. 

100I would propose to achieve the objectives stated by imposing sentences as indicated in the following table. For ease of comparison I have set out the sentences which I would impose irrespective of those imposed by Sorby DCJ, the sentences I propose in light of what his Honour did and the extent of the accumulation I would propose. The terms indicated are measured in months.

101The result will be sentences totalling 2 years and 7 months for the New South Wales offences and 2 years and 9 months for the Commonwealth offences. 

102I have set out above the terms of s 19AB of the Crimes Act 1924 (C'th). Given its terms the Court is required to fix a single non-parole period in respect of the Commonwealth offences. In the past there has been a common practice of fixing that period in the range of 60 to 66% of the total sentence but the High Court has made clear that that range should not be regarded as a ""norm"" - see Hili and Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [44]; (2010) 85 ALJR 195 - and it is to be determined in light of earlier decisions of the High Court to which reference was made. In short, what is the minimum time that justice requires that the Applicant must serve having regard to all of the circumstances of his offences? 

103In that connection, it is important to not forget that the periods referred to above include periods for New South Wales, as well as for Commonwealth offences and furthermore, that the periods stated for New South Wales offences are what I regard as appropriate fixed term (or non-parole) periods. These are periods which, given that totality has been taken into account, the Applicant should be required to serve in custody. They are not full terms, a portion of which should be served on parole or recognisance. That is not to say that they should be completely disregarded in determining the period during which the Applicant is to be subject to a recognisance, but it is appropriate to recognise that they were not deserving of the same weight as the (full term) sentences for the Commonwealth offences in the selection of an appropriate recognisance period. Perhaps because the matter does not seem to have been the subject of prepared argument in that case, the approach in Cahyahi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 does not completely accord with what I have said. 

104In judging how much of 5 years and 4 months the Applicant should be required to serve, a number of features stand out. One is what would seem to be his much above average prospects of rehabilitation. Operating in the other direction is the extent and duration of his dishonesty and the contumelious nature of his offending following his arrest in, and decamping from, Victoria and later, following his arrest and in breach of his bail in New South Wales. 

105In these circumstances, I am of the view that the period that the Applicant should be required to serve in custody is 4 years and 4 months. I would limit the period that the Applicant is to be subject to a recognisance release order to 1 year. In so concluding, I am conscious of the fact that this 1 year is but 18.75% of his total sentence and this is an unusually low proportion (although it is about 32.5% of the total of the sentences for the Commonwealth offences). However, given the magnitude of the Applicant's offending it would in my view be an affront to the legislative provisions and to the administration of the criminal law if the Applicant served less time in custody than the 4 years and 4 months I propose. In so concluding, neither do I ignore the Applicant's apparently excellent prospects of rehabilitation. However, in the face of what he did, there remain limits as to the weight that can be given to such subjective factors. And, although I do not need to rely on it, his prospects of rehabilitation mean that he should not need an extended period on parole or recognisance. 

106And lest it be thought that the period on recognisance is too small a proportion of the total sentence, I would add the following. In my view the appropriate total sentence is 5 years and 9 months. Constrained by the sentence that Sorby DCJ imposed, I have proposed a reduced period of 5 years and 4 months but the reduction should be effected by reducing the non-parole or recognisance period. Had the sentence been 5 years and 9 months, the ""non-parole"" portion of it, i.e. 4 years and 4 months, would have been 75% - again, I accept, a high proportion but I have stated why I believe the period in custody should not be less. 

107To give effect to these views, I propose that the Court make the following orders:- 

(i) Grant leave to appeal; 

(ii) Allow the appeal; 

(iii) Quash the sentences imposed by Sorby DCJ on 11 February 2010; 

(iv) In respect of count 10, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 9 months commencing on 6 January 2009; 

(v) In respect of each of counts 11 and 12, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 9 months commencing on 6 September 2009; 

(vi) In respect of each of counts 9 and 13, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 10 months commencing on 6 June 2010; 

(vii) For failing to appear, the offence I have numbered 14, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 months commencing on 6 April 2011. 

(viii) In respect of each of counts 1, 4 and 6, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for 4 months commencing on 6 August 2011; 

(ix) In respect of count 7, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 6 October 2011; 

(x) In respect of count 8, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for 4 months commencing on 6 July 2012; 

(xi) In respect of count 2, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 6 November 2012; 

(xii) In respect of each of counts 3 and 5, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 6 May 2013; 

(xiii) Pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (C'th) direct that, upon entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months and providing security in the sum of $1, the Applicant be released after serving imprisonment for the period from 6 August 2011 to 6 May 2013. 

108HOEBEN J: I agree with RS Hulme J and the orders which he proposes.

		26 August 2011",2011-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757655,R v Hawi & ors (No 21) [2011] NSWSC 1667,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Evidence has been given in the trial by Detective Sergeant Bruce Groenewegen that in 2009 the Comanchero Motorcycle Club had a number of rules. They included rule 1, ""Any display of cowardice will not be tolerated"". 

2The cross-examination yesterday of Mr Hawi by the Crown Prosecutor briefly touched upon these rules. The manner in which the accused Abounader was referred to in that context has given rise to Mr Trevallion making an application for the discharge of the jury. 

3The relevant passage of the cross-examination appears at transcript page 3812 at line 11: 

Q. And as Road Captain you knew that Farres Abounader could be relied upon to follow club rules? 
A. Yes, ma'am. 

Q. Such as to not show cowardice? 
A. Yes, ma'am. 

4No objection was taken to those questions or that evidence. The context was that the Crown Prosecutor was pressing Mr Hawi as to whether the position of ""Road Captain"" was one that carried with it any authority within the club. I perceive that from the Crown's point of view it was considered that Mr Hawi was downplaying the significance of that position. Mr Hawi said that it was not an important position (T3811.7) and that the occupant was ""not in any position of authority"" (T3811.22). 

5At the end of the proceedings yesterday afternoon, in the absence of the jury, Mr Trevallion raised a concern about the passage I have quoted above, but indicated a desire to reserve his position so that he could reconsider the matter overnight. The application to discharge the jury was made this morning. 

6It seems to me that the evidence does not advance the situation to any significant extent beyond the evidence that Mr Dunn QC adduced from Mr Hawi in his evidence in chief. To put what follows into context, it should be noted that there is evidence that Mr Abounader was a member of the Comanchero Motorcycle Club. Mr Hawi's evidence in chief included: 

Q. In relation to the rules of the club, we've heard some evidence about the rules of the club; how long have the rules been around to your knowledge? 
A. About 45, 46 years, since the start of the Comancheros. 

Q. And are members expected to obey the club rules? 
A. Yes, sir. 

Q. Reference has been given to a rule to protect the President; are you familiar with that rule? 
A. No, sir. (T3767) (Emphasis added) 

7There was no objection taken to that evidence either. 

8In relation to the third of those questions, it does not appear from my perusal of the transcript that there has been any reference to a rule concerning protection of the president but that is by the by for present purposes. 

9As I said, it seems to me that the evidence adduced in the evidence in chief of Mr Hawi by Mr Dunn can be regarded as being to similar effect as that which was adduced by the Crown Prosecutor in cross-examination. The evidence in chief could be interpreted by the jury as being to the effect that there was an expectation upon all of the members of the Comanchero Motorcycle Club that they would obey the club rules. Those rules included that no cowardice would be shown. To say that the person who occupied the position of Road Captain could also be relied upon, in other words, expected, to obey the club rules is not materially different. It really is a statement of the obvious in any event. Why would the club have rules if there was no expectation that they would be followed? 

10Mr Trevallion raised concerns about the evidence first quoted above leading the jury to tendency reasoning (T3854.1). He also asserted that it ""goes ... to the reputation or character of Mr Abounader"" (T3854.8). He was concerned that it might provide a foundation for the Crown to submit that ""given the reputation or character of Mr Abounader he would be more likely to be involved in the fighting"" (T3854.11). None of these concerns are at all realistic. 

11The application is refused. I will hear Mr Trevallion as to any direction he might ask that I give the jury at a later time.

		14 February 2012",2011-08-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757668,Police v Scott Michael WIDDISON [2011] NSWLC 26,"JUDGMENT 

Remarks on Sentence 

1The offender is charged with the following: 

""(That he) on 17 February 2011 at Corowa in the State of New South Wales did recklessly cause grievous bodily harm to Andrew Vaughan""; contrary to section 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

2A plea of not guilty was entered at the first return date at Corowa Local Court on 23 March 2011, but the matter was never listed for hearing, and Counsel for the offender indicated a plea of guilty on 22 June 2011. In these circumstances, noting the serious nature of the charge I will proceed on the basis that the offender is entitled to the full 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 

Facts 

3As is customary in the Local Court the matter proceeded by way of tender of a Police Fact Sheet to which there was no apparent objection. I will proceed to sentence on the basis that the contents of that Police Fact Sheet are agreed facts. The fact sheet remains with the papers, but I will summarise those facts. 

4On the afternoon of 17 February 2011 the victim, Andrew Vaughan and the offender attended to Newmarket Hotel in Corowa to attend a farewell function for a work colleague. Both men worked at the ""Rivalea"" Piggery at Corowa. After apparently spending some time at the Newmarket Hotel they moved to the Australia Hotel, then the Royal Hotel in Sanger Street, Corowa. Both consumed an amount of alcohol during the course of the evening. 

5At about 10.40pm the victim Vaughan together with a Mr Ross Ovenden left the Royal Hotel and walked up Sanger Street. They sighted the offender outside the Commonwealth Bank walking towards them. The men joined up and an argument ensued. Mr Ovenden placed himself between the two men in an attempt to avoid any physical contact. The offender said, ""I could knock you flat on you arse"". The victim replied, ""I don't want to fight you Scotty"" and walked back towards the Royal Hotel. 

6The offender followed closely behind, and the two of them traded insults. At a point in a driveway outside the Australia Hotel, the offender moved around to the front of the victim. The offender stepped forward towards the victim and with a closed right fist punched the victim, the punch connecting to the left side of the victim's face. The victim immediately fell backwards and his head impacted heavily with the concrete portion of the footpath. A large ""crack"" was heard as the victim's head impacted with the concrete. 

7The victim remained motionless and unconscious and was bleeding heavily from a laceration that was at the base of his skull. The victim was bleeding heavily and made a loud ""snoring"" type noise. The victim vomited a quantity of blood. 

8A 000 call was made and the victim taken to Albury Base Hospital, and later transferred to Royal Melbourne Hospital in a critical condition. 

9A number of scans were taken at the Albury Base Hospital. Tendered to the court on 12 August 2011 was a report by Dr Morokoff, the treating Neurosurgeon. That report sets out that the victim had a Glasgow Coma Score of 3/15, with 15 being normal, at the time the ambulance first attended. A CT Brain scan revealed that there was a small amount of subarachnoid blood, a fracture of the right occipital bone, and a comminuted fracture of the nasal bone. Under the heading ""diagnosis"" the report sets out ""subarachnoid haemorrhage, base of skull fracture, nasal fracture, aspiration in the lung (pneumonia)"". 

10The report from Dr Morokoff goes on to say that the victim was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, where the intracranial pressure imposed on 3 March 2011. He was transferred back to Albury Base Hospital for inpatient rehabilitation. 

11So far as the injuries are concerned, the report of Dr Morokoff is supplemented by a report from Dr Love, the victim's treating General Practitioner in Corowa. That report dated 11 August 2011 recites: 

I have been involved in Mr. Vaughan's care since 21st March 2011 and I had not actually met him prior to his injuries. Initially he had significant problems with his health with physical symptoms of persistent headaches, dizziness and drowsiness. This was associated with significant depression which required treatment. He has improved since this time but he is in no way back to what I would consider his pre-injury state. He is still unfit to work mainly because he has problems of ongoing dizziness and headaches. He was reviewed by the Rehabilitation Unit on 20th July 2011 and at that time he had ongoing problems with his vision and significant co-ordination issues. The advice at that time that he was not presently fit to drive a car. I have since referred him to the Eye Clinic in Albury/Wodonga for him to be further assessed with respect to his suitability for driving. It appears most of his dizziness is related to inner ear pathology which I am sure is a consequence of his significant head injury. 

In summary, while Mr. Vaughan has shown significant improvement since I first met him in March he does have ongoing disabilities and is currently unable to work let alone drive a motor vehicle. 

12Therefore, the injuries sustained were serious, and with the subarachnoid haemorrhage were life-threatening. The victim was in the intensive care unit for some time, and there are ongoing difficulties. 

13The offender was spoken to by police later in the day of the incident and was formally interviewed. He admitted to punching the victim once to the face with a closed fist and told police that the victim, ""fell like a tree"", and he heard a cracking noise. The offender maintained that the victim was annoying him, getting in his face and threatened to punch the victim if he said certain things. The victim repeated the comment and that led to the punch. Mr. Blackman, Counsel for the offender, indicated when specifically asked that he was not relying on provocation from the victim. 

14The offender told police that he had consumed about 20 pots (middies) of beer, he was affected by liquor, but he could remember the events. He told police, ""You never forget something like that"". 

Maximum Penalty 

15The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is a sentence of ten years imprisonment. The table following section 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that for an offence such as this if dealt with on Indictment, there is a standard non-parole period of 4 years. As I am passing sentence in the Local Court the only relevance of the standard non parole period is that it is an indication enough of how seriously the Parliament considers such an offence to be. 

16This is a matter to which the principles enunciated in R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 apply. In that decision Grove J (Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing) said at [35]: 

The result of true construction of the statutory provisions in New South Wales is that, what has been prescribed is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction. In other words, where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. The implication of the argument of the appellant that, in lieu of prescribed maximum penalties exceeding two years imprisonment, a maximum of two years imprisonment for all offences triable summarily in the Local Court has been substituted must be rejected. As must also be rejected the corollary that a sentence of two years imprisonment should be reserved for a 'worst case'. 

17I note that the decision in Doan was affirmed and followed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, sitting a Bench of five in Attorney General's Reference Pursuant to s. 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No. 2 of 2002 (Guideline on Assault Police) (2002) 137 A Crim R 196. 

18In passing I note the decision of R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, which is authority for the proposition that on a plea of guilty if the matter were dealt with on indictment the standard non-parole period is a guidepost to which the court should have reference in passing sentence. 

19Given the nature of the injuries and the fact that the offence carries a standard non-parole period the community would be well justified in inquiring why this matter was not dealt with on indictment. The prosecuting authorities apparently were of the view that the matter could be dealt with by the Local Court. Although ultimately I am passing a sentence that is just within the Local Court's jurisdictional limit, the point from which I started exceeds that limit. The authorities, and indeed the community, must understand that matters such as this if left in the Local Court are subject to the jurisdictional constraints on the Local Court. 

Assessment of the Criminality 

20Before going specifically to assess the criminality, it is important to note that the offence on which I am passing sentence is a ""result"" offence. In McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94, Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL, Simpson J agreeing) said at [37]: 

Malicious wounding is principally a result offence. Generally speaking the seriousness of the offence will significantly depend upon the seriousness of the wounding. That is not to say that the manner in which the wound was inflicted, the reason for the infliction of the wound and the circumstances surrounding the wounding are irrelevant. The same can be said for an offence involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm: the more serious the harm inflicted the more serious the offence: see R v Mitchell and Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [27]. 

21In R v Mitchell and Gallagher (2007) 177 A Crim R 94; [2007] NSWCCA 296, Howie J said inter alia at [27]: 

The nature of the injury caused to the victim will to a very significant degree determine the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. 

22Accordingly, the offender is to be sentenced for the result of that one punch. This matter speaks eloquently of a point I make repeatedly in the Albury Local Court that the act of punching a person to the face is a potentially very dangerous and even potentially lethal act. 

23Care is needed in expressing the assessment of the criminality. The offence was committed by one punch, but the injuries were serious and the victim continues to suffer, and on the medical report from Dr Love I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt will continue to suffer those difficulties for some time. I assess the matter as being towards the lower end of mid-range of objective seriousness of matters of this sort whether finalised in this Court or a higher Court. 

Matters of General Principle 

24There are very significant issues of general deterrence in this matter. I have presided at the Albury Local Court and indeed the Corowa Local Court for over three and a half years. Rarely does a week pass in the area without there being some incident involving drunken violence in the central business district of Albury. Corowa is less than 60 kilometres away. 

25The Court of Criminal Appeal in a number of judgments has held that there are significant issues of general deterrence in matters involving violence on the streets where the offender is young and affected by alcohol or other mind-altering substances. See for example R v Mitchell & Gallagher (2007) 177 A Crim R 94; [2007] NSWCCA 296 at [29]; R v Carroll [2008] NSWCCA 218 per McClellan CJ at CL, Hislop J agreeing, Simpson J dissenting at [21] and McKenna v R [2007] NSWCCA 113 at [2] per McClellan CJ at CL. The cases also address the issue of community concern over such matters. 

26The decisions to which I have referred involve criminality greater than what I am dealing with in the matter presently under consideration, as is to be expected given that the Court of Criminal Appeal was deciding appeals from matters dealt with on Indictment. However, clearly, as a matter of general principle, persons who commit indiscriminate acts of violence resulting in serious injury that produces ongoing sequelae also deserve punishment that includes a significant emphasis upon general deterrence. 

27It is not suggested that the victim in any provoked the offender. In the circumstances of this case I am firmly of the view that the violence was indiscriminate. By consent part of the answer to question 32 of the ERISP conducted with the offender was tendered. On the version of events as set out in the answer there was a verbal exchange between the victim and the offender, but certainly nothing amounting to provocation. 

28In the matter presently under consideration the offender had consumed in the vicinity of 20 middies of beer. That indicates a substantial tolerance to alcohol. Intoxication is not usually a mitigating factor, and this matter is no exception to that general rule. In Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22 McClellan CJ at CL (Price and RA Hulme JJ agreeing) said at [26] and [28]: 

There was evidence before the sentencing judge which clearly indicated that it was probable that the applicant's intake of alcohol was the most significant cause of the applicant's behaviour. Intoxication, whether by alcohol or drugs may explain an offence but will ordinarily not mitigate the penalty save where the intoxication is the result of an addiction and the original addiction did not involve a free choice. An offender cannot expect a reduction in sentence merely because they have committed an offence while intoxicated: R v Rosenberger (1994) 76 A Crim R 1. 
... 
28 When a condition is self-induced it is not generally accepted as mitigating an offence. In these cases an offender is usually regarded as morally responsible for his condition at the time of the offence. Self induced intoxication or addiction at an age of rational choice involves moral culpability for the predictable consequences of that choice. R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 383. 

29Mr Blackman in the course of his very helpful and comprehensive submissions put the principle of parsimony. That principle forms no part of the sentencing law in New South Wales. In the decision of Blundell v R (2008) 70 NSWLR 660; [2008] NSWCCA 63, Simpson J (with Grove J specifically agreeing on this issue) after reviewing a number of authorities on the issue said at [47]: 

I do not read these judgments as containing or endorsing a proposition that mandates that the minimum sentence that reflects the objective and subjective features of a case and satisfies the purposes of sentencing must be that which is imposed. That is inconsistent with the notion of a range of sentences, and the discretions properly open to sentencing judges. I do not accept that ""the principle of parsimony"", at least as, on one construction of DB; DNN , it appears to have been interpreted by Adams J, is part of the sentencing law of NSW. In Kelly v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 357 at [30] Basten JA rejected that construction of the judgment in DB; DNN . Adams J, who, coincidentally, was also a member of that Bench, agreed with Basten JA. 

30The charge to which the offender has pleaded guilty is Recklessly Inflict Grievous Bodily Harm. The fact that the victim suffered significant injuries is not an aggravating feature. Given that the offence is a ""result"" offence, the court uses the extent of the injuries as an important (although not the only) factor in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the criminality involved. See for example Nowak v R [2008] NSWCCA 89. 

Criminal History 

31The offender has never been in trouble with the law before this matter, and accordingly, is substantially assisted by his record. He is to be dealt with as a person of prior good character. 

Victim Impact Statement 

32The Court received a hand-written victim impact statement dated 18 July 2011 from the victim. It sets out the injuries and refers to the same ongoing issues expressed in detail in the report of Dr Love to which I have already referred. I accept that the injuries sustained by the victim have had a significant effect on him. That fact is also evident from the medical material. 

Pre Sentence Report 

33The Pre Sentence Report sets out many of the matters amplified by Mr. Blackman in his plea in mitigation. The offender is a 28-year-old stockman employed at Corowa in New South Wales. The offender and his partner are expecting their first child in September 2011. The report notes that a psychological report was prepared at the recommendation of counsel, but the offender denies having treatment for mental health issues prior to this matter. 

34The report also notes that the offender was well affected by liquor at the time of the commission of the offence. The report notes that the offender has engaged an alcohol and other drugs counsellor at the recommendation of counsel. 

35Significantly, the report notes that the offender made ""little attempt to mitigate the offences"". I accept that this amounts to evidence that I can accept that the offender has genuine remorse for his actions - see for example R v Van Rysewyk [2008] NSWCCA 130. 

36The offender is suitable for a medium/low level of intervention by the Probation and Parole Service. He is not suitable for community service because he declined to sign the necessary documentation due to current employment obligations. In any event, I am firmly of the opinion that community service would be a manifestly inadequate sentence in this matter. 

Psychologist's Report 

37The comprehensive report prepared by Mr Tony Jago of Hume Psychology and Consulting Services of Wangaratta, also establishes that the offender has considerable remorse over the offence for which he appears for sentence. Further, the report notes that in 2007 the offender's then girlfriend was killed in a motor vehicle accident, and the offender is able to extend some empathy to his victim in this matter. 

38According to the report, and I accept, the offender is quite distressed about the results of his actions in the early hours of the morning of 17 February 2011. He has ""sound insight"" into the psychological stressors of the past, particularly the death of his then girlfriend in 2007 and the impact on himself of the offence. 

39As a result of the incident that brings him before the Court the offender has ""developed a range of symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder with associated depression and anxiety"". Not surprisingly, the report indicates that the offender will require on going counselling in order to deal with these ongoing issues. Further, the author of the report opines that, ""some self-regulation skills training would be appropriate"". The report notes that the offender has taken steps to reduce his alcohol consumption. 

40The report concludes that the prognosis for a healthy functioning individual in society is good. I do not understand the author of the report to suggest that there was any psychological issue that contributed to the commission of the offence. 

41I do not mean any disrespect to the author of the report by dealing with the contents so briefly. The essential aspects of the report, and those highlighted in the course of sentencing submissions are summarised. The report was extremely helpful on the issue of remorse, and establishing ""special circumstances"". 

Subjective material and plea in mitigation 

42Counsel tendered a large volume of character references. The references were from Diane Polkinghorne, Ole Donslund Jensen, Alan J Bratt, Sandra Kay, Ann Charleston, Tony & June King, Claire King, and Ken Widdison (the offender's father). The parties can assume that I have carefully read and considered those references. Clearly, the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced is out of character. Clearly, up until this matter the offender has led a blameless and worthwhile life and has contributed significantly to the community of which he is part. 

43Supporting the observation of the psychologist is a report from Ms. Debbie Atkins, Drug & Alcohol Counsellor, indicating that the offender has attended a number of appointments and he appears to be taking positive steps in making changes towards his lifestyle choices. 

44The court is very much indebted to Mr Blackman of counsel for his thoughtful, comprehensive and extremely helpful submissions. Mr. Blackman referred to the decision of Nowak. The circumstances of the offence were addressed, as was the answer to question 32 of the ERISP. I do not resile from my description of the actions of the offender as being indiscriminate violence, however, the answer to q 32 of the ERISP puts the actions of the accused into some context. Again I note that Mr Blackman did not submit there was provocation from the victim. 

45Mr Blackman then addressed at length on Mr Jago's report. The issues from the report that have been highlighted within these remarks were appropriately emphasised, in particular that the offender is suffering from the effects of PTSD. It is particularly significant, and goes to the credit of the offender, that in neither the Pre Sentence Report nor the Psychologist's report does the offender attempt to minimise his criminality. 

46The references to which I have referred were addressed in some detail in the course of submissions. Counsel then went into the personal background of the offender. He is 28 years of age, of prior good character. His parents separated when he was 5, and he was raised principally by his father. He was educated to year 10 level at Corowa and was an apprentice green keeper for some time. He went to South Australia with his then partner for some time before returning to the Corowa area. He has been in his present relationship for about 2 and a half years, and as has been previously mentioned the birth of their first child is imminent. He has played representative football. 

47It was put and I accept that there was no planning in the commission of the offence. The vastly excessive consumption of alcohol on the night of the offence was admitted. It was put and I accept that the offender is now doing something positive about his consumption of alcohol. It was put and I accept that there is little likelihood of re-offending. Likewise, I accept that there are good prospects for rehabilitation. 

48Both Mr Blackman and the prosecutor have referred to the ameliorative conduct of the offender. It was not as if the offender fled the scene. The ambulance was called, and accordingly, there was some preliminary assistance to the victim. In Thewlis v R [2008] NSWCCA 176 Spigelman CJ (Price J agreeing) said at [4]-[6]: 

The reasons in Phelan were clearly appropriate in the context of a crime involving the loss of money. They, however, emphasise that something special is required for ameliorative conduct to result in mitigation of sentence. Merely taking a step to redress the effect of a crime on victims is not of itself enough. 

5 In the present case that special additional element is to be found in the fact that it does appear that the applicant's immediate recognition of his wrongful act played a significant, and quite possibly decisive role, in saving the victim's life. 

6 I agree with Simpson J that this is a circumstance of the present case that deserves recognition in the sentence . 

49In the matter presently under consideration there is not the same extent of conduct as there was in Thewlis . However, the offender is entitled to some small consideration for his actions immediately following the striking of the victim. 

50Mr Blackman submitted that the dispositions of Periodic Detention or and Intensive Corrections Order would be appropriate. Periodic Detention is no longer available in New South Wales, and an ICO is not available either in Albury or Corowa. The decision in Tsokos (unrep., NSWCCA, 19 June 1995) then becomes relevant. In that decision Hulme J (Gleeson CJ, Powell JA agreeing) said: 

There is nothing in R v Christine Blair to support the view that a court, unable to impose a sentence it regards as theoretically the most appropriate, is obliged to impose a sentence that is more lenient. The correct approach is to choose from the available options the sentence which is most appropriate. 

51Ultimately, the issue for this court in this matter is whether the sentence to be imposed can be suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

Prosecutor's submissions 

52I commend the prosecutor who appeared for her written submissions. Rarely does the Local Court get such assistance. The prosecutor submitted that there were aggravating factors present: namely (a) the offence involved the actual use of violence and (b) that the offence was an offence in which the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused was substantial. That submission must be firmly rejected, as both are an element of the offence on which the court is passing sentence. The prosecution appropriately concede that there was no planning, the offender pleaded guilty and that there are no previous convictions. I have already covered the aspect of ameliorative conduct. Likewise, I have already made findings that intoxication cannot in the circumstances of this offence be a mitigating factor. Neither, however, is it an aggravating factor. The prosecution submit that only a sentence of full time custody is sufficient in this matter. 

General Remarks 

53I have been referred to the sentencing statistics kept by the New South Wales Judicial Commission. Often enough, those statistics can be useful, however, in this matter, once refined, the sample is so small as to render the statistics of little practical use. 

54I am obliged to give proper effect to sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is not appropriate to impose any sentence of custody unless the court is of the opinion that no other sentence is appropriate. The purposes of punishment as prescribed in s 3A are: 

(a)to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b)to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c)to protect the community from the offender, 
(d)to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e)to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f)to denounce the conduct of the offender, and 
(g)to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 

55It is an established principle of sentencing that the sentence imposed must be proportionate to the offence. Given the very strong subjective features of this matter it is timely to remind myself of what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354: 

Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective seriousness of the case: Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. 

56Given the criminality, the injuries and ongoing issues suffered by the victim and the need for a significant element of general deterrence, I am firmly of the opinion that a sentence of imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence. The next issue to be determined is the length of the sentence. Given all of the factors to which I have referred in these remarks the appropriate starting point is a sentence in the vicinity of two and one half years (30 months) from which is to be deducted the 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, which with some slight mathematical rounding down in favour of the offender results in a total sentence of 22 months. 

57The next issue to be determined is whether the sentence should be suspended. Howie J in decision of Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 said at [32]: 

Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is to protect the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate. 

58Given the seriousness of the matter taken with the need for a significant element of general deterrence, I am firmly of the opinion that the sentence should not be suspended. However, I am persuaded there are special circumstances, including the offender's prior good character, that this is his first time in custody, and the need for a lengthy period of supervision directed towards issues relating to alcohol. On the issue of special circumstances Hulme J in R v Boney [2008] NSWCCA 313 said at [48]: 

Altering the ratio between the non-parole and balance of term periods of a sentence from that of 3:1 embodied in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as much as to result in a ratio of 50:50 is sufficiently unusual as to inspire examination. 

Formal Orders 

59The offender is convicted . Consequent upon that conviction the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months to date from today, 23 August 2011 to expire on 22 August 2012. Thereafter, I specify a balance of term of 10 months to commence on 23 August 2012, and expire on 22 June 2013.

		25 August 2011",2011-08-22 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2757675,Salman v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 192,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP P : The applicant pleaded guilty on 21 May 2010 to two charges on an indictment dated 11 May 2010, alleging that the applicant: 

(a) contrary to the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), s 233BAB(5): 

""On or about 29 April 2009 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did intentionally import goods, being tier 2 goods, namely digital images containing child pornography contained on six (6) Digital Versatile Discs, being reckless to the fact that the goods were tier 2 goods, the importation of which was prohibited under the Customs Act 1901 and requisite approval had not been obtained at the time of importation"" (count 1); and 

(b) contrary to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 50BC(1)(a): 

""Between 3 December 2007 and 2 March 2008, in the country of Thailand, being an Australian citizen, while outside Australia, did commit an act of indecency on a person, namely sucked on the breasts of a female person, who was then under the age of 16 years"" (count 2). 

2The maximum penalties for the two offences were 10 years' imprisonment for the Customs Act offence and 12 years' imprisonment for the Crimes Act offence. 

3At the sentencing hearing before the District Court on 1 and 23 July 2010, the sentencing judge dealt with one further matter pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 166 being a charge that on 29 April 2009 the applicant possessed or controlled a foreign travel document not issued to him contrary to the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2005 (Cth), s 21(4). The sentencing judge also took into account in sentencing in respect of count 1 two further matters pursuant to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 16BA being charges that the applicant: 

(a) imported prohibited imports, being seven flick knives, contrary to the Customs Act , s 233(1)(b); and 

(b) intentionally made a false statement contrary to the Customs Act , s 234(1)(d)(i). 

4The sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were: 

(a) on count 1, imprisonment for four years to date from 1 July 2010; 

(b) on count 2, imprisonment for four years to date from 1 July 2011; 

(c) an overall non-parole period was fixed of three years and four months; 

(d) in relation to the matter on the certificate under the Criminal Procedure Act , a term of three months was imposed to be served concurrently with the sentence for count 1. 

5A statement of facts not in dispute was tendered. The relevant facts were as follows. The applicant was born in Turkey in February 1948. On the morning of 29 April 2009, he arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, New South Wales, on board British Airways flight BA9 from Thailand. 

6After completing immigration processing, the applicant collected a number of bags and presented for customs and quarantine clearance. He was selected for a baggage examination and was escorted to the Customs examination area by an Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officer. 

7During the examination, Customs officers located a number of items including: 


A Thai passport in the name of [J... P...] born February 1986; 
Several DVDs, video cassettes, a Sony video camera and a still camera; and 
Seven flick knives. 

8The DVDs were examined and were found to contain images thought to be consistent with the description in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (Cth) (the ""Regulations""), reg 4A(1A), which is in the following terms: 

""(1A) This regulation applies to publications and any other goods, that: 

(a) describe, depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be imported; or 

(b) describe or depict in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a person who is, or who appears to be, a child under 18 (whether the person is engaged in sexual activity or not) ..."" 

9There were six DVDs found to contain such material (two originals and two copies of each). 

10It will be necessary in due course to describe the contents of the DVDs in some detail. It is sufficient for immediate purposes to set out from the statement of facts a description of the images said to offend s 233BAB: 

(a) DVD 1 

(i) Young Asian female approximately 15/16 years of age seen sitting on a bed. SALMAN pulls down side of her t-shirt and appears to suck her breast. 

(ii) Young Caucasian females approximately 14/15 years of age with bare breasts. Another male person is then seen to suck the females' breasts. 

(b) DVD 2 

(i) Young Asian female approximately 15/16 years of age seen sitting on a bed. SALMAN pulls down side of her t-shirt and appears to suck her breasts. 

(This includes the same footage as described on DVD 1.) 

(ii) Young Asian female approximately 15/16 years of age seen sitting on a bed with her upper body exposed. SALMAN repeatedly sucks her breasts whilst talking to the camera. 

11Throughout the DVDs the applicant spoke in both English and Turkish. A translation and interpretation was made of each of the DVDs. 

12Section 233BAB provides for a special offence relating to so-called ""tier 2 goods"". Section 233BAB relevantly provides: 

""(1) The regulations may provide that: 

... 

(h) items of child pornography... 


constitute tier 2 goods. 

... 

(3) For the purposes of subsection (1) an item is taken to be an item of child pornography if it is a document or other goods: 

(a) that depicts a person , or a representation of a person, who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age and who: 

(i) is engaged in, or appears to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons); or 

(ii) is in the presence of a person who is engaged in, or appears to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity; 

and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or 

(b) the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of: 

(i) a sexual organ or the anal region of a person who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; or 

(ii) a representation of such a sexual organ or anal region; or 

(iii) the breasts, or a representation of the breasts, of a female person who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; 

in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or 

(c) that describes a person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age and who: 

(i) is engaged in, or is implied to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons); or 

(ii) is in the presence of a person who is engaged in, or is implied to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity; 

and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; 

... 

(4A) The matters to be taken into account in deciding for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4) whether reasonable persons would regard a particular document or other goods as being, in all the circumstances, offensive, include: 

(a) the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults; and 

(b) the literary, artistic or educational merit (if any) of the material; and 

(c) the general character of the material (including whether it is of a medical, legal or scientific character). 

(5) A person is guilty of an offence against this subsection if: 

(a) the person intentionally imported goods; and 

(b) the goods were tier 2 goods and the person was reckless as to that fact; and 

(c) their importation: 

(i) was prohibited under this Act absolutely; or 

(ii) was prohibited under this Act unless the approval of a particular person had been obtained and, at the time of the importation, that approval had not been obtained. 

Maximum penalty: A fine not exceeding 2,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years, or both. 

(5A) Subject to subsection (5B), absolute liability applies to paragraph (5)(c). 

... 

(5B) For the purposes of an offence against subsection (5), strict liability applies to the physical element of circumstance of the offence, that an approval referred to in subparagraph (5)(c)(ii) had not been obtained at the time of the importation..."" 

13Section 50BC(1) of the Crimes Act was in the following terms: 

""(1) A person ( the first person ) contravenes this section if, while the first person is outside Australia: 

(a) the first person commits an act of indecency on a person who is under 16; or 

(b) the first person submits to an act of indecency committed by a person who is under 16; or 

(c) the first person commits an act of indecency in the presence of a person who is under 16 ( the child ), and the first person intends to derive gratification from the child's presence during the act; or 

(d) the first person submits to an act of indecency committed in the presence of a person who is under 16 ( the child ), and the first person intends to derive gratification from the child's presence during the act; or 

(e) the first person engages in sexual intercourse with another person in the presence of a person who is under 16 ( the child ), and the first person intends to derive gratification from the child's presence during the sexual intercourse. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 years."" 



14Section 50BC was part of Pt IIIA entitled ""Child sex tourism"" that was introduced into the Crimes Act by the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). The section was amended in 2001 and the Part was repealed in 2010. Child sex offences committed outside Australia are now governed by the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), Ch 8, Div 272. 

15The audio content was transcribed after interpretation from the Turkish language. The statement of facts asserted that the contents of the transcripts also constitute child pornography as described in reg 4A(1A)(b); and that the contents of the transcripts constitute child pornography by s 233BAB(3)(c)(i) in that the transcripts describe a person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age and who is engaged in, or is implied to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity and do this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive. 

16The relevant extracts of the transcript that were said in the statement of facts to offend the above provisions were set out in annexures A and B to the facts. These two annexures cover eight pages of typing. They are difficult to appreciate without viewing the accompanying DVDs, which the Court has done. They involve the applicant talking to the camera about the young Thai female with him and about what he and she are doing. Some of the transcript deals, in addition to describing the girl, or the activity of kissing and sucking of her breasts, with what he says he will do to or with the girl. I have marked these passages with an asterisk. I will refer to them in due course. I will set out what I consider to be representative examples. I have anonymised the names of the people to whom the applicant is speaking. It can be inferred that they include persons who are not present. Unless otherwise indicated, the applicant is speaking.

This is our Turkish restaurant, just opposite. We are in Thailand Pattaya, look there is our restaurant. Hah ... hah ... hah ... Good ... good ... good."" 

The applicant dressed as a pilot: 

""... I will bring her to Australia. We are a pilot of course, so we are a pilot. That's how. When somebody is called a pilot, all the obstacles are overcome, *we have affairs with 15 year old girls*, Mr [S...], this is not a sin is it? 

[Y...], you do see, don't you, [C... O...], this is how. [V...], you die of jealousy, don't say 'I am a truck driver', say 'I am a pilot.' You see what piloting is? You see how ... beautiful. We are going to go soon. I am going to give mum to [H...] Beautiful mum. I am giving [H...] to her. Oh ... very beautiful. Look at her eyes. [Indistinct] I [indistinct] your eyes. Very beautiful. That's how."" 

The applicant and others in a nearby restaurant: 

""So [H...], let's see, you've done it. I am letting you fuck my mother-in-law. [H...] okay. I am letting my mother-in-law fucked. Sit anywhere ... anywhere ... sit here ... no problem, okay, no problem. This light is okay. The light ... Do you see? [Laughs] Smart girl. Small, no. Okay, higher. Okay ... okay. Waitress good. Okay. I am [indistinct] today. 

... 

[V...], look, this business is not for free. Feeding her first then I'll fuck her. Do you see, we are feeding her with all these? We are not feeding her with 10 baht worth of Thai food. Okay? Look, this is my mother-in-law. We are feeding them with 10 baht worth of Thai food. 

Do you see, [V...]? We are not feeding her with 10 baht worth of food, like you do. 

Okay? This is 350 baht. Okay, [V...], look. Okay? You should live with this kind but you should open up your wallet. Tell Australia and the wife and all to fuck off, come here, look, how polite she is. I am kissing in front of everybody, do you see? 

... 

Now, I am the champion from now on ... since the last year. I got her when she was 15 years of age. The boys say 'You are the one. There is nobody like you in Thailand' [Y...] and all ... They say 'There isn't anybody' ..."" 

The applicant back in a room with the girl: 

""Look, I am kissing her in the presence of her mother. Okay, good. Come on, play, I am giving my mother-in-law to [H...]. Good ... good. [Sings] Up ... up ... up ... up ... up ... up. Ahhaa .. Lovely girl, lovely, tiny. Still a child. Mr [S...] is this sinful, fucking her? [H...] will now fuck my mother-in-law and *I will fuck this one*. Come on, Mr [A... A... U...] greetings to you too, [A... U...]. We are fucking children. Never seen before, very beautiful. [Laughs] Do you see [V...], like this, we are now going to make love? Beautiful, give me ... give me. [V...], this is how I suck, look. 

Give me another one. This how I suck. [V...] Shove the money up your ass in Australia; shove it up your ass unless you suck the girls like this at 15. 

How do I suck, you see [V...], look. Mr [S...] look. Give me this one, the other one, look. I am kissing this one too, look. Very good ... very good ... very good ... very good. Okay? Give me. Okay, this is how you should suck. Look ... look ... look ... Stand ... stand up ... stand up. Do you see, you see the breasts, [V...]? Mr [S...], look at this.

Look at her ass ... look ... look ... do whatever you like, [V...] come, come and make her sit on your lap. This is how you make her sit on your lap and suck the breast, look ... look, okay [V...]. Brother-in-law [A...].

This is how you suck; this is how, okay, look? Give the other one darling. I say (indistinct) and she gives that one too. This is how you suck. Look, this is how, look ... look. [Laughs] The girl's mouth developed into a wound by kissing. This is how you strip and do. This is life; this is how we live with the girls. Come and live, are you going to shove the money up your assess? Greetings to all the friends in Turkey, greetings to [M...

17The statement of facts then dealt with count 2. The statement of facts commenced with the following paragraphs on this charge: 

""In January 2009, a member of the community made a report to the AFP about the Offender. He stated that the Offender would show him photographs of naked Thai girls from his wallet and told him that the photos were taken from his Thai trips and that he had sex with the girls. The Offender would say to him that the girls would start in ages from 13 to 15 years of age and were from villages surrounding Pattaya. 

On 12 August 2009, Customs Investigators contacted the AFP and informed them that a review of the seized DVDs contained footage of the Offender engaged in sexual acts with young girls, allegedly below the age of 16 years. Customs further stated that the footage is believed to be taken during the Offender's visits to Thailand. 

On 25 August 2009 AFP specialist members completed a review of the DVDs found in possession of the Offender on 29 April 2009. A review of DVD-R (DVD 2) identified the Offender with two other unidentified males in a small apartment accompanied by two females of Thai appearance. AFP specialist members determined that one of the females was approximately 14 to 15 years of age."" 

18The statement of facts then recited some individual statements from the interpreted transcript and provided a commentary of and extracts from the parts of the DVDs relevant to count 2, which can be found in the extracts set out above. 

19The statement of facts recorded various admissions made by the applicant in September 2009: 

""- He identified the subject DVDs as being in his possession when he entered Australia on 29 April 2009; 

- He identified the DVDs as containing a selection of footage from his trips to Pattaya, Thailand; 

- During his trips to Thailand he met Thai girls at the Go Go Bar and he believed that the girls had to show identification to gain entry; 

- He had sexual intercourse with Thai girls, but denied having sex with girls under 16 years of age; 

- He confirmed he was the male person kissing a Thai girl's breasts as outlined [in the statement of facts]. He also confirmed he was the voice behind the camera on this occasion. He denied having sexual intercourse with the Thai girl. He further stated that he believed that the Thai girl was 19 years of age; 

- He stated that the footage was taken between 2008 and 2009 in Pattaya, Thailand; 

- He confirmed that the voice recording, both in English and Turkish was commentary spoken by him; 

- He stated that the comments made by him during the footage were made as a joke and he did not intend to act on them. He further stated that he made these statements as a result [of] an altered mental state due to consuming a number of prescription drugs for depression and high blood pressure..."" 

20As to the charge of possessing a foreign travel document not issued to the applicant, the statement of facts recorded: 

""The Offender stated to a Customs officer that the Thailand passport numbered [N...] belonged to his former girlfriend and it was in his possession for the purpose of buying her an air ticket and applying for a Turkish visa for Ms [P...]. He stated that he did not end up doing this because she had cheated on him and invited the Customs officer to throw it away. He further admitted that his former girlfriend did not know that he had possession of her passport. 

The photo of Ms [P...] shows that she is the same woman who appears in many of the Offender's DVD footages. 

A short while later, the Offender stated to another Customs officer that he had a fight with his girlfriend and he took the passport from her."" 

21It is to be understood that count 2 related to the kissing of the girl on the occasion when she had her top off, and not the other occasion when she had her top on and it was pulled down by the applicant. 

22The charge concerning the false statement on the incoming passenger card related to a false declaration that the applicant was not ""bringing into Australia goods that may be prohibited or subject to restrictions, such as medicines, steroids, firearms, weapons of any kind or illicit drugs"", when in fact he was carrying seven flick knives. 

23From the transcript of argument it would appear that the applicant, on arriving in Australia, also had DVDs containing images of sexual conduct by him with women apparently of adult years. 

24The applicant did not give evidence. Material was tendered on his behalf, including a report of a consultant psychologist, Dr Jacmon and of a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Younan. Also tendered was material concerning his medical history and a DVD of his work history (the applicant apparently having a penchant for diarising aspects of his life on camera). 

The remarks on sentence 

25The sentencing judge briefly described the applicant: 

""The offender is a sixty-five year old Australian citizen of Turkish descent. He suffered some injuries while working in a metal factory and has received worker's compensation over the years. He had a car accident and received another injury. (There is objective evidence to support the claimed injuries.) He has a Centrelink disability pension and he has, from time to time, suffered from depression."" 

26His Honour referred to the applicant's travel to Thailand: 

""He has taken trips to Thailand and has lived there for various periods in recent years and while living there he appears to enjoy sex with, inter alios, various adult women. The bad back mentioned in various parts of the medical evidence appears not to be too have [sic] greatly impeded his sexual activities in Thailand. Not only has he had sex in Thailand, he has video taped at least some of these episodes."" 

27His Honour described the applicant's re-entry into Australia in April 2009: 

""On 20 April 2009 while returning to Australia (an exercise funded presumably from his Australian Government disability pension, unless he has some savings which do not appear obvious) he was searched by Customs officers. They found him to be in possession of a number of video recordings, particularly exhibit SB in these proceedings. As well, there are a number of videos of him having sex with adult women. The latter videos are not in evidence but they have been referred to without objection by the defence, presumably on the basis that they are inclined to suggest that his inclinations are not towards prepubertal children."" 

28The sentencing judge then described the content of the DVDs: 

""Exhibit SB shows the offender in Thailand with a pretty young girl who appears to be about fifteen years of age. While explaining in Turkish for the benefit of the camera what is going on (and presumably the Thai girl has little knowledge of Turkish) he kisses her repeatedly for the benefit of the camera. She cooperates with a show of what I confidently take to be feigned enthusiasm. He is pretending to be a rich Australian - a commercial pilot in fact, as evidenced by several items behind him in the room, a tie and a pilot's shirt with the appropriate epaulettes. He opens her blouse and fondles her breasts for the camera. He repeatedly sucks her breasts, grinning and making lascivious comments in Turkish for the benefit of others to whom he will, in due course, wish to communicate the images. One of the persons to whom he appears to wish to communicate the images is a brother-in-law. 

It is unnecessary for me to go through in detail the various obnoxious comments he makes - they are all set out in annexure B to tab 3 of exhibit SA. He appears to emphasise the fact that she is a fifteen-year-old girl. 

At a point timed as 9.29 in annexure B to the DVD he says, 'Do you see her beauty? Here is, I mean, my sweetheart undoubtedly. Okay, here is the chief pilot'. He goes on to say, 'I will move her to Australia. We are a pilot of course, so we are a pilot. That's how when somebody is called a pilot all the obstacles are overcome. We have affairs with fifteen-year-old girls Mr [S...]. This is not a sin is it?' He goes on to emphasise that he is pretending to be a pilot; this is impressing the young Thai girls and leads to his sexual success, if it could be so called. 

The exhibit continues and the location is changed to a restaurant where the offender buys a substantial meal for the girl and her mother. He says to the camera, 

'Look, this business is not for free. Feeding her first, then I'll fuck her. Do you see we are feeding her with all these? We are not feeding her with ten baht worth of Thai food, okay. Look, this is my mother-in-law, we are not feeding them with ten baht worth of Thai food.' 

Then he goes on to say: 

'This is 350 baht. Okay, [V...] look okay? You should live with this kind, but you should open up your wallet. Tell Australia and the wife and all to fuck off, come here, look how polite she is. I am kissing in front of everybody, do you see?' 

Although they are not ill-clad, the females in question are obviously Thai women of a class which finds itself open to manipulation for economic reasons. He explained for the benefit of the camera that the meal is not cheap but something substantial. His intention is to have sex with the young girl after the meal, but as it turns out he does not do so as the girl is menstruating at the time. 

The CD exhibits also contain images of two other females, possibly middle European, taken in circumstances unknown. He fondles the breasts of one of them who appears to be under eighteen years of age. That conduct is criminality within the child pornography offence, but the fondling of breasts of that Caucasian lass it not itself a separate offence - rather the image of it is part of the importing offence."" 

29The sentencing judge then described the contact that underpinned the charges under s 50BC(1)(a): 

""The proof of her age is not supplied by any birth certificate or statement from her mother; rather it appears throughout the transcript in exhibit SA that the offender wishes to emphasise his involvement with fifteen-year-old girls. He says at one point: 

'Now I am the champion from now on, since the last year. I got her when she was 15 years of age. The boys say you are the one, there is nobody like you in Thailand.' 

At another point he says: 

'Give me another one, this is how I suck, [V...]. Shove the money up your arse in Australia, shove it up your arse unless you suck the girls like this at 15' 

That is, it is from this offender's own mouth that the girl is aged fifteen. I accept this as fact, noting that it accords with the images."" 

30His Honour then turned to Dr Jacmon's report dealing with the applicant's history, industrial accidents, depression, chronic pain, marriage break-up and what the applicant told Dr Jacmon of his experience in Thailand, which Dr Jacmon reported as follows: 

""In Thailand he experienced a welcome change to his mood. His depression and anxiety lifted and he gave up his medication. He visited various tourist venues and enjoyed himself. He had to leave Thailand after each month to renew his visa and hence gained some familiarity with the surrounding countries. 

In Thailand he stayed in Pattaya. He was saddened to see many impoverished children in the street and by contrast rich tourists spending money freely in bars and entertainment venues. He developed the habit of giving money to children begging in the streets. He travelled to Thailand a number of times until his arrest in April 09."" 

31His Honour commented upon this in strong terms: 

""Frankly it is difficult to see this as anything but humbug. It is unsupported by sworn evidence of the offender and seeks to cast him as a philanthropist intent on doing social good for the poor and downtrodden of East Asia. This is frankly delusional, not least in the implied anticipation that a court might believe it. The facts are that Mr Osman Salman was managing, through unexplained financial resources, to live a life of geriatric debauchery quite at odds with the slightest social concern. I set this self-promotional material aside as unhelpful, except as a pointer to the offender's true character as a man willing to stoop to even the most laughable of falsehoods. 

32His Honour recognised that the applicant had no prior convictions but said that the misconduct could not be viewed as a ""one-off"" or an aberration, saying: 

""... Nonetheless, his misconduct here cannot be viewed as a 'one-off' or an aberration. As I have said, the video, exhibit SB, also includes images of two Caucasian woman [sic], one a girl whom the offender gropes in the breast area. I reject the notion that Mr Salman's conduct, as viewed in exhibit SB and as translated in exhibit SA, is that of a neophyte in this field of offending 

... 

In exhibit SB the offender appears happy, boastful and in control. He appears to be delighted to have a beautiful fifteen-year-old girl in his grip, literally. She going through the motions of amorous response as if he were some twenty year-old film star, rather than a dirty old man. He is ecstatic. Depression is the least emotion the offender displays. Any connection between a history of misfortune with accidents, chronic pain, depression and these offences is not apparent to me. We are left essentially with the video and the translation from it as the central evidence."" 

33The sentencing judge then turned to the seriousness of the offence, saying: 

""No doubt there are worse such videos, showing the violation of five year olds and graver crimes. I accept this. The single strongest point in the accused's case is that the girl was fifteen, not five or eight. The injury she suffers from this offence is not of an infant, but that of a teenager on the cusp of womanhood. The damage to her will presumably be less than it may have been had it been imposed upon a pre-pubertal child. Nonetheless the injury will be real. To watch the video is to see a beautiful child under duress, compelled by economic and social misfortune to 'agree' to sex with an apparently wealthy foreigner, large, old and hairy. Her person is violated, since she gives no greater real consent than that of a bank teller handing over money at gunpoint as he gropes her and sucks her breast. Furthermore the image of this violation is captured on film or video, possibly to be circulated ad infinitum. His words were addressed to some unidentified but presumably real person, and were intended to be communicated to at least one other, and presumably to more than one. 

Worst of all, in my view the conduct is calculated to inflict the injury of hardening this girl so as to make her callous and disregarding of human decencies. This is a sorry burden for anyone to bear whether they live in Sydney or in Thailand. It follows that the age of the girl as fifteen rather than as an infant is the offender's strongest point, impressed on me by Mr Smith. It is his best point, but it is not all that good. The girl of the age she is comes within the protection provided by the relevant statute... 

The injury inflicted by such crimes is primarily to the victim, but it is also to the international standing and reputation of Australia. This is a crime based on an extra territorial jurisdiction claimed by Australia. Historically such jurisdiction is unusual. For reasons of international policy and comity, many nations have historically been reluctant to attempt to punish misbehaviour beyond their own boundaries. Australia does not claim jurisdiction to punish the generality of crimes committed overseas. The legislation we are now dealing with reflects the phenomenon known these days as globalisation. The Australian parliament has recognised that in an era of cheap air travel citizens will sometimes go overseas and will sometimes seriously misbehave, and that crimes such as the present ones committed overseas by Australians can bring disgrace and disfavour to Australia and its interests. 

The parliament of Australia does not criminalise [sic] its own citizens for most of the criminal misbehaviours which they commit in other countries. The law says that this is a special category of cases. Our national laws do not inhibit our citizens from lawful sex in other countries, but recognise that a particular national disgrace ensues when Australian citizens travel overseas and victimise economically vulnerable children. The parliament of Australia does not tolerate its citizens travelling abroad and defiling the children of our neighbour countries."" 

34His Honour then remarked on the comparative criminality in the two primary offences (s 233BAB and s 50BC): 

""In my view, the criminality involved in the two offences (to which there has been a plea of guilty) is approximately equivalent. I have identified and spelled out the impact upon the child herself of the indecency misconduct, that is to say, the physical indecency. The criminality of the creation of the film lies in the tendency of such activity to popularise the sexual predation involved. Sometimes the importation of child pornography will be quite separate from any proof of physical misconduct by the importer. But even where there is no such physical misconduct by the importer himself, the very potential for promulgation and distribution of the film itself contributes to this unacceptable overseas conduct. As I say, it seems to me that the penalties for each of the two matters should be roughly equivalent."" 

35The sentencing judge took into account the applicant's family, absence of prior convictions, guilty plea and assistance to the authorities. This did not, however, in his Honour's view, reflect contrition. 

The appeal 

36The only ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive and that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. 

37The disagreement on the submissions focussed upon two matters: 

(a) the proper assessment of the criminality involved in counts 1 and 2; and 

(b) what could be taken from other sentences for similar offences. 

38Further, the Court raised the question whether there was likely to have been a degree of double counting necessarily reflected by the two offences attracting the same punishment (four years), even taking into account the fact that the additional offences on the schedule under the Crimes Act , s 16BA related only to count 1, the offence under s 233BAB. 

39No complaint was made about the sentence in respect of the matter on the certificate under the Criminal Procedure Act , s 166. 

The charges 

40It is first necessary to say something about the charges. The offence of importation of tier 2 goods contrary to s 233BAB(5) applied in this case only because the DVDs were ""items of child pornography"" for s 233BAB(1)(h) as provided for by the Regulations or other parts of s 233BAB. 

41The nature of the offence under s 233BAB(5) is not to be taken only from the general expression ""child pornography"" with such connotations as may flow in contemporary society from that phrase, but rather, in substance, from the definitions made relevant by the Customs Act and Regulations. The statement of facts to which the applicant pleaded guilty identified the substance of the charges as follows: 

in respect of the images: s 233BAB(3)(b)(iii); and 

in respect of the audio content: reg 4A(1A)(b) (by the combined effect of reg 179AA(3) and Pt 2 of Sch 1AA, item 3 of the Customs Regulations 1926 (Cth) and s 233BAB(3)(c)(i) of the Customs Act ). 

42Thus the plea was to the effect that the applicant intentionally imported goods (the six DVDs) that were tier 2 goods and was reckless as to that fact and that importation was prohibited. The facts underlying the conclusion that the goods were tier 2 goods were that: 

(a) as to the visual images, the DVDs were goods the dominant characteristic of which depicts for a sexual purpose the breasts of a female person who is or appears to be under 18 years of age in a manner that reasonable persons would regard as offensive (s 233BAB(3)(b)(iii)); 

(b) as to the audio content, the DVDs were goods that describe in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18 (whether the person is engaged in sexual activity or not) (reg 4A(1A)(b)); and 

(c) further as to the audio content, the DVDs were goods that describe a person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age and who is engaged in, or is implied to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons) (s 233BAB(3)(c)(i)). 

43As I have said, the charge under the Crimes Act , s 50BC was only in respect of the acts done while the young Thai female had her top removed and was sitting on the edge of the bed. The charge did not involve the applicant doing anything else. 

The sentences in question 

44The head sentences of four years were imposed by his Honour after taking into account the pleas of guilty, albeit it was common ground that the pleas were not made at the earliest opportunity. Nevertheless, the pleas obviated the need for proof beyond reasonable doubt of the age of the girl. That may not have been of considerable difficulty for count 1 (under 18), but it may have been for count 2 (under 16), notwithstanding the applicant's statements on the DVDs. The pleas were therefore of relevance and benefit in the administration of justice. Those pleas, together with the lack of prior convictions, though taking into account the relatively minor matters taken into account under the Crimes Act , s 16BA, meant that the starting point for the sentences for counts 1 and 2 was somewhat above four years. 

45This places these offences about half-way along a spectrum of the worst offence that might attract 10 and 12 years' imprisonment for counts 1 and 2 respectively. I put the matter in this way to avoid using a very broad expression such as ""mid-range"". Care needs to be exhibited not to substitute for the proper assessment of the facts and the evaluation of the appropriateness of the sentence in accordance with the Crimes Act , s 16A, a syllogism based on labels such as might be reflected by the following: if four years plus is ""mid-range"", and the offence was ""mid-range"" in seriousness, the sentence is therefore ""within the range"". This is both a short and misleading calculus. Of course, there must be an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. This is to be done in accordance with s 16A. All the circumstances must be assessed, including those matters in s 16A(2). 

The s 233BAB offence 

46The applicant referred to the list of factors relevant to the objective seriousness of offences of possession or importation of child pornography in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29. That case concerned s 233BAB(5). Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreed) discussed the history of the provision at 36-37 [29]-[32]. Johnson J then noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Western Australia in Assheton v The Queen [2002] WASCA 209; 132 A Crim R 237 (Malcolm CJ, Murray J and Steytler J agreeing) and in Holland v The Queen [2005] WASCA 140; 30 WAR 231 and the Court of Appeal in Queensland in R v C; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld); R v C; Ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2004] QCA 469 considered the relevant sentencing principles applicable to offences under s 233BAB(5). From these cases, it can be taken that a range of factors bear upon the objective seriousness of the offence, including the nature and content of the material informing the degree of ""offensiveness"" of the material, the age of the child, the gravity of the sexual activity, the number of images, whether the importation is for sale or further distribution and whether the importation is for profit. 

47Further, the offence is a serious one and one for which deterrence, both general and specific, is of great importance. The protection is for both society as a whole and children in particular. 

48Here, counsel for the applicant emphasised that the girl was 15 and not of a very young age, she is only ever in a state of partial undress, the sexual act is sucking her breast, there is nothing in the way of sadism, or cruelty or bestiality, the duration of the DVDs are 3 to 15 minutes with only 9 minutes relating to physical contact, the videos were plainly not for sale (but it was accepted that it could be reasonably inferred that they were to be played or distributed to a limited group of acquaintances). Counsel for the applicant also submitted that the length of time involved in accessing, storing and classifying the pornography was an inapt and irrelevant consideration. 

49The Director referred to the recent decision of R v Dennison [2011] NSWCCA 114 in which the Court (Schmidt J, with whom Whealy JA and McCallum J agreed) discussed many of the authorities on child pornography (though not in the specific context of s 233BAB) and in particular the recent review of the same subject by Hulme J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreed) in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; 201 A Crim R 243. There, Hulme J said at 260-261 [94]-[95]: 

""[94] Drawing primarily from the authorities to which I have referred, the following matters may be relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of offences involving the possession or dissemination/transmission of child pornography: 

1. Whether actual children were used in the creation of the material. 

2. The nature and content of the material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed. 

3. The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material. 

4. The number of images or items of material - in a case of possession, the significance lying more in the number of different children depicted. 

5. In a case of possession, the offender's purpose, whether for his/her own use or for sale or dissemination. In this regard, care is needed to avoid any infringement of the principle in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 

6. In a case of dissemination/transmission, the number of persons to whom the material was disseminated/transmitted. 

7. Whether any payment or other material benefit (including the exchange of child pornographic material) was made, provided or received for the acquisition or dissemination/transmission. 

8. The proximity of the offender's activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence. 

9. The degree of planning, organisation or sophistication employed by the offender in acquiring, storing, disseminating or transmitting the material. 

10. Whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded persons. 

11. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children. 

12. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted. 

13. Any other matter in s 21A(2) or (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for State offences) or s 16A Crimes Act 1914 (for Commonwealth offences) bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence. 

[95] This list of factors is, of course, not closed. Individual cases may always produce further matters relevant to the assessment of their objective seriousness."" 

50The Director also relied upon what had been said in R v Oliver [2003] 1 Cr App R 28 at 467 [11] as to a ""scale"" of seriousness: 

""(1) images depicting erotic posing with no sexual activity; 

(2) sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by a child; 

(3) non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children; 

(4) penetrative sexual activity between children and adults; 

(5) sadism or bestiality."" 

51Oliver was relied on in Minehan . 

52All these cases are no doubt helpful discussions of the essentially evaluative assessment involved. They are not to be taken as listing prescriptive schedules, with elements to be counted. They helpfully collect and discuss, however, the kinds of considerations relevant to the evaluative process. The place of the applicant as the creator of the film and as an actor is relevant. He is not, however, to be punished twice for the act of indecency. The sexual acts were not violent, cruel or depraved. No physical harm was inflicted. The acts were in the presence of others. No apparent commercial motive was involved. 

53It is important to appreciate that the applicant was not charged with any of the acts that he said he would do or had done with the girl, as identified in the passages marked with an asterisk. These passages are relevant as statements that assist in the evaluation of the ""offensiveness"" of the material. They may also assist in drawing a conclusion that the applicant should not be sentenced on the basis that this is an isolated offence or an aberration. He is not, however, to be sentenced for doing (if he did) what he said he would do or had done. 

54Giving full weight to the importance of general and specific deterrence, taking into account the matters under s 16BA and all the matters considered by the sentencing judge, and considering the kind of material that could be covered by the offence, I am clearly of the view that a term of imprisonment of four years was manifestly excessive. Giving due weight to all the factors mentioned by the sentencing judge, all the circumstances of the offence, evaluating the degree of offensiveness from the nature of the material, the matters in s 16A(2) and recognising the importance of general and specific deterrence, I would impose a sentence of two years' imprisonment. 

The s 50BC offence 

55The applicant relied on R v Wicks [2005] NSWCCA 409 at [39] (McClellan CJ at CL, Adams J and Hoeben J agreeing) in his Honour's identification of factors relevant to sentencing for child-related sexual activities: 

""[39] The decisions of appellate courts make plain that there are a number of common elements when sentencing offenders for child related sexual offences. General deterrence is of paramount importance ( R v Levi (1997) unreported, NSWCCA, 15 May 1997, R v D (1997) 69 SASR 413; R v AJW (2001) 80 SASR 246; Bell v R [2001] WASCA 40). Any abuse of a position of trust is considered to be an aggravating feature. Other relevant factors in sentencing for this type of offence include the type of conduct committed, the number of victims (see R v LLK (2003) 146 A Crim R 1), the number of occasions on which the offending occurred, the period of time over which the offending occurred and whether the offending was part of a course of conduct (see R v H [2001] NSWCCA 117)."" 

56Two other cases were referred to by way of comparable sentences: Assheton and Sage v R [2007] NSWCCA 224. 

57It can be accepted that the proper use of sentences in other cases is as described by Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 273 ALR 324 at 388-389 [303]-[305] (approved by the plurality in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 272 ALR 465 at 479 [54]). Using the cases referred to by way of assistance and as a yardstick, bearing in mind all the comments and findings of the sentencing judge, taking into account the circumstances of the offence and the matters in s 16A(2) and giving full weight to general and specific deterrence, I cannot but conclude that four years' imprisonment was manifestly excessive. 

58I fully appreciate that doing different sexual acts listed in s 50AC as part of the definition of ""sexual intercourse"" would take the offence into ss 50BA and 50BB carrying a maximum penalty of 17 years. The seriousness of the acts that do fall within s 50BC must, nevertheless, be evaluated. 

59The acts lasted for some minutes. The girl was 15 years old. There can be concluded to have been a degree of predation in that the women involved are, to use the words of the sentencing judge, ""of a class which finds itself open to manipulation for economic reasons"". That is reinforced, perhaps, by the presence of the mother. The nature and circumstances of the offence cannot, in my view, be characterised as of the most serious kind; nor, however, was the offence trivial. It was an offence of some seriousness within s 50BC. It is not to be viewed as isolated or an aberration. Taking into account the above matters, all the factors referred to in Wicks , the factors in s 16A, in particular the important, indeed paramount place of general deterrence, and for this applicant specific deterrence, and taking into account the age of the applicant, his ill-health, the absence of any prior criminal history and his plea of guilty, I am unable to conclude other than that four years' imprisonment was manifestly excessive. In my view, a sentence of three years and three months fully reflects the criminality involved and is the sentence that is appropriate in all the circumstances. 

60I would accumulate the sentences by six months. I would set a non-parole period of two years and six months. 

61In conclusion, these sentences, in my view, amply reflect the level of criminality involved and the important considerations of specific and general deterrence, in the context of pleas of guilty from a man over sixty with no prior criminal convictions. 

62The orders that I would make are: 

1. Grant leave to appeal. 

2. Allow the appeal. 

3. Set aside the sentences imposed on the applicant by the District Court on 23 July 2010 and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant as follows: 

(a) On count 1, and taking into account the additional offences which appeared on the schedule pursuant to the Crimes Act , s 16BA, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years to commence on 1 July 2010 and to expire on 30 June 2012. 

(b) On count 2, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years and three months to commence on 1 January 2011 and to expire on 31 March 2014. 

(c) A non-parole period of two years and six months is fixed, the applicant thereby being eligible for parole on 31 December 2012. 

(d) As to the matter under the Criminal Procedure Act , s 166 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for three months to commence on 1 July 2010. 

63SIMPSON J : I have read in draft the judgment of Allsop P. I am unable to agree that the sentences imposed were (or either of them was) manifestly excessive. Since no other specific error was propounded, it follows that, while I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal. 

64It is unnecessary to restate the facts and circumstances of the offences, or the complicated legislative regime under which the applicant was judged and sentenced. I can therefore state my position with relative brevity. 

65I bear in mind what the President has said at [45]. However, it is always necessary to make an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence in question. Objective gravity can be measured against the range of conduct that falls within the legislative provision that creates the offence. 

66In the case of the Crimes Act 1914 offence, of committing an act of indecency on a person under the age 16, that legislative provision was s 50BC, prescribing a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. What is important is that an ""act of indecency"" is defined in s 50AB as follows: 

"" ... an act that: 

(a) is of a sexual nature; and 

(b) involves the human body, or bodily actions or functions; and 

(c) is so unbecoming or offensive that it amounts to a gross breach of ordinary contemporary standards of decency and propriety in the Australian community."" 

To avoid doubt, subs (2) specifies that an act of indecency includes an indecent assault. 

67In my opinion, recognition of the range of conduct that could come within that description demonstrates that the objective gravity of this offence was high. There exists a range of conduct well below what is illustrated in the DVDs that would constitute an offence under s 50BC. 

68It is also relevant to have regard to the other offences created by Pt IIIA of the Crimes Act , of which s 50BC is a part. They include engaging in sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 (s 50BA), and inducing a person under the age of 16 to engage in sexual intercourse with a third person (s 50BB). Each of these offences carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 17 years. What is informative, for present purposes, however, is the definition of ""sexual intercourse"", since that establishes the boundaries of conduct that constitute a more serious offence than the s 50BC offence. By s 50AC, ""sexual intercourse"" is defined as: 

""(a) the penetration, to any extent, of the vagina or anus of a person by any part of the body of another person; or 

(b) the penetration, to any extent, of the vagina or anus of a person, carried out by another person by an object; or 

(c) fellatio; or 

(d) cunnilingus; or 

(e) the continuation of any activity mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d)."" 

69I find it difficult to envisage sexual conduct more serious than that in which the applicant engaged that would not come within that definition. That persuades me that the conduct here in question was of the most serious kind contemplated by s 50BC. 

70While I accept, as the President has said, that the offence itself was constituted by the kissing of the victim's breasts, I do not accept that the surrounding circumstances are irrelevant. This was a sustained act of indecency, accompanied by lascivious and predatory commentary. The exercise of power is clearly depicted on the DVD recording. 

71Against that, and in favour of the applicant, is the age of the victim, 15 years. In my opinion Woods DCJ was correct to treat this as the circumstance most favourable to the applicant in terms of the assessment of objective gravity. Of course, the younger the victim, the more serious the offence. 

72Other relevant circumstances, those referred to in s 16A of the Crimes Act, pertaining to the sentencing exercise were the age of the applicant, his relative ill-health, the absence of any prior criminal history, and, of course, his plea of guilty. Those are the reasons that the sentence imposed was one third of the maximum prescribed. 

73It is rather more difficult to measure the Customs Act 1901 offence, of importing prohibited material, against the range of conduct that falls within the offence, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Anecdotally, one hears or reads of pornography of a vastly greater degree of depravity than the DVDs here in question. I am prepared to accept that these DVDs were not high on that scale of depravity. It is, however, relevant that there were two different DVDs, each replicated twice (a total of three of each). 

74In my opinion, the sentence imposed in respect of the Customs Act offence was, by reference to its objective gravity, relatively severe. But bearing in mind the strictures pronounced in Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665, at [15], I am unable to conclude that it was outside the legitimate range of sentences available. 

75I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 

76BUDDIN J: I agree with Allsop P.

2757689,Sutton v NSW State Parole Authority [2011] NSWSC 935,"Judgment 
1William Lewis Sutton applies to the Court for a direction to the NSW State Parole Authority that the information on which the Authority based its decision to refuse his release on parole was false, misleading, or irrelevant. 
2The application is permitted by the provisions of s 155 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. 
3The Authority has filed a submitting appearance. The Attorney General for the State of New South Wales was granted leave to intervene and has been the contradictor on the application. 
4For the reasons set out below I have decided that the application should be dismissed. 
Nature of application 
5The application is brought solely pursuant to the provisions of s 155 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act . It is not an application for prerogative relief. 
6It is necessary to understand the restrictive nature of an application of this kind. It is appropriate to commence with the legislation. 
7Section 155 is in the following form: 
"" 155 Application to Supreme Court by offender : 
(1) If: 
(a) the Parole Authority decides that an offender should not be released on parole, and 
(b) the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information, 
the offender may, in accordance with the rules of the court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information is false, misleading or irrelevant. 
(2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit. 
(3) An application under this section is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application. 
(4) This section does not give the Supreme Court jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Parole Authority's decision otherwise than on the grounds referred to in subsection (1)."" 
8The operative terms of this section are in substantially identical form to the terms of s 23 of the Sentencing Act 1989, which has now been repealed. However, there are a number of authorities dealing with those earlier provisions that are apt to apply to the section under consideration. 
9The authorities establish these propositions: 
(a)An application for a direction from this Court to the Authority, is not an appeal, or any form of an appeal against the decision of the Authority: McPherson v Offenders Review Board (1991) 23 NSWLR 61 at [69C] per Hunt J (Meagher JA, Studdert J agreeing); 
(b)An application for a direction from this Court to the Authority is not concerned with whether the Authority acted in accordance with the statute, because it is not a proceeding in the nature of an administrative proceeding seeking prerogative relief: LMS v Parole Board (1999) 110 A Crim R 172 at [8] per Stein JA, Hulme and James JJ; 
(c)The role of this court in considering an application of this kind is extremely limited. It can only consider whether information given to the Authority was false, misleading or irrelevant. And then only if that information is a basis for the decision which was made: R v Naudi [2003] NSWCCA 160 at [19] per Simpson J (Hodgson JA and James J agreeing); Lee v State Parole Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 1225 per Johnson J; 
(d)On the hearing of an application, this Court is not concerned with any questions as to the merits of the decision of the Authority, or with what weight it placed on various factors: Radford v Parole Board [2002] NSWCCA 70 at [36], McCallum v Parole Board of NSW [2003] NSWCCA 294 at [33], DCU v State Parole Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 526 at [5]-[7] per Johnson J; 
(e)At the hearing of an application, this Court is not concerned with the thought processes of the Authority, or its findings based on the information before it: McCafferty v Offenders Review Board (Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 June 1995, unreported) per James J (Gleeson CJ and Ireland J agreeing); 
(f)The term ""information"" in s 155 is not used in any broad sense. It is used in the sense of factual information, namely information going to the characteristics of the offence and the offender and all factual matters relevant to whether or not it may be appropriate to order a release on parole: Attorney General for New South Wales v New South Wales State Parole Authority [2006] NSWSC 865 at [73] per McClellan CJ at CL, Lee at [14]; 
(g)In hearing an application, the Court needs to be satisfied that the information was false or misleading in substance. This will usually require evidence in addition to that which was before the Authority to discharge the onus on the applicant: Rozynski v Parole Board of New South Wales [2003] NSWCCA 214 at [13] per Greg James J (Hodgson JA and Simpson J agreeing) 
10I will bear these principles in mind in considering this application. 
Decisions of NSW State Parole Authority 
11The first decision by the NSW State Parole Authority was made on 12 November 2010. 
12On that day it made a decision not to release the applicant on parole. 
13It gave its reasons as follows: 
""REASON/S: Unlikely to adapt to normal community life [unwillingness to comply with conditions of parole, lengthy violent history, lengthy criminal history, previous offence similar to current index offence, prior revocations of parole and poor response on previous community supervision], risk of re-offending [reoffended and received a custodial sentence on last parole order and limited participation in relevant programs], needs to address offending behaviour (Therapeutic) [needs to participate in therapeutic program to address violence eg VOTP etc and needs to participate in therapeutic programs that address alcohol and other drugs problems eg Ngara Nura, Phoenix] and need for post release accommodation [no suitable post release accommodation]."" 
14On 22 November 2010 the applicant applied to the Authority to reconsider its decision to refuse his release on parole. In that application, the applicant included the following statement: 
""I do not agree with the information that has been given to the Parole Authority ...: 
Information used & conclusions made are incorrect. 
- eg - never reoffended on parole 
- eg - have never refused to comply with any future order of parole 
- eg - have never refused classification to proceed thru (sic) system."" 
15Other information was provided. 
16On 3 December 2010, the Authority met to consider the application for a review hearing lodged by the applicant. 
17It determined on that day that it was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Sutton's release was appropriate in the public interest. Its decision then read: 
""In deciding that the release of the offender is not appropriate in the public interest, the Parole Authority has regard to the following matters: 
Unlikely to adapt to normal community life [unwillingness to comply with conditions of parole, lengthy violent history, lengthy criminal history, previous offence similar to current index offence, prior revocations of parole and poor response on previous community supervision], risk of re-offending [reoffended and received a custodial sentence on last parole order and limited participation in relevant programs], needs to address offending behaviour (Therapeutic) [needs to participate in therapeutic program to address violence eg VOTP etc and needs to participate in therapeutic programs that address alcohol and other drugs problems eg Ngara Nura, Phoenix] and need for post release accommodation [no suitable post release accommodation]. "" 
18It is to be observed that the Parole Authority has used precisely the same words to explain why it has refused to release Mr Sutton on parole on each of the two occasions, namely 12 November 2010 and 3 December 2010. 
19The evidence on this application satisfies me that the factual material that was put before the Parole Authority was identical on each occasion with the exception that on the second occasion, the applicant's application for reconsideration was also before the Parole Authority. 
20That material comprised: 
(a)NSW Police Force, Criminal history - bail report dated 28 September 2010; 
(b)Remarks on Sentence of O'Connor QC DCJ dated 3 November 2009; 
(c)Probation and Parole Service, Pre Release Report dated 1 November 2010; and 
(d)NSW Department of Corrective Services, Parole Authority Offender Report. 
21Although in the course of argument before the Court neither party discriminated between the two decisions made by the Parole Authority, it is necessary in an application of this kind for the Court to have regard to one only of the decisions. It seems to me that the appropriate decision to which I ought to have regard for the purpose of identifying whether any of the information was false, misleading or irrelevant, is the second of the two decisions. That is, the decision which is the last in point of time, and finally determines the applicant's status. 
Information said to be false 
22Mr Sutton submitted that there were a number of pieces of information said to be false upon which the Authority based its decision. It is appropriate to review each of these. 
""Offending during last parole period"" 
23As indicated in [ 17 ] above, the Authority's reasons disclosed that it was of the opinion that one basis for its decision that Mr Sutton's release was not appropriate in the public interest was that there was a risk of his re-offending. The basis of that conclusion was that he had "" reoffended and received a custodial sentence on last parole order "". There was an additional reason, namely that he had engaged in relevant programs to a limited extent. 
24Mr Sutton submits that the reference to the fact that he had re-offended and received a custodial sentence on his last parole order was incorrect. 
25The Attorney General concedes that this was an incorrect statement. 
26There was no information before the Authority which expressly stated that Mr Sutton had re-offended while subject to his last parole and had received a custodial sentence. The information before the Authority, on the contrary, indicated that he had last been sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court on 13 June 2003 for two offences of breaking and entering a building and stealing therefrom. For these offences he was sentenced, in total, to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. His sentence commenced on 25 February 2003. The earliest date upon which he could be released from prison on parole was 24 February 2005. The entire sentence concluded on 24 February 2007, namely, two years after he was released to parole. 
27On the Parole Authority Offender Report before the Authority, it was indicated that Mr Sutton had been released to parole on 29 March 2006. That record also shows that he was taken back into custody on 26 March 2008. This was a period of time well after his parole period had expired. 
28However, the records do disclose that on the occasion before his release on parole in 2006, after he had been released to parole on 18 October 2002 for a period of six months, Mr Sutton had re-offended and been arrested and returned to custody on 27 February 2003. 
29As well, the material before the Authority indicated that on occasions in 1985, 1992, 1996, 1998, 2001 and, as I have just mentioned, in 2003, Mr Sutton had breached his parole conditions by committing further offences, and had been returned to custody. 
30Hence it can be seen that the error, assuming it to be part of the factual information upon which the Authority acted, was not to have inserted the description "" second-last "" in referring to the parole order rather than the word "" last "". 
31Again, assuming without deciding, that this sentence represents information of the kind to which s 155 is addressed, I need to decide whether this is an error of substance or of mere form. 
32The issue to be determined by the Authority, to which this information was relevant, was Mr Sutton's risk of re-offending. Having regard to Mr Sutton's appalling history of breaching parole and committing further offences on six occasions over 23 years, there was abundant evidence to support the conclusion made by the Authority that Mr Sutton had a risk of reoffending which meant that it should not release him to parole. 
33In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the error is one of substance. Whether the applicant reoffended whilst out on parole on the second-last, or last occasion, in light of his history was a peripheral not central issue. 
Probation and Parole Service Pre Release Report 
34Mr Sutton submits that the Probation and Parole Pre Release Service Report contained information that was false or misleading. 
35He submits that the Court ought to infer that the contents of the Report, and in particular, the erroneous and misleading parts of it, amounted to information which formed the basis of the Authority's decision. 
36It is necessary to examine the material to see if that is so. 
37On page four of the report, Mr John Bell, the Probation and Parole Officer who was the author of the report, records this: 
""Mr Sutton described the actual victim in unflattering terms and had nothing positive to say about him. He said his only mistake lay in allowing such a 'grub' into his life. He expressed some sympathy for the victim's partner and child."" 
38Mr Sutton contends in his submissions that he did not use the description "" grub "" to Mr Bell when he was describing the victim of his current offence. 
39It is unnecessary for me to resolve the issue of whether or not Mr Sutton used the term because there is nothing about the contents of this extract that can be discerned as forming the basis for the Authority's decision. In other words, it is not demonstrated that this is a matter in which a direction can be given. 
40On page five, Mr Bell records this: 
""He admitted to some cannabis use during his last period of parole however it was not identified as a factor in his offending behaviour."" 
41Mr Sutton submits that he did not say to Mr Bell that he had used cannabis and submitted that the fact was he had not used cannabis. 
42Again, it is unnecessary for me to resolve this issue because the Authority did not use that statement, or the fact of cannabis use by Mr Sutton during his last period of parole as the basis for any decision which it made. 
43On page six, Mr Sutton complains that the following entry 
""RISK OF REOFFENDING 
Administration of Instruments. 
The LSI-R (Level of Service Inventory - Revised) risk assessment instrument was administered to Mr Sutton in February 2010, recording a raw score of 42/54 (High)."" 
is false because no risk assessment instrument was administered to him in February 2010 nor at any other time. 
44Annexure H to Mr Robert Cosman's affidavit, which was read in these proceedings, is a series of case note reports obtained from the NSW Department of Corrective Services. These case note reports were not before the Parole Authority. 
45One case note report, dated 1 February 2010, is said to describe an LSIR/CP interview of that day. It is an extensive note completed by the staff member. The note does not record that this or any other test was administered during the interview. 
46On the contrary, it says this: 
""NB: I was somewhat distracted by inmate's resistance and disdain for current legal system and forgot to complete recent OIDF. However, it is likely that he would not have cooperated with interview (as has happened in the past). Given his presentation, I have partially completed OIDF based on info in his case history file such as recent psych report (Sept 09)."" 
47On the following day, 2 February 2010, a further note appears. It says: 
""Discussion with DM ... regarding case note 1/2/2010. She advised to complete LSIR/CP as info in case history and as long as it adequately reflects his level of risk."" 
48On 18 February 2010, a further case note appears apparently completed by a different staff member from the first two case notes. This note includes the following remarks: 
""Unable to vet LSI-R, as OIDF is incomplete ... File has been handed to supervising PPO to complete OIDF before vetting."" 
49The combination of these notes demonstrate clearly that the statement in Mr Bell's Report that the LSI-R Risk Assessment Instrument was "" administered "" to Mr Sutton is misleading, if what it intended to convey was that the administration of the instrument was done personally during the interview. What in fact occurred was that the instrument was not administered personally to him but rather information gathered in part from the interview and in part from his file, was combined in an unidentified way, to form the basis of the assessment. 
50Neither the Parole Authority at the hearing, nor this Court on Mr Sutton's application, was given the actual assessment form. It is not possible, in the absence of that form, or some evidence about its content, to form any view about whether personal administration was a necessary, let alone essential, part of reaching the score recorded. 
51In the absence of any evidence about whether personal administration, as opposed to calculation of a score based upon objectively ascertainable facts was a necessary or integral part of the assessment process, I cannot conclude that this "" misleading "" statement was in any way relevant to, let alone that it formed, the basis for the Authority's determination. 
52Whilst the risk of re-offending was one of the matters to which the Parole Authority had regard in deciding against the release of Mr Sutton, the form of the Parole Authority's decision does not clearly identify what information that conclusion was based upon. There was clearly much material available to the Authority upon which to come to that conclusion. In those circumstances, I would not be prepared to conclude that such information as formed the basis of the Authority's decision, was misleading. 
53Mr Sutton raised a number of other complaints about the contents of this report including that he had not expressed any interest in the Restorative Justice Program, that his employment history was incorrect and that he had failed to initiate an assessment by a psychologist. 
54I am not satisfied that to the extent that these matters are reported, they are in error and that falsity has been demonstrated by compelling evidence. The comments made in the report are, in any event, not relevant to the basis for the Parole Authority's decision. 
Irrelevant material 
55Mr Sutton submitted that the Parole Authority had relied upon irrelevant material. The Parole Authority's decisions includes reference to Mr Sutton's limited participation in relevant programs and the fact that he needed to address his offending behaviour by participating in therapeutic programs which addressed violence, alcohol and other drug problems. 
56Mr Sutton submitted, at length, that this material was irrelevant because he had been prevented from undertaking those programs by one or more factors, including the lack of availability of the programs, the timing of the programs being unsuitable having regard to his earliest release date from custody, the fact that entry into the programs was dependant upon a referral from a psychologist and he was not able to organise such a referral and, lastly, that his classification within the prison system meant that he was confined in institutions where the courses were not readily available, particularly for prisoners of his classification. 
57I do not think that these submissions demonstrate that the information is not relevant. What is clearly relevant to a decision on parole is not why Mr Sutton did not do the courses but rather that he had not done them. From the point of view of the Parole Authority, which is considering whether it is appropriate in the public interest to release Mr Sutton on parole, it is entitled to have regard to the completed courses which may assist in his rehabilitation into the community. The fact is, and remains, that he has not completed the various courses. That was a relevant matter for the Parole Authority to have regard. It did so in a wholly unexceptional way. 
Conclusion 
58I am not satisfied that in any respect the information before the State Parole Authority was false or misleading, in a way which satisfies the legal principles applicable to applications under s 155 of the Crimes (Administration of sentences) Act . 
Orders 
(a)The application filed 17 February 2011 for directions pursuant to s 155 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 is dismissed.

2757713,Jehad Jodeh v R [2011] NSWCCA 194,"Judgment 

1McClellan CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J. 

2Johnson J: I agree with McCallum J. 

3McCallum J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon Mr Jehad Jodeh after he pleaded guilty in the District Court to three offences of robbery armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(1)(b) of the Act (as it stood in December 2006). The maximum penalty for the offence of armed robbery is 25 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty in respect of the charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm was 7 years imprisonment. At the time of the offences, there was no standard non-parole period prescribed for either offence. 

4Mr Jodeh was sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment: 

(a) for the first offence of armed robbery, to a fixed term of imprisonment of four years commencing on 24 September 2007 and expiring on 23 September 2011; 

(b) for the second offence of armed robbery, to a fixed term of four and a half years imprisonment commencing two years into the first sentence, that is, on 24 September 2009 and expiring on 23 March 2014; 

(c) for the charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing three years into the second sentence, that is, on 24 September 2012 and expiring on 23 September 2014; 

(d) for the third armed robbery offence, to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years commencing one year into the third sentence, that is, on 24 September 2013 and expiring on 23 September 2018. The balance of term for that offence was five years, giving a total sentence of 10 years imprisonment. 

5The effect of the sentences is that Mr Jodeh is to commence serving the non-parole period of the last sentence six years after the commencement of the first sentence. The total effective non-parole period is accordingly 11 years imprisonment and the total effective sentence is 16 years imprisonment. 

6In passing sentence for the charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, the learned sentencing Judge took into account a charge of possessing ammunition without a licence or permit on a ""Form 1"" in accordance with the procedure contemplated in s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. A second Form 1 listed an offence of knowingly being carried in a stolen conveyance, which the Judge took into account when sentencing Mr Jodeh for the third armed robbery offence. 

Facts of the offences 

7All of the offences were very serious. The first armed robbery was committed on 9 October 2006 in the car park of a McDonald's restaurant at Enfield. The victim was a cash-in-transit security guard. He was in plain clothes and was using his own private car. He had collected $29,000 in cash from the manager of the restaurant and had returned to his car when he saw in his rear view mirror a yellow motorbike with a rider and a pillion passenger. The rider was the applicant. The pillion passenger was a man by the name of Abdul Baghdadi. 

8Mr Baghdadi was armed with a .38 calibre, long-barrelled revolver. He went to the driver's side door and demanded the money, pointing the firearm at the security guard. The judge at first instance sentenced the applicant on the basis that he was in joint possession of the firearm, but accepted that the first he knew of it was when it was presented to the victim by Mr Baghdadi. The offenders left the scene on the motorbike. They were observed later that day under police surveillance buying a large amount of shoes and clothes at Westfield Shopping Centre in Parramatta. 

9The second armed robbery was committed two days later. The applicant and Mr Baghdadi went together to a BP service station, again on the yellow motorbike. They went to a GM Cab office located within the service station, where Mr Baghdadi pointed a revolver over the counter and discharged a round into the office area. Mr Baghdadi yelled at the victim to open to the door, which the victim attempted to do, without success. Mr Baghdadi then discharged three or four further rounds into the door. He again demanded that the victim open the door, which the victim again was unable to do. Finally, Mr Baghdadi kicked the door open and took $17,000 in cash from the office, together with a number of cab-charge and credit card dockets. The applicant was standing in the doorway to the office area throughout. The offenders left on the yellow motorbike. 

10In respect of the second offence, the Judge sentenced the applicant on the basis that he knew, prior to the robbery, that Mr Baghdadi was in possession of a firearm. His Honour was not, however, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew, before it was fired, that the firearm was loaded. 

11The third offence in order of time was the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, which was committed on 27 December 2006. At about 4.45 am that day, the offender and four unknown males described as being ""of Islander and Middle Eastern appearance"" attempted to force entry to a nightclub by barging past the doorman. When the doorman tried to stop them, they set upon him, punching him to the head and body many times. 

12About 20 minutes later, the applicant and two of the males from the earlier incident returned to the nightclub, where they again attacked the doorman. On the second occasion, while the doorman was being punched to the head and body by the other two men, the applicant ran in from 3 or 4 metres away and began kicking the doorman to the body. His acts were captured on CCTV footage, which clearly depicted him and both other men punching and kicking the doorman. As a result of their punches and kicks, the doorman was knocked to the ground and was unconscious for a number of seconds. He sustained serious injuries including a punctured lung that required surgery, fractured ribs, a fractured nose, a damaged kidney and bruising and swelling to the head. He was admitted to hospital for a period of two and a half weeks. 

13The Form 1 offence taken into account in the sentence passed in respect of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm related to two rounds of ammunition found by police in a drawer in the applicant's bedroom when they executed a search warrant on 18 January 2007. 

14The applicant was arrested on 29 January 2007 after voluntarily attending Kings Cross police station in relation to the assault on the doorman at the nightclub and the offence of possessing ammunition. He was granted bail the following day. On 31 January 2007, he was arrested in relation to the first two offences of armed robbery. He was again granted bail the following day. 

15It follows that the fourth offence (the third armed robbery) was committed whilst the applicant was on bail for the other three. The circumstances of the fourth offence are the most serious of all. On 10 September 2007, the applicant and two others robbed a security guard while he and another guard were returning to an Armaguard van with sealed security bags containing $72,241 in cash. The three offenders were in a van which had been stolen, giving rise to the second Form 1 offence. One of the men remained in the driver's seat of the van. The other two got out of the van. Each was armed and was wearing a balaclava. One of the armed men held a gun to the side of the security guard's face. At some point, one of the firearms was discharged but fortunately, the security guards sustained only minor injuries. 

16Police were called immediately and recovered the stolen van. DNA recovered from items found in the van identified all three offenders. The Crown could not say which of the three men was the applicant. The Judge was satisfied to the requisite standard that the applicant knew there was a firearm in the possession of at least one of his co-offenders but was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew the firearm was loaded. 

Subjective circumstances of the offender 

17The applicant was aged 18 at the time of the first three offences and 19 at the time of the fourth offence. He had no prior convictions. There was evidence before the court that he had enjoyed a good education and a strong family upbringing. 

18The applicant's case on sentence was that his previously happy life had taken a severe downhill turn after he was involved in a motorbike accident at the age of 17. He suffered serious injuries as a result of that accident including a fractured leg, injuries to the back and evidently some damage to one knee. He had been in hospital for nine days following the accident and had undergone a series of surgical procedures then and later. 

19The applicant did not give evidence at the proceedings on sentence. He wrote a letter to the court in which he stated that the motorbike accident left him very confused and disoriented, causing him to suffer from depression, anxiety and mental and physical pain. This, he said, had led to the use of marijuana, cocaine and ice, which led him to a path of crime. 

20Those contentions were supported by a letter from the applicant's older sister who was made available for cross-examination but was not cross-examined. At the time of writing to the court, she had completed a degree in psychology. She stated that, prior to the accident, the applicant had been vibrant, funny and friendly and had a high sense of morals and religion. She said that, after the accident, his personality slowly began to change. She said that he could not tolerate the pain he was in and that his prescribed medication (200 gm of Tramal three times a day) was not working for him. 

21Apart from a series of highly favourable character references, there was also tendered at the hearing a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Bruce Westmore, and a report of a psychologist, Mr Chris Probets. 

22Dr Westmore's report had been prepared for the purpose of Mr Jodeh's civil proceedings arising out of the motor vehicle accident, but he expressly referred to the connection between those events and the present offences. Dr Westmore said: 

I also expressed the view that [the applicant's] criminal legal team should be alerted to the fact that I am of the opinion that the motorbike accident is likely to have had a significant impact on his mood state prior to the offending behaviour and the offending behaviour may have been influenced in a significant way because of his depression and his illicit drug use. I note his history that he had no problems with the police prior to the motorbike accident and he denies absolutely using any illicit drugs prior to the motorbike accident. These are matters which are likely to be highly relevant to any sentencing court. 

23Dr Westmore concluded that the applicant was developing psychological and psychiatric injuries following the motorbike accident. He expressed the view that the accident would have had an impact upon the applicant because it affected his capacity to work and he also developed symptoms of pain leading to the use of illicit drugs, which would have adversely affected his mood. 

24The psychologist, Mr Probets, agreed with Dr Westmore's conclusion. He said: 
I agree entirely with Dr Westmore on both grounds that Jehad Jodeh's mental state at the time of the offences was closely tied to, and is probably entirely due to, the combination of his difficulty controlling his mood swings and particularly his depression following the motorcycle accident and his illicit drug use that occurred as a result of this motorcycle accident and the resulting pain and disabilities. While the drugs enabled Jehad Jodeh to reduce his pain and gain some control over his moods, it also reduced his ability to make sound and rational judgements and decisions. I also agree that he does not have an antisocial personality disorder and, in my opinion, this makes the possibility of re-offending much less likely. 


Ground 1: relevance of the motorbike accident in assessing moral culpability 

25The first ground of appeal is: 

His Honour, when determining the objective seriousness of the offences, erred in failing to give sufficient weight, if any, to the fact that the offending was motivated by a drug addiction, which was caused by an event for which the applicant was not primarily responsible. 

26The Judge said: 

I am unable to see how the offender's deliberate decision to resort to the use of illicit drugs to manage pain reduces, to any significant extent, his culpability in the commission of these serious armed robbery offences. 

27Separately, his Honour accepted that the applicant's drug use did contribute to his offending in that it clearly affected his judgment. However, his Honour reiterated his view that it did not reduce his criminal responsibility to any significant degree. 

28It was acknowledged on behalf of the applicant that the circumstances in which an addiction to drugs will be a mitigating factor are limited. It was submitted, however, that the applicant fell into the ""rare category"" described by Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [273]: 

It may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance, in so far as the origin or extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it might: 
... 
(ii) suggest that the addiction was not a matter of personal choice, but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, for example, where it arose as the result of the medical prescription of potentially addictive drugs following injury, illness or surgery ... or where it occurred at a very young age, or in a person whose mental or intellectual capacity was impaired, so that their ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete. 


29In my view, it was open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the circumstances revealed in the evidence relied upon by the applicant did not fall within that category. It must be borne in mind that his Honour was not determining a question of causation of the kind that arises in a civil claim. The task was to assess the moral culpability of the offender's conduct in the commission of a criminal offence. That is very much a question within the judgment of a sentencing judge. 

30It may be accepted that the consequences of the motorbike accident inflicted pain and hardship on the applicant and one could readily conclude that the accident was, in that sense, a contributing factor in the development of the addiction. 

31The applicant's submissions put the matter considerably higher than that, contending that ""it was only in the use of prohibited drugs that the applicant was able to seek refuge"". The evidence did not sustain that contention. In that respect there is force, in my view, in the contention put by the Crown that the absence of any evidence from the applicant himself was significant. 

32Particularly (in light of the applicant's decision not to give evidence) there was little basis on which the Judge could assess the extent to which the applicant was troubled by pain on a regular basis in the period leading up to the offences. He was evidently able to ride a motorbike on the days of the first two armed robberies. There was no evidence that he made any attempt to address the issues of pain and depression with professional assistance and legally-prescribed drugs. Although the letter from the applicant's sister identified the drug he had been prescribed, and asserted that it did not provide adequate pain relief, there was no ability for the Judge to assess the strength of those contentions. 

33The inference it is contended the Judge ought to have drawn is that the pain was so great that the applicant's ability to exercise appropriate judgment whether to adopt the habit of taking illegal drugs was ""incomplete"". In my view, that inference was barely open on the evidence put before the Judge, and it certainly cannot be concluded that it was the only inference available. It was plainly open to the Judge, in my view, to reject the proposition that the applicant was deprived of free will in the circumstances. His Honour did not overlook the relevant evidence. He considered it carefully, and rejected the conclusion contended for. I see no error in that approach. Ground 1 must be rejected. 

Ground 2: parity 

34The second ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant is: 

The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender Abdul Baghdadi. 

35Mr Baghdadi and the applicant were co-offenders in respect of the first two armed robberies. The principle of equal justice requires that there should not be, as between them, a marked disparity such as to give rise to ""a justifiable sense of grievance"": Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ. 

36On 18 December 2007, Mr Baghdadi was sentenced by Ellis DCJ for a slate of offences including the first offence under consideration in the present appeal (the McDonald's robbery). He was also sentenced for a number of offences which did not involve the applicant. The individual sentence imposed upon him for the McDonald's robbery was a term of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of three years and six months. That sentence was subsequently increased following a successful Crown appeal to a term of imprisonment of seven years with a non-parole period of four years: R v Baghdadi [2008] NSWCCA 239 at [63] per McClellan CJ at CL, R S Hulme and Hidden JJ agreeing at [64] and [69] respectively. 

37The applicant was sentenced on 13 May 2009, after the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The sentence imposed upon the applicant for the McDonald's robbery was a fixed term of imprisonment of four years. In the case of a fixed term, the appropriate comparator is the non-parole period imposed on Mr Baghdadi: R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346 at [161], cited with approval in Hristovski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 at [65] per Johnson J. The sentences are accordingly to be regarded as being the same. 

38For the second offence (the GM Cabs robbery), the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of four years and six months commencing two years after the commencement of the term imposed in respect of the first count. Mr Baghdadi had not been sentenced for that offence at the time sentence was passed on the applicant. He was sentenced for that offence (again together with other offences not involving the applicant) by Armitage DCJ on 21 August 2009. The sentence imposed for the GM Cabs robbery was a term of imprisonment of nine years with a non-parole period of five years. I did not understand the applicant to contend that there was marked disparity between the sentences imposed on the two offenders for that offence. 

39In sentencing the applicant for the McDonald's robbery, the Judge accepted that Mr Baghdadi's involvement was objectively more serious than that of the applicant, since Mr Baghdadi was the person in possession of the firearm and, plainly, the person who brought it to the scene of the robbery. 

40The Judge rejected a submission on behalf of the applicant that Mr Baghdadi's subjective case was not as strong as the applicant's. His Honour noted that, unlike the applicant, Mr Baghdadi had a significant cognitive deficit and a deprived upbringing without the advantages of family support enjoyed by the applicant. His Honour accepted, as submitted on behalf of the Crown, that looking at both cases objectively and subjectively, the two were comparable. I do not think it has been demonstrated in this appeal that his Honour's conclusion was not open to him. 

41It must also be borne in mind that Mr Baghdadi was given a discount for an early plea of 25% in respect of the McDonald's robbery, whereas the applicant entered his plea at a later point and received a discount of only 15%. Further, as acknowledged on behalf of the applicant, the principle of double jeopardy would have caused this Court to exercise restraint in re-sentencing Mr Baghdadi following the successful Crown appeal. 

42In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed upon the applicant for the McDonald's robbery is such to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on account of the sentence imposed upon Mr Baghdadi for the same offence. 

43Separately, the applicant sought to mount an argument as to disparity by reference to the aggregate sentences imposed on each offender. As the matters recited above reveal, however, the circumstances of each are too different to yield any sensible comparison. In particular, the principle of totality would have operated very differently in respect of each offender. 

44In my view, ground 2 must fail. 

Ground 3: extra-curial punishment 

45The third ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant is: 

His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that the applicant would suffer extra-curial punishment, due to the effect his conviction would have upon his ability to recover damages in respect of his motorcycle accident. 

46This ground of appeal was based on the fact that, prior to the time of his sentencing, the applicant had retained solicitors to commence civil proceedings for damages arising from the motorbike accident, including damages for future economic loss. It was submitted at first instance that the sentencing Judge ought to have taken into account, as extra-curial punishment, the fact that the applicant's incarceration would diminish his ability to recover such loss. 

47The Judge rejected the submission. His Honour said: 

It is clear that any such economic loss suffered by the offender was brought upon the offender directly by his deliberate decision to embark upon a serious course of criminal offending, knowing that he had civil proceedings pending. Those civil proceedings involving a claim for damages for injuries including a claim for future economic loss. Whilst I am prepared to allow some amount of mitigation for this factor, that mitigation must in the circumstances be minimal. 

48In my view, this ground is misconceived and it is doubtful whether the applicant was entitled even to the minimal amount of mitigation allowed by the judge on that account. 

49As noted on behalf of the applicant, the principle which allows extra-curial punishment to be taken into account in mitigation of an otherwise appropriate sentence was explained in R v Hannigan (2009) 193 A Crim R 399 at [25] per Chesterman JA as follows: 

[T]he theory which underlies the relevance of extra-curial punishment to sentence is that it deters an offender from re-offending by providing a reminder of the unhappy consequence of criminal misconduct, or it leaves the offender with a disability, some affliction, which is a consequence of criminal activity. In such cases one can see that a purpose of sentencing by the court, deterrence or retribution, has been partly achieved. 

50The attempt to characterise the loss of an entitlement to a component of damages in the civil proceedings as extra-curial punishment misconceives the nature of an award of damages in personal injury proceedings. Although such an award comes as a lump sum, its purpose is to compensate an injured person for future loss caused by the negligence of the defendant. It remains open to the applicant to contend in the civil proceedings that the motorbike accident caused the commission of the present offences. For that reason alone, the existence of any extra-curial punishment has not been determined. 

51However, even if the applicant is awarded a lower amount for future loss of income as a result of having been in prison rather than in the community earning money for the period of his sentence, I think it is wrong to characterise the consequential reduction in any award of damages in the civil proceedings as extra-curial punishment. It would simply mean that the amount of compensation to which he was entitled was less because the future loss was less. The absence of an entitlement to compensation does not, in my view, amount to punishment. Ground 3 must be rejected. 

Grounds 4 and 5: accumulation and manifestly excessive sentence 

52It is convenient to consider the fourth and fifth grounds of appeal together. They are that his Honour erred in accumulating the individual sentences to the extent provided for in his Honour's judgment and that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive. 

53The applicant submitted that, putting aside his complaints about the individual sentences imposed, the sentence arrived at through the process of partial accumulation resulted in a sentence which was excessive. 

54As already noted, his Honour allowed a total period of six years' accumulation. The sentence imposed in respect of the third armed robbery was almost wholly consecutive upon those imposed in respect of the first three offences, overlapping by one year. The applicant submitted that the degree of accumulation added considerably to the severity of the sentences and was not warranted. It was submitted that the total sentence imposed will have a crushing effect upon the applicant and so in fact be counter-productive to the objects of sentencing. 

55There is authority to support the proposition that the totality principle should be applied so as to obviate the imposition of a ""crushing"" sentence. In R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [17], the Court said: 

[One] matter that is considered under the totality principle is the proposition that an extremely long total sentence may be ""crushing"" upon the offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform. 

56The applicant also relied upon the remarks of King CJ in R v Rossi (Court of Criminal Appeal, SA 20 April 1988, unreported) (cited with approval in Kelly v R (1992) 33 FCR 536, 541 per O'Loughlin J): 

There is a principle of sentencing known as the principle of totality, which enables a court to mitigate what strict justice would otherwise indicate, where the total effect of the sentences merited by the individual crimes becomes so crushing as to call for the merciful intervention of the court by way of reducing the total effect. 

57The principle calls for a judgment as to the likely effect on the offender of the total sentence imposed, taking into account the circumstances of the individual case and having due regard to the objects of sentencing. Plainly, there will be cases in which, although the effect of the sentences imposed may readily be viewed as being likely to have a crushing effect on the offender, the circumstances of the offences nonetheless require such sentences to be imposed. Each case must be considered on its own facts. 

58With great respect to the sentencing judge, I have concluded that, although each individual sentence in the present case was plainly warranted, the degree of accumulation was excessive in the circumstances, and resulted in an aggregate sentence that will be so crushing upon the applicant as to risk undermining the objects of sentencing. I accept that these are complex and often controversial judgments. I also accept that the cases in which this Court should interfere with such a judgment by a sentencing judge should be rare. 

59There is no doubting the seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant, nor that condign punishment is warranted. The overriding considerations that have led me to the view I have reached are the applicant's youth at the time he sustained serious injuries in a motor vehicle accident, the positive direction in which his life was moving until that point, the spiralling downturn it took within a short time afterwards and the complicating effect of his injuries (including the psychological conditions addressed in the experts' reports) upon his process of rehabilitation. 

60The applicant had been of good character before the present offences. He had enjoyed a happy upbringing and had completed the HSC in 2005. He was in a relationship and was employed. 

61The motorbike accident occurred in early 2006 when the applicant was still 17 years of age. Although I have rejected the proposition that the applicant is not responsible for his choices following that event, it may readily be accepted that a seventeen-year-old boy might cope with injuries and disabilities of the kind he sustained with less maturity and stoicism than other members of the community. The applicant chose to address his pain with illicit drugs, which in due course engendered an addiction and a course of serious criminal offending. The result was that, within six months after turning 18, all his previous gains had been swept aside and he was in custody facing a series of very serious charges. The aggregate non-parole period of 11 years imposed by the sentencing judge will see him in jail until at least after he turns 30, possibly considerably longer. 

62Notwithstanding the absence of any error in the individual sentences imposed, and accepting the clear need for some accumulation between those sentences, the aggregate sentence imposed is in my view so lengthy as to be likely to have a crushing effect on such a young man encountering the criminal justice system for the first time. For that reason (and no other), in my view the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

63The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be allowed and that the sentences imposed at first instance be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced as follows: 

(a)on count 1, to a fixed term of imprisonment of four years commencing on 24 September 2007 and expiring on 23 September 2011; 

(b)on count 2, to a fixed term of imprisonment of four and a half years commencing on 24 September 2008 and expiring on 23 March 2013; 

(c)on count 3, to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years, commencing on 24 September 2011 and expiring on 23 September 2013; 

(d)on count 4, to a term of imprisonment of ten years with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 24 September 2011 and expiring on 23 September 2016 and a balance of term of 5 years expiring on 23 September 2021.

2757714,Ballard v R [2011] NSWCCA 193,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY JA: I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Harrison J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with Harrison J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: The applicant pleaded guilty on 30 September 2009 to the following offences:
	


Count 1: Supply a prohibited drug, namely 23.05g of methylamphetamine. This was an offence contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.

Count 2: Possession of a prohibited firearm. This was an offence contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996.


	
	The drug offence carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment with no standard non-parole period. The firearms offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 there were six related offences before the sentencing court. They were possessing shortened firearm, possessing prohibited weapon, possessing prohibited firearm, possessing prohibited drug, receiving stolen goods and possessing prohibited plant. His Honour took these offences into account on two forms when sentencing the applicant in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	His Honour King DCJ sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months from 11 May 2009 for the drug offence. He sentenced the applicant to a period of 4 years imprisonment for the firearms offence with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 11 May 2011 and expiring on 10 November 2013 and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 11 November 2013 and expiring on 10 May 2015. The overall effective sentence was therefore one of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 11 May 2009 and expiring on 10 May 2015 with an effective non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 11 May 2009 and expiring on 10 November 2013.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against these sentences upon the following grounds:
	


Ground 1: The sentencing proceedings miscarried when [his Honour] rejected exculpatory material, to which the Crown had not objected, without informing the parties of his intention [to do so].

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the drug offence, in particular by finding that the applicant was engaged in a ""significant commercial operation"".

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the applicability of the standard non-parole period in relation to the firearms offence, including when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.

Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred, in considering whether special circumstances justified departure from the statutory ratio between the term of the sentence and the non-parole period, by failing to take into account anything other than the fact of partial accumulation in relation to the firearms offence.

Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to totality and the extent of accumulation.

Ground 6: The sentences, including the overall effective sentence, are manifestly excessive.

Agreed facts


	
	The facts were not in dispute. On 11 May 2009 police executed search warrants at the applicant's home and that of his mother. Police found a total of 23.04g of methylamphetamine at the two locations. The applicant admitted that the drug was his and that he had it for the purpose of sale. Also present at his house were so-called indicia of supply such as mobile phones, electronic scales, resealable plastic bags and lists of names with amounts of money, as well as just over $1,000 in cash. The drug found at the applicant's house was divided into 12 small packages weighing a total of 3.02g and two packages weighing a total of 6.06g. The remaining 13.42g were found at his mother's house, divided into two packages. Count 1 relates to the applicant's possession of the total quantity of the drug for the purpose of supply.
	
	
	Also found were 0.7g of cannabis leaf and a cannabis plant, which the applicant said were for his personal use. (The sentencing judge and the Crown apparently accepted that). These items were the subject of the possession offences on Form 1B.
	
	
	An amount of property, including a watch, a laptop computer and some cosmetics were also located. The latter still retained security tags from Woolworths Ltd. The computer was worth $1,400 and the cosmetics had a retail value of $12,950. This property was the subject of the receiving offences on Form 1B.
	
	
	Police located a rifle that had been modified to resemble a walking stick, the subject of Count 2 on the indictment. The rifle was not loaded and no live ammunition for it was located. Spent .22 cartridges and holes in the kitchen door consistent with .22 calibre projectiles were found. The rifle had been shortened by the removal of the stock. Possession of that weapon was the subject of the relevant offence on Form 1A.
	
	
	A homemade mace and a non-functioning paint ball pistol were also found. These became the subject of the remaining offences on Form 1A. The sentencing judge expressed the view that these offences were of a level of seriousness that would have had them dealt with summarily.
	
	
	There was no reference in the agreed facts to the involvement of any other person in the supply of prohibited drugs. There was no explanation given concerning the provenance of the items that were the subject of the receiving offence.
	


Ground 1


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. It is apparent that the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour was significantly influenced by his Honour's view of whether or not the applicant acted alone or in concert with others in the supply of drugs. The issue was the subject of comment in a psychiatrist's report from Dr Furst, upon which the applicant relied. Part of that report is as follows:
	


""The offences in question were part of an enterprise that Mr Ballard was involved in with others. He understood that his actions were wrong, however he appears to have open [sic] to the suggestion of the other parties involved in the crimes before the Court. In my opinion, the cognitive deficits Mr Ballard suffers from, including poor attention, poor judgment, difficulty in problem solving, concrete (inflexible) thinking, mental slowness, problems with working memory would have made him more vulnerable to suggestions of others and were substantial contributing factors in his offending behaviour.""


	
	His Honour's remarks on sentence included the following passages:
	


""… Dr Furst had access to the medical and clinical notes from the Liverpool Hospital and the Liverpool Bone Injury Unit and all of the material that had been provided to Mr Champion as well as…consulting or interviewing the offender. Of note in respect of the offence itself, contained in Dr Furst's report is an explanation or account given by the offender in respect of the offence. In part it indicates that the offender asserted that there were three people involved in the supply of drugs, and that they were not making any money from it. ""We were giving out too much on credit and lost everything. I was the only one arrested."" The original idea was said to have come up in conversation between himself and what I refer to as the co-offenders. He said that:

""We were just getting ripped off everywhere, all it was was a little bit for me, I never bought the stuff, I was just there for the ride.""

He said that the stolen goods had been given to him by customers and the intention was to sell the goods at some point at the markets, but that he and the co-offenders ""never got around to it"". I note that there is no indication in the agreed facts of there having been any other person that was a participant in the offence. The offender has not given evidence on sentence, and the facts, in terms of the admissions said to have been made at the time, indicate that the offender was, in fact, the principal in relation to the offences that occurred at his premises, other than that portion of the drug recovered at his mother's, and he acknowledged the weapons as being his and having carried out the modification to the item described as the walking stick.

The account given by the offender appears to be an attempt to diminish his responsibility or moral culpability in relation to the offences in circumstances where there is, in fact, no evidence of the participation of any other person before the Court.

There have been a number of decisions over the years which highlight the need for the sentencing Court to be circumspect in relation to untested self serving statements made by offenders, whether they be by way of letters from the offender to the Court, or by way of statements made to presentence officers and/or psychologists or psychiatrists. [His Honour cited the authorities]. In the circumstances of this matter, the Court does not propose to accept in any way the assertion made to the psychiatrist as to the participation of others.

Again, the report from Dr Furst is an extensive report. Before referring to any specific content of the report I note that in part the psychiatrist has accepted…the assertions made to him by the offender that he was participating in an enterprise involving others as previously outlined in these remarks. The fact that the psychiatrist has relied on that material somewhat diminishes the utility of the report. However, in respect of the offender's cognitive functioning, Dr Furst found on examining the material before him that his brain injury would be classified as moderate, and that common long term symptoms of a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury are changes such as inappropriate social behaviour, deficits in social judgment and cognitive changes, and special problems with sustained attention, processing speed and executive functioning, and he said that those features are evident in the offender's psychiatric history since the accident and in the results of neuropsychological testing. So much is accepted by the Court. The difficulty with the acceptance of the offender's assertions of others being participants in the offence is that Dr Furst goes on to say:

In my opinion, the cognitive deficits Mr Ballard suffers from, including poor attention, poor judgment, difficulty in problem solving, concrete (inflexible) thinking, mental slowness, problems with working memory would have made him more vulnerable to suggestions of others and were substantial contributing factors in his offending behaviour.

As I have previously indicated, the difficulty with that is the lack of any evidence independent of the assertions made by the offender and recorded in the psychiatrist's report, to support such a prospect.""


	
	The applicant submitted that it flowed from his Honour's rejection of the applicant's assertion to Dr Furst that others were involved in the supply of drugs, that his Honour also rejected Dr Furst's opinion that ""cognitive deficits…would have made him more vulnerable to the suggestions of others and were substantial contributing factors in his offending behaviour"". This was said to be important because such reasoning affected both the assessment of the objective criminality of the offending behaviour as well as the extent to which the need for general deterrence might have been ameliorated.
	
	
	The applicant complained that in taking this approach the sentencing judge improperly and erroneously denied him the opportunity to explain his level of involvement in the activities concerned. The applicant submitted that what he told Dr Furst was exculpatory, in the sense that it indicated that he was not the instigator of the drug offences but was led by others. The Crown had not objected to Dr Furst's report and the Crown declined what the applicant's written submissions described as ""the opportunity to cross-examine him"". The Crown did not suggest that what he told Dr Furst should be given little or no weight because it was in the form of a statement to Dr Furst. The Crown's submissions did no more than suggest that the applicant's involvement in the supply of drugs was not merely impulsive and that he involved himself knowing full well what he was doing and to support his own addiction. The Crown did not seek to distinguish between a case where others were involved in that activity and one where they were not.
	
	
	The applicant referred to well known authority dealing with the need for sentencing judges to exercise caution when faced with untested but self-serving exculpatory material. His Honour referred to these cases in his remarks on sentence. In R v Elfar [2003] NSWCCA 358, Whealy J said this at [25], [28] - [29]:
	


""[25] The matters of principle stated in R v McGourty and R v Qutami are plainly important. They require emphatic endorsement by this court. Indeed it needs also to be further emphasised that this principle extends not only to statements in psychological reports, but also to statements by offenders in pre-sentence reports - (R v Palu per Howie J with whom Levine J and Heydon J agreed (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at 185). In addition, the current practice of tendering a note or letter from an offender in sentencing proceedings attracts the same admonishment. Considerable caution should be exercised in reliance upon such exculpatory material where there is a matter in dispute and where no evidence is given by an offender or other direct evidence is not placed before the court. The essential reason for treating the material in that way is precisely because it remains untested. Indeed, where the Crown has either objected to the tender of this type of material or has made it clear, either at the time of tender or when submissions are made, little or no weight should be placed upon the material, that the sentencing court would be entitled to treat the material as being of little or no weight. Indeed, in an appropriate case, it ought to do so.

*****

[28] While sentencing judges are required in general to act with caution and employ a sound level of judicial scepticism when confronted with statements in reports or other material which are not supported by an offender’s evidence, I do not think it is open to the Crown to complain of appellable error in this court if its representative in the court below has not plainly taken up a disputant position, either when the material was tendered or when submissions were made. This is even more so when, as here, the Crown had raised no objection whatsoever and made no submissions in opposition to the documentary material or its hearsay contents.

[29] In some situations, the evidence placed before a sentencing court will be so inconsistent, so contrary to common sense and the agreed facts that, even without Crown intervention, adverse submission or opposition, it will be quite apparent to the sentencing judge that little or no weight should be given to the material. The duty of the sentencing judge will be plain in such a situation. There will be a need for the sentencing judge to inform the parties of his preliminary attitude to the tendered material and to invite submissions and provide the opportunity for further evidence. Absent satisfaction, the judge will be entitled to, and should exercise considerable caution in placing reliance on the material. In many cases, only very limited weight, if any, will be given to the material. When, as happened here, however, there was a consistent body of coherent credible evidence, admittedly of a hearsay kind, supporting the existence of genuine exculpatory factors, it will be necessary for the Crown to state that it disputes the position revealed in that material and to say why that is so.""


	
	More recently this Court returned to the same issue in Alvares v R; Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33. The usual authorities were considered and helpfully reviewed. At [49] - [58] Buddin J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said this:
	


""[49] It is now convenient to refer to the authorities to which counsel directed the court's attention. In R v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 in which Smart AJ, with whom Simpson J agreed, said:

'There is one further general observation. In this case reliance appears to have been placed on statements made by the prisoner to psychiatrists and the psychologist. While those statements are admissible in evidence, very considerable caution should be exercised in relying upon them when there is no evidence given by the prisoner. In many cases only very limited weight can be given to such statements.

There has been a noticeable and disturbing tendency of more recent years for prisoners on a sentence hearing not to give evidence and to rely on statements made to experts. Prisoners should realise that if this course is taken great caution will be exercised in respect of the weight, if any, given to those statements.' (paras 58-9)

[50] Spigelman CJ said:

'I agree with the observations of Smart AJ as to the limited weight that ought to be given to self-serving, untested statements made to experts which are tendered in sentencing hearings.' (para 79)

[51] Subsequently in R v McGourty [2002] NSWCCA 335, Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said:

'So far as I can see, there was no factual basis for the finding made by his Honour beyond a self-serving and untested statement made by the respondent to a psychologist. Recently this Court has criticised the practice of placing material of this kind before sentencing judges, in an attempt to minimise the objective seriousness of a crime otherwise apparent on the face of a record: Regina v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, at paras 58 and 59 per Smart AJ, and at para 79 per Spigelman CJ).

I whole-heartedly agree with the criticism offered in that case. If an offender appearing for sentence wishes to place evidence before the court which is designed to minimise his/her criminality, then it should be done directly and in a form which can be tested.' (paras 24-5)

[52] There are many other decisions to similar effect. See, for example, R v Tulloh (Court of Criminal Appeal, (NSW) 16 September 1993 unreported at 4); R v Niketic [2002] NSWCCA 425; R v Hooper [2004] NSWCCA 10; R v Alameddine [2004] NSWCCA 286.

[53] It was submitted that those statements were prescriptive in nature and were thus likely to be applied in a fashion which effectively placed a fetter upon the exercise of a sentencing judge's discretion. It was also submitted that no statutory foundation for the statements was to be found in s 16A(2) of the Act. Although in written submissions, counsel had contended that those decisions were wrongly decided, that submission was not pressed in oral argument. Rather, it was argued that they did not apply to Commonwealth offences or in circumstances in which no objection was raised to the evidence being given.

[54] Since counsel placed considerable reliance upon this court's decision in R v Elfar [2003] NSWCCA 358, it is necessary at this stage to consider its significance. That case involved a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence that had been imposed upon a young man who had pleaded to having been involved in a large-scale conspiracy to ""re-birth"" stolen vehicles in order that they could be sold overseas. The respondent's father was a co-conspirator. The sentencing judge had before him a pre-sentence report, two psychological reports and a letter addressed to him from the respondent. Much of that material was directed to highlighting the influence which the respondent's father exerted over him and to the violence which he had exacted upon him. It also contained assertions that the respondent's father had forced his son to assist him in his criminal activities. The sentencing judge accepted that the respondent's ""criminal activity was due to the duress of his father"". The sentencing judge apparently accepted, without reservation, the accounts recorded in the material which had been placed before him, notwithstanding the fact that the respondent had not given sworn evidence.

[55] The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in accepting two major components of the respondent's case solely on the basis of hearsay material. Whealy J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said:

'There is, however, a problem for the Crown in relation to the first submission. The Crown was represented throughout the sentence hearing. The transcript records that, when the hearsay material was tendered, there was no objection taken to it. There was no qualification expressed as to the way in which the sentencing judge might use the material. The Crown did not, at any time suggest that there was any dispute as to the assertion that the respondent had been, in effect, coerced into the criminal enterprise by the force of his father's personality and his position as family leader. Nor was there any dispute raised with the proposition that the respondent had expressed remorse and contrition on a number of occasions in relation to his involvement in these serious criminal activities. Moreover, at one stage, the solicitor appearing for the offender indicated her willingness to call the offender's grandmother to give evidence of her observations of the behaviour of the offender's father towards him. The respondent's grandmother was then present in court with an interpreter available to translate her evidence. His Honour, however, indicated that, for his part, he did not require to hear from the witness in view of the material in the statements. More importantly, the Crown made no demur to the proposition that the sentencing judge might accept the statements in the material before him, without hearing direct evidence on the issue. Additionally, the Crown did not express any wish to test the available witness in cross-examination on any matter relating to the issue.

While sentencing judges are required in general to act with caution and employ a sound level of judicial scepticism when confronted with statements in reports or other material which are not supported by an offender's evidence, I do not think it is open to the Crown to complain of appellable error in this court if its representative in the court below has not plainly taken up a disputant position, either when the material was tendered or when submissions were made. This is even more so when, as here, the Crown had raised no objection whatsoever and made no submissions in opposition to the documentary material or its hearsay contents. 

In some situations, the evidence placed before a sentencing court will be so inconsistent, so contrary to common sense and the agreed facts that, even without Crown intervention, adverse submission or opposition, it will be quite apparent to the sentencing judge that little or no weight should be given to the material. The duty of the sentencing judge will be plain in such a situation. There will be a need for the sentencing judge to inform the parties of his preliminary attitude to the tendered material and to invite submissions and provide the opportunity for further evidence. Absent satisfaction, the judge will be entitled to, and should exercise considerable caution in placing reliance on the material. In many cases, only very limited weight, if any, will be given to the material. When, as happened here, however, there was a consistent body of coherent credible evidence, admittedly of a hearsay kind, supporting the existence of genuine exculpatory factors, it will be necessary for the Crown to state that it disputes the position revealed in that material and to say why that is so.

In this regard this case was perhaps an unusual one. This was so because of the consistent nature of the material and its inherent credibility. Nevertheless, there was not one suggestion made that the sentencing judge should reject the material, or treat it as of little value because of the absence of direct evidence from the respondent. If the Crown wished to take an adverse position in that regard during the sentence hearing it needed to do so clearly and explicitly.

Because of the Crown's failure to take that position in the rather unusual circumstances of this matter; and because of its tacit acceptance that the sentencing judge might reliably act on that material, there is, in my view, no substance in the first point of the argument.' [paras 27-31] (emphasis added)

[56] The applicant relied upon his Honour's observations as providing support for the proposition that since the Crown in the present case had not raised any objection to the tender of the material (or at least not to the material concerning the issue of remorse), or made any submission that it should be approached with caution, then that material should not only have been accepted but should have been afforded substantial weight. Moreover, it was submitted that the decision made it clear that a sentencing judge is under a duty as a matter of procedural fairness, to put a party on notice especially where the evidence is uncontested, as to any preliminary view about the weight to be given to particular material which he or she may have formed. That was necessary, so it was submitted, to enable the parties to consider their positions and so that they could proceed with the benefit of that indication. Support was also, it was submitted, to be found in the underlined passage from Olbrich (supra) to which reference was made earlier.

[57] I am unable to accept that his Honour's observations should be construed in that fashion. His Honour was not, as I read the judgment, seeking to lay down rules of general application. In my view, what his Honour said was utterly uncontroversial in the context of deciding that particular case. It is important to reiterate that Elfar (supra) involved a Crown appeal and, as Whealy J was at pains to point out, the Crown sought on appeal to impugn findings of fact that were based on material to which no objection had been taken at first instance. Furthermore, his Honour described the case as an ""unusual one"" and referred to the ""consistent nature of the material and its inherent credibility"". There was, as I read the judgment, statements from other family members to the effect that the respondent had indeed been afraid of his father and that he had previously made unsuccessful attempts to leave home and cease working for his father. There was also reference to the fact that the respondent's father had previously served a minimum term of 4 years imprisonment for a very similar offence. Moreover in a passage to which the Court's attention was not drawn, his Honour went on to say:

‘The matters of principle stated in R v McGourty and R v Qutami are plainly important. They require emphatic endorsement by this court. Indeed it needs also to be further emphasised that this principle extends not only to statements in psychological reports, but also to statements by offenders in pre-sentence reports - ( R v Palu per Howie J with whom Levine J and Heydon J (sic) agreed (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at 185). In addition, the current practice of tendering a note or letter from an offender in sentencing proceedings attracts the same admonishment. Considerable caution should be exercised in reliance upon such exculpatory material where there is a matter in dispute and where no evidence is given by an offender or other direct evidence is not placed before the court. The essential reason for treating the material in that way is precisely because it remains untested. Indeed, where the Crown has either objected to the tender of this type of material or has made it clear, either at the time of tender or when submissions are made, little or no weight should be placed upon the material, that the sentencing court would be entitled to treat the material as being of little or no weight. Indeed, in an appropriate case, it ought to do so.' [at para 25]

[58] Not only does the court in Elfar make clear its ""emphatic endorsement"" for the principles expressed in Qutami (supra) and McGourty (supra) but nowhere in the judgment is there to be found any support for the proposition that in the absence of objection to material adduced on behalf of an offender, evidence of remorse must be afforded substantial weight. Nor is there any support for it in Olbrich (supra). At one stage it was submitted that this court had, in effect, created a principle that has been interpreted, particularly in the District and Local Courts, as having the consequence that an offender cannot get a meaningful benefit for remorse unless he or she gives sworn evidence. It is not easy to reconcile that submission with the approach taken by this Court in determining the Crown appeal in Elfar itself. Nevertheless, circumstances may arise in which it will be prudent for a sentencing judge to remind the parties during the course of a sentence hearing of what was said by this court in Qutami (supra).""


	
	The applicant contended that in the present case the evidence was not plainly inconsistent or contrary to common sense or the agreed facts. The Crown did not object to the evidence and made no submissions about the force it had or the weight that should be given to it. The applicant was not ""cross-examined"". The applicant submitted that in those circumstances it was ""even more clearly incumbent upon the judge to inform the parties of his preliminary attitude, invite submissions and provide the opportunity for further evidence"". He failed to do so. The applicant argued that in the events that occurred he had been denied a fair hearing, particularly as he had been willing to enter the witness box and give evidence if required. The applicant went as far as to suggest that his Honour's failure infected the entire sentencing process with error, including in particular his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences and the relevance and significance of the applicant's uncontested cognitive difficulties.
	
	
	I am unable to accept these submissions. The applicant's argument proceeds upon the basis that his Honour was somehow obliged to accept the version given to Dr Furst because the Crown did not object to his report or ask to cross-examine the applicant. However, his Honour was not obliged to approach the task at hand by placing an uncritical reliance on material contained in tendered reports or other third party statements where the applicant chose not to give evidence: see Qutami and TS v R [2007] NSWCCA 194 at [30]. The applicant's decision not to give evidence was a forensic choice taken with a presumed knowledge and understanding that the authorities were to this effect. In deciding not to enter the witness box he ran the risk that evidence given by others of what he had said to them, in a clinical setting or otherwise, would and could be treated by the sentencing judge with appropriate circumspection. His Honour was not required to underline the authenticity of that approach before deciding not to accept the evidence in whole or for all purposes. Moreover, the applicant is not entitled to expect some special status because the Crown declined his offer to enter the witness box to be cross-examined. The applicant made a decision not to give evidence. Responsibility for the consequences of that decision rests with him. The Crown cannot be criticised for not responding to the applicant's offer to be cross-examined when there was nothing to be cross-examined about. His Honour was therefore confronted with the consequences of two competing forensic decisions and was entitled to treat the evidence that came before him upon the assumption that the parties, but in particular the applicant, knew and understood what they were. Any views that his Honour might thereafter have formed or expressed about the reliability of the applicant's assertions to Dr Furst were the reasonable and logical product of that process.
	
	
	It should also be emphasised that the agreed facts made no reference to any other offender being involved in the commission of the offences. His Honour made specific comment about that fact. It would otherwise have been obvious to the applicant that there was potentially a tension between those facts and the version of events proffered by him to Dr Furst. There existed in those circumstances the unremarkable possibility that his Honour might arrive at his decision, such as the one he arrived at in fact, by reference to the whole of the evidence as it was presented to him. The applicant took the procedural risk that his failure to give a first hand account of the events in question would thereby leave his Honour free, in accordance with authority, to approach the hearsay material with ""considerable caution"". That is what he did. That led his Honour to reject a version of events suggesting that the applicant acted in concert with others who influenced him. His Honour otherwise accepted Dr Furst's medical opinion concerning the applicant's cognitive impairment.
	
	
	There was no denial of procedural fairness because his Honour approached the matter in this way. No error has been demonstrated. This ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Ground 2


	
	His Honour found that the quantity of drug that was the subject of the charge was ""substantially less than the commercial quantity"" of 250g. He then said the following:
	


""However, the circumstances of the location of the drugs, together with firearms, stolen property, and all of the indicia of drug supply, being five mobile phones, a box of weights, two sets of electronic scales, and an exercise book recording names and dollar amounts, and the location of $1,000 in cash, indicates that the offender was participating in a significant commercial operation regarding the supply of the prohibited drug. In the circumstances, although the quantity of the drug is far less than the commercial quantity, the offence should be regarded as falling within the mid-range of seriousness for such offences.""


	
	The applicant was being sentenced for possession of 23.04g of methylamphetamine for the purpose of supply. The applicant emphasised that the principles referred to in cases such as R v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104 and R v Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398 applied and, absent exceptional circumstances, called for a full-time custodial sentence if the offender was involved in drug trafficking to a substantial degree. The applicant submitted that a single instance of the possession of 23.04g of methylamphetamine would not necessarily indicate trafficking to a substantial degree. He conceded that his Honour was undoubtedly entitled to take into account the surrounding circumstances when considering this question, including the evidence that the offence was not an isolated incident. The applicant also conceded that his Honour's finding that he was involved in trafficking to a substantial degree and ought to be sentenced to full time imprisonment was clearly open to him.
	
	
	However, the applicant contested his Honour's finding that the applicant was involved in a ""significant commercial operation"". He submitted that in coming to that conclusion his Honour failed to have regard to the following matters. First, the drug was of a very low purity. Secondly, no cutting compounds or mixing equipment were located. Thirdly, the uncontested evidence was that the applicant had been selling to support his own drug addiction and was a ""user/dealer"". Fourthly, the absence of any evidence to indicate that any stolen goods said to have been the proceeds of earlier supplies had ever been sold or disposed of. Fifthly, the evidence of the value of the stolen goods was the retail value, which would have been considerably higher than the value of the goods in the hands of the applicant. Finally, the indicia of supply were consistent with street level supply.
	
	
	The applicant contended in all of these circumstances that a finding that he was involved in a ""significant commercial operation"" was not open to his Honour. He submitted that his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence therefore miscarried. It was submitted that his Honour should have found that the applicant's level of criminality fell towards the lower to lower-middle end of the scale for an offence of this type.
	
	
	The following responses should be noted. There was evidence that goods to a value of more than $12,000 had been exchanged for drugs as part of the applicant's operation. He had drugs stored in two locations. He had record keeping books consistent with the fact of earlier transactions. There were other indicators of the existence of a commercial drug supply operation. His Honour appears to have used the word ""commercial” in its ordinary or generic sense, and not in the sense used in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised that low purity was not inconsistent with a commercial operation. The absence of cutting compounds or mixing equipment only spoke to the level of the operation conducted by the applicant, not to its commerciality. The existence of stolen goods suggested that the sale of drugs by the applicant was not limited to the circumstances associated with his addiction or use. The comparison between the retail value of the goods and the value to the applicant failed to take account of the commercial realities of the transaction in which such goods were traded and the particular value that must have been ascribed to them for that purpose. Street level supply is nonetheless a commercial operation.
	
	
	The offence of supply was not an offence attracting a standard non-parole period so that it was not necessary for his Honour to make a finding of where the subject offence fell on a hypothetical scale of objective seriousness: Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286 and Georgopolous v R [2010] NSWCCA 246 at [32]. It was not, however, an error for his Honour to have done so: Nguyen v R [2011] NSWCCA 127 at [40].
	
	
	In my opinion, his Honour made findings that were reasonably open to him. A sentence of 2 years and 6 months against the background of a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment is wholly unexceptionable in the circumstances of this case. This is particularly so having regard to the fact that in passing sentence for this offence his Honour took into account in addition the matters contained on the Form 1B. I am unable to detect any error either in his Honour's approach or in the conclusions that he reached.
	


Ground 3


	
	In his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to the firearms offence in terms that included the following:
	


""In respect of the offence of possessing the prohibited firearm, that is the weapon modified to resemble a walking cane, it is of significance that the modification of the weapon appears not merely to make it a concealable weapon, but to make it a weapon which can be concealed in public places by having the appearance of a walking stick or cane. Indeed, such a modification can reasonably be regarded as sinister. It is not the type of modification that one would expect if the weapon was to be used in the course of a robbery. It is more consistent - although this is not to suggest that this was the purpose of the modification - but it is more consistent that the type of weapons that are occasionally referred to in relation to public assassinations. However, as indicated, I do not draw the inference that that was the purpose of the modification. However, in the circumstances the offence must be regarded as falling at least within the mid-range of objective seriousness. Having said that, the Court will deal with the matter on the basis that it falls at the high end of the mid-range of objective seriousness.""


	
	The applicant contended that the formulation of the finding in this way was itself indicative of error. This was because his Honour was required to decide whether the offence fell within, above or below the mid-range and, if above or below, to what extent. The applicant contended that his Honour's formulation implied a degree of variation within the mid-range itself, which is inconsistent with the task. The applicant relied on R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [13] as follows:
	


[13] The following propositions emerge from Way and subsequent cases:

(i) while s 54B(2) requires, in sentencing in respect of an offence to which Division 1A applies, unless the sentencing court determines that there are reasons not to do so, that it set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence, that obligation exists where the offence in question is an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of that kind; one reason permitting departure from the standard non-parole period is that the offence in question falls outside the middle of that range (para [67]);

(ii) the standard non-parole period was intended for a middle range case where the offender is convicted after trial: a plea of guilty might be in itself a reason for departure from the standard non-parole period (para [68]);

(iii) a sentencing judge will be required, in relation to any given case, to hypothesise what is an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in order to determine where the subject offence lies in relation to such an offence; such an exercise is, in reality, little different from the traditional sentencing exercise of evaluating objective seriousness of any offence, and should be approached intuitively and based upon the general experience of courts in sentencing for the particular offence (paras [74] - [77]);

(iv) circumstances that affect the evaluation of the objective seriousness of any offence include (but are not necessarily limited to) the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, such factors as impinge upon the mens rea of the offender, matters of motivation, mental state, mental illness or disability (where causally related to the commission of the offence). Factors that affect the circumstances of the offender as distinct from the offence (for example, youth or prior sexual abuse) do not affect the evaluation of objective seriousness (paras [85] - [86]);

(v) that an offence is “typical” or “common” does not dictate that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (para [101]);

(vi) the numerical frequency with which an offence of a particular kind is committed is not an indicator of the objective seriousness of any individual instance of that offence: (paras [101] - [102]);

(vii) where a court determines that there are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, the standard non-parole period nevertheless remains of relevance in the sentencing determination, as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost (para [122]); see also R v GJ Davies [2004] NSWCCA 319.""


	
	The applicant also argued that his Honour had failed to consider a number of factors relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence including the nature of the firearm compared to other prohibited firearms including machine guns. His Honour should also have considered the fact that the weapon was of a small calibre and was neither automatic nor semi-automatic. The weapon was not loaded and no ammunition was found.
	
	
	His Honour made no findings of what, if anything, the applicant kept the weapon for or why it had been modified. The possession of the gun was wholly consistent with the applicant's statement to police that he liked weapons. The applicant asserted that his Honour's failure to make a finding one way or the other about the purpose for which the applicant possessed the weapon caused the exercise of his discretion to miscarry. There had been competing contentions advanced before his Honour about whether the weapon had anything to do with drugs, which his Honour failed to decide.
	
	
	In Mack v R; Mack v R [2009] NSWCCA 216 at [40], Davies J identified a number of matters of the type that the applicant contended the sentencing judge in the present case should have taken into account when determining the objective seriousness of a firearms offence. Davies J said this:
	


""[40] His Honour did not, as he should have done, identify the matters which go to determining the objective seriousness of the offence. Simpson J in AJP at [13](iv) identified the factors and matters in general terms that ought to be examined. Applying those to the facts in the present matter suggests that the following would be the relevant considerations:

(a) the number of the firearms;

(b) the number of the firearms that were prohibited or were pistols;

(c) the nature and type of the firearms;

(d) the purpose for the possession of the firearms;

(e) evidence which would show any relationship between the possession of the firearms and the drug industry being carried on at the premises; and

(f) the location of the property and the security under which the firearms were kept.""


	
	The applicant submitted in this particular case there had not been a finding that the firearms were kept for drug related purposes which was a significant matter in relation to the objective seriousness of the firearms offence.
	
	
	The applicant also submitted that if the objective seriousness of the offence fell within the mid-range, his Honour should have given reasons for not applying the standard non-parole period. The only matter identified was the plea of guilty. The applicant contended that his Honour should have considered and decided whether or not any of the applicant's subjective circumstances, including his brain injury and his need for special programs of rehabilitation, also provided reasons.
	
	
	More particularly, the applicant contended that in the light of a finding of objective seriousness in the mid-range and the application of a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty, the sentence imposed necessarily indicated error. This was because the starting point for the sentence was 5 years and 4 months before the application of the 25 per cent discount. Absent special circumstances, a ""usual"" 75 per cent non-parole period would have been 4 years, or 1 year longer than the standard non-parole period for this offence. The applicant submitted that given his Honour's finding that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness, even at the upper end of that mid-range, his Honour has necessarily fallen into error: he should have determined a non-parole period of no more than 3 years if the offence fell within the mid-range or a starting point, apart from special circumstances, of 4 years. A discount of 25 per cent would have produced a term of 3 years and a non-parole period, absent special circumstances, of 2.25 years. The non-parole period that his Honour imposed was 2.5 years.
	
	
	The Crown contended that because his Honour found that the objective seriousness of the offence was at the higher end of the mid-range it justified a sentence with a non-parole period greater than the standard 3 years for this offence. The Crown also emphasised that his Honour was required to take account of the three matters on the Form 1 as well. The Crown referred to Attorney General's application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518 and submitted that the appropriate sentence for Count 2 could not be determined in isolation from the matters on the Form 1. The Crown contended that the applicant's submissions incorporated that mistake.
	
	
	In this case only one firearm was found. It does not appear to have been in the possession of the applicant for any particular purpose. Certainly none was suggested and none was established. It may simply have been the case that the applicant’s avowed affection for weapons was the true explanation. There was also no obvious or distant relationship or connection between the drug offence and the weapon concerned. It is difficult to conceive of any. The applicant’s commercial drug enterprise was not dependant upon the use of force or the threat of it. The two offences have no discernible or apparent connection. There was simply no evidence, which would show any relationship between the possession of the firearm and the drug industry being carried on by the applicant. There does not appear to have been any attempt by the applicant to conceal the firearm upon the premises so as to avoid discovery.
	
	
	Clearly minds may differ about the level of objective seriousness of this offence. His Honour formed the view that the firearm and its idiosyncratic modifications were “sinister”. His Honour was undoubtedly well placed to express that view. Having regard to the wide range of firearms that falls to be considered within the terms of the section defining this offence, I would for my part have thought that its position in the scheme of objective seriousness was below the middle of the range. I am not, however, prepared to say that his Honour fell into error in exercising his discretion in this respect. On the other hand, I do consider that there is scope for acknowledging the existence of different views about this in considering the extent to which the firearms offence and the drug offence should be accumulated. This is dealt with under grounds 5 and 6 referred to later in these reasons.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 4


	
	The applicant complains that even though his Honour found special circumstances in relation to the firearms offence, the only circumstance considered was the fact of accumulation. Accordingly, the departure from the statutory ratio was only sufficient to produce an overall effective sentence with a non-parole period of 75 per cent of the total sentence. The applicant submitted that his Honour does not appear to have considered whether or not there were any other special circumstances that were referable to the firearms offence. The applicant contended that his Honour ought to have considered his long standing addiction to drugs, his cognitive deficits and the fact that those deficits meant that he was likely to require special rehabilitation programs. This was also the first lengthy period of imprisonment, which might amount to a special circumstance justifying a departure from the statutory ratio in relation both to the firearms offence and the overall effective sentence as well.
	
	
	His Honour dealt with this matter in his remarks on sentence as follows:
	


""The practical effect is that the total term, when the two matters are added together, is a term of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of four years and six months. In varying the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term in respect of the firearms offence, I have taken into account special circumstances in relation to the total term of imprisonment, and providing for the overall term of imprisonment for the balance of term to correspond with the statutory relationship provided for an individual offence. So that a total period of custody of four years six months before being eligible for parole represents seventy-five per cent of the overall sentence of six years.""


	
	The Crown emphasised that merely because his Honour consciously determined that the appropriate non-parole period for the totality of offending was one of 4 years and 6 months it did not mean that he failed somehow to consider whether or not there were or may have been other relevant special circumstances. His Honour was not obliged to outline his reasons for not varying the ultimate ratio of 75 per cent. This Court has made it clear that the allocation of the non-parole and parole periods following a finding of special circumstances is generally a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judges. See, for example, Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [13] per McClellan CJ at CL and R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] to [36] per Spigelman CJ.
	
	
	The applicant was burdened with long-term drug addiction, cognitive deficits requiring treatment and the likely consequences to him of adjustment following his first lengthy period of imprisonment. It is certainly arguable that a combination of these features may have entitled his Honour to allow for a longer period on parole had he so desired. The question for determination in this Court is whether it was reasonably open to his Honour to refrain from varying the statutory ratio to any greater extent than he did. The manner and extent to which his Honour may have factored any of these matters into the way that he structured the applicant's sentences was entirely for him to determine. It cannot in my opinion be said that there is any demonstrated error affecting the way that his Honour did so.
	


Grounds 5 & 6


	
	It was the applicant's case that the total non-parole period vastly exceeded the totality of the criminality involved in the two sets of matters, even taking into account the matters on the forms. In the circumstances the overall effective sentence was said to be manifestly excessive. The applicant complained about his Honour's approach to both totality and the extent of accumulation.
	
	
	Neither of the offences fell into the upper half of the range of objective seriousness. The offences taken into account on the two forms were described as ""relatively minor"". They could have been dealt with summarily. The applicant's subjective case was described as ""relatively positive"". He had a generally minor record of convictions, an unfortunate background and a serious medical condition. He had pleaded guilty and had accepted responsibility for his actions. On the other hand he had been on conditional liberty for a firearms offence.
	
	
	His Honour imposed a fixed term of 2 years and 6 months for the drug offence. The amount of methylamphetamine (23.04g) possessed by the applicant was less than ten per cent of the highest amount of the drug capable of amounting to this offence. The applicant had no prior convictions for drug supply. He received the benefit of a 25 per cent discount for his plea of guilty. The maximum penalty was 15 years. The applicant submitted that this sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The sentence for the firearms offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years. The applicant was sentenced to 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, which would have been 3 years but for the finding of special circumstances. The weapon in question was a .22 calibre shortened rifle, disguised but not loaded and without ammunition. He received the benefit of a 25 per cent discount for his plea of guilty. The applicant submitted that this sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The applicant referred this Court to statistics for equivalent offences. Caution must be exercised in the way that these statistics are applied.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that his Honour's decision not to commence the sentence for the firearms offence until 2 years into the non-parole period of the supply prohibited drug offence was clearly one of the major factors that resulted in the total non-parole period of 4.5 years.
	
	
	In R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43 at [85], Johnson J said the following:
	


""[85] In my view, proper consideration of the above principles required at least a partly cumulative sentence for the firearm offence. The sentence on the drug supply offence could not comprehend and reflect the criminality for the firearms offence. The failure to impose at least a partly cumulative sentence contributed to the fact that the total sentence failed to reflect the Respondent's total criminality for these offences. The offences involved discrete and independent criminal acts.""


	
	These comments are pertinent in the present case. The sentence necessary to reflect the criminality for the drug supply offence could not comprehend or reflect the criminality for the firearms offence. There was clearly a need for partial accumulation. The question is whether or not 2 years partial accumulation was excessive. In R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52], Hall J said:
	


""[52]… It is well established that questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary. What is important is that, firstly, an appropriate sentence is imposed in respect of each offence; and, secondly, that the total sentence imposed properly reflects the totality of the criminality: Regina v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38] per Simpson, Barr and Latham JJ agreeing.""


	
	The Crown quite properly conceded that his Honour's approach produced what the Crown described as ""a stern total effective sentence for the totality of the criminality involved"". The Crown maintained that the sentence was not however manifestly excessive in the result.
	
	
	I disagree. Even though the drug offence and the firearms offence were separate and distinct acts of criminality, and deserving of recognition as such in the penalty that is imposed for each offence, I consider that the manner in which the sentences have been accumulated has in terms of totality resulted in a sentence that is manifestly excessive. The drug offence consisted in a series of related or interconnected ongoing commercially oriented acts. The firearm offence was, by comparison, a passive offence apparently not directed to or associated with any demonstrated criminal intent or activity. While it must be clearly accepted and understood that the firearms offence is made out even in the absence of such collateral characteristics, it does seem to me that the community's disapprobation of this particular offence can be adequately recognised if the sentences remain as imposed but with a greater degree of concurrence between them. This is in my view a preferable course to adopt than one that attempts to vary the particular sentences imposed by his Honour, which, as I have indicated, are in my view not individually vulnerable to attack.
	
	
	In forming the views I have formed I have had regard to other decisions of this Court dealing with similar offences. For example, in Tran v R [2010] NSWCCA 183, the applicant had been convicted of two offences under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 and s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 respectively. He was sentenced following an appeal to a period of imprisonment on the first count consisting of a non-parole period of 6 months with a balance of term of 2 months and on the second count to a period of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and 2 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 1 month. Hislop J recited the facts that gave rise to these charges at [5] and [6] as follows:
	


""[5] The facts were agreed. In essence, at approximately 3.00 am on 10 June 2008 two police officers stopped in response to traffic lights at an intersection. They observed a Subaru WRX which was also stopped in response to traffic lights at the intersection. There were four male occupants in the vehicle. The actions of the driver and passengers aroused the interest of the police who pulled the vehicle over a short distance from the lights. As his Honour recounted:

'Information regarding the WRX and its occupants was then broadcast over police radio and Officer O’Brien reached into the car to remove the keys from the ignition.

Officer O’Brien noticed all four [occupants] become extremely nervous, looking from side to side and behind them as they fidgeted and reached down between their legs with their hands. He then stepped back from the vehicle and pulled the restraining clip from his firearm, yelling 'Keep your hands up where I can see them, stop moving around and keep your hands up. If you don’t someone is going to get hurt'.

[6] A search of the vehicle and its occupants revealed the presence of a balaclava and three white gloves. One occupant (Nguyen) had a machete with a 50 cm blade secreted in his pants. A black Parabellum pistol containing a magazine with 10 live rounds of ammunition was located in the foot well where one occupant (Chompeay) had been sitting. A 32 calibre Beretta pistol was located in the foot well area on the driver’s side where Do had been sitting. It contained a magazine with two live rounds of ammunition. A plastic bag containing 0.27 grams of methylamphetamine was located in his pocket. The applicant had a Taser-type device, in working order, on his person and a copper coloured bullet in his pocket. A .25 calibre pistol with a magazine with six live rounds was found in the foot well area where the applicant had been sitting. The pistols and Taser-type device were prohibited and unregistered. The occupants had no licences or permits in respect of them. Numerous items of correspondence in the name of Do were located in the glovebox of the vehicle.""


	
	His Honour's view of the gravity of the offences in the case before the Court is exposed later in his reasons for judgment at [13] -[19] as follows:
	


""[13] The Firearms Act 1996 s 7(1) provides:

‘A person must not possess or use a prohibited firearm or pistol unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit.’

[14] A prohibited firearm is defined in s 4 and means a firearm prescribed in Sch 1 of the Firearms Act 1996. The firearms there described ranged from a machine gun, rifle, shotgun down to replica firearms. A prohibited pistol is defined in s 4C(1).

[15] Section 7(1) is of wide application. It refers to both possessing and using a firearm. It can be argued that using is a more serious offence than possessing and that a pistol is less dangerous than a machine gun. However, each can be lethal and a pistol may be readily concealed upon the person. Much will depend upon the particular circumstances.

[16] In this case the pistol was loaded and unsecured. It was in the applicant’s possession when he was a member of a group of heavily armed young men. The pistol was within a vehicle which was upon a public street in an urban area. It was capable of concealment upon the applicant’s person or in the vehicle. A balaclava and gloves were in the vehicle. The pistol represented a high risk to members of the public and to the arresting police though it was not used on this occasion. There was no acceptable innocent explanation for the possession of the pistol which in any way mitigated the objective seriousness of the offences. There was no material before the Court from the applicant explaining his involvement in these offences.

[17] The objective circumstances of count 2, in my opinion, place it significantly above the middle range of objective seriousness for such offences. In these circumstances, reference to the yardstick provided by the standard non parole period is of little assistance. The maximum penalty of 14 years becomes the principal factor in determining the sentence as the objective criminality is above the mid range - R v Mitchell [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 94 at [37], Micklesson v R [2009] NSWCCA 61 at [15]-[16].

[18] The Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 s 7(1) provides:

‘(1) A person must not possess or use a prohibited weapon unless the person is authorised to do so by a permit.’

[19] The definition of ‘prohibited weapon’ is contained in s 4 of the Weapons Prohibition Act and means anything described in Sch 1. Schedule 1 includes a wide range of weapons extending from bombs, grenades, rockets and missiles to knives, crossbows, slingshots, knuckledusters and a studded glove. The Taser type device fell within the description in Sch 1 cl 2.""


	
	A comparison of the objective criminality involved in that case with the corresponding weapons offence committed by the applicant in the present case in my view significantly favours the applicant.
	
	
	I have also had regard to what was said by Mason P in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540 at [7] - [11] on the question of concurrence and accumulation in the light of R v Pearce [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 as follows:
	


"" Concurrence or Accumulation

[7] I wish to make it plain at the outset that I agree with the approach taken by Dowd J in the restructured sentences he proposes. My difficulty lies in the proposition expressed by his Honour in paragraph 69 of the draft. I do not agree that for the sentencing judge to take into account, in considering questions of concurrence and accumulation, features that were common to the two conspiracy offences, denotes an invalid reasoning process. Whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is, in the end, an exercise of discretion to be made in accordance with established principle. Features common to two or more offences are all matters relevant to be taken into account (pointing towards concurrence) as are features indicating the disparate nature of the offences (pointing the other way). There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong.

[8] As a result of the decision of the High Court in R v Pearce [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, the question of whether to accumulate sentences for multiple offences has taken on a new dimension. Following Pearce, a judge is required to fix “an appropriate sentence” for each offence, before considering questions of accumulation, concurrence or totality. I take this to mean that, except perhaps in cases of multiple offences committed as part of a single, discrete, episode of criminality, the sentence for an individual offence is to reflect the criminality involved in the offence untainted by reference to the other offences for which that offender is to be sentenced.

[9] Pre-Pearce, it was possible to discern two different approaches to sentencing for multiple offences. The first was to select a single charge (a lead or representative count) and, in accordance with the principle of totality, on that charge impose a sentence that properly reflected the overall criminality involved in all offences. On the remaining counts, comparatively lenient sentences, frequently fixed terms, were imposed. The second approach was, again with the principle of totality in mind, to select a sentence appropriate to the overall criminality and impose that sentence in respect of all or most of the charges. Both of these approaches avoided the need for elaborate exercises in accumulation of sentences.

[10] Neither of these approaches would survive the application of the Pearce principles. In the case of a judge adopting the first approach, the lengthy sentence imposed in relation to the lead or representative count would appear excessive and those imposed on the remaining counts would appear inadequate. None would represent “an appropriate sentence” for the specific offence for which it was imposed. On the second approach, all sentences would appear excessive for the specific charges to which they related, even when the ultimate term to be served was unimpeachable.

[11] The application of Pearce in the present case illustrates the reason that pre-existing sentencing practices need modification. “Appropriate” sentences imposed in relation to each individual conspiracy count would, if made wholly concurrent, fail to reflect the total criminality; if made wholly cumulative, would exceed what totality permits. The only solution is, as proposed by Dowd J, to make the sentences partly concurrent and partly cumulative.""


	
	More recently Howie J expanded upon the principles of concurrence and totality in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] as follows:
	


""[27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""


	
	His Honour drew upon what was said by this Court in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [11] - [13] in these terms:
	


""[11] One of the limiting principles that constrains a sentencing court in seeking to promote the purposes of punishment is the principle of proportionality. Another is the, not-unrelated, principle of totality and it is this principle that operated in the present case. It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence in accordance with statements of the High Court as to the operation of the principle in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616.

[12] In R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245, Street CJ described the principle as follows: (at 260)

‘... The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing Judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing Judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences. ...’

[13] In some cases the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending: see for example R v Brown [1999] NSWCCA 323. This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion: R v Janceski (No 2) [2005] NSWCCA 288. The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault: R v Gorman (2002) 137 A Crim R 326. Although, it has been held that a determination of the extent, if any, that a sentence is to be served cumulatively with another sentence is an exercise of discretion on which minds might differ, R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66, that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality."" (Emphasis added)


	
	I am conscious of the fact that the exercise of the sentencing discretion, as with any discretion properly exercised, is prone, if not likely, legitimately to produce different and varying results. I have reaffirmed the sentencing judge's analysis of the seriousness of the weapons offence and the sentence that he imposed. However, as I have indicated, it is my view that in terms of the principle of totality it is not only legitimate but also necessary to increase the level of concurrence of the sentences for that offence and the drug offence, having regard to the circumstances of, and sentences imposed in, comparable cases with comparable offences, such as in Tran. I consider that his Honour accumulated the sentences excessively. Whilst deserving of recognition as a discrete and separate act of criminality, and even warranting the description ""sinister"", the weapons offence can be backdated by 1 year without derogating from the impact of the sentence imposed by his Honour for that offence. In my opinion, a proper application of the principle of totality drives me in this case to that conclusion.
	


Conclusions and orders


	
	Although the individual sentences imposed upon the applicant by his Honour were appropriate, the total effective sentence was excessive because of the way in which the overall sentence was structured. I consider that his Honour erred in his approach to totality and the extent of accumulation by ordering that the sentence for the firearms offence should commence on 11 May 2011. That does not of itself mean that this Court should intervene. The Court must be satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law: s6 (3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In my opinion some other sentence is warranted. I consider that the commencement date for the firearms offence should be 11 May 2010.
	
	
	Accordingly I would propose the following orders:
	


1.   Grant leave to appeal.

2.   Allow the appeal in part.

3.   Order that in lieu of the sentence imposed on the applicant by King DCJ for the firearms offence the applicant be sentenced to a period of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 11 May 2010 and expiring on 10 November 2012 and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 11 November 2012 and expiring on 10 May 2014.

4.   Otherwise confirm the orders made and the sentences imposed by King DCJ on 13 August 2010.


	
	It follows that the overall effective sentence remains the same but that the effective non-parole period is reduced to 3 years and 6 months. The first date upon which the applicant will become eligible for parole is 10 November 2012.

2757715,R v Hawi & ors (No 26) [2011] NSWSC 1672,"Judgment 


1HIS HONOUR: Mr Conwell, on behalf of the accused Padovan, has indicated an objection to the Crown relying upon Mr Padovan leaving the terminal as flight evincing a consciousness of guilt. 

2It would seem from the exchange with counsel that had just taken place that there may have been some crossed wires in terms of whether the Crown was in fact relying upon this in the case concerning Mr Padovan. 

3The evidence is to the effect that the fighting that was occurring in the terminal ceased at around 1:41:30pm. The CCTV footage shows Mr Padovan moving around the departure hall area in the ensuing minutes, and at least at one point he is seen to walk in a direction approaching the area where the deceased was on the ground receiving medical attention. Mr Peter Zervas, the deceased's brother, is in the area where the deceased is being treated, in a most agitated state, and can be seen to speak with Mr Wainohu for what appears to be a relatively short period of time. There were people who appeared to be security guards in this area at the time as well. How close Mr Padovan actually approached that position is not evident from the camera footage. 

4Mr Padovan is then seen to walk in the opposite direction, and at about 2 minutes and 45 seconds after it can be deduced that the fighting had ceased, he is seen to emerge into the arrivals hall on the floor below, having travelled down the escalators and presumably from there proceeded to leave the terminal. 

5Whatever be the case as to Mr Conwell's understanding as to whether the Crown was relying upon flight as consciousness of guilt, it does not seem to be a matter from which any particular prejudice arises. 

6Mr Conwell indicated that he might possibly have sought evidence from Detective Sergeant Groenewegen concerning a possible explanation for Mr Padovan leaving the terminal; that being that it was part of the ""bikie culture"" that one does not speak to police officers (T4125.31). However, Mr Conwell frankly conceded that he was not sure that he really would have wanted that evidence to be adduced because it carried potentially prejudicial overtones as well. 

7There would seem to be a number of submissions available to be made by Mr Conwell that could persuade the jury against concluding that Mr Padovan leaving the terminal was because of some consciousness of guilt. However that does not mean that the Crown cannot rely upon it. 

8It seems to me that the jury could conclude that Mr Padovan leaving the terminal some 2 minutes and 45 seconds after the fighting had concluded was because of a consciousness of guilt. Whether the jury accept that this is the only inference available or they accept an alternative explanation is entirely a jury issue. 

9My conclusion is that it would be open to the Crown to put a consciousness of guilt argument to the jury and it will be the subject of the usual directions that I will give as to the need to consider competing explanations. For these reasons I propose to allow the Crown to rely upon flight as consciousness of guilt in relation to Mr Padovan. 

10I should add that I dealt with this issue briefly in my judgment on the no case submission that was made by Mr Conwell after the close of the Crown case: R v Hawi & ors (No 20) . Within that judgment (at [43]) there is some further elucidation of the reasoning that might lie behind the Crown's submission on this topic.

		14 February 2012",2011-08-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757717,R v Hawi & ors (No 25) [2011] NSWSC 1671,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: The Crown has proposed putting its case on murder in respect of the six Comanchero accused on two bases, in the alternative. The first basis involves a contention that there was a joint criminal enterprise, the object of which was to inflict grievous bodily harm upon one or more Hells Angels who were at the airport on the day in question. The second basis involves a contention that there was an extended joint criminal enterprise, that is, there was an agreement to assault one or more Hells Angels, and that the accused contemplated the possibility that in the course of committing such assault(s), one of their number would intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm. The reference to ""Hells Angels"" should be understood as a reference to all of the men in the Hells Angels group. That is, it includes the deceased who was not a member. 

2The Crown Prosecutor outlined these matters in her opening address to the jury on 25 May 2011 (T79 - 81). She concluded with the following encapsulation: 

So there are two ways that the Crown says each of the accused could be all guilty or each guilty of murder on the basis that he agreed to commit a crime and that Anthony Zervas died as a result. So either if you were satisfied the accused agreed to inflict really serious physical injury, and that is what happened, or you were satisfied that each accused agreed to some lesser assault but contemplated the possibility that grievous bodily harm might intentionally have been inflicted, then the Crown could establish its case. (T80.48 - 81.4) 

3The evidence of Dr Johan Duflou, forensic pathologist, as to the cause of the death of the deceased was that it was the result of ""[c]ombined effects of blunt force head injury and stab wounds to the chest and abdomen"" (T3043.49). There is no dispute about this. The evidence in the Crown case is that the deceased was pursued, brought to the ground and then beaten, including with the use of a bollard. He was also stabbed with a knife, or a pair of scissors, or both. 

4The trial has reached the stage when the evidence has been completed and closing addresses are about to commence. Mr Stratton SC, who appears for the accused Menzies, has made a submission that it is necessary for the Crown to prove that the accused were aware ""that at least one of his co-accused was armed with a weapon (relevantly a knife, a pair of scissors, or a bollard), which might be used with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or to kill"" (written submissions at [2]). Various authorities were cited, principally R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292. 

5The issue was the subject of oral submissions yesterday. At the conclusion, I indicated a tentative view that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove the contemplation of an accused that another participant in the joint criminal enterprise would, or possibly would, use a weapon (T4098.1). Overnight I have further considered the matter and have looked again at the authorities to which I was referred. This has confirmed the aforementioned tentative view. 

6At the present stage of proceedings, with closing addresses about to commence, and quite a number of legal issues requiring consideration in terms of my summing up, it is simply not possible to deliver a formal judgment that addresses all of the authorities and arguments that were presented to me in the course of submissions. Delivery of such a judgment would not, in any event, serve to fulfil any presently useful purpose. The parties need to know the bases upon which the Crown case will go to the jury on the charge of murder. If the reasoning behind it may later be called into question, that will require an even more considered and thorough survey of the issues, authorities and principles than I could hope to achieve in any judgment I could deliver in the present circumstances. 

7I do, however, indicate that the view I have arrived at has been based principally upon two considerations. The first is that what was said by Carruthers J in R v Sharah , upon which much reliance has been placed, cannot be regarded as anywhere near approaching statements of principle of general application in cases involving the concept of extended joint criminal enterprise. The idea that an accused must contemplate the possible, or actual, use of a weapon as being always essential where the contemplated possible incident of a joint criminal enterprise was achieved by such means is not established by R v Sharah , or by any other case to which I was referred. 

8Much confusion was introduced into the submissions by recourse to cases which involved robberies, where there were questions as to the need for the accused to be aware of the certainty, or possibility, that a co-offender was armed. There are many reasons why such cases should, in applying them to a case such as the present, be read with some circumspection before deriving statements of principle. 

9Mr Stratton sought to characterise the present case as being the equivalent of a ""robbery gone wrong"" homicide case (T4078.36; T4087.38), similar to R v Sharah and many of the cases in which reference has been made to it. As I understand it, the basis for this characterisation was that unlike in R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; (2002) 56 NSWLR 182, in those cases, and here, the Crown was ""unable to establish contemplation of the possibility of an act by a co-accused with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm unless the Crown can satisfy the jury that the accused was aware of the presence or use of weapons"" (T4078.40; see also T4085). 

10The flaw in that analysis is that the evidence in the present case is, in my view, capable of establishing that an accused contemplated the possibility of the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm even absent any foresight that a weapon might be used. The Crown case is that there were 12 men in the Comanchero group, a significant number of whom were large and powerfully built, who embarked upon a fight when they came across 5 men in the Hells Angels group, one of whom (the deceased) was short and slightly built. The prospect of grievous bodily harm being inflicted by any means is capable of being regarded by the jury as a very real one. 

11There was also exposed, with respect, a level of illogicality in the point sought to be made. Mr Stratton submitted that it was necessary for the accused to be aware of a co-accused being armed with a weapon. Without such awareness, so it was submitted, it could not be established that the accused was guilty, even when the possibility of the infliction of grievous bodily harm in the course of the enterprise was in fact achieved. However, it did not matter what type of weapon it was contemplated might be used, just the bare fact that the principal might use a weapon. I had difficulty in understanding why that should be so in terms of logic and common sense; factors which are usually a useful intuitive guide as to what the law is. 

12Various analogies were discussed. They led to these propositions: 


If an accused was aware that there was a possibility of the infliction of grievous bodily harm by sheer physical force, and that such force achieved such harm, then the accused would be guilty (T4086.30). If the accused was aware that there was a possibility of the infliction of grievous bodily harm by sheer physical force, but that the harm was caused by a weapon, the accused would be not guilty (T4086.35). 

If the accused was aware that there was a possibility of the infliction of grievous bodily harm by use of a weapon, but that such harm was caused by sheer physical force, the accused would be not guilty (T4079.25). 

If the accused was aware that there was a possibility of the infliction of grievous bodily harm by a relatively innocuous instrument (e.g. a butter knife) but the principal offender used a much more obviously deadly weapon (e.g. a shotgun fired at close range), then the accused would be guilty (T4096.5). 

13Mr Dunn QC, for the accused Hawi, Mr Young SC, for the accused Eken, and Mr Gordon, for the accused Kisacanin, aligned themselves with the submissions made by Mr Stratton. Mr Driels, for the accused Potrus, did not wish to be heard. 

14On the other hand, Mr Trevallion, for the accused Abounader, accepted that where a secondary participant contemplates the possibility of another participant in a joint criminal enterprise intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm, it is unnecessary, as a matter of principle, for the Crown to prove a contemplation of the possible use of a weapon, if it is the case that the harm was in fact caused by a weapon. However, he submitted that on the facts of this case, there was no evidence to establish that an accused contemplated the possible intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm unless it could be shown that the accused contemplated that a weapon would or might be used (T4093). 

15My conclusion is that there is evidence capable of satisfying the jury that the Comanchero accused were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to assault men in the Hells Angels group and that such evidence is also capable of satisfying the jury that it was contemplated that one of their number might intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm. Whether the jury will draw such conclusions is not presently relevant. It is unnecessary for the Crown to establish that it was contemplated that a weapon would be used for the infliction of such harm. I am fortified in the latter conclusion by what was said in Varley v R (1976) 12 ALR 347; R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545; McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; (1995) 183 CLR 108; Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316; Clayton v The Queen [2006] HCA 58; (2006) 81 ALJR 439; R v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; (2009) 236 CLR 397; and R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 85 ALJR 8.

		14 February 2012",2011-08-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757720,Sami KURDI v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 179,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: The appellant was arraigned in relation to 28 offences which, broadly speaking, arose out of his relationship with a Ms AH (""the complainant""). The appellant was found guilty by a jury on 13 of these charges and was acquitted on the balance. 

2The appellant does not challenge the guilty verdicts in respect of three of these charges, namely, those contained in Counts 4, 5 and 28 of the indictment. It challenges the balance of the guilty verdicts on the basis that the verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. As an alternate but related ground, the appellant submits that the verdicts are inconsistent, there being no logical and reasonable basis for the inconsistency. Finally, it suggests that the verdicts demonstrate compromise. 

The principles 

3The appeal is brought under the provisions of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (""the Act""). That section, so far as relevant for present purposes, provides as follows: 

""6(1) The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice ..."" 

4Section 5 of the Act gives a right of appeal on any ground which involves a question of law alone, otherwise an appeal only lies by leave of the Court. This appeal does not involve a question of law alone, so leave to appeal should have been sought. The issue was not raised at the hearing and having regard to the questions involved, in my opinion, it is appropriate to grant leave. 

5Section 8 of the Act empowers the Court to order a new trial if it thinks a miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by a new trial than by any other orders. 

6In M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, the majority of the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) set out the approach which should be adopted when a ground of appeal is that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. Relevantly, their Honours stated at 493: 

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 

And, at 494-495: 

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 

7These statements have been accepted as authoritative in subsequent decisions of the High Court: Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 56; (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 452; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25], [59]. 

8It follows that to answer the question which M v The Queen supra requires to be answered, it is necessary for the Court to review the whole of the evidence available to the jury. That is not to say that a court of appeal conducts its own trial. The question which it must answer is whether it was open to the jury to reach the verdict which it in fact reached. Further, as was pointed out in M v The Queen supra, the Court must pay full regard to the primacy of the jury as the fact-finding tribunal and to the fact that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the evidence. 

9Particular difficulties arise when on a trial on multiple counts the jury returns a verdict of guilty on some counts and not guilty on others. In Jones v The Queen supra, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ held that on the particular facts of that case an acquittal on one of three counts of sexual assault diminished the complainant's overall credibility to the extent that it was difficult to see how it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the second and third counts. However, as was made clear in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82, that decision does not stand for the proposition that in cases where multiple sexual offences are alleged involving one complainant the jury's acquittal on one of those counts should compel an appellate court to conclude that the jury must necessarily have regarded to the complainant generally as an unsatisfactory witness. 

10In MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ set out a number of considerations appellate courts should take in account in considering a claim of inconsistent verdicts. They stated (at 366) that a distinction must be drawn between legal or technical inconsistency and suggested factual inconsistency. They pointed out that where the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process the test is one of logic and reasonableness. They cited with approval the judgment of Devlin J in R v Stone [1955] Crim LR 120 to the following effect: 

""He must satisfy the court that the two verdicts cannot stand together, meaning thereby that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind properly to the facts in the case could have arrived at the conclusion, and once one assumes that they are an unreasonable jury, or they could not have reasonably come to the conclusion, then the convictions cannot stand."" 

11In MacKenzie the plurality also pointed out (at 367) that the respect which the law assigns to the function of juries means courts should be reluctant to accept the submission that verdicts are inconsistent. Therefore, if there is a proper way in which the appellate court may reconcile verdicts to enable a conclusion that the jury performed its function, the plurality in MacKenzie suggests that conclusion will generally be accepted. In that context they said (at 367): 

""If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt."" 

12In R v Markuleski supra, Spigelman CJ (at [31]) emphasised that nothing in Jones cast any doubt on the appropriateness of a jury accepting a witness's evidence in one respect whilst retaining a reasonable doubt about the commission of the events about which the same witness is the only substantive witness. He explained (at [73]) that whilst there may be circumstances in a particular case which would lead to the conclusion that a jury which has found it had a reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant's evidence on one count ought to have had such a doubt with respect to another count, that that does not necessarily follow. He emphasised (at [76]) that there are a number of possibilities for diverse verdicts that do not necessarily give rise to a doubt about the complainant's credibility on all counts. 

13In the same case, Wood CJ at CL emphasised (at [209]) the need to pay close attention to the evidence in applying the test enunciated in M v The Queen. He gave a series of examples (at [234]-[235]) where it may be concluded that a verdict of acquittal on one count would support the argument that the jury looked with real disfavour upon the credibility of the complainant and also a number of examples where it was possible to identify a possible basis for differentiating between verdicts. I will not set these out, but the variety of the examples indicates the need for the appellate court to focus on the actual evidence before the jury when it delivered its verdict rather than proceeding on the assumption that an acquittal on one count and a finding of guilty on another count involving similar offences necessarily leads to the conclusion that the verdicts were unreasonable within the meaning of s 6 of the Act, even where each of the findings appear to have been based on an assessment of the credibility of the complainant. 

14In MFA v The Queen supra, the High Court approved the approach adopted in Markuleski (at [32]). In the course of their judgment, Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ dealt with the issue of different verdicts in the following terms (at [34]): 

""Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie . They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman , and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed."" 

McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ adopted a similar approach (at [85]-[86]): 

""The principles in MacKenzie apply to the present case. This is not an instance of 'legal or technical inconsistency', whereby the jury have returned two or more verdicts which, in law, cannot stand together. Nor is it a case where 'logic and reasonableness' necessarily dictated a common approach to the several verdicts concerned. In judging suggested inconsistency, this Court said in MacKenzie that 'if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted'. The Court cited with approval the remarks of King CJ in R v Kirkman to the effect that juries may not always act 'in accordance with strictly logical considerations' or even 'in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them'. Juries sometimes give effect to 'their innate sense of fairness and justice' as well as to their sense of proportion and compassion. 

Nevertheless, cases do arise where different verdicts returned by a jury represent 'an affront to logic and commonsense' and suggest a compromise in the performance of the jury's duty. Such a conclusion 'depends upon the facts of the case'. There can be no 'hard and fast rules' except that the obligation to demonstrate inconsistency in jury verdicts rests upon the person making the submission."" 

15This Court in R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; (2009) 74 NSWLR 299 suggested that where the suggested unreasonableness was based on the existence of inconsistent verdicts, the issue was not just whether the verdict was open upon the whole of the evidence (these words being emphasised by Simpson J at [135]) but whether it was open on the whole of the evidence and having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including: where one of the circumstances was that the jury acquitted on one or some counts; whatever can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals; and whatever insight can be gained into the jury's thinking and reasoning: see [135] per Simpson J, Latham J agreeing at [204]. 

16So far as the last matter raised by her Honour is concerned whatever insight might ultimately be gained from questions asked by the jury of a judge during the course of their deliberations may be questionable. The issue does not arise in the present case. The Court in R v TK supra again emphasised the importance of the role of the jury as the primary finder of fact. In the case of verdicts said to be compromised verdicts, the Court emphasised the caution that a court must show prior to concluding that a jury has acted contrary to its duty and contrary to the instruction it has been given: see [6] per McClelland CJ at CL, [136] per Simpson J. 

17In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 85 ALJR 571 the High Court again stated that in considering whether a verdict should be set aside on the grounds that it was unreasonable the approach in M v The Queen should be adopted (at [11]-[14], [78]). The Court emphasised in particular the need to make an independent assessment of the evidence (at [21]-[22]). 

18I have set out the principles above in some detail not because they are controversial but rather because of the importance of bearing them in mind in considering the issues raised in this case, which involves a diverse number of counts over a period of many years with different verdicts on each type of count. 

Background 

19It is convenient to deal with the evidence and the submissions in relation to each count in the indictment in chronological order. 

20Counts 1 and 2 were charges of assaulting the complainant in 2000 and 2001. They resulted in directed verdicts in favour of the appellant. Counts 4 and 5 were charges of intimidation of the complainant's mother and father respectively with the intention to cause them to fear mental harm. Guilty verdicts were entered on each of these counts. The parties are agreed that the directed verdicts on Counts 1 and 2 and the guilty verdicts on Counts 4 and 5 do not have any substantial bearing on the issues in the appeal. 

21Counts 3 and 6 relate to incidents in 2002. Count 3 charged the appellant with intimidation with the intention of causing the complainant to fear physical harm whilst Count 6 charged the appellant with an act intending to pervert the course of justice. It is alleged he threatened to make public sexually explicit photographs of the complainant if an Apprehended Violence Order (""AVO"") was not withdrawn. 

22The complainant's evidence in chief in support of these charges may be summarised as follows: she entered into a relationship with the appellant in 1997 when she was 14 years of age; the relationship became a consensual sexual relationship when she was 16 years of age. She claimed the relationship changed when she was 18 and there was some violence. 

23The complainant gave evidence that in January 2002 she went on a holiday to Surfers Paradise with the appellant, the complainant's cousin, and some of her cousin's friends. On return she said the appellant continued to control her movements and would hit her. She said that on 24 May 2002 she went to Ashfield Police Station and sought an AVO against the complainant. 

24The complainant said the appellant called her on the following day and said he knew she had obtained an AVO because he had followed her to Ashfield Police Station. He said she had better drop it or he would show everybody compromising photographs of her. She claimed that he attended her work and showed her a series of negatives of photographs of her in her lingerie in a shed in Perry Park. She said the negatives depicted her wearing a bra and a g-string in one photograph, wearing no bra in another and wearing a bra and short skirt in a third. She said that the complainant stated he would show the photographs to her parents and other people. 

25The complainant said she did not go ahead with the AVO because the applicant blackmailed her with the negatives and because she was scared. She said she did not attend court on the day specified in the AVO and thereafter she stayed with the appellant out of fear. 

26In cross-examination she conceded that it was only in a statement given to the prosecutor a week before the trial that she stated that the appellant knew about the AVO because he had followed her. She was unable to say why she did not tell the police in May 2002 about the threat concerning the AVO. She agreed the appellant had never showed compromising photographs of her to anybody. 

27She was also cross-examined on the first statement she made in connection with Count 6 in which she said she believed the negatives (of the photographs) were of the appellant and her having sex. In that context she stated she could not remember what she was wearing. 

28The complainant's parents gave evidence. Her father said that he accompanied her to Ashfield Police Station to seek the AVO, that in 2002 his family were receiving what were described as prank calls and that at the time of the AVO he saw marks and bruising on his daughter. He stated he told the appellant he would go to the police if the appellant did not leave his daughter alone. The so-called prank calls were the subject of Counts 4 and 5. 

29The complainant's mother gave evidence that she accompanied the complainant to Ashfield Police Station to obtain an AVO. She stated that her daughter had said she did not want to proceed because the appellant had promised to leave her alone. 

30In his address to the jury on Count 3, counsel for the appellant accepted the prank calls were made but said there was no intention to intimidate. He did not draw any distinction between Counts 3, 4 and 5. 

31In relation to Count 6, counsel for the appellant stated the question for the jury was how the appellant knew about the AVO. He pointed to the fact that the claim by the complainant that the appellant followed her to the police station was first made in her seventh statement. He pointed to inconsistencies in her evidence as to what she was wearing and the fact that contrary to her evidence in her initial statements she did not say that the photographs were of her and the appellant having sex. 

32Counts 7, 8 and 9 all involve an incident which occurred on 1 January 2005 at the Bankstown Travelodge. The appellant was acquitted on all counts. 

33The complainant gave evidence that in 2003 she went on a holiday to Greece for a period of three months and that when she returned the relationship resumed. In her words, ""I went back to how we left things"". She said the appellant was angry she had struck up a friendship with a man called Ross. 

34She said that on 1 January 2005 the appellant demanded to see her and they met at the Bankstown Sports Club. She said they met there, he gambled a little and then he told her to book a room and pay for it. (It seemed to have been common ground that the Bankstown Sports Club was adjacent to the Bankstown Travelodge.) She said he made her get money from an ATM in the foyer and she paid for the room in cash. She said they went to the room at about 2.00pm and when they got to it the appellant told her to take her clothes off and then he tied her up and tied her arms to a chair while she was in her underwear. She then said he put duct tape around her mouth and that she was crying and panicking because she could not breathe properly. She then said he punched her and she fell onto the ground with the chair. When she got back onto the chair she said he told her to remove the duct tape and forced her to give him oral sex. Afterwards he told her to go to the shower. She said she took off her bra and g-string and went to the shower. She said the appellant followed her and took his clothes off. She said she sat down in the corner of the shower feeling faint and he urinated on her. 

35She said she left on her own catching the train home from Bankstown. 

36In cross-examination the complainant acknowledged that this was the first time that the appellant had tied her up and used duct tape. She said that she forgot about the tape when she made her first and second statements to the police. She said that in late 2004 and early 2005, she and the appellant were in a consensual sexual relationship and had frequently gone to hotels and motels. She acknowledged that they had had consensual sex at the Bankstown Sports Club both before and after that day. She agreed she paid for the room on her credit card notwithstanding the fact he told her to pay by cash. She said she made a mistake when she said in the first statement that the appellant drove her home and she said her statement was incorrect where she said they were at the motel for four hours. 

37In his address to the jury, counsel for the appellant pointed out the inconsistencies to which I have referred, as well as the fact that she paid by credit card, and that the four hour duration of the stay at the motel pointed to consensual sex. 

38Counts 10, 11 and 12 were counts of demanding money with menaces. The appellant was found not guilty on the first of these charges (Count 10) but guilty on the other two. 

39The complainant's evidence on Count 10 was brief. She claims that around 6 July 2005 the appellant said ""I'm getting a car, I need $10,000"". She said she replied ""I don't have $10,000"", to which he responded, ""Well you can put it on your credit card. If you put it on your credit card I'll let you go, I'll leave you alone"". 

40She confirmed the entry on her credit card statement which showed the payment. 

41The complainant was cross-examined about the absence of complaint concerning this $10,000 in her first two statements. She explained the absence of complaint by saying that she forgot. 

42In relation to Count 11 the complainant's evidence was that the appellant asked her to obtain a loan for $25,000 and if she did he would leave her alone. She went to St George Bank, obtained the loan, and gave it to the appellant in cash. She identified a personal loan approval for $25,000. She corrected her evidence saying the total amount she gave the appellant was $30,000 of which $5,000 was transferred into the St George Bank from her ING account. She said when she handed the money over she was crying and he forced her to sign a piece of paper stating: ""I'm giving $30,000 to Sami Kurdi on my own free will"". The piece of paper was not produced. 

43In relation to Count 12 the complainant's evidence was that a week after payment of the $30,000 the appellant said he needed more money. She claims he said ""Just one more amount and I promise I'll leave you alone"". She obtained a loan from the ANZ Bank and identified a letter of offer. She acknowledged that the reason she gave the bank for needing the loan, namely that it was for a wedding, was untruthful. 

44In cross-examination she corrected her evidence that she did not know where the money was spent and said it was spent on a boat. She was cross-examined on the implausibility of her believing the appellant when he said he would leave her alone. 

45A Mr Stevens and a Mr Izci gave evidence that they did work on a boat for Mr Kurdi at a total cost of $9,500. 

46In his address to the jury counsel for the appellant pointed to the absence of any threat to expose compromising photos and videos which the appellant had in his possession, the implausibility of the fact that the complainant would accept that if she paid him the money he would leave her alone, the absence of any evidence of whether the appellant spent the money and the fact that a number of cash deposits totalling $84,000 went into the complainant's account over the two years subsequent to the $55,000 withdrawal. 

47Count 13, on which the appellant was found guilty, charged the appellant with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The incident was said to have occurred on 29 December 2007. The complainant's evidence was that she was attending a family barbeque when the appellant demanded to see her. She met him at Clemton Park and she got into his car. She said he was very angry and told her to pull her pants down. She said he lit a cigarette lighter, put it on her buttocks and burnt her twice. She was shown a photograph where she identified what she said were burn marks. She said the photograph was taken at Ashfield Police Station in September 2008. 

48She said that a few days after the incident the appellant bought her a burn patch and then some cream. She said she saw her local general practitioner, a Dr Papadakis in Earlwood, who referred her to a laser clinic at Neutral Bay. She identified the date of the incident by reference to a photograph on the appellant's phone showing her at the beach the following day. She said she remembered because she was in pain at the beach and she could not sit down properly. 

49In cross-examination she said the appellant forced her to go to the beach and she had bandages on. 

50In his address to the jury, counsel for the appellant pointed out that there was no evidence that the scars to which the complainant pointed were burn marks, that the allegations were inconsistent with her actions in going to the beach the following day, and that the appellant's actions in supplying her medication were inconsistent with the allegation that he burnt her. 

51In relation to this assault and the subsequent assaults, counsel for the appellant also pointed to the recording of 22 September 2008 and pointed out that allegations of these assaults were not made. 

52The next two counts, Counts 14 and 15, related to alleged assaults following the complainant's attendance at 21 st birthday parties on 28 March 2008 and 14 June 2008. The appellant was found not guilty of each of these counts. 

53The alleged assault on 28 March 2008 occurred after a 21 st birthday party the complainant attended at Forest Inn at Bexley. The appellant had given her permission to go but rang her saying she had lied about the address and demanded she leave. She said she left at about 11.00pm with her girlfriend and the appellant picked her up from her girlfriend's house. She alleged that he punched her in the stomach for lying about the venue. 

54In cross-examination she admitted that she and the appellant had consensual sex six days after the incident, as well as a massage at Star City. 

55In his address to the jury counsel for the appellant again pointed to the absence of any complaint in the recording of 22 September 2008. 

56The alleged assault of 14 June 2008 was said to have taken place following a 21 st birthday party at premises known as the Ivory Room at Five Dock. The complainant said that the appellant indicated that he agreed to her going to the party but became angry when he found out she was having her hair curled prior to doing so. He indicated she should not go but she went in any event. 

57The complainant's evidence was that she arrived at the party at about 6.45pm. The appellant kept calling her demanding she leave and threatening her if she did not. About an hour later she left. A friend dropped her off at Hurlstone Park RSL Club and she got a cab from there to Lakemba Station. She met the appellant then got in his car and he punched her about four times on her head, stomach and arms. After the assault the complainant said the appellant dropped her off in a street near her house. 

58She was cross-examined as to the fact that on 9 July 2008 the appellant spent $1,865 buying gifts from Versace and on the fact that on 7 September 2008 she sent him a photograph of herself wearing a wet tshirt. 

59In his address to the jury counsel for the appellant pointed to the absence of corroboration. 

60In relation to this charge and in relation to the events which occurred in 2008 generally, reliance was also placed on the contents of a video made in August 2008 at around the time of the Olympics. The complainant said she was scared of the appellant the whole time but she agreed that a video of August 2008 showed her conducting herself in an intimate, friendly way with the appellant. She acknowledged the video showed that she wanted to stay with him and that she performed oral sex on him, laughing when he ejaculated on her face. She acknowledged that it was consensual sexual activity. 

61Counts 16 and 17 relate to events which occurred in September 2008. Count 16 charged the appellant with assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst Count 17 charged him with stealing the complainant's SIM card and keeping it. The appellant was found guilty on both counts. 

62The complainant gave evidence she met the appellant at his townhouse on 10 September 2008 and told him she had formed a relationship with another man. She stated in her evidence that he then slapped her and she fell to the ground, where he kicked her three or four times. She was shown a photograph and she identified the bruises where she says she was hit. She then said she was forced to call the man with whom she had formed a relationship, a Mr Sfetsos, and the appellant told him to keep away from her. She said that after the discussion he took her phone, took the SIM card and put in a new prepaid SIM card. He refused to give the old SIM card back. When she got home she said her parents demanded the appellant come to see them. She said the appellant came to her home and argued with her father. 

63In cross-examination she was asked why, if she feared him, she went to his townhouse to tell him about the new relationship. She said it was the right thing to do. She acknowledged she did not mention the incident in the recorded conversation of 22 September 2008. She acknowledged that at the meeting with her father on 10 September 2008 (the night of the alleged incident) the appellant denied the incident occurred. 

64The complainant's father stated that in August or September he had a conversation with the appellant. He said at the time he saw bruising on the complainant's left cheek. He said he told the appellant that if he did not leave the complainant alone he would go to the police. He said that the appellant then swore he would leave her alone. However, the complainant said that she did not believe the appellant and he was lying. 

65The complainant's mother said that she was present during the conversation between the appellant and the complainant's father. She said the appellant said: ""Please do not go to the police, don't take out an AVO because its not good for my business"". The complainant's mother claimed to have said: ""You are sneaky and I will go to the police if you don't stop"". She said the appellant then left. 

66In his address to the jury counsel for the appellant emphasised that it was inherently unlikely that the complainant would go to the appellant's townhouse to tell him about her new relationship if she feared violence to the extent she claimed. 

67Counts 18-22 relate to incidents said to have occurred on 11 September 2008. Count 18 charged the appellant with aggravated break and enter, Count 19 with assault on the complainant, Count 20 with theft of the complainant's passport and Count 21 with taking the complainant with intent to obtain an advantage (forcing the complainant into a car), whilst Count 22 charged the appellant with intimidating the complainant with the intention of causing her mental harm. The appellant was acquitted on all counts. 

68In her evidence in chief the complainant said that on the morning of 11 September 2008 the appellant telephoned her asking whether she thought it was a smart idea to tell her parents (presumably about the assault the day before). She said she denied telling them. He allegedly said he was at Redfern and he would show everybody at her work ""what I have on you"". The appellant understood this to mean naked photographs and sex footage. 

69The appellant then said the complainant came to her house and demanded she open the roller doors at the rear of the premises. She said she did not want to, but he said it was for her own good so she opened the roller doors. She said she was scared because he gave the impression he was going to break in. She said that beyond the roller doors there was a shutter and glass door which she also opened because he was angry and screaming. The complainant said the appellant went straight through the doors and went to her bedroom. She said there was a scuffle and he took her passport saying she was not going anywhere. She then said he went to the kitchen, grabbed a steak knife, and put it to her neck. He told her to come to the car. She said when they got to the backyard he had the knife at her throat. He then dropped it. They walked to the car and she got in the back seat. The car was a black Audi and there was another man in it. She was introduced to the other man who was then driven to his house. 

70The complainant said that the appellant then took her to his townhouse where he showed her sex video footage he had on his computer and said he was going to show it to everybody. The footage showed images of consensual sex. 

71In cross-examination the complainant admitted that the first police statement she made in relation to these incidents was untruthful. She did not want to say that she voluntarily opened the roller doors because she did not want her parents to find out. She admitted that up to the sixth statement there was no mention of any other male in the car. She agreed that it was only in a statement made in November 2008 that she said the complainant dropped the knife. She acknowledged that she had previously seen some of the videos that he showed her. In relation to the passport she said she had plans to go to Thailand but acknowledged that the first time she said this was in her evidence at the trial. 

72In his address to the jury, counsel for the appellant emphasised the difficulties with her evidence which emerged in cross-examination and to which I have referred above. He also pointed out that in relation to Count 21, the complainant only contended that the appellant threatened to show the videos if she did not listen to him. He did not say that she had to continue an intimate relationship with him or else he would make public the tapes. 

73Counts 23-26 all relate to incidents which occurred on 22 September 2008. Count 23 charged the appellant with taking the complainant without her consent with intent to obtain an advantage (namely, to continue the relationship) and that at the time of the taking actual bodily harm was occasioned to the complainant. Count 24 charged the appellant with threatening to use an offensive weapon, namely a taser, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely intimidation. Count 25 charged the appellant with possession of a prohibited weapon, a taser, without being authorised by a permit whilst Count 26 charged the appellant with having sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting. The appellant was found guilty on all charges. 

74Count 27 also related to an incident on 22 September. It charged the appellant with demanding a laptop from the complainant with menaces with the intent to steal it from her. The appellant was acquitted on this charge. 

75The complainant gave evidence that she was too scared to go to work between 12 and 22 September 2008 because the appellant knew her movements. She said she went to work on 22 September 2008, leaving home at 6.55am. She said when she got to the bus stop the appellant grabbed her and took her to his car. She said there was shoving and pushing because she wanted to get out of the car as a result of which she suffered bruises on her arms. She then said he pulled out a taser gun, placed it close to her inner thigh, and said: ""If I zap this on your vagina you won't be able to conceive children"". She said he turned it on and she saw a blue current and it made a zapping noise. 

76The complainant said she was taken to a park 20 minutes away. She said they spoke more. He said: ""I will always have an alibi, I am always two steps ahead of you"". She said he stated he would infect her with AIDS. She then said the appellant demanded she give him oral sex and she did. A CD showing this incident was tendered. She said the appellant took the footage on his mobile phone. 

77The footage commenced with the complainant saying: ""Now I'm going to suck Sam's dick"". The complainant said the appellant told her to say this. She said the appellant told her to act normally. She said she did what she was told because she was frightened and did not know what to do. She said she knew the taser was in the car. She said that after the incident she and the appellant went to Westfield Shopping Centre at Miranda. She said the appellant bought her coffee and a muffin. She asked why they were there and he said ""I need to be seen with you in public"". 

78The complainant said that she and the appellant then went to the JB Hi-Fi store. She said that the appellant said to her he needed her to buy a laptop because he needed it at work. She said she told him she could not afford it but she bought it because she said: ""He just wouldn't stop"". She paid for it with an ANZ Visa card. She identified a receipt for the purchase of the computer. 

79The complainant then drove her home. On the way home she said they parked in her street up from her house and had the conversation which she recorded. 

80The appellant placed heavy reliance on this recording both at the trial and in this Court. During the course of the conversation the appellant said consistently he needed help. The complainant accused him of saying that he was going to get someone to infect her with AIDS and asked him if he was going to burn the shop. She asked him if he was going to get a hit man. The recording does not record any response by the appellant to the initial questions concerning infection with AIDS but in relation to the burning of the shops it records the appellant saying: "" ... will if I needed to. I've already got an alibi"". The appellant did not respond to the question: ""Are you going to get a hit man?"". In the course of the conversation the complainant told him to stop screaming and to continue with his therapy. She said she would not help him. She subsequently stated that she could not get out of her mind that he said he would get someone to infect her with AIDS with a syringe or burn the shop. The appellant responded: ""Maybe I was wrong to tell you that, maybe I was wrong"". 

81In the latter part of the conversation, the complainant said she had never seen the appellant so pathetic. He told her to get out of his car and she told him to calm down. He said he would get her money and she said: ""Give it to me"". When he said she should get in the car (presumably to drive to an ATM) she said: ""Don't worry about it"". Towards the end of the recording the complainant was recorded as saying: ""Oh man enough of your threats please"". It records the appellant saying in response: ""Well fuckin' make a few ... decision. Save your fuckin' life before I fuckin' destroy you"" and the complainant replying: ""No you wont"". 

82The appellant submitted that there were two matters of particular significance arising out of this conversation. First, there appeared to be no complaint of the incidents which were said to have occurred earlier in the day. Secondly, it was submitted that the conduct of the complainant was inconsistent with the conduct of someone who was fearful of the appellant. To the contrary she was the person who seemed in control. 

83The complainant was cross-examined extensively on the contents of the tape. It was put to her she was not scared. She denied that, saying she was confused because she had never seen the appellant act in that way. She denied she was in control and that what she said was inconsistent with someone who was fearful. 

84In relation to the incident of 22 September she admitted she did not tell the police what the appellant had said about not conceiving children. She also admitted that when she first went to the police she said nothing about the offence of sexual intercourse and only made the complaint when the police discovered the video which showed it. She told the police on 6 October that: ""She only remembered it then"". In her evidence she said she did not tell the police because of the impact it would have had on her boyfriend. 

85She admitted she was not detained at Westfield but said that she could not walk away because she was scared. She acknowledged that she did not tell the police about the recorded conversation in her first statement but only in her second. 

86A search by the police discovered a taser gun at the appellant's premises lying relatively openly in his garage. The officer who attempted to use it was unable to do so but it appears to be common ground that it was in working order. 

87Count 28 charged the appellant with intimidation of Mr Sfetsos. The appellant was found guilty and the finding is not challenged. 

88Neither party to the appeal proffered any criticism of the summing-up of the learned trial judge. He pointed out to the jury that because they reject some of the witnesses' evidence they did not have to reject all of it. They were directed that they were required to give separate consideration to the individual charges and that they were entitled to bring in verdicts of guilty on some counts and not guilty on others. They were specifically directed that if they had a doubt about the truthfulness of the complainant or her reliability on one or more of the charges, then they had to consider how that conclusion affected the other charges that depended on her evidence. Consistent with Markuleski they were directed that any doubts they may form about one aspect of the evidence of the complainant ought be considered in assessing her overall credibility with respect to the other charges. They were warned to exercise particular caution in convicting on uncorroborated evidence in terms suggested in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19 and were warned about the forensic disadvantage to the accused which can occur when there are significant delays in making a complaint, consistent with Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 29. 

Consideration 

89It is appropriate at the outset to have regard to the evidence available to the jury on the charges on which they acquitted the appellant. In relation to Count 6 there was no issue that an AVO had been obtained by the complainant but not proceeded with. The issue was whether the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she did not proceed because of the threats by the appellant to show sexually explicit photographs of her to her parents. There were three difficulties. First, there was no corroboration. Secondly, the claim that the appellant had followed her to Ashfield Police Station was only made to the prosecutor in her seventh statement immediately before the trial. Thirdly, there were inconsistencies in her evidence as to what she was wearing in, and the nature of, the photographs. 

90It should be noted that it was not suggested to the jury that although the incident may have occurred the requisite intent to pervert the course of justice had not been established. 

91It does not seem to me that acquittal on this count would necessarily lead to the conclusion that the jury had doubts about the complainant's honesty or for that matter her reliability generally. Rather, the jury may have acquitted because they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt having regard to the lack of corroboration coupled with the particular inconsistencies in her evidence concerning an event which had occurred seven years before. 

92So far as Counts 7, 8 and 9 are concerned there was evidence independent of the complainant that she and the appellant were at the Bankstown Travelodge together on 1 July 2005. Indeed, that did not seem to be in issue. However, the balance of what she said had occurred on that occasion is uncorroborated. I have set out earlier (at [36]) the matters which were raised in cross-examination in particular the timing of the allegation concerning the duct tape, the fact that she and the appellant had had consensual sex at the same motel previously and the withdrawal from what she said in her statement that she and the complainant were at the motel for four hours and that he had driven her home. 

93It is difficult to conclude on the evidence in this count other than that the jury failed to convict the appellant because the matters on which she was cross-examined to which I have referred cast doubt on her credibility or the reliability of her evidence at least so far as it related to this count. 

94Count 10, which was the first of the three demand with menaces counts, was corroborated at least to the extent that a credit card entry showed the withdrawal of $10,000. The incident occurred four years before the trial and was not the subject of a complaint in her first and second statements, unlike the payments the subject of Counts 11 and 12. 

95The jury plainly was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this payment was made to the appellant pursuant to an unlawful demand. However, this does not mean that the jury necessarily could not accept her evidence on Counts 11 and 12, demands which occurred two years later. The length of time between the payments and the late complaint compared to the complaints with respect to the other two payments meant, in my opinion, that it was open to the jury to find against the appellant in relation to Counts 11 and 12 whilst not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to Count 10. 

96Counts 14 and 15 related to the alleged assaults after 21 st birthday parties. The complainant's account was uncorroborated, nor were the assaults the subject of complaint in the 22 September recording. Further, the evidence showed that at the time surrounding each of these alleged assaults the appellant and complainant continued to engage in what appeared to be an affectionate relationship (see [54], [58], [60] above). 

97Counts 18-22 relate to the events of 11 September 2008. The appellant was acquitted on all counts. Once again there was no corroboration. Further, there was the admission that her first statement was untruthful in that the complainant did not say that she opened the roller door voluntarily. Other difficulties with her evidence which emerged during cross-examination are summarised in [71]. 

98Count 27 related to events which occurred immediately after the events of 22 December on which the appellant was found guilty. It was clear that the appellant and the complainant were at the JB Hi-Fi shop at Miranda and that the complainant purchased the laptop computer. The jury, however, were not prepared to accept beyond reasonable doubt her uncorroborated evidence that she was forced to do so. 

99So far as the counts in respect to which a conviction was recorded are concerned, it is necessary to bear in mind that the appeal is not merely based on inconsistent verdicts. The primary ground is that the verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The alternative is that they were inconsistent in the sense that they were neither logical nor reasonable and finally that they demonstrate compromise. However, it was not in contest that the verdicts could stand if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the evidence of the complainant on each count. 

Count 3 

100The first challenged count is Count 3, which related to intimidation of the complainant. In dealing with this count the complainant's evidence was that in 2002 the appellant hit her. Further, the jury found in relation to Counts 3 and 4 that the prank calls were in fact made and it is not in dispute that the complainant sought an apprehended violence order. Her evidence was to some extent corroborated by her parents. It seems to me that it was open to the jury to find the appellant guilty on this count. 

101I do not think that the fact the jury found the appellant not guilty on Count 6 means that the verdict in relation to Count 3 was illogical or unreasonable. The fact that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the reasons the complainant withdrew the AVO does not mean that it was illogical for them to find that the alleged intimidation the subject of Count 3 occurred. Nor do I think that the credibility issues which arose in respect of some of the more serious charges in later years precluded them from reaching this position particularly having regard to the corroborative material to which I have referred. 

102In these circumstances it is my opinion that the appeal so far as it relates to Count 3 should be dismissed. 

Counts 11 and 12 

103These counts present more difficulty. However, once again I am of the view that it was open to the jury to enter a verdict of guilty on these counts. There was no doubt that the money was withdrawn. The fact that the piece of paper the complainant claimed to have signed and given to the appellant in relation to the money the subject of Count 11 was not produced does not seem to me to be of particular significance having regard to the fact that the incident in question occurred some two years before the trial. Nor do I think that the absence of complaint prior to September 2008 was a matter which precluded the jury from concluding beyond reasonable doubt that the incident in question occurred. The complaint was raised when the complainant first elected to go to the police in September 2008. Similar considerations apply in relation to Count 12. Further the complainant's evidence that the money was to be spent on a boat obtained some limited support from the evidence of Mr Stevens and Mr Izci, although the $9,500 spent on the boat by no means accounts for the whole of the money the subject of Counts 11 and 12. Nor in my view does the fact that she did not tell the ANZ Bank the true reason for the second loan necessarily cast doubt upon her credibility in relation to this charge. It is quite conceivable that she would not have stated the true reason in the circumstances in which she claimed to have made the advance. 

104Further, I do not think much assistance is to be derived from the fact that $84,000 went back into her account over the two years subsequent to the withdrawal. Similarly the fact that she did not allege that the appellant threatened to show compromising videos and the suggested implausibility of his statement that he would leave her alone were not factors which required the jury to reject her evidence beyond reasonable doubt. It was open to the jury in my view to accept that she paid the money at least in the hope the appellant would do what he said. 

105The jury were directed to take into account any doubts they had as to the complainant's credibility on any one charge in their consideration of the other charges. In this regard they were required to take into account the conclusions which they reached particularly on Counts 7-9, 18-22 and 27. There was no reason to consider that they did not do so. Even taking these matters into account it does not seem to me that it was not open to the jury to accept the complainant's evidence on this count. 

106There are two other matters relevant to these counts. The first is that it was certainly established that the relationship between the appellant and the complainant from time to time was an affectionate one. This, of course, is consistent with voluntary advances. Secondly, there was no complaint in the recording of 22 September of the wrongful demand for these monies. However, once again I do not think these matters lead to the conclusion that the verdict was unreasonable. The fact that the relationship ebbed and flowed is not necessarily contrary to the conclusion that the unlawful demands were made. Also the fact that the demands were not mentioned in the recorded conversation of 22 September 2008 whilst a factor certainly to be taken into account, in my opinion, does not lead to the conclusion that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt particularly when these matters were raised in the first complaint to the police. 

107Finally, there is the acquittal on Count 10. The event in question occurred some two years prior to the incidents the subject of Counts 11 and 12. It does not seem to me that an acquittal on this count made the verdicts on Counts 11 and 12 illogical and unreasonable. Unlike the other two counts there was no complaint about the demand the subject of Count 10 at the time the complainant first went to the police and this, coupled with the absence of corroboration and a lengthy delay since the incident, may well have caused the jury not to have reached the requisite state of satisfaction on this count. 

108It follows that the appeal so far as it relates to Counts 11 and 12 should be dismissed. 

Count 13 

109This count related to the assault on 29 December 2007. There was no real corroboration of the incident. However, the complainant was able to identify the day of the assault from the date of the photograph taken the following day and she identified what she said were scars from the burns she claimed were the subject of the assault. She identified a doctor who she saw and a laser clinic to which she was referred. 

110Against these matters there must be put any doubt as to her credibility or reliability generally which the jury must have had arising out of their finding of not guilty on other counts, the fact that the only evidence that the scars to which she referred came from the burns was her uncorroborated testimony, and the fact there was no reference to the assault in the recording of 22 September 2008. 

111It seems to me that notwithstanding these matters the jury was entitled to accept her evidence on this count. It was a matter for the jury who heard her evidence to determine whether they could accept her account notwithstanding the limited corroboration. So far as the absence of any specific mention of the assault is concerned, I do not think that it is of particular significance in the context of this count. The assault occurred some eight months before the recording and it does not seem to me that the failure to mention this specific incident in a conversation of the nature of that which occurred was such as to preclude the jury from accepting her evidence beyond reasonable doubt on this count. 

112It follows, in my opinion, that the appeal so far as it relates to this count should be dismissed. 

Counts 16, 17, 23-26 generally 

113These counts along with Counts 17-22 and Count 27 all took place over a period of 12 days between 10 September 2008 and 22 September 2008. There are, in these circumstances, two things which should be said at the outset. First, it was plain that the jury was not satisfied at least as to the reliability of the complainant in relation to her evidence on Counts 17-22 and Count 27. In relation to the first of these sets of counts the difficulties with her evidence which are set out in [71] of this judgment must be borne in mind. So far as Count 27 is concerned it is implicit in the verdict of acquittal on this count that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to her evidence that she was forced by menaces of the appellant to acquire the computer. 

114Further, in relation to the sexual assault charge (Count 26) the jury was required to consider the effect on the general credibility of the complainant implicit in their rejection of Counts 7, 8 and 9 and of the fact that as late as August 2008 the complainant and the appellant were engaged in consensual sexual activity including similar activities to the ones the subject of Count 26. 

Counts 16 and 17 

115I have summarised the evidence surrounding these charges in [61]-[66]. To what I have said there must be added the content of the statement of agreed facts dated 17 November 2009. In that statement of facts it was agreed that on 10 September 2008 the complainant rang Mr Sfetsos and said she did not think they should see each other any more. Mr Sfetsos asked whether she was at home and she said no. The agreed statement of facts says that on the same day Mr Sfetsos rang the complainant's phone which was answered by the appellant. During the course of the call a conversation to the following effect took place: 

The appellant: ""I told you before don't call A again and walk away. I know where you live."" 

Sfetsos: ""What do you mean, are you trying to threaten me?"" 

The appellant: ""I'd advise you not to go down this road."" 

116Taking this evidence into account coupled with the evidence of the complainant's parents to which I have referred in pars [64]-[66], it seems to me that notwithstanding any doubts the jury may have had as to her credibility and reliability concerning the other incidents which occurred either about the same time or generally, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to these counts. In particular, the proposition put to the jury that it was inherently unlikely that the complainant would go to the appellant's townhouse if she was in fear of him is to a large extent contradicted by the contemporaneous statement that she was not at home and the fact that on that day the appellant had her phone. 

117In these circumstance the appeal should be dismissed so far as it relates to Counts 16 and 17. 

Counts 23-26 

118I have set out at [73]-[86] the facts surrounding these counts and the evidence given in cross-examination. There are a number of matters which should be noted about the evidence. First, having regard to the time the complainant said the respondent collected her they were together for some 31/2 hours before they arrived at Westfield to have coffee and a muffin and to acquire the computer. These facts would tend to cast doubt on any sexual activity being non-consensual. Related to this is the complainant's evidence that she was not detained at Westfield. Her statement she was in fear was to some extent contradicted by the aggressive tone that she adopted in the conversation she subsequently recorded. Secondly, there is the fact that the complaint of sexual assault was only made after the video of the sexual activity was discovered coupled with her initial explanation that she only remembered it at that time. Thirdly, in the recording of 22 September 2008, she made no complaint about the incident which was the subject of the events which had occurred only that morning. Fourthly, and perhaps less importantly, although in her first statement to the police the complainant alleged that appellant threatened ""I'll put this on your vagina"" while holding the taser, she later recounted that he said ""If I zap this on your vagina you won't be able to conceive children"". 

119These matters fall to be considered in the context of doubts which arose as to the complainant's reliability arising out of the jury's acquittal in relation to Counts 7, 8 and 9, the fact that similar sexual activity had taken place consensually one month before and the acquittal on Count 27. 

120There are three other matters which tend the other way. First, as I have pointed out in [80], one of the matters which was raised in the recording of 22 September 2008 was the statement by the appellant that he would cause her to be infected with AIDS. This is one of the threats she told the police he made at the time of the demand for oral sex. Secondly, there is no doubt that the appellant was in possession of a taser three days after the alleged event occurred. Thirdly, I have considered the video taken on the appellant's phone. Having looked at it, it would seem to me to be open to the jury, at least absent the other facts to which I have referred, to take the view that notwithstanding the complainant's repeated comment ""Now I am going to suck Sam's dick"" and the so-called smiles, the activities were non-consensual. 

121However, taking all these matters into account I am of the view that on the whole of the evidence and taking into account the advantages enjoyed by the jury it was not open to them in this case to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the charges the subject of Counts 23, 25 and 26. The evidence I have discussed in detail in [73]-[86], and summarised in [118]-[120], coupled with the doubts the jury must have had in respect of her general reliability and credibility arising out of the acquittals on Counts 7-9 and Count 27 in particular, lead to that conclusion. This is so notwithstanding the countervailing factors to which I have referred above, and the jury's advantage in seeing the complainant. 

122Count 25 falls into a slightly different category. A taser was found in the appellant's garage on 28 September 2008. However, if it is correct that it was not open to the jury to convict on Count 24 (use of the taser with intent to intimidate on 22 September 2008) then on the evidence, in my opinion, it was not open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the weapon on 22 September 2008 as charged. 

123In summary, the evidence given by the complainant revealed a number of matters which, when examined individually and together, raise issues concerning the reliability of the complainant. They included: 

(1) At about 6.00pm on the day the alleged offences occurred, the complainant attended Ashfield Police Station and provided an account in relation to a number of matters. 

(2) However, as noted above, she did not initially report the most serious of the offences later reported, namely, the alleged sexual offence. There was no reference to it in her first statement given to police. 

(3) The complainant again failed to report that offence when providing a second statement to police. 

(4) The alleged sexual offence was only raised after police found the video recording of sexual activity involving the complainant and the appellant and police put a direct question to her as to whether the appellant forced her to engage in that activity. That was the first time the matter was raised in discussions with police. Her account was subsequently included in her statement signed on 8 October 2008. 

(5) The reason given by the complainant in cross-examination for not having raised the alleged sexual offence with police in her first discussion with them about all of the events of 22 September 2008 was said by her to have been that she did not want her boyfriend ""Steve"" to find out. She said she felt guilty and she felt ""bad for him"" having regard to what he had been through the previous week. 

(6) The recording made of a conversation between the complainant and the appellant on 22 September 2008 was not provided by the complainant to police on that day when she attended Ashfield Police Station even though she said that she listened to the tape before going to police. She said there was no reason why she would not have given the recording to police that day. 

(7) The complainant said that she was scared during the period she was with the appellant on 22 September 2008. She would not agree in cross-examination that the recording showed her ""standing up for yourself"". The recording, however, does indicate that the complainant was at least assertive and speaking in strong and, at times, in quite forthright terms to the appellant. It was put to her that she told the accused to stop screaming and ""Don't make a scene. I've never seen you so pathetic"". The complainant rejected the proposition that she was asserting control. A number of the complainant's statements are not consistent with her being in a state of fear at least at the time they were made. 

124Following an examination of the whole of the evidence relating to Counts 23, 24 and 26, I have concluded that the inadequacies in the evidence to which reference is made in par [123] (1)-(7) are such that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences the subject of those counts. 

125For the reasons given in pars [118]-[124] and in circumstances in which the jury were not prepared to convict the appellant on the complainant's graphic evidence concerning the alleged sexual and other assaults the subject of Counts 7, 8 and 9, a jury properly assessing the evidence would have had a reasonable doubt as to the offences that the complainant alleged had taken place on 22 September 2008. 

126It follows, in my opinion, that the appeal should be allowed so far as Counts 23-26 are concerned. 

Conclusion 

127The appeal should be allowed in part. The convictions in respect to Counts 23-26 should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered on each of these counts. In all other respects the appeal should be dismissed. 

128The effect of these conclusions is that the only extant sentences are those in respect to Counts 11 and 12 which were fixed term sentences expiring on 24 December 2011 and 24 March 2012 respectively. I note the present appeal is an appeal against conviction only. There were no submissions made on behalf of the appellant as to whether any application might be made in respect of sentences imposed for those offences in respect to which convictions remain. Having noted that matter, I do not consider that it is either appropriate or necessary for this Court to make any other observations or express any other conclusions on that matter. 

129In the circumstances, I would make the following orders: 

(1) Grant leave to appeal. 

(2) Appeal allowed in part. 

(3) The convictions in respect of Counts 23-26 in the indictment of 9 November 2009 be quashed and in lieu thereof direct that judgment and verdicts of acquittal be entered on each of those charges. 

(4) In all other respects dismiss the appeal. 

130HALL J: I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Bathurst CJ. 

131HARRISON J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

		29 August 2011",2011-08-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757734,R v MURRAY [2011] NSWDC 203,"Judgment 
1HIS HONOUR: Justin Murray appears for sentence on four offences. To three of those he entered pleas of guilty, to the final offence he pleaded not guilty, but I found him guilty after a short judge alone trial. 

2Before setting out the offences themselves, I want to set out how it is that Mr Murray found himself in a position where he committed those offences. He was released from custody for some driving matters on 19 February 2010. He had earlier had a relationship with a young woman by the name of Kristy Nabillo. Although Ms Nabillo had terminated the relationship, she generously allowed Mr Murray to stay with her upon his release from custody as he had not many other places to go. 

3After a few days matters turned sour. The precise circumstances of what occurred on 23 February 2010 are disputed and will be resolved at a trial to be held at a later date, but what is common to the version of events advanced by the prosecution and the version of events advanced by Mr Murray, is that he was significantly distressed at learning that Ms Nabillo had entered a new relationship. He then went on something of a binge. He drank a lot and took drugs. Indeed on 27 February 2010, the day before the offences for which I must sentence him, he was admitted to Westmead Hospital under a different name because he was found on a train in a highly intoxicated position. Investigations revealed that he had overdosed on alcohol, methadone and valium. 

4The following day at about 7 o'clock he went into a convenience store and committed the following offences. He was armed with an imitation firearm and assaulted Jun Xu with intent to rob him. He was in possession of the imitation firearm, that being a ""weapon"". He was in possession of a set of knuckle dusters and upon being caught, having committed those three offences, he intimidated Joseph Kudare with intention to cause him fear or physical or mental harm. 

5It is clear from the observations made by police who later arrested him, and also what Mr Xu described, that Mr Murray was significantly intoxicated at the time he committed the offence. The offender went in to the convenient store, approached Mr Xu, who was serving behind the counter, and said, ""Give me cigarettes"". When Mr Xu asked for money, the offender said, ""I don't have any money, I'll pay you later."" It was at that stage that the offender produced what looked to be a handgun. The offender looked at the gun and then pointed the gun at Mr Xu. Mr Xu said, ""Okay, I will set up a credit account for you. Just give your ID."" Somewhat surprisingly the offender then said ""Okay"". 

6Mr Xu then said, ""Give me your driver's licence."" The offender said, ""I don't have a driver's licence, but I can give you some other identification,"" and he then began looking through cards that he had produced from his pants. Mr Xu took advantage of the fact that the offender was distracted. He said, ""I'll get the cigarettes for you,"" and moved to pick up a metal bar. He then said to the offender , ""Get out, drop the gun."" 

7In finding the accused guilty of this offence, I concluded that the evidence tendered to suggest only a momentary intention to rob, which may well have evaporated by the time the offender pulled out the cards from his pocket. After Mr Xu produced the metal bar, the offender ran away. He was chased. He dropped the gun to the ground and Mr Xu picked it up. The offender turned around and said, ""Give me the gun, give me the gun,"" but Mr Xu said, ""No, wait here for the police."" 

8It was at about this time that Mr Joe Kudare, the gentleman mentioned in the offence of intimidation that I referred to earlier, came on the scene. He and some relatives of his were working in Mr Kudare's pizza shop. Mr Kudare was told that Mr Xu, who he knew as Billy, was in trouble, so Mr Kudare and his son and his nephew ran out of their shop to see if they could assist. They saw Mr Xu with the gun in one hand and the metal bar in the other. Mr Kudare said to the offender, ""Stay right there, mate. Stay right there, don't bloody move."" The offender said, possibly reasonably accurately, ""I didn't mean it. I only wanted a packet of smokes."" He was told to stay where he was, but ran away. 

9The people chasing him caught up to him in a park. He was told to get on the ground, which he did. He was then held down. He asked to be let go, saying to one of the men, again fairly accurately, ""Let me go, let me go, I've had problems with my girlfriend. I've just broken up."" The offender was seen to take off some knuckledusters, which he had on his hand, and dropped them to the ground. Police arrived and arrested him. As he was being arrested he said to Mr Joseph Kudare, ""Watch your shop. Watch your fucking shop, you Lebanese wog."" Not surprisingly, Mr Kudare said that he felt threatened by those comments and feared that the offender would return to damage his pizza shop and hurt himself and his family. 

10The offender was taken to the police station, where he slept for a while before being interviewed. He was asked why he was being interviewed and he said, ""Yeah, drive with no licence."" The offender said that he had not consumed any alcohol or drugs that day, but that he had had a fair bit the day before. When told he was at the police station for an attempted armed robbery, he replied, ""I forgot about that."" The offender said other things to the police, indicating that at some stage two people that he was with tried to convince him to assist in the robbery of a pizza deliverer, but all he really wanted to do was to get some cigarettes. 

11I know very little about the offender. I know that he was born on 28 April 1979 and that he has spent a substantial part of his life in gaol. He has been given opportunities in the past, but primarily, I gather, because of problems with alcohol and drugs, he offends. He is at the age where not much leniency can be shown towards him. It is terribly sad to say it, but the offender seems to have fallen into a pattern of behaviour which sees him commit offences soon after release from custody, which has the effect of him having to return him to custody, with very little time as a free man. 

12He has had problems in the past with depression, to the extent that he has reported to medical staff with suicidal ideation. Indeed at one stage he was taken to Cumberland Hospital after his arrest on 1 March 2010, the day after committing these offences, because of concerns about his mental state. 

13Since going into custody he appears to have made the most of his time there. He is undertaking various TAFE courses, primarily those involving welding, and is achieving good results. Indeed his trainer says that he should be able to obtain employment in this field with more study. He follows instructions and shows great enthusiasm and skill towards each given task. Mr Murray should be proud of having achieved those results whilst in custody. 

14Because the weapon offences carry with them standard nonparole periods, it is important that I assess their objective criminality in a specific way. I am satisfied that objectively both offences are significantly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Of course the primary reason for that finding concerns the nature of the weapons. The imitation firearm was incapable of causing injury, and whilst the knuckledusters were a nasty weapon, quite capable of causing significant injury, they were not used in any way, and in any case the range of prohibited weapons extends a significant direction towards weapons capable of causing enormous harm, injury and death. 

15I do also have to say one other thing about the offence involving possessing the imitation firearm: it is the use of that same item which exposes the offender to a much higher maximum penalty insofar as the attempted robbery is concerned. I have to be very careful therefore not to double count and punish the offender by taking into account the possession of the weapon twice, once when sentencing him for the most serious matter which I found him guilty of, and once in sentencing him for the possession of that item. 

16Although the offender did not plead guilty to the major offence, he pleaded guilty to an alternative. The Crown did not accept that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment and so the judge alone trial was held, but I will give the offender substantial credit for the limited nature of the issues that I had to determine in the trial. By his pleas of guilty the offender admitted many things and left only a very narrow issue in dispute. I will also discount the sentences on the matters where pleas of guilty were entered by twentyfive per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas. I am going to do that even though the pleas came late because as the Crown fairly concedes the only reason they were late is that the Crown attitude prevented them being entered earlier. 

17Of course I should look at the  R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R guideline in determining the appropriate sentence. There are a number of matters to be said about that guideline and its relationship with the present case. Firstly, the maximum penalty is higher. Secondly, this is not a weapon like a knife or working firearm. As I have said, a couple of times I think, this weapon was incapable of causing any injury at all. Of course Mr Xu was not to know that and so he was no doubt at least apprehensive at seeing the offender in possession of what to him must have looked like a real firearm. 

18The Henry guideline is based on a plea of limited utility. Here there was no plea of guilty to the robbery matter, but, as I have mentioned before, there were pleas of guilty to other matters and the issue in relation to the robbery matter was very limited indeed. Finally, when I compare this matter to the Henry guideline, Mr Murray is far from a young offender with little or no criminal history. It is therefore necessary for a substantial period of imprisonment to be imposed upon him, even though he was at the time not functioning as well as he would have been had he not been toxicated or affected by drugs. 

19One issue that I specifically raise concerns when I should commence the sentences that I will shortly announce. There are a number of reasons that I will start the sentence earlier than today. He spent two months in custody solely in relation to these matters and he does not appear to have been given credit for that time in any of the other sentences that have been imposed upon him to date. He has also spent some extra time in custody in relation to both these matters and the offences which allegedly involve Ms Nobillo. I will give him credit for that time. Should he be convicted of offences in relation to Ms Nobillo, it would be inappropriate for him to get further credit. 

20Finally, there is the principle of totality. Were I dealing with all of these matters at the same time I would probably partially accumulate sentences upon each other. I should not fail to do that simply because he is being sentenced for these matters at separate times. For those reasons the sentences that I will shortly announce will start on 25 November 2010. 

21There is hope for the offender's future, despite the matters I have said so far looking rather bleak. The offender is, not to put too fine a point on it, growing up. He genuinely desires, I believe, to put his unproductive life behind him. When he was asked how long it was since he had last taken methadone, he knew precisely how many days it was. He is clearly proud of the efforts that he has been able to make to date and so he should be. Upon his release from custody, of course, he will need a lengthy period of supervision on parole and I have made a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour because of that. I have also made that finding because of the fact, as I have mentioned, that these sentences will be accumulated on other sentences imposed upon Mr Murray earlier. 

22Although these offences all occurred at the same time, they do represent separate aspects of criminal behaviour and so it is appropriate that separate sentences be imposed for each offence, with the qualification that for the two weapons offences sentences for those will be served at the same time for the reasons I indicated when dealing with the matters earlier. 

23For the offence of intimidating Joseph Kudare, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of eighteen months, to date from 25 November 2010. For the offences of possessing weapons, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of one year and a head sentence of two years, to date from 25 November 2011. For the offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, I set a nonparole period of one and a half years, to date from 25 May 2012, and a head sentence in that matter of four and a half years. The overall sentence is thus one comprising of a nonparole period of three years, with a head sentence of six years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 24 November 2013.

		16 December 2011",2011-09-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757737,R v McKENZIE [2011] NSWDC 168,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Karen McKenzie appears for sentence after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to aiding and abetting the importing of a border controlled drug namely amphetamine, the quantity imported being a marketable quantity. What Ms McKenzie did, precisely, has been the subject of some dispute in the evidence before me. It is important therefore that I make clear my findings of fact. 

2The matter came to the attention of the authorities when they detected a series of packages, sent from the United States of America' which had secreted within them methamphetamine. These were sent by a Ms Farrow. Some of those packages were sent to the offender's address. One particular consignment is the subject of the present offence. It was sent to the consignee named as Janet Rigby, Gordon Rigby Smith & Co., at the offender's address in Redfern. It purported to contain a cordless tranquillity fountain kit for relaxation and whilst it may well have contained something of that nature it also contained a significant quantity of drugs; 63.3 grams of pure crystal methamphetamine. 

3Gordon Rigby Smith is the offender's uncle, he is relatively old and has suffered from Alzheimer's disease for a number of years. His affairs have been managed by the Public Guardian since 23 December 2009. He is also cared for by the offender herself. It is clearly a matter which reflects badly upon her that she used her demented uncle's name as a means of escaping detection as she committed the offence for which she must now be sentenced. 

4The particular area of dispute concerns the level of the offender's involvement. The Crown submissions in this matter are predicated on the assumption that I would find that Ms McKenzie was the purchaser of those drugs, but it is Ms McKenzie's evidence is that all she did was allow her address to be used by another person who was the actual purchaser, in return for receiving free drugs. She admits that as well as doing that she used her own telephone to check up on where the particular consignment was, using the tracking number that had been provided. She concedes also that her fingerprint was found on a deposit slip which accompanied a deposit of $8,000 cash into Ms Farrow's bank account and she concedes that when she was first arrested by the Australian Federal Police she told them, what I would describe as a pack of lies. But she still maintains that she was not the purchaser of the drugs, merely someone who aided the purchaser by receiving packages at her address. I will sentence her on the basis that she describes. 

5It is important to note that she was charged as an aider and abetter, she was not charged as a principal and were it the case that she was in fact a person who purchased and thus imported the drugs, I would have expected her to be charged as a principal. In any case the only material the Crown can rely on is the statement of facts. Read carefully it is not inconsistent with the sworn evidence given by the offender. I will therefore sentence her on the basis that her criminality is that she allowed someone else to have packages that she knew contained drugs sent to her premises in return for receiving some free drugs herself. 

6I mentioned before that this was not the first package. Although of course I am only to sentence Ms McKenzie for the actual offence to which she has pleaded guilty, she does not get the benefit of a finding that this was an isolated instance. 

7Ms McKenzie is forty-eight years of age, she has no prior convictions, although given her lengthy history of drug use it cannot be said that she has never broken the law before. She has been a user of illegal drugs for some time and each time she purchased them, possessed them and used them, she was committing a criminal offence, albeit of course an offence not nearly as serious as the offence for which she must now be sentenced. 

8She was brought up in a stable and loving family, she was married, that marriage ending in divorce, but remains on good terms with her ex-husband. Indeed he provided a reference supporting his ex-wife in the present proceedings. She has her own graphic design business. Like many businesses of recent times it has had some financial set-backs but Ms McKenzie hopes to be able to revitalise the business if the order I make today allows her to do so. 

9She has done much in her life that she is entitled to be proud of. On the first occasion this matter was before me there were many people in the Court room supporting her, and a lot of those people have returned today. Tendered on the last occasion were also many, many, references from family and friends describing the good work that Ms McKenzie does to others who need support and comfort. She helps strangers as well, assisting various charities in financial terms, despite her financial position not being a comfortable one. 

10It is surprising, indeed, were it not for a factor I will now mention, for a person of Ms McKenzie's admirable background and character to face a sentence for such a serious offence as this, an offence which ordinarily would result in Ms McKenzie receiving a sentence of full time custody. 

11In 1989 Ms McKenzie was in London, she was on the Marchioness, a boat which was sunk in a collision with another vessel on the Thames; fifty-one people died in that collision. Ms McKenzie was trapped under water for a significant period of time but was able to swim to the surface and eventually, after some significant time in the water, she was rescued. Not surprisingly that experience has had a profound impact upon her. Diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder are bandied around these courts with gay abandon, but it is not at all difficult to accept that many of the problems that Ms McKenzie has faced since 1989 can be traced directly to the terrifying experience which I have just described. 

12Courts are often called upon to sentence offenders addicted to drugs. In determining the effect that such an addiction has upon the sentence to be imposed, Judges often look at the concept of personal choice. Indeed the well-known decision of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R examined that issue at some length. It has to be recognised that Ms McKenzie was less able than others to respond appropriately to stressors in her life which followed the sinking of the Marchioness because of her experience. That is not, of course, to say that all survivors of the Marchioness went down the path of drug use, but it is to recognise that the choices that Ms McKenzie faced were made more difficult for her by her experience. She began to self-medicate in the years which followed and that led to a significant drug addiction which in turn, led directly to the commission of this offence. 

13When the matter was first before me there were promising signs. Ms McKenzie was receiving treatment and it looked as though she was able to put her drug addiction behind her. I therefore adjourned the matter under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In doing so I made it quite clear to Ms McKenzie the impact that further drug use would have upon my decision as to what sentence I would impose upon her. I told her this, ""I can guarantee you that any use of drugs is going to make it much more likely that you end up in gaol."" Despite that warning Ms McKenzie has used drugs. One of the conditions of the s 11 remand was that she undergo regular urinalysis. The urinalysis conducted in late June revealed the presence of amphetamine type substances and benzodiazepines. If Ms McKenzie is prepared to use drugs knowing that she will be coming back before a Judge to be sentenced for a drug related offence, one has to wonder whether there needs to be a further and important aspect of personal deterrence in any sentence I impose upon her. That she would use drugs knowing that her use would be revealed to the Judge who is about to sentence her says a lot about the depth of her addiction. It calls into question her prospects of rehabilitation, at least insofar as that concerns drug use. It also makes it more likely that the offender will commit other more serious offences beyond simple drug use; offences of the kind that I have to sentence her for. It is disappointing to say the least that she appears in Court unable to say that she took advantage of the period of leniency that was offered to her. 

14Notwithstanding that use of drugs, reports tendered today by people who are aware of the relapse still speak highly of her, and her abilities to rehabilitate, that is to put her drug use behind her. In particular the pre-sentence report, the updated one tendered today, remains positive. Indeed, although it is not terribly relevant to the ultimate sentence that I am going to impose, whilst in the first pre-sentence report she was not suitable for a Community Service Order because of her vulnerability to relapse, the author of the updated pre-sentence report has been so impressed by Ms McKenzie's efforts, despite the relapse, that she is now suitable for a Community Service Order. To her credit also Ms McKenzie revealed her relapse to her general practitioner and has discussed with her doctor, and her counsellors, what led to that relapse. 

15I should mention that Ms McKenzie's plea of guilty is of course consistent with her willingness to facilitate the course of justice and so the sentence that I will impose upon her is 25 per cent less than it otherwise would have been. 

16Ms McKenzie is clearly distressed by the position that she now finds herself in, a position of course that she has put herself in through her illegal conduct. She is able to look back, with a clearer mind than she had at the time, to the way she was behaving in 2009 and to recognise that what put her in the position she is today was her drug use. She is clearly distressed by her present predicament and fearful of going to gaol. 

17The Crown seeks a full time custodial sentence. Ms Paul, who appears for the offender, seeks a suspended sentence under s 20(1)(b) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act . I do propose to impose a suspended sentence upon Ms McKenzie. Notwithstanding that that can be thought to involve little punishment, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to focus more on Ms McKenzie's personal rehabilitation than it is to focus on other aspects of sentencing. That is not to say, of course, that I have ignored such things as general deterrence and retribution, but it is to say that in the present case I consider that if I can fashion orders which see Ms McKenzie turning away from drug use, then she will once again become a valuable member of the community. Not only will she benefit from that but of course the community will as well. 

18However it needs to be understood that the position I am taking is a lenient one, that Ms McKenzie was very close to going to gaol full time and that any breach of the conditions under which I will suspend the sentence will see her receiving the sentence which, in one sense, she richly deserves. 

19Ms McKenzie is sentenced to be imprisoned for two years to date from 1 September 2011. I make a recognisance release order. I direct the offender be released forthwith upon giving security in terms I will now specify. 

20The conditions of the recognisance release order and the order that the offender be released from custody forthwith are conditional upon the offender entering into a recognisance, self in the sum of one thousand dollars, the conditions of which are: 

(1)she is to be of good behaviour, 

(2)she is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of that service, 

(3)she is to consume no illegal drugs, whatsoever, no matter what pressure she perceives that she is under, 

(4)she is to prove compliance with condition 3, by providing at her own expense, to the Probation and Parole Service results of monthly urinalysis and to undergo further random urinalysis at the direction of the Probation and Parole Service, 

(5)any breach of these conditions is to be brought to my attention immediately. 

21Now Ms McKenzie, the prosecution wanted me to send you to gaol straight away, you know that do you not. Ordinarily I would have done that without any hesitation, especially given your relapse in the interim. It is a sentence that, as I said a little while ago, you richly deserve. However I am going to take a chance that you can put your drug use behind you. In one sense I do not really care whether you use drugs or not, I mean it is your life, you can do what you like with it. But when you commit offences by using drugs and more importantly when you harm the community by using drugs and then importing them that is when things get serious. So I put you on very strict conditions for two years, you cannot use any drugs at all, if you do there is going to be but one consequence and that is that you go to gaol. Now I have spent a bit of time visiting the gaols and I can tell you that they are terrible places. In particular the gaols that women serve their sentences in are awful, so not only will you be in a place where you are confined but you will be in a place where the conditions are terrible. 

22Now do you want to ask me any questions about what I have done? 

23OFFENDER: No, no.

		27 October 2011",2011-09-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757738,Gorrick v NSW Police [2011] NSWSC 1312,"Judgment (on adjournment of proceedings) 

1JOHNSON J : Before the Court today, in the Duty Judge list, are proceedings commenced by Summons filed on 21 October 2010, in which the Plaintiff, Christopher Charles Gorrick, seeks relief against the Defendant, referred to as ""NSW Police"" . 

2Proceedings having been commenced 10 months ago, there have been a number of mentions before the Registrar with no appearance of the Defendant. Given the imprecise way in which the Defendant was identified, that state of affairs is not surprising. 

3On 8 August 2011, the matter came before Barr AJ, and an affidavit of the Plaintiff affirmed 8 August 2011 was furnished to the Court. The matter was stood over and, on 19 August 2011, the Registrar directed that the proceedings should come before the Duty Judge today to deal with the application for leave to appeal out of time identified in the Plaintiff's Summons. 

4Today, Mr Fraser appears effectively for the Commissioner of Police. Mr Gorrick appears for himself. 

5There has been some discussion concerning the nature of the proceedings and their current status. Mr Gorrick sought an adjournment of the matter, which was not opposed by Mr Fraser, and which I propose to allow. The following observations are intended to record the issues in the proceedings and the steps which Mr Gorrick will be required to take to prepare the matter for hearing. 

6The Summons seeks the following relief: 

""1. Leave to appeal out of time against conviction in Parramatta Local Court. 

2. Stay of execution of sentence pending granting of leave to appeal and hearing of appeal"". 

7Until the affidavit of Mr Gorrick of 8 August 2011 was supplied, the nature of the proceedings remained as expressed in those somewhat cryptic terms. The affidavit indicates that what Mr Gorrick is seeking to do is to appeal against a conviction in the Parramatta Local Court on 16 June 2010 for an offence under s.18 Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 . Mr Gorrick indicates that he pleaded guilty to that matter and was placed on a bond under s.9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 18 months. 

8Mr Gorrick's affidavit indicates that he gave instructions to his then lawyers to appeal to the District Court. He was represented in the Local Court by a solicitor, Mr Autore, who instructed a barrister, Mr Steward. 

9It would seem that Mr Gorrick was in custody for a period for breach of parole and that, as it happens, no appeal was lodged to the District Court. 

10An appeal to the District Court lies in criminal proceedings in the Local Court under s.11 and following of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 . Such an appeal may be brought as of right within 28 days and, by leave, within three months. Under s.13 of that Act, three months is an outer limit which cannot be further extended. 

11Mr Gorrick has told the Court that his intention was to appeal against conviction. As I have mentioned, he pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was represented by solicitor and counsel. The transcript of 16 June 2010 is now before the Court (MFI1). A statement of facts was apparently presented to the presiding Magistrate in a form that was signed by Mr Gorrick (MFI3). If Mr Gorrick had been in time to appeal to the District Court against conviction, it would still have been necessary for him to obtain leave to appeal against conviction because he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court: ss.11(1A), 12(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 . However, that is academic because it is simply too late for Mr Gorrick to appeal to the District Court. It was too late by the time he commenced the proceedings in this Court on 21 October 2010. 

12Mr Gorrick tells the Court that, by his Summons, he seeks leave to appeal to this Court and to have this Court, in effect, allow him to appeal to the District Court. I do not think that ss.52, 53, 54 or 55 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (or any other section in that Act) allows this Court to make orders to open the door to an appeal to the District Court. 

13Mr Gorrick then indicated that what he sought to do was to appeal against conviction on the basis that the statement of facts relied upon in the Local Court does not disclose the offence to which he pleaded guilty. I have raised with Mr Gorrick a number of problems with this argument. Having done so, although I am not proceeding to determine the matter, it is appropriate that I record these matters in case it becomes relevant at a later time. 

14It is open to a person who has pleaded guilty to an offence in the Local Court to seek the leave of the Local Court to withdraw the plea of guilty, at any time prior to sentence, under s.207 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 . The Local Court has a discretion in that respect which will not be lightly exercised: Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 129; 155 A Crim R 37; Director of Public Prosecutions v Yeo [2008] NSWSC 953; 188 A Crim R 82 at 92-93 [40]-[47]. The position is particularly challenging for an applicant who was legally represented when the plea of guilty was entered. However, that is academic because no such application was made to the Local Court by Mr Gorrick before sentence in this case. 

15It may be theoretically open to the Plaintiff to seek to challenge, on appeal, his conviction on the basis that no offence was committed, despite his plea of guilty: cf Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 312-313 [32]-[35]. A problem for Mr Gorrick, of course, is that the plea of guilty itself involves an admission of all the elements of the offence: Meissner v The Queen [1995] HCA 41; 184 CLR 132 at 157. The basis of the conviction is the admission of the Plaintiff, whether the facts tendered in support of the sentencing hearing disclose an offence or not. 

16All of this I record because it reveals, in my view, a number of fundamental problems that lie ahead for the Plaintiff. Whether he can persuade a Judge of this Court to grant him leave to appeal and indeed whether there is a foundation within ss.52 to 55 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for him to seek that that be done, remains to be considered on a future occasion, if the Plaintiff presses his claim for relief. 

17I have informed the Plaintiff that the ordinary rule as to costs in civil proceedings applies to an appeal of this sort. If the matter is run to finality, and if he does not succeed, then he is at risk of an order for costs being made against him in favour of the active Defendant to the proceedings. 

18Mr Gorrick has indicated that he intends to instruct a solicitor, Maurice Marshan of Maurice Marshan & Associates at Five Dock, and that he wishes an opportunity to file an Amended Summons and an affidavit in support, and to have an opportunity for the matter to proceed to a hearing on the merits. 

19It will be necessary for the Plaintiff to correctly identify the Defendant. The Defendant ought be the police officer who initiated the criminal proceedings against the Plaintiff in the first place. It may be, in accordance with common practice, that the Director of Public Prosecutions will take over the opposition to the appeal in this Court under ss.9 and 10 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 . That course is open to the Director, and frequently happens. Whether the Director takes that course or not, of course, is a matter for him. 

20I have made these observations to record my perception of the issues and problems in the proceedings as they stand. It will, of course, be a matter for the Judge who hears the matter to determine the proceedings on their merits including any application for leave to appeal out of time. 

21I make the following orders: 

(1) I direct the Plaintiff to file and serve by 14 October 2011 an Amended Summons which identifies correctly the Defendant, and which sets out the relief he seeks under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and which otherwise complies with the requirements of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 for an appeal to this Court under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 . 

(2) I direct the Plaintiff to file and serve by 14 October 2011 any affidavit upon which he seeks to rely in support of his claim for relief. 

(3) I direct that a Notice of Appearance of the lawyer to appear for the Plaintiff be filed and served by 14 October 2011. 

(4) I stand over the proceedings until 9.00 am on 24 October 2011 before the Registrar. Whether the proceedings are referred to the Duty Judge for hearing on that day will depend upon the state of readiness and time estimate of the matter, and the ability of the Duty Judge to accommodate the matter. 

(5) The costs of today are reserved. 

22[Postscript: On 20 October 2011, the Plaintiff discontinued the proceedings with the consent of the Defendant].

		15 November 2011",2011-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757746,LS v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) and Anor [2011] NSWSC 1016,"Judgment 

1JOHNSON J : By Further Amended Summons filed 18 August 2011, the Plaintiff, LS, seeks prerogative relief under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 with respect to a ruling made in criminal proceedings against him before the Children's Court. 

2The Plaintiff contends that the Second Defendant, Magistrate Graham Blewitt, erred in ruling on 3 February 2011 that, because of s.19 Evidence Act 1995 , it was not open to the mother of LS to object under s.18 Evidence Act 1995 to being called as a prosecution witness in the case against him. 

Proceedings in the Supreme Court 

3Following the commencement of proceedings in this Court by the filing of a Summons on 3 May 2011, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) gave notice, for the purpose of ss.9(1)(c) and 10 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 , that the Director was conducting the present proceedings in this Court on behalf of the prosecution. The Director of Public Prosecutions has been substituted as First Defendant in place of the police officer who instituted proceedings in the Children's Court against the Plaintiff. 

4At the hearing of the Further Amended Summons on 29 August 2011, Ms Loukas of counsel appeared for the Plaintiff and Mr Bourke of counsel appeared for the First Defendant. A submitting appearance had been filed on behalf of the Second Defendant. 

5The Court was assisted by helpful written and oral submissions made by counsel for the Plaintiff and the First Defendant. 

6Counsel agreed in their submissions that the learned Magistrate had erred in his construction of s.19 Evidence Act 1995 and that a proper basis had been demonstrated for a grant of relief in the nature of certiorari in this case. 

7Of course, it remains a matter for the Court to determine whether a proper basis exists for the grant of relief sought by the Plaintiff. 

The Alleged Offences 

8The Court Attendance Notices, and accompanying documentation, reveal the following prosecution case against the Plaintiff. 

9As at 24 November 2010, the Plaintiff was 15 years' old. He lived with his mother and elder brother at premises in a town on the south coast of New South Wales. 

10It is alleged that there had been some tension in the household between the Plaintiff and his mother. As at 24 November 2010, the Plaintiff attended school for two hours daily. On that day, his mother picked him up from school and asked him to perform some household chores. It is alleged that the mother went out for a period and returned home to find that the Plaintiff had been riding his motorbike, and gear was scattered over the front veranda of the house. 

11It is alleged that the Plaintiff's mother became upset and told him to move his motorbike gear. The young person became argumentative towards his mother. It is alleged that the mother then threw the Plaintiff's motorbike gear over the side fence onto a grass nature strip. 

12It is said that the Plaintiff continued to abuse his mother, while kicking the side fence. It is said that the argument continued, with the mother asking the Plaintiff to leave and not return until he had calmed down. 

13The prosecution alleges that, once back inside the premises, the Plaintiff grabbed an iron and threw it against the wall, causing the iron to smash and putting two holes in the wall. It is further alleged that the Plaintiff punched the wall putting a hole in it. 

14The mother then contacted police who attended a short time later and spoke with her. Police entered the premises and observed two holes in the lounge room wall, apparently caused by the iron. A hole in the gyprock wall near the kitchen area was also observed. Police observed the broken iron on the floor. 

15It is alleged that police informed the Plaintiff that he was under arrest and he was cautioned. When told that he was required to come to the police station, it is said that the Plaintiff refused and walked away from police. 

16It is alleged that police attempted to take hold of the Plaintiff's arm, but he flung his arms around in an attempt to avoid arrest. The Plaintiff lifted his t-shirt up over his head and twisted his body, resulting in him falling onto the lounge. Police then took hold of the Plaintiff, lifting him from the lounge. The Plaintiff began to struggle and kick his legs out. 

17The Plaintiff was carried to the police vehicle and placed in the rear section of the vehicle. Police obtained a statement from the Plaintiff's mother, which was signed by her in a police officer's notebook. In addition, photographs were taken of the damage to the premises. 

18The Plaintiff was charged with two offences: 

(a) intentionally or recklessly damaging property, being two walls in the property of his mother, contrary to s.195(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 ; 

(b) resisting Sonja Nielsen, a constable of police, in the execution of her duty, contrary to s.58 Crimes Act 1900 . 

19Court Attendance Notices issued for these offences, which were made returnable at the Nowra Children's Court on 20 January 2011. The Plaintiff was granted conditional bail. An apprehended violence order was applied for and was granted on behalf of the Plaintiff's mother as the protected person. It appears that the terms of the apprehended violence order permitted the Plaintiff to reside with his mother but required him, amongst other things, not to assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with his mother or destroy or deliberately damage or interfere with her property. 

The Local Court Proceedings on 3 February 2011 

20The matter came before Magistrate Blewitt sitting at the Nowra Children's Court on 3 February 2011. The Court was informed that the Plaintiff's mother was a prosecution witness in the matter. His Honour indicated that she should remain outside the Court. 

21The Plaintiff's legal representative informed the Court that there was to be an application by the mother to be excused from giving evidence under s.18 Evidence Act 1995 . Thereafter, submissions were made by the prosecutor and the Plaintiff's legal representative on the topic, apparently in the absence of the mother. 

22Following submissions, his Honour made the following ruling (T4-5, 3 February 2011): 

"" HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings relating to the young person [LS] who is before the Court on a charge contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, namely intentionally or recklessly destroy or d amaging property, domestic violence related. It appears that the mother who is, as I understand it, a witness for the prosecution, it would seem that she's taken legal advice and desires to make an application under s 18 of the Evidence Act that she not be compelled to give evidence against her son on the basis of the matters that are set out in s 18 and I will not go into that at the moment. 

This Court is very familiar with s 18 and has on occasions excused a mother or a parent from giving evidence against their child on the basis that by giving evidence it was likely to harm the relationship between them and in the interests of justice the Court has ruled that the mother should not be compelled. In my experience a novel submission has been made by the prosecution, one that I have not encountered in the past, namely that s 19 of the Evidence Act applies in this case by reason of the fact that the young person is charged with an offence that is referred to in s 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act, that is a section that deals with the compellability of spouses to give evidence in certain proceedings. Section 19 of the Evidence Act provides that s 18 does not apply in proceedings for an offence against or referred to in the following provisions and it then sets out various sections and including s 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act applies to spouses giving evidence against a defendant but it also sets out the offences in respect of which s 279 applies, various offences are set out in subs (1). Subsection (1)(b) defines what a domestic violence offence is in this provision and subs (2) says that the spouse of an accused in proceedings in any court is compellable. Section 18 also speaks of spouses but subs (2) says, 'A person who...required to testify', et cetera. So clearly s 18 has a broader application to the persons who can claim the protection or rely on the provisions of the Act for not being required to give evidence and it is broader than just a spouse. Section 19 does, however, have the title Compellability of Spouses and Others in Certain Criminal Proceedings. So the mere fact that s 279 only refers to spouses I think it is quite clear that the provision of s 19 are meant to cover spouses and those other persons described in s 18(2). So the mere limitation in s 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act to spouses would, in my view, be sufficient to cover the mother of the defendant in this case. 

The prosecution submits s 19 relates to proceedings for an offence against or referred to in s 279. Clearly s 279 does refer to a domestic violence offence. I am satisfied the offence charge [d] , at least the first sequence, is a domestic violence offence and it would seem a clumsy piece of drafting perhaps from one point of view, but on a question of legal interpretation I agree with the prosecution that s 18 does not apply in circumstances where the mother of a child is being prosecuted in respect of a domestic violence offence. SO I UPHOLD THE PROSECUTION'S SUBMISSION THAT S 18 DOES NOT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MOTHER TO RELY ON S 18. I MAKE THAT RULING."" 

23It is appropriate to bear in mind that his Honour's reasons constituted an unedited and unpunctuated record of ex tempore remarks in a busy Magistrate's Court: Acuthan and Ors v Coates and Ors (1986) 6 NSWLR 472 at 479A, 485C-D. Such a judgment should not be picked over, and appropriate allowance should be given to the pressures under which Magistrates are placed by the volume of cases coming before them: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402 at 407-408 [15]. 

24After this ruling was made, on application by the Plaintiff's legal representative, the Children's Court proceedings were adjourned to permit the ruling to be tested in proceedings ultimately brought in this Court. 

25The Children's Court proceedings remain adjourned pending the decision of this Court. 

26Proceedings were commenced in this Court on 3 May 2011. The Plaintiff presses the claim for relief in the nature of certiorari under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 contained in the Further Amended Summons. 

The Magistrate's Decision 

27Mr Bourke, in his written submissions, distilled the Magistrate's reasoning in the following useful way: 

""The Magistrate's reasoning (effectively adopting the argument put by the Prosecutor) appears essentially to have been this:- 

a) Section 18 creates a right in certain persons (including a Mother of a defendant) to object to being required to give evidence as a witness for the prosecution. 

b) Section 19 however, provides that s.18 (the right to object) does not apply in 'proceedings for an offence against or referred to' in the provisions quoted in s.19. 

c) One of the provisions quoted in s.19 is s.279 Criminal Procedure Act. 

d) Section 279 Criminal Procedure Act applies to spouses giving evidence against a defendant, but it also sets out 'the offences to which s.279 applies'. 

e) Section 279(1)(b) defines what a domestic violence offence is, and s.279(2) says that the spouse of an accused is compellable. 

f) Section 18 also speaks of spouses, but subs (2)...(refers to others including a parent). So s.18 has a broader application to the persons who can 'rely on the provisions of the Act for not being required to give evidence and it is broader than just a spouse'. 

g) (Although) s.279 only refers to spouses...it is quite clear that the provisions of s.19 are meant to cover spouses and those other persons (ie including a Mother) described in s 18(2)). 

h) Section 279 refers to a 'domestic violence offence'. The offence charged (under s.195 of the Crimes Act) is a domestic violence offence. 

i) I therefore uphold the Prosecution's submission that s.18 does not provide an opportunity for the Mother to rely on s.18."" 

Relevant Statutory Provisions 

28It is appropriate to set out the terms of ss.18 and 19 Evidence Act 1995 and s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

29As at 3 February 2011, ss.18 and 19 Evidence Act 1995 were in the following terms: 

""18 Compellability of spouses and others in criminal proceedings generally 

(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding. 

(2) A person who, when required to give evidence, is the spouse, de facto partner, parent or child of a defendant may object to being required: 

(a) to give evidence, or 

(b) to give evidence of a communication between the person and the defendant, 

as a witness for the prosecution. 

(3) The objection is to be made before the person gives the evidence or as soon as practicable after the person becomes aware of the right so to object, whichever is the later. 

(4) If it appears to the court that a person may have a right to make an objection under this section, the court is to satisfy itself that the person is aware of the effect of this section as it may apply to the person. 

(5) If there is a jury, the court is to hear and determine any objection under this section in the absence of the jury. 

(6) A person who makes an objection under this section to giving evidence or giving evidence of a communication must not be required to give the evidence if the court finds that: 

(a) there is a likelihood that harm would or might be caused (whether directly or indirectly) to the person, or to the relationship between the person and the defendant, if the person gives the evidence, and 

(b) the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given. 

(7) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court for the purposes of subsection (6), it must take into account the following: 

(a) the nature and gravity of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted, 

(b) the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it, 

(c) whether any other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of the person would relate is reasonably available to the prosecutor, 

(d) the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person, 

(e) whether, in giving the evidence, the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant. 

(8) If an objection under this section has been determined, the prosecutor may not comment on: 

(a) the objection, or 

(b) the decision of the court in relation to the objection, or 

(c) the failure of the person to give evidence. 

19 Compellability of spouses and others in certain criminal proceedings 

Section 18 does not apply in proceedings for an offence against or referred to in the following provisions: 

section 25 (Child abuse), 26 (Neglect of children), 51 (Endangering children in employment) or 52 (Certain employers of children to be authorised) of the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987 

section 279 (Compellability of spouses to give evidence in certain proceedings) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

Note. This section differs from section 19 of the Commonwealth Act."" 

30As at 3 February 2011, s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provided as follows: 

""279 Compellability of spouses to give evidence in certain proceedings 

(1) In this section: 

(a) a reference to the spouse of an accused person includes a reference to the de facto partner of an accused person, and 

Note. 'De facto partner' is defined in section 21C of the Interpretation Act 1987. 

(b) a reference to a domestic violence offence is a reference to a domestic violence offence within the meaning of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, and 

(c) a reference to a domestic violence offence committed on the spouse of an accused person includes a reference to an offence of contravening a prohibition or restriction specified in an apprehended violence order that was made against the accused person and in respect of which the spouse was the protected person, and 

(d) a reference to a child assault offence is a reference to: 

(i) a prescribed sexual offence committed on a child under the age of 18 years, or 

(ii) an offence under, or mentioned in, section 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 33A, 35, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 58, 59 or 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 committed on a child under the age of 18 years, or 

(iii) an offence that, at the time it was committed, was a child assault offence for the purposes of this section or section 407AA of the Crimes Act 1900, or 

(iv) an offence of attempting, or of conspiracy or incitement, to commit an offence referred to in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii), and 

(e) a reference to a child assault offence committed on a child includes a reference to an offence of contravening a prohibition or restriction specified in an apprehended violence order that was made against the accused person and in respect of which that child was the protected person. 

(2) The spouse of an accused person in proceedings in any court: 

(a) for a domestic violence offence (other than an offence arising from a negligent act or omission) committed on the spouse, or 

(b) for a child assault offence (other than an offence arising from a negligent act or omission) committed on: 

(i) a child living in the household of the accused person, or 

(ii) a child who, although not living in the household of the accused person, is a child of the accused person and the spouse, 

is compellable to give evidence in the proceedings, either for the prosecution or for the defence, without the consent of the accused person. 

(3) The spouse of an accused person is not compellable to give evidence for the prosecution as referred to in subsection (2) if the spouse has applied to, and been excused by, the court. 

(4) A court may excuse the spouse of an accused person from giving evidence for the prosecution as referred to in subsection (2) if satisfied: 

(a) that the application to be excused is made by that spouse freely and independently of threat or any other improper influence by any person, and 

(b) that it is relatively unimportant to the case to establish the facts in relation to which it appears that the spouse is to be asked to give evidence, or there is other evidence available to establish those facts, and 

(c) that the offence with which the accused person is charged is of a minor nature. 

(5) When excusing the spouse of an accused person from giving evidence under subsection (4), the court: 

(a) must state the reasons for doing so, and 

(b) must cause those reasons to be recorded in writing in a form prescribed by the regulations. 

(6) An application under this section by the spouse of an accused person to be excused from giving evidence is to be made and determined in the absence of the jury (if any) and the accused person, but in the presence of the accused person's Australian legal practitioner. 

(7) A court may conduct the hearing of an application under this section in any manner it thinks fit, and is not bound to observe rules of law governing the admission of evidence but may obtain information on any matter in any manner it thinks fit. 

(8) The fact that the spouse of an accused person in proceedings for an offence has applied to be excused, or has been excused, from giving evidence in the proceedings is not to be made the subject of any comment by the court or by any party in the proceedings."" 

The Operation of ss.18 and 19 Evidence Act 1995 

31The prosecution wished to call the Plaintiff's mother as a witness in the prosecution case in the Children's Court. The Plaintiff's mother wished to object to this course. 

32Issues of compellability arose for consideration. Section 12 Evidence Act 1995 provides: 

""12 Competence and compellability 

Except as otherwise provided by this Act: 

(a) every person is competent to give evidence, and 

(b) a person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is compellable to give that evidence."" 

33Prima facie, a parent is competent to give evidence for the prosecution in criminal proceedings against his or her child. 

34The Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 defines ""child"" as being ""a child of any age including the meaning given in Clause 10(1) of Part 2 of the Dictionary"" . ""Parent"" includes the meaning given in Clause 10(2) of Part 2 of the Dictionary. Clause 10 of Part 2 of the Dictionary states: 

""10 References to children and parents 

(1) A reference in this Act to a child of a person includes a reference to: 

(a) an adopted child or ex-nuptial child of the person, or 

(b) a child living with the person as if the child were a member of the person's family. 

(2) A reference in this Act to a parent of a person includes a reference to: 

(a) an adoptive parent of the person, or 

(b) if the person is an ex-nuptial child - the person's natural father, or 

(c) the person with whom a child is living as if the child were a member of the person's family."" 

35Section 18 gives a parent a right to object to being required to give evidence as a witness for the prosecution in a criminal proceeding brought against the parent's child. Where objection is taken, the Court is required to rule on it, applying the balancing test contained in s.18(6) and (7) of the Act. 

36Section 19 provides, relevantly, that the right of a parent to object under s.18 does not apply ""in proceedings for an offence against or referred to in"" certain specified provisions. 

37As originally enacted in 1995, s.19 was in the following terms: 

""19 Compellability of spouses and others in certain criminal proceedings 

Section 18 does not apply in proceedings for an offence against or referred to in the following provisions: 

section 25 (Child abuse), 26 (Neglect of children), 51 (Endangering children in employment) or 52 (Certain employers of children to be authorised) of the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987 

section 407AA (Compellability of spouses to give evidence in certain proceedings) of the Crimes Act 1900."" 

38In the second reading speech of the Hon JW Shaw, the Attorney General and Minister for Industrial Relations, concerning the Evidence Bill 1995 , reference was made to Clause 18, but not Clause 19 of the Bill (Hansard, Legislative Council, 24 May 1995, page 114): 

""Clause 18 of the bill makes it clear that members of families of a defendant in a criminal proceeding are competent and compellable witnesses. However, such persons may object to giving evidence as a witness for the prosecution and, in certain circumstances, will not be required to give evidence. In this regard members of a family include spouses, de facto spouses, parents, natural and adoptive children and children living in the household of a de facto as though they are the children of the defendant. The approach which has been adopted in the bill offers the best means of ensuring the achievement of the underlying policy objectives of protection of the family unit and the avoidance of undue hardship of the witness."" 


39The Explanatory Note to the Evidence Bill 1995 referred to both Clauses 18 and 19: 

""Clause 18 provides that a person who is the spouse, de facto spouse, parent or child of a defendant in a criminal proceeding when he or she is required to give evidence may object to being required to give evidence, or to being required to give evidence for the prosecution of a communication between the person and the defendant. 'Child' is defined in the Dictionary to include not only a natural or adoptive child, but also a child living in the household of a defendant as if the child is a child of the defendant. 

A court which considers that a person might have a right to object under the proposed section will be required to satisfy itself that the person is aware of the effect of the section. 

An objection will be upheld if the court finds that: 

Â· there is likelihood that harm would or might be caused to the person or to the relationship between the defendant and the person if the person gives the evidence, and 

Â· the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of the evidence being given. 

Clause 18 further provides that the court must take into account a number of matters including the nature and gravity of the offence charged, and the substance and importance, and the weight likely to be attached to, any evidence that the person might give. 

The clause prohibits comment by a prosecutor on an objection, the decision of the court in relation to the objection or the failure of the person to give evidence. 

Clause 19 provides that clause 18 does not apply in proceedings for certain offences under the Children (Cure and Protection) Act 1987 and domestic violence offences and child assault offences under the Crimes Act 1900. As a result a spouse, de facto spouse, parent or child of a defendant must (unless excused under a provision such as section 407AA of the Crimes Act 1900) give evidence in such proceedings."" 

40It will be observed that s.19, as enacted in 1995, referred to s.407AA Crimes Act 1900 . Section 407AA is the statutory predecessor to s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 . The purpose of s.407AA may be gleaned from the second reading speech of the Premier, Mr Wran, concerning the Crimes (Domestic Violence) Amendment Bill 1982 (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 9 November 1982, pages 2366-2367): 

""Schedule 1 relates to the compellability of spouses to give evidence in domestic violence proceedings. The main aim of this reform, embodied in the proposed new section 407AA of the Crimes Act is to take the onus off the woman in deciding whether or not to give evidence. Honourable members will understand that the evidence of the victim is often critical to the success of a case. 

In all criminal courts, witnesses can, in all cases, generally be compelled to give evidence. The rule about spouses not being compellable against other spouses in criminal cases relates to the intimacy of the marriage relationship. However, it is now recognized that where women are themselves the victims of assault by their husbands, it is harsh and unfair to put upon them the burden of making the decision about whether or not the case should proceed. Moreover, up until now a great discouragement to the police against pursuing cases of domestic violence has been the repeated situation of victims who are key witnesses withdrawing from giving evidence. Victims are often subjected to a great amount of undue pressure and threats to not give evidence. Accordingly, this bill will alter the law so as to provide a presumption of compellability. As well, it will provide in item 3 for a judge or justice to excuse the huband [sic] or wife of the accused person from being compelled to give evidence. The judge or justice must be satisfied that the application is made freely and independently of threat or any other improper influence. The judge or justice must have regard also to the importance to the case of the victim's evidence and the seriousness of the offence. These are fair and reasonable tests of whether the court should give effect to the presumption of compellability, or excuse the witness from giving evidence."" 

41Counsel drew attention to a curious feature of s.19. The first category of provisions contained in s.19 comprises ss.25, 26, 51 and 52 Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987 . These four offence provisions were repealed by the Children and Young Persons Legislation (Repeal and Amendment) Act 1998 . The Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987 was replaced by the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 . 

42Clause 2.1 of Schedule 2 of the Children and Young Persons Legislation (Repeal and Amendment) Act 1998 provided for the following amendment to be made to s.19 Evidence Act 1995 : 
 
""2.14 Evidence Act 1995 No 25 

Section 19 Compellability of spouses and others in certain criminal proceedings 

Omit the matter relating to the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987. 

Insert instead: 


section 222 (Endangering children in employment), 223 (Certain employers of children to be authorised), 227 (Child and young person abuse) or 228 (Neglect of children and young persons) of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998."" 

43It seems clear that it was intended to amend s.19 Evidence Act 1995 to remove the repealed offence provisions from the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987 , and to insert references to offence provisions contained in ss.222, 223, 227 and 228 Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 . However, for reasons that are not clear, Clause 2.14 of Schedule 2 has not commenced. Accordingly, s.19 Evidence Act 1995 , in the first category of provisions which are mentioned, refers to repealed provisions. 

44Although it was not this first category of provisions mentioned in s.19 which played a part in the construction adopted by the Magistrate, it seems clear that s.19 is ripe for further consideration. I will return to this topic later in the judgment. 

45I turn to the second category of provisions contained in s.19, namely the reference to s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 . The argument put by the prosecutor in the Children's Court, and adopted by the Magistrate, was that the charge under s.195 Crimes Act 1900 constituted ""proceedings for an offence referred to ... in section 279"" and, as a result, s.19 operated to remove the mother's right to object under s.18 of the Act. 

46Mr Bourke made the following points in relation to the argument advanced by the prosecutor and accepted by the Magistrate. 

47Firstly, it is to be noted that s.279 is not an offence-creating provision. It refers to certain offences, but it does not create offences. Therefore, the proceedings in the Children's Court cannot be regarded as proceedings for an offence ""against"" s.279. Accordingly, the first limb of s.19 can be put to one side. 

48It is necessary to consider whether the proceedings in the Children's Court were proceedings for an offence ""referred to in"" s.279, this being the basis for his Honour's ruling in the Children's Court. 

49Section 279(1)(b) refers to a ""domestic violence offence"" and defines it by reference to the definition in the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 . Sections 4, 5 and 11 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 are pertinent: 

""4 Meaning of 'personal violence offence ' 

In this Act, personal violence offence means: 

(a) an offence under, or mentioned in, section 19A, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 33A, 35, 35A, 37, 38, 39, 41, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 58, 59, 61, 61B, 61C, 61D, 61E, 61I, 61J, 61JA, 61K, 61L, 61M, 61N, 61O, 65A, 66A, 66B, 66C, 66D, 66EA, 80A, 80D, 86, 87, 93G, 93GA, 195, 196, 198, 199, 200, 562I (as in force before its substitution by the Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence) Act 2006) or 562ZG of the Crimes Act 1900, or 

(b) an offence under section 13 or 14 of this Act, or 

(c) an offence of attempting to commit an offence referred to in paragraph (a) or (b). 

5 Meaning of 'domestic relationship ' 

For the purposes of this Act, a person has a domestic relationship with another person if the person: 

(a) is or has been married to the other person, or 

(b) is or has been a de facto partner of that other person, or 

(c) has or has had an intimate personal relationship with the other person, whether or not the intimate relationship involves or has involved a relationship of a sexual nature, or 

(d) is living or has lived in the same household as the other person, or 

(e) is living or has lived as a long-term resident in the same residential facility as the other person and at the same time as the other person (not being a facility that is a correctional centre within the meaning of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 or a detention centre within the meaning of the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987), or 

(f) has or has had a relationship involving his or her dependence on the ongoing paid or unpaid care of the other person, or 

(g) is or has been a relative of the other person, or 

(h) in the case of an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander, is or has been part of the extended family or kin of the other person according to the Indigenous kinship system of the person's culture. 

Note. 'De facto partner' is defined in section 21C of the Interpretation Act 1987. 

... 

11 Meaning of 'domestic violence offence ' 

In this Act, domestic violence offence means a personal violence offence committed by a person against another person with whom the person who commits the offence has or has had a domestic relationship."" 

50The term ""personal violence offence"" in s.4 includes an offence under s.195 Crimes Act 1900 and the Plaintiff and his mother had a ""domestic relationship"" under s.5 as they lived in the same household (s.5(d)) and they were relatives (s.5(g)). 

51Thus, the Magistrate found that the charge brought against the Plaintiff under s.195 Crimes Act 1900 is a ""domestic violence offence"" . Taking a literal approach, it can be said therefore (as the Magistrate also found) that the proceedings relating to the s.195 offence are ""proceedings for an offence ... referred to in ... section 279"" . It was on this basis that the Magistrate upheld the prosecutor's argument and found that s.19 applied so as to remove the mother's right to object to giving evidence under s.18 Evidence Act 1995 . 

52Having identified this contrary argument (in a manner which assisted the Court), Mr Bourke submitted that the Court should not accept it. He submitted that application of relevant principles of statutory construction should lead to acceptance of the construction advanced by the Plaintiff. 

53The objective of statutory construction is to give to the words of the statute the meaning which the legislature is taken to have intended them to have: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at 384 [78]. 

54Ms Loukas submits, and Mr Bourke accepts, that the reference in s.19 Evidence Act 1995 to s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is a reference to a domestic violence offence committed by a spouse, and not a domestic violence offence generally within the meaning of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 . I accept these submissions. 

55Counsel submit, and I agree, that this construction is supported by the logic and structure of s.19. If the intention of Parliament was to remove the s.18 right to object in relation to all ""domestic violence offences"" , then it could have done so, easily and clearly, by inserting in s.19 a reference to the definition of ""domestic violence offence"" in s.11 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 . The contrast between the direct reference to several offences against provisions of the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987 (in the first category in s.19) and the indirect reference (in the second category) to offences ""referred to"" in s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 , suggests that the reference to s.279 was intended to be substantive and not merely incidental. 

56I accept the submission that the reference to an ""offence ... referred to ... in section 279 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986"" can only be to cover the specific offences dealt with by s.279 involving the compellability of the spouse of an accused person. 

57I accept that the Plaintiff's construction of s.19 is also supported by the relationship between the Evidence Act 1995 and the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provisions concerning compellability of witnesses. As mentioned earlier (at [40]), s.279 was first enacted in 1982 as s.407AA Crimes Act 1900 . It created an exception to the non-compellability of spouses that predated the introduction of the Evidence Act 1995 . Thus, when s.18 was enacted, the reference to s.407AA Crimes Act 1900 in s.19 was intended to preserve the status of s.407AA as a limited exception to the right now embodied in s.18. 

58The history of the relationship between ss.18 and 19 Evidence Act 1995 and s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and its predecessors, supports the submission that s.19 refers only to domestic violence offences committed by a spouse, as opposed to domestic violence offences in general. 

59Ms Loukas submitted, and Mr Bourke accepted, that the construction of s.19 adopted by the Magistrate in this case would lead to anomalies. I accept this submission. For example, a spouse of an accused person could apply to be excused under s.279(4) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 but (presumably) a parent of an accused child could not, because s.279(4) only permits a court to excuse a ""spouse"" . This consequence does not appear to reflect the intention of the legislation. 

60I accept the submission of counsel that s.19, by referring to s.279, operates simply to preserve the operation of s.279, which makes a spouse compellable in proceedings for a domestic violence offence committed against the spouse, and in proceedings for a child assault offence committed on specified children (but subject to being excused under s.279(4)). 

61This conclusion is given further support by the fact that s.279(4) creates a different test to that created by s.18(6) and (7) Evidence Act 1995 . In other words, one of the intended effects of the legislation is that, in cases where s.279 applies, the principles set out in that section should apply, rather than the more general principles set out in s.18. 

62I accept Mr Bourke's submission, that a correct reading of s.19 (insofar as it applies to this case) includes one or (probably) both of the following formulations: 

(a) s.18 does not apply in proceedings ""referred to"" in s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 - namely, proceedings ""referred to"" in s.279(2) against a ""spouse"" for a ""domestic violence offence"" committed on the spouse, or proceedings for a ""child assault offence"" committed on specified children; or 

(b) s.18 does not apply in proceedings for an offence ""referred to"" in s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 - namely, proceedings for an offence referred to in s.279(2) against a ""spouse"" for a ""domestic violence offence"" committed on the spouse, or proceedings for a ""child assault offence"" committed on specified children. 

63I accept Mr Bourke's submission that reading s.19 in this way would appear to preserve the apparent legislative intention behind the provision - namely, that s.18 should not apply in those proceedings to which s.279 applies, and that in the type of proceedings referred to in s.279, the different statutory considerations set out in that discrete provision should apply, rather than those in s.18 Evidence Act 1995. 

Suggested Review of s.19 Evidence Act 1995 

64It will be apparent from this judgment that the Magistrate in this case was confronted with a difficult question of statutory construction which fell to be determined on the day. This Court has had the considerable assistance of written submissions, supplemented by oral submissions, from experienced counsel appearing for the Plaintiff and the First Defendant. Those submissions have undertaken, for the purpose of construction of s.19, a textual analysis of relevant provisions against the background of the legislative history of ss.18 and 19 Evidence Act 1995 and s.279 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and the intention behind the enactment of those provisions. With the considerable advantage of detailed submissions from counsel, I have reached a different conclusion to that reached by the Magistrate. 

65The wording of s.19 Evidence Act 1995 is less than ideal. 

66Firstly, the provision continues to include references to repealed provisions of the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1997 (see [41]-[44] above). This is, to say the least, unsatisfactory. 

67Secondly, the present provision involves a mixture of concepts which have a tendency to deflect the reader from a clear understanding of the provision. It is self evident that s.19 ought state, with clarity and precision, the provisions in relation to which s.18 is not to apply. The operation of the criminal law should be as certain as possible: Taikato v The Queen [1996] HCA 28; 186 CLR 454 at 466. 

68It is useful to refer to versions of s.19 which exist in other Australian jurisdictions where the Uniform Evidence Act has been adopted. Section 19 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) relates to offence provisions in the Australian Capital Territory. That section provides: 

""19 Compellability of spouses and others in certain criminal proceedings 

Section 18 does not apply in proceedings for an offence against or referred to in the following provisions:

71In due course, I will recommend that a copy of this judgment be furnished to the Attorney General for New South Wales with a view to consideration being given to amendment of s.19 of the New South Wales Act so that it provides clearly and simply, and by reference to current legislation, the areas of exception which are to apply to the availability of s.18 of the Act. 

Appropriate Relief 

72I am satisfied that clear error has been demonstrated in this case in the manner contended by counsel for the Plaintiff and accepted by counsel for the First Defendant. 

73The Summons originally filed on 3 May 2011 in the proceedings advanced an appeal under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 . The Further Amended Summons filed 18 August 2011 confines the claim for relief to a claim for prerogative relief under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 . 

74In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v O'Conner [2006] NSWSC 458; 181 A Crim R 294, I observed at 310 [45]: 

""The Court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction to grant relief under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 where a statutory appeal is available: Meagher v Stephenson (1993) 30 NSWLR 736 at 738-9; Hill v King (1993) 31 NSWLR 654 at 656, 658-9. However, such a course is not mandatory. Even where a statutory avenue of appeal was available and may have been preferable, the Court has granted prerogative relief: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Farley (2001) 51 NSWLR 494 at 500-501 (paragraph 24)."" 

75Mr Bourke submitted that the statutory appeal provisions in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 do not appear to apply to the decision of the Magistrate under challenge in this case. Section 53(3)(b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides for an appeal, by leave, on a question of law against an ""interlocutory order"" made against a person in summary proceedings. It has been held that a ruling on evidence is not an ""interlocutory order"" : R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633; R v EK [2009] NSWCCA 4; 75 NSWLR 302 at 304-306. It has also been observed that s.53(3)(b) does not confer jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to grant leave to appeal against an ""interlocutory decision"" , only an ""interlocutory order"" : Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCA 357; 75 NSWLR 392 at 396 [32]. 

76It is difficult to characterise the Magistrate's decision in this case as an ""order"" . Rather, it appears to have been an interlocutory ruling or decision made in advance of the prosecution calling the Plaintiff's mother as a witness, and the mother making a s.18 application. It was in the nature of a determination of the threshold question as to whether the procedure in s.18 Evidence Act 1995 was available, in the face of s.19 of the Act: cf R v EK at 305 [15]. 

77In my view, the Magistrate's decision is not an ""interlocutory order"" so that the appeal provisions in s.53(3) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 do not apply. 

78The appropriate avenue to challenge the Magistrate's ruling is the claim for prerogative relief now advanced by the Plaintiff. 

79Both the Plaintiff and the First Defendant contend, and I accept, that the Magistrate fell into jurisdictional error in this case in that there has been misconstruction of the relevant statute, thereby misconceiving the nature of the function which the Children's Court was performing and the extent of the powers of that Court in the circumstances of the case: Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 at 573-574 [72]; Hoffenberg v District Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 142 at [21]. 

80It has been demonstrated that the learned Magistrate misconceived the nature of the power he was required to exercise in hearing and determining an objection by the Plaintiff's mother to the giving of evidence under s.18 Evidence Act 1995 . 

81Even if the circumstances of this case did not reveal jurisdictional error, I am satisfied that error of law on the face of the record has been established for the purpose of relief in the nature of certiorari under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 : Re Don [2006] NSWSC 1125 at [18]; s.69(3), (4) Supreme Court Act 1970 . 

82The Plaintiff has made good the claim for discretionary relief in the nature of certiorari and it is appropriate that relief be granted. It will be a matter for the Children's Court to determine, in the exercise of discretion under s.18 Evidence Act 1995 , whether the Plaintiff's mother ought be required to give evidence in the prosecution case against the Plaintiff. 

83Counsel informed the Court that it was agreed that each party was to pay their own costs of the proceedings in this Court. 

Orders 

84I make the following orders: 

(a) I direct that the record of the proceedings of the Children's Court at Nowra against the Plaintiff on 3 February 2011 be removed into this Court; 

(b) pursuant to s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970 , I make an order quashing the decision of the Children's Court at Nowra to the effect that, because of the operation of s.19 Evidence Act 1995 , s.18 Evidence Act 1995 did not apply to the application by the Plaintiff's mother to be excused from giving evidence against the Plaintiff in those proceedings; 

(c) I order that the proceedings be remitted to the Children's Court at Nowra to be dealt with according to law and consistent with the judgment of this Court; 

(d) I make no order as to the costs of these proceedings; 

(e) I recommend that a copy of this judgment be provided to the Attorney General for New South Wales for the purpose of consideration being given to amendment of s.19 Evidence Act 1995 .

		05 September 2011",2011-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757747,X v R [2011] NSWCCA 202,"Judgment 

1SIMPSON J : The applicant seeks leave, pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to appeal against an interlocutory order made by Murrell DCJ in the District Court on 30 August 2011 ( R v X [2011] NSWDC 116). The order in question was an order refusing an application to quash an indictment. The applicant contended that the indictment did not disclose an offence known to law. 

Background 

2The applicant is charged under s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, which creates an offence of specially aggravated kidnapping. Provision is made in s 86(1) for the basic offence of kidnapping, in the following terms: 

"" 86(1) Basic offence 

A person who takes or detains a person, without the person's consent: 

(a) with the intention of holding the person to ransom, or 

(b) with the intention of obtaining any other advantage, 

is liable to imprisonment for 14 years."" 

3The circumstances of special aggravation that bring such an offence within subs (3) are the commission of the offence in company, and/or that actual bodily harm is occasioned to the victim. 

4The indictment is in the following terms: 

""On 1 April 2009 at ... in the State of New South Wales [the applicant] did, whilst in company of another person, take [the complainant] with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely, so that it could be determined whether [the complainant] had been near [a particular address] earlier that day, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that actual bodily harm was occasioned to [the complainant] immediately before he was taken."" 

5Murrell DCJ had before her a statement of the facts alleged by the Crown. The statement of facts was not put before this Court. The following facts are drawn from the judgment of Murrell DCJ. They may be stated briefly. The Crown alleges that, on 1 April 2009, the applicant was telephoned by his estranged wife. She told him that she had seen a man ""lurking"" near her home. The applicant went to the home for the purpose of locating the man. The complainant, a 15 year old boy, was walking on a street near the applicant's wife's home. The applicant drew up in a motor vehicle on the same street. An occupant of the vehicle (who, it may be inferred, the Crown alleges was the applicant, or a person acting in concert with the applicant) left the car, punched the complainant, and forced him into the vehicle. The applicant asked the complainant ""did you rob my home?"" to which the complainant replied in the negative. The complainant was driven by the applicant to a nearby park, where he met two other men. The three men conveyed the complainant to the applicant's wife's home, and asked her if the complainant was the person whose presence had earlier concerned her. She said he was not. The complainant was given $100 and released. 

6It can be seen from the manner in which the indictment is framed that the advantage that the Crown alleges the applicant intended to obtain from the taking and/or detention of the complainant was information about his (the complainant's) whereabouts earlier on the day (more specifically, perhaps, information about whether he was the person who had been seen by the applicant's wife ""lurking"" in the vicinity of her home). That, the applicant contends, is an advantage not within the meaning or concept or contemplation of s 86(1)(b). 

7The argument was difficult to follow. Essentially, as it was put in the District Court (as summarised by Murrell DCJ) it was: 

""9. ... in order to fall within s 86, an 'advantage' must be tainted by illegality. It was submitted that s 86 refers to the alternative intention of 'holding (the complainant) to ransom' and 'obtaining any other advantage'."" ( R v X, at [9]) 

Murrell DCJ rejected the argument. 

8In this Court the same argument was put as follows: 

""22. The advantage must ... be construed in the context of taking the person, generally away, for the purpose of obtaining a ransom or other illegal quid pro quo . 

23. It is submitted (on the Crown case), the Crown is unable to establish any intention by the accused to obtain for himself an advantage within the terms of the section. 

24. ... 

25. Furthermore, the advantage, if not a legal one, is one which would need to provide the receiver (the accused) with something of value to him which he would not otherwise be able to obtain legitimately or otherwise be entitled. 

26. For example, in the cases, the advantage received by the accused was one which he would not have been able to obtain lawfully and whereas in the current case, arguably - whether the alleged victim walked with him voluntary [sic] or was escorted to the house in a matter [sic] alleging evidence given by him in the lower court - could have been obtained by another means - bringing of the accused [sic] estranged wife to the park for example."" 

9The argument is untenable. It is only necessary to reflect on the many cases under s 86 that involve detaining a person for sexual favours. That is something that can be obtained legitimately and lawfully; the illegality is in the manner in which the perpetrator sets about obtaining the advantage. In R v Robson; R v Collett, [1978] 1 NSWLR 73 on an application for a verdict of not guilty by direction at the end of the Crown case (of a prosecution under the forerunner of s 86, s 90A of the Crimes Act ), a similar argument appears to have been advanced, and was rejected. 

10A second argument advanced in this Court was that what was identified in the indictment as the advantage the applicant intended to obtain was not capable of being an advantage for the purposes of the section. Reference was made to Dictionary definitions of the word ""advantage"". In my opinion, ""advantage"", is a word in common currency, and does not require resort to a Dictionary. In any event, the Dictionary definitions do not assist the applicant. One of the meanings given in the Macquarie Dictionary is ""any desired end"". The Crown case is that the applicant wished for information from which he could ascertain if the complainant was or was not the person his wife had earlier seen. That is ""a desired end"". 

11Section 86(1) is framed in wide terms precisely to encompass the many forms of advantage that may be sought, and that would not necessarily have been anticipated by the draftspersons of the legislation. Information falls readily into the category of advantage which may be so obtained. I would, like Murrell DCJ, reject this argument. There is no end to the ingenuity of the criminal mind. There is no reason to confine the nature of the advantage that might be intended to be obtained by a kidnapper to one which is, of itself, unlawful. A kidnapper may well seek to obtain a lawful advantage by the unlawful means of kidnapping. 

12In supplementary submissions provided to the Court after the conclusion of the hearing, counsel for the applicant contended (by reference to Parliamentary Debates concerning s 90A of the Crimes Act , the predecessor to s86), that: 

""... the relevant advantage must stem from the taking or detention, because the relevant advantage must be obtained by the taking or detention"". 

13The Parliamentary materials attached to the submissions (apparently part of a debate recorded in Hansard of 30 November 1961) do support that contention. But it does not assist. On what is here alleged by the Crown, the very purpose of the taking and detaining was to obtain the information the applicant sought - ie, if the Crown can prove the facts it alleges, the advantage sought did stem from the taking or detention. The argument proffered appeared to be that, because there were alternative means of obtaining the information sought (by, for example, taking the applicant's wife to the park to identify the complainant) any information obtained would not ""stem from"" the taking or detention. There is no logic to this argument. In the first place, it would have been necessary to detain the complainant until the applicant's wife could be brought to the park. In the second place, however the applicant and his accomplices went about it, the allegation is that they took and detained the complainant for the specific purpose of obtaining information from or about him. 

14I accept that the indictment could have been more lucidly expressed, but the applicant could be in no doubt about the nature of the advantage that he is alleged to have intended to obtain. In any event, lack of clarity is not the complaint; it is as to the nature of the advantage alleged. I am satisfied that the argument is without any merit whatsoever. That conclusion would warrant refusal of leave under s 5F(3). However, since the Court has heard full argument, and in order to dispose of this arid argument, I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal. 

15HISLOP J: I agree with Simpson J. 

16GARLING J: I agree with Simpson J.

		29 July 2014",2011-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757750,Ismael Amado v R [2011] NSWCCA 197,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA: The circumstances in which the applicant is before the Court have been fully set out in the judgment of Garling J and need not be repeated. Subject to the issues addressed below, I adopt his Honour's reasoning. 

Suspension of sentence of imprisonment 
2Courts, rightly, place great weight on the need to understand and apply statutory powers, with careful attention to limitations implicit in the language by which they are conferred. Further, courts, rightly, place great weight on maintaining procedural regularity. Nevertheless, a proper understanding of the power being exercised, or the function being performed, should inform both exercises. An example of the difficulties which can arise from a literal, step-by-step approach to a statutory requirement may be seen in the exercise under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act "") for a court, when sentencing an offender to imprisonment, to first set a non-parole period, being the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention, and then to set the balance of the term of the sentence, which must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless special circumstances permit the balance to be increased. Read in splendid isolation, that provision would seem to require that special circumstances would give rise to a longer sentence than otherwise. That is not current practice. 

3A similar issue arises in respect of suspended sentences. Section 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act relevantly provides: 

"" 12 Suspended sentences 

(1) A court that imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender (being a sentence for a term of not more than 2 years) may make an order: 

(a) suspending execution of the whole of the sentence for such period (not exceeding the term of the sentence) as the court may specify in the order, and 
(b) directing that the offender be released from custody on condition that the offender enters into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding the term of the sentence."" 

4Two features of this provision are immediately apparent: first, what is suspended is not the sentence, but the ""execution"" of the sentence and, consequentially, s 12 cannot operate unless the Court imposes a sentence of imprisonment. Logically, suspension is therefore seen as dependent upon an earlier step in the process, namely the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. That step, however, is subject to the following constraint: 

"" 5 Penalties of imprisonment 

(1) A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate."" 

5There is, of course, a perfectly sound abstract logic to the proposition that a person may be sentenced to imprisonment, without ever having to go to prison. On the other hand, what mental exercise is the Court required to undertake in deciding that imprisonment is the only available option? If, at the first step (described as the ""preliminary question"" by Howie J in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [25] ), the Court decides that imprisonment is appropriate, that, in a practical sense, would involve the conclusion that the offender should spend a period in custody. Step two in this process involves the specification of the relevant period of imprisonment including, it must at that point be assumed, the specification of a non-parole period, being the minimum term for which the offender must be kept in detention. (If a fixed term is deemed appropriate, either because the term of the sentence is less than six months (s 46) or because the court considers it is not appropriate to fix a non-parole period (s 45), the term will nevertheless reflect the minimum period for which the court considers the offender must be kept in custody.) If, after earnestly making the determinations required at steps one and two, the Court, as step three, then suspends the execution of the sentence, so the person is under no immediate liability to serve the specified period in custody, the result appears incongruous. Even such an appearance tends to undermine the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act . The incongruity, however, is not merely an appearance, but a reality. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to suppose that the Court actually reaches its conclusion by proceeding mechanically from step one to step three. 

6The incongruity just identified arises from the assumption that sentences may be divided into two groups, being sentences of imprisonment on the one hand and other possible options on the other, together with the assumption that a suspended sentence falls into the first category. 

7At one point it may have been open to this Court to hold that a suspended sentence of imprisonment did not fall within the first category, having regard to the structure of Part 2 of the Sentencing Procedure Act . Division 2, headed ""Custodial sentences"", included (at the time of sentencing in the court below) penalties of imprisonment, compulsory drug treatment detention, periodic detention and home detention. (In 2010, 'periodic detention' was replaced by ""intensive correction orders"".) Division 3, headed ""Non-custodial alternatives"", included community service orders, various forms of bond and conditional discharge and suspended sentences. These headings form part of the Act: Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 35(1). However, this course was rejected in Zamagias at [25]. 

8None of this is to say that sentencing judges must not be acutely aware of the fact that a suspended sentence of imprisonment, while not imposing a liability to immediate detention, involves a contingent liability to detention. In Regina v Percy [1975] Tas SR 62 at 72-73, Neasey J described a suspended sentence as ""the penultimate weapon in the extensive armoury of graduated penalties"". He also cited with approval the view that a suspended sentence should not be imposed as a ""soft option"" in circumstances where ""but for the power to give a suspended sentence, a probation order was the proper order to make"": O'Keefe v The Queen [1969] 2 QB 29 at 32F. There is the further important consideration that a sentence should not be increased in length because there has been a decision to suspend its operation: Stevens v Giersh (1976) 14 SASR 81 at 82 (Bray CJ); Zamagias at [27] and Percy at 73. 

9Equally, it would be misguided to treat a suspended sentence as not involving a sentence of imprisonment at all. As stated by Bray CJ (Bright and Zelling JJ agreeing) in Elliot v Harris (No 2) (1976) 13 SASR 516 at 527, that view: 

""... reveals an entirely mistaken and wrong-headed approach to the question of suspended sentences. So far from being no punishment at all, a suspended sentence is a sentence to imprisonment with all the consequences such a sentence involves on the defendant's record and his future, and it is one which can be called automatically into effect on the slightest breach of the terms of the bond during its currency."" 

10These remarks were quoted with approval by this Court in Regina v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215; 33 MVR 565 at [36] (Badgery-Parker AJ, Giles JA and Greg James J agreeing), and by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Regina v Gillan (1991) 54 A Crim R 475 at 480, and Regina v P (1992) 39 FCR 276 at 285-286; 64 A Crim R 381 at 391. (In Foster there is a mis-quotation, substituting ""dramatically"" for "" automatically"" in the penultimate line quoted above.) The remarks of Bray CJ may overstate the risks faced by the offender in respect of trivial breaches - Sentencing Procedure Act , s 98(3); nevertheless, the point is well made. None of these considerations, however, require the adoption of an inflexible step-by-step approach to the exercise of sentencing involving a suspended sentence. Indeed, there are considerations which suggest otherwise. 

11First, as noted above, if the Court were to proceed methodically, as if from one hermetically-sealed room to another, the Court would need, at step two, to undertake the exercise described, involving the fixing of a non-parole period or explaining reasons why that course was not to be taken. However, if the sentence were to be suspended, that course would be inappropriate, because Part 4 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, dealing with setting non-parole periods, does not apply until the Court revokes the good behaviour bond: ss 12(3) and 99(1). Secondly, reliance is regularly placed upon the remarks of Kirby J in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 in support of the view that a staged approach is required and that the steps ""should not be elided"": at [79]. References to Dinsdale in this Court tend to be accompanied by the statement that the Western Australian legislation is ""analogous"" - see Foster at [31] - or that the approach is equally applicable here: see R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 at [50] (Wood CJ at CL). 

12While it is true that the Sentencing Act 1995 (WA), s 76, required that the offender be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, before the sentence was suspended, it also contained s 76(2), in the following terms: 

""Suspended imprisonment is not to be imposed unless imprisonment for a term or terms equal to that suspended would, if it were not possible to suspend imprisonment, be appropriate in all the circumstances."" 

13There is no equivalent provision in the Sentencing Procedure Act. Further, s 39(2) of the WA Act provided for six categories of sentence, identifying suspended imprisonment as less serious than imprisonment and requiring that the court not use any option unless satisfied that it is not appropriate to use a lesser option: see Dinsdale , at [11] (Gleeson CJ and Hayne J). It may be inferred that the purpose underlying the legislative scheme in Western Australia is the same as that in this State, but the language is clearly different. Reliance on Dinsdale therefore supports the view that a purposive approach should be taken to the relevant provisions in Part 2 of the Sentencing Procedure Act so that, to the extent possible, sentencing takes place in a structured way, but one which does not create incongruous results likely to undermine the important public purposes set out in s 3A. 

14Taking these principles into account, there are three factors appearing from the reasons of the sentencing judge which must be assessed. First, it is clear that his Honour was minded to accord a degree of leniency to the applicant. Secondly, and consequentially, it should be inferred that he would not, absent a power of suspension, have imposed a sentence of nine months imprisonment. Given the early acknowledgment of guilt in respect of possession, that would involve a first sentence of imprisonment calculated by reference to a starting point of approximately one year, in respect of an offence carrying a maximum penalty of two years. Such a sentence would have been manifestly excessive. Accordingly, it must be inferred that his Honour increased the appropriate sentence of imprisonment, if any period were appropriate, because he was suspending the sentence. That course was impermissible. 

15Thirdly, his Honour was satisfied that some substantial sanction was called for to ensure that the applicant maintained his new-found rejection of illicit drug-taking. That approach, which may have had much to recommend it in practical terms (and may indeed have achieved its intended result in the present case), is only permissible in accordance with current principles if actual imprisonment for the specified period is the only appropriate option. It was not an appropriate option in this case. Unless a suspended penalty is treated as another possible option, it is unclear on what basis (there being no additional or different criteria to be taken into account) suspension is ever available. That is the result of the two (or three) step approach mandated by this Court. 

Relevance of immigration status 
16Although it may not have been the only consideration, it seems clear that one significant motivating factor underlying the application for leave to appeal was the potential consequences of the sentence for the applicant's claim for permanent residence in this country. There were references to it by his counsel in submissions before the sentencing judge: see [22**]-[25] below. It was also a factor referred to in his affidavit of 20 July 2011, referred to at [51**] below. 

17There was no evidence before this Court as to the current practice of the Commonwealth department in dealing with applications for permanent residence, in circumstances where the applicant has one or more criminal convictions. Furthermore, the extent to which such circumstances could be properly taken into account as some form of ""extra-curial punishment"" is by no means straightforward: see Einfeld v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 at [85]-[97]. The law in this regard was not addressed in submissions. 

18In these circumstances, reference to the applicant's immigration status should be treated as irrelevant. 

Re-sentencing 
19The error identified above, namely that the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment significantly in excess of that which should properly have been imposed had the applicant been facing immediate detention, constitutes error requiring that the sentence be set aside. It is therefore necessary to re-sentence the applicant. 

20I would infer that the period of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge, and then suspended, was partly a reflection of the period during which his Honour considered that the applicant should be subject to a bond. A longer period could well have been justified, but could not have been imposed because the term of the bond under s 12(1) could not exceed the term of the sentence. 

21On one view, it would be possible to fix a shorter term of imprisonment. But, unless the applicant is to serve it, which would in effect increase the penalty, it would have to be suspended. However, its suspension would render the bond largely inutile. Further, it is clear that no sentence involving immediate detention was contemplated by the sentencing judge. The appropriate course is, as explained by Garling J, to remove the suspended sentence and impose, independently, a bond. 

22That course too involves difficulties. It is by no means self-evident that the applicant can now be required to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour in respect of a period which has already long since elapsed. Nor would it be appropriate to require him to be of good behaviour for a period in the future (thereby increasing the penalty). 

23The precise order made by the sentencing judge is not before this Court. The language used in the judgment is imprecise. However, it may be assumed that the order involved four parts, in accordance with s 12(1), namely: 

(a) the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment of nine months; 
(b) an order suspending execution of the sentence for a period of nine months; 
(c) an order that the offender be released from custody upon the specified condition, and 
(d) a direction that the condition require the applicant to enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of nine months. 

24The appropriate course is to set aside orders in terms of (a) and (b) in the preceding paragraph. Order (c) may or may not have been made, depending on whether the applicant was briefly detained pending execution of the bond. In any event, it is clear that order (d) was carried into effect, the applicant entering into a bond, and that order should be allowed to stand. 

Conclusions 
25In my view, the Court should make the following orders: 

(1) Extend the time for filing notice of application for leave to appeal to 19 May 2011. 

(2) Grant the applicant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by Lakatos DCJ on 23 October 2009 for the offence of possessing a prohibited drug, namely 14.95 grams of 3,4-MDMA. 

(3) Allow the appeal and set aside the sentence of 9 months imprisonment, together with the order suspending the execution of the sentence. 

(4) Otherwise dismiss the appeal, thereby leaving in force the good behaviour bond entered into by the applicant as a condition of his release from detention. 

26SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J. 

27GARLING J: This is an application for an extension of time and, if granted, for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales by his Honour Judge Lakatos on 23 October 2009. 

28The applicant, Mr Ismael Emilio Avalos Amado, pleaded guilty before Lakatos DCJ to two offences. The first was that in March 2009 he had in his possession a prohibited drug, namely 2.68 grams of cannabis. The second was that at the same time he also had in his possession 14.95 grams of MDMA. 

29Both of these offences were contrary to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

30In respect of the offence involving the possession of cannabis, the applicant was fined $500. No application is made with respect to this sentence and accordingly, it requires no further consideration. 

31In respect of the second offence, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for nine months, wholly suspended under the provisions of s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is in respect of this sentence for which the applicant seeks an extension of time and leave to appeal. 

32The maximum sentence for an offence against s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is a penalty of two years' imprisonment or a fine of 20 penalty units or both. No standard non-parole period applies. 

Facts 

33On 28 March 2009 the applicant who was then nearly 44 years old was detected travelling on a train whilst there was in his possession the drugs. The MDMA offence related to him being found in possession of 49 tablets of ecstasy. 

34The applicant was indicted before a jury on a count of deemed supply of a prohibited drug, namely the MDMA, contrary to the provisions of ss 25(1) and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act . The jury found the applicant not guilty of that offence. 

35As a consequence, the Court was called upon to deal with the two back-up or related charges which had been referred to the Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

36The relevant facts of those two offences were described in short compass by the trial judge and are not challenged on this application. He said: 

""...the accused in the trial gave evidence that ecstasy was his drug of choice. He did not drink. When he went to parties he used ecstasy quite commonly. My recollection of the evidence is that he went to a party in Roslyn Street Kings Cross. He tasted one tablet of ecstasy provided by a person called Sam or Boney. He thought the grade of the ecstasy was higher than normal and therefore made an arrangement to acquire a further quantity. That occurred about a week later at the town hall. Payment was in the order of $1,000. 

The offender got onto the train, was stopped near Thornleigh by a sniffer dog and ultimately disclosed to police that he was carrying ecstasy and gave an explanation of personal use then and there to the police officers. That was obviously a version accepted by the jury and if I might say, was a version which was one of a number of reasonable options which might have been accepted. Where the truth lies does not matter, the jury verdict binds me and I accept it."" 

37The applicant's trial on the count of supply took place between 7 and 9 October 2009. The applicant came to be dealt with for both of the backup charges, only one of which is the subject of this application, on 23 October 2009 when he pleaded guilty before Lakatos DCJ. 

Applicant's submissions on sentence 

38The applicant's submissions on sentence were, as one might reasonably expect, relatively brief. 

39Importantly the evidence included two reports of Dr John Albert Roberts, a specialist psychiatrist. Dr Roberts' reports of 24 June 2009 and 19 October 2009 demonstrated that prior to sentencing, Mr Armado had ceased taking ecstasy and had ceased marijuana except for an occasional relapse. The applicant provided urine specimens to Dr Roberts on three occasions in August 2009 which were tested. Those tests disclosed no evidence of substance use. 

40Dr Roberts concluded in October 2009: 

""This is in accordance with his assertions and consistent with his clinical presentation. 

In summary, Mr Amado's arrest in relation to this matter appears to have been a turning point in his lifestyle and substance abuse. 

He is determined to be successful and there are substantial grounds for optimism in regards to his prognosis."" 

41The submissions on behalf of the applicant accepted that he had one previous conviction for possessing a prohibited drug that was dealt with in 2007 at the Downing Centre Local Court when he was given the benefit of a dismissal under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act with the result that no conviction was recorded. 

42The learned sentencing judge enquired of the Crown Prosecutor whether a sentence which was a non-custodial sentence for the two matters, would fall outside the range of available and appropriate sentences. The Crown replied in the negative. 

43Counsel for the applicant in addressing his Honour shortly after the exchange to which I have just referred, then said this: 

""Perhaps in response to your Honour's question to Mr Crown, I think Mr Crown, and I am not verballing here, it would not be inappropriate if your Honour were to impose a section 12 bond for the possess and a modest fine for the ... cannabis. In my submission that would be the appropriate sentence that I would submit in this matter in any case your Honour."" 

44As the later submissions make clear, the reference to a "" s 12 bond "" in this extract, was intended to be to a bond of good behaviour under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . On the hearing of this application, the parties accepted that the Court should read this as a submission that the imposition of a s 9 bond was an appropriate penalty. 

45His Honour then said this after reading the material that was tendered to him and asking some questions about the facts: 

""Gentlemen, this is the provisional sentence that I propose to impose and I'll hear you if anybody wishes to debate any aspect of it. I propose a 12 months suspended sentence for the ecstasy tablets and a $500 fine for the cannabis."" 

46The Crown Prosecutor indicated that he did not wish to be heard in respect of that suggested "" provisional "" sentence. 

47Counsel for the applicant then said this: 

""Your Honour in relation to why I submit that a bond would be appropriate for the ecstasy and the possession and I realise immediately that a suspended sentence would be a lenient sentence as well, where there's a two year maximum, the submissions are that since this has happened, the arrest, the reports of Dr Roberts, in particular the first one says he desires entering treatment and he does that and he says what he wants to do in relation to work and so forth. ..."" 

48Counsel for the applicant continued to make submissions pointing to the subjective circumstances of his client and placing particular emphasis on the fact that he had taken considerable steps to rehabilitate himself. He then put this: 

""A second factor is that if a sentence of imprisonment, albeit suspended, is imposed upon him, even for a possession charge, that could impact upon his - he's a temporary resident currently, from I think May this year he was granted - and that's one of the exhibits, temporary residency."" 

49His Honour enquired about whether there was evidence which suggested that if a prison term, suspended or otherwise, was imposed it would affect his visa status. He received this response from the applicant's counsel: 

""I can only submit that it is something that he would disclose obviously. He intends to apply for Australian citizenship, that's where he wishes to live. It is definitely something, a term of imprisonment, suspended, which would be a factor to be considered. That's all I could say. I don't have any evidence that it would result in, it'd be inevitable or - certainly I'd submit that we might need a - that's why he obtained the record as well, his Mexican record was actually for immigration purposes, he obtained that, he has nothing in Mexico because that's what he was advised he needed."" 

50There was then further discussion about the question of whether any one or other sentence which the Court might impose would affect his residency status. 

51The applicant's counsel concluded with this submission: 

""I think I can only say that the fact that the court, if it characterises it as such a serious offence that a period of imprisonment, albeit suspended, it's obviously going to be something that immigration will look at in deciding whether temporary residency goes to further residency."" 

52The applicant's counsel then drew the Court's attention to a sentence which had been imposed by Lakatos DCJ in another matter and sought to draw a favourable comparison for his client in respect of the criminality involved in that other matter where a period of imprisonment of 18 months wholly suspended upon entry into a s 12 bond had been imposed. 

53There was then finally a submission about whether 12 months was an appropriate period. 

Subjective features 

54The applicant was 44 years at the time of sentencing and is now 46 years old. It appears that the applicant, who was born in Mexico, commenced using marijuana when he was about 22 years old. By the time he came to live in Australia, he continued to use it but on rare occasions only. 

55He was educated at high school and university. He worked in a number of occupations and for a time he owned his own business involving the distribution of oil in Mexico. 

56He had had a short marriage lasting about 12 months whilst in Mexico. 

57The applicant came to Australia in 2004 and since that time he has been employed and has also undertaken study and was completing a Masters in Information Technology at Central Queensland University. His subjective circumstances including his state of health and psychiatric history were largely unremarkable. He had had some features of depression that required some low level treatment. 

Remarks on sentence 

58His Honour's remarks on sentence were brief. Having recounted the facts and evidence of Dr Roberts and the submissions with respect to the imposition of a penalty, his Honour said this: 

""It is often said in these courts that the taking of illegal drugs is a lifestyle choice. It may well be that people think that to be so, but when lifestyle choices intersect with the breaking of the law, the law has to deal with them. This of course is the second time in a short space of time that the offender comes before these courts. I do not suggest that the history is an extremely serious one but it is a continuous one and I can only say to [the applicant] that at forty-four if he is to relapse into using recreational drugs there is only one alternative left and that will be a prison term. That is not to be recommended to anybody. It is a scary proposition and it is one which does nobody, including the State or yourself any good at all. 

You have a decision to make and the decision really is, do you continue your lifestyle or not? You have made, I think, good and constructive efforts for which you should be congratulated. I am sure this has caused you much stress but if you ever think about relapsing, think of being arrested and think of being taken downstairs. It is not a thought which is worthy of thinking about. You have a good career and obviously an intelligent mind. You should put that to good use. If you need chemical recreation, choose the legal kind."" 

Grounds of appeal 

59There are two grounds of appeal which appear in the application in these terms: 

""1. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the imposition of a term of imprisonment by failing to conclude that full time custody was the only appropriate option in the circumstances of this case. 

2. The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive."" 

60Ground 1 would be better expressed if the word ""not"" were inserted before the words ""only appropriate"". This is the way in which the parties understood it and the basis upon which the application was argued. 

61It will be convenient to deal with both these grounds together. 

62The principal submission is that in his remarks on sentence, the learned sentencing judge provided 

""...no explanation as to why no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate; s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999."" 

63Section 5 of that Act says: 

""(1) A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate."" 

64Where a court sentences an offender to imprisonment for six months or less, then s 5(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires it to both indicate to the offender why it is doing so and to make a record of its reasons for so doing. That subsection was not applicable here. 

65The applicant's submissions contend that the appropriate penalty was a bond under s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , to be of good behaviour. 

Disposition 

66The context within which this Court has to deal with this matter is important. This is an application for an extension of time and, if granted, for leave to appeal. The sentence of imprisonment, suspended by entry into the bond under s 12 imposed by the sentencing judge, expired on 22 July 2010, that is, over 12 months ago. No suggestion is made that the applicant has not complied with the bond. 

67Although a Notice of Intention to Apply for Leave to Appeal was filed promptly after the applicant was sentenced, namely on 17 November 2009, there was an extensive delay, through no fault of the applicant, in obtaining a transcript of the proceedings and obtaining appropriate advice and a grant of legal aid. The Notice of Grounds of Appeal was filed together with an application for an extension of time on 12 May 2011. By that time, the six month period allowed for the Notice of Intention had expired, and by a period of about 12 months. 

68Whilst the necessity for the applicant's legal advisers to have a copy of the transcript of the trial, upon which the applicant was acquitted, before proceeding with the hearing of the application for leave to appeal does not emerge with any clarity from the evidence, the fact remains that the delay in this application for leave to appeal being brought on for hearing is no fault of the applicant, and is attributable to the need to take steps thought to be relevant by his legal advisers. An extension of time should in my view be granted. 

69What is sought by this appeal, if leave be granted is that the sentence imposed by Lakatos DCJ be quashed although it has expired, and instead a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requiring the applicant to be of good behaviour be imposed for the same period of nine months. 

70The remarks on sentence of his Honour, as I have earlier said, were brief. The offence with which his Honour was dealing was, whilst an offence of being in possession of prohibited drugs for personal use, one which involved a quantity of drugs which would ordinarily fall to be dealt with as an offence supplying the drugs. The quantity merited careful consideration as to whether, in light of the fact that the jury had accepted that the applicant was found in possession of the drugs for his personal use, a term of imprisonment was either warranted at all, let alone whether it was the only appropriate option in the circumstances of the case. 

71It is not apparent from the mere nature and circumstances of the offence that a sentence of imprisonment was automatically called for. Nor, when one adds to the nature and circumstances of the offence, the particular subjective of circumstances of the applicant, is it at all obvious why a sentence of imprisonment would be the only appropriate option in the circumstances of the case. 

72In those circumstances, what was required of the learned sentencing judge was that he carefully consider and give reasons for his determination of each of the steps required in imposing a sentence of the kind which he did: R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215 at [30] per Badgery-Parker AJ (Giles JA and Greg James J agreeing); R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 at [50]-[52] per Wood CJ at CL (Stein JA and Studdert J agreeing). In Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321, Kirby J in dealing with West Australian legislation, said this at [79]: 

""The starting point ...is the need to recognise that two distinct steps are involved. The first is the primary determination that a sentence of imprisonment, and not some lesser sentence, is called for. The second is the determination that such term of imprisonment should be suspended for a period set by the court. The two steps should not be elided. Unless the first is taken, the second does not arise. It follows that imposition of a suspended term of imprisonment should not be imposed as a 'soft option' when the court with the responsibility of sentencing is 'not quite certain what to do': [ R v O'Keefe [1969] 2 QB 29 at [32]]."" 

73This Court has held that the remarks of Kirby J in Dinsdale articulate an approach which is consistent with the correct approach in New South Wales: R v Zanagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [27] per Howie J (Hodgson JA and Levine J agreeing). 

74The remarks on sentence do not demonstrate that the learned sentencing judge followed the two-step process described by Kirby J. On the contrary it seems entirely clear that he elided them. 

75Where, notwithstanding an elision of the two steps, the learned sentencing judge has made findings about the relevant circumstances including the seriousness of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the offender and has addressed at least the basal question, that a sentence of imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence as required by s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , then this Court would need to carefully consider those findings to determine whether the sentence is erroneous: see Foster at [35]. 

76However, it is not possible to discern from the remarks on sentence what conclusions the learned sentencing judge reached with respect to seriousness, nor is it possible to discern what subjective circumstances, other than that the applicant had a previous offence, the sentencing judge took into account. It is not possible to identify what discount, if any, the learned sentencing judge allowed for the plea of guilty. 

77In those circumstances, particularly in the absence of any consideration of, and finding that a term of imprisonment was the only available alternative, the reasons bespeak error and it is necessary for the Court to consider what sentence ought be imposed. 

Re-sentence 

78The applicant relied upon an affidavit of 20 July 2011 to provide further evidence to put before the court in the event that it was necessary for the application to be re-sentenced. There was no cross-examination upon that affidavit. 

79The applicant's evidence disclosed that he has remained fully employed since October 2009 with the firm with which he then had an internship. He works in the IT industry. He says this: 

""5. I am a Mexican citizen but have applied for permanent residency in Australia. I am currently a temporary resident and have recently been informed by my Migration Agent that the Department of Immigration is awaiting the outcome of these proceedings before finalising my application for permanent residency. 

6. Since my arrest for this matter in March 2009, I have not been arrested nor charged with any criminal or traffic offences. 

7. Furthermore, since my arrest, I have continued to abstain from consuming illicit drugs of all kinds. I have continued training to keep fit and live a healthy and productive lifestyle."" 

80As is apparent from the discussion earlier in these reasons, the offence of possession where the drugs are for personal use is generally regarded as being towards the low end of the range of criminal offences in New South Wales. We were informed, and accept, that the great majority of cases of possession of drugs for personal use are dealt with in the Local Court. 

81In dealing with this offence, it is necessary to recognise the quantity of drugs in the applicant's possession. Here it was 49 tablets. But it also needs to be recognised that the jury was satisfied, and this is the basis upon which the sentence correctly proceeded, that the applicant had possession of those drugs for his personal use. In imposing a sentence, the court should also do so on a basis consistent with the jury's verdict. 

82The applicant, when first interviewed by the police, admitted that he had the drugs in his possession and asserted that they were for his personal use. On appeal the Crown accepted that this was the version ultimately accepted by the jury and that the applicant had all along asserted this to be the case. No occasion arose for an early plea of guilty because the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty were back-up offences and the Crown indicated an intention, at all relevant times, to proceed with the indictable offence of supplying the drug. 

83On the hearing of the application the Crown accepted that the applicant ought be given the benefit of his early indication that the drugs were in his possession and for his personal use. An appropriate discount is therefore warranted with respect to his plea of guilty and the early indication of his possession with respect to these offences: s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . 

84Importantly, the applicant had significant subjective circumstances which merit careful consideration. 

85I have referred earlier to some of the subjective features of the applicant. 

86The expert reports of Dr John Albert Roberts are entitled to significant weight in considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the applicant. In particular, Dr Roberts' opinion and his recounting of the applicant's history and conduct were of assistance. 

87Initially, when seen by Dr Roberts, the applicant was prescribed a trial of an anti-depressant medication to assist with his coping with anxiety and depressive symptomatology that Dr Roberts associated with illicit substance use. 

88In his second report of October 2009, Dr Roberts said this: 

""On 14 August 09, Mr Amado informed me that the medication prescribed ...did not agree with him and that as a result of taking such medication he experienced a sensation of feeling upset in the stomach and dizziness. 

Mr Amado decided to discontinue medication and attempt to achieve progress by means of self discipline and exercise. 

... 

Mr Amado attended for further review on 1.10.09. He commented on continuing to do well, of him working, and attending the gym, that he had while using drugs lived in a fantasy world, that he was now engaged in the real world. 

As of 1.10.09 he remained on no medication."" 

89Dr Roberts recorded that the three specimens of urine provided and tested all showed no evidence of substance use. 

90He then said this: 

""This is in accordance with his assertions and consistent with his clinical presentation. 

In summary, Mr Amado's arrest in relation to this matter appears to have been a turning point in his lifestyle and substance use. 

He is determined to be successful and there are substantial grounds for optimism in regard to his prognosis. 

Should he continue with the proposed treatment plan and remain abstinent as I believe is his wish, his potential to re-offend must be deemed to be minimal."" 

91The further evidence from the applicant supports Dr Roberts' optimistic view of the applicant's future. 

92In all of those circumstances, I would not be prepared to conclude that a sentence of imprisonment is the only appropriate penalty to be imposed: s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . On the contrary, the appropriate penalty to be imposed is a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for the applicant to be of good behaviour. 

93This adequately reflects the circumstances which are presented for sentence, the conviction taken with this bond provides a condemnation of the criminality involved and a reflection of the subjective circumstances, in particular, the applicant's refraining from further illicit drug use, such as to encourage his further rehabilitation. This is the sentence that in my opinion ought to have been imposed upon the applicant in October 2009. He would then have had a conviction for the offence and he would have been obliged by the bond to be of good behaviour for a period of nine months. 

94A question arises, having regard to the date upon which this Court is imposing the sentence, what is the appropriate order? 

95In my view it is not an exercise in futility to impose the sentence that ought to have been imposed in the first place, notwithstanding the elapse of time. 

96Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 requires this Court, if it is satisfied that a less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed, to "" pass such other sentence in substitution therefor "". 

97In those circumstances the orders which I propose are; 

(1)Grant the applicant an extension of time to 19 May 2011 to file a notice of application for leave to appeal. 

(2)Grant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed for the offence of possessing a prohibited drug, namely, 14.95 grams of 3,4-MDMA. 

(3)Appeal allowed. 

(4)Quash the sentence imposed by Lakatos DCJ on 23 October 2009 and in lieu thereof order that the applicant enter into a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a term of nine months commencing on 23 October 2009.

		05 September 2011",2011-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757752,Snedden v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 262,"Judgment  1McCOLL JA: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL and the orders his Honour proposes.  2MACFARLAN JA: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  3McCLELLAN CJ at CL: On 8 September 2005 the Australian Newspaper published on its front page an article under the headline ""Serbian death squad commander alive and well and teaching golf in Perth."" A copy of that article is annexed to these reasons. The Australian is published in all the Australian States and Territories.  4The appellant, Daniel Snedden, previously known as Dragan Vasilykovic, claimed that he was defamed by the article and he sued for damages in the Supreme Court. He failed at trial and has appealed to this Court.  5The proceedings were brought under the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) with the consequence that a trial with a jury was held pursuant to s 7A(3) of the Act to determine whether defamatory imputations were conveyed by the article. The jury found the following defamatory imputations were conveyed:  1. the plaintiff was a death squad commander;  2. the plaintiff had condoned the rape of women and girls;  3. the plaintiff was a mercenary;  4. the plaintiff had admitted committing a massacre;  5. the plaintiff was before 1991 a criminal;  6. the plaintiff before 1991 had underworld links.  6The plaintiff had pleaded a further four imputations which the jury found were not conveyed by the article. They were:  the plaintiff had authorised the torture of civilians;  the plaintiff had authorised the murder of hundreds of civilians or alternatively the plaintiff had authorised the murder of civilians; and  the plaintiff had authorised the rape of women and girls.  7In jurisdictions other than NSW, the respondent pleaded that the matter complained of was true in substance and in fact. In relation to NSW the respondent pleaded truth only to imputations 4, 5 and 6. It did not initially plead truth to imputation 2 in New South Wales but this was later amended. In this Court, the respondent also formally sought leave to amend its defence to plead truth to imputation 1. In addition, it defended the proceedings in New South Wales and Tasmania by relying on the defences of contextual truth under the relevant statutes. In the other States and Territories the defendant pleaded the common law defence of justification. The extent to which the respondent pleaded truth to all imputations in jurisdictions other than New South Wales does not seem to have been appreciated in the submissions to this Court or at trial.  8With respect to the statutory defence of contextual truth and the common law defence of justification the respondent pleaded a further 10 contextual imputations which it contended were true. An additional contextual imputation was pleaded in relation to jurisdictions apart from New South Wales. The ten imputations were:  7. The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, went to a foreign State and engaged in hostile activity in that foreign State, which is contrary to Australian law;  8. The plaintiff, as commander of Serbian paramilitary units which committed the war crime of torture, bore responsibility for the commission of that crime;  9. The plaintiff, as commander of Serbian paramilitary units which committed torture, bore responsibility for the commission of that crime;  10. The plaintiff condoned the commission of the war crime of torture;  11. The plaintiff condoned the commission of torture;  12. The plaintiff committed the war crime of torture;  13. The plaintiff committed torture;  14. The plaintiff condoned the rape of women;  15. The plaintiff participated in the organised rape of women; and  16. The plaintiff raped a woman.  9The additional imputation was:  17. The plaintiff committed war crimes (not pleaded in NSW).  Findings of the Trial Judge  10At the trial the appellant confined his case in chief to evidence with respect to his reputation and hurt to feelings. He did not himself give evidence in chief but gave evidence in reply. The respondent called a significant body of evidence going to the truth of the pleaded imputations.  11The appellant did not dispute that imputations 7 and 14 were conveyed but submitted that imputations 8 to 13 and 15 to 17 were not conveyed. The trial judge rejected that submission. Her Honour's finding is challenged in ground 2 of the appeal. The pleaded ground is that her Honour's finding was ""unreasonable"" although the submissions put the matter differently. I have dealt with them below.  12The trial judge found that imputations 4, 5 and 6 were substantially true. In relation to imputation 4 her Honour accepted the evidence of journalists Anne McElvoy and Paul McGeough with respect to admissions made by the appellant in 1991. The finding in relation to imputations 5 and 6 were supported by evidence of conviction of the appellant for offences of receiving stolen goods, unlawful possession of goods and operating a brothel for prostitution.  13The trial judge found each of the contextual imputations to be true. In so doing her Honour accepted the evidence in relation to various events given by witnesses. The trial judge rejected the appellant's evidence in which he denied those events. Her Honour said of the appellant's evidence generally:  ""I formed the impression that the plaintiff was prepared to change or colour his evidence in an attempt to defuse the allegations made against him. In short, he was loose with the truth when it suited his purposes.""  14The defence of contextual truth is provided by statute in New South Wales and Tasmania.  15Section 16 of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) provides:  16. Truth: contextual imputations (NSW)  (1) Where an imputation complained of is made by the publication of any report, article, letter, note, picture, oral utterance or other thing and another imputation is made by the same publication, the latter imputation is, for the purposes of this section, contextual to the imputation complained of.  (2) It is a defence to any imputation complained of that:  (a) the imputation relates to a matter of public interest or is published under qualified privilege,  (b) one or more imputations contextual to the imputation complained of:  (i) relate to a matter of public interest or are published under qualified privilege, and  (ii) are matters of substantial truth, and  (c) by reason that those contextual imputations are matters of substantial truth, the imputation complained of does not further injure the reputation of the plaintiff.  16Section 18 of the Defamation Act 1957 (Tas) provides:  18. Justification (Tas)  In an action for defamation in respect of words containing two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence of justification does not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff's reputation, having regard to the truth of the remaining charges.  17Section 16 of the NSW Act was considered in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd & Anor v Jones [2004] NSWCA 205 where Spigelman CJ at [15] emphasised that contextual imputations pleaded by a defendant must differ in substance from the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff. Contextual imputations must be ""of a different character, rather than different levels of generality of the same allegation"".  18The trial judge determined that imputations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 should be considered together, being gradations of seriousness of the same imputation. Contextual imputations 15 and 16 were accepted as stand alone imputations. Contextual imputation 14 was considered to be an alternative to imputations 15 and 16.  19With respect to the NSW and Tasmanian jurisdictions, her Honour determined that each of the contextual imputations was substantially true. She held that having regard to those imputations the description of the appellant as a ""death squad commander"" (imputation 1) did not result in any further injury to the appellant's reputation.  20The trial judge made a similar finding in relation to imputations 2 and 3. Her Honour determined that any damage to the appellant's reputation caused by these imputations was ""completely subsumed by the damage to his reputation occasioned by the evidence underpinning the contextual imputations"".  21Her Honour considered the application of the common law contextual truth defence in jurisdictions other than NSW. However her Honour indicated that contextual truth is not available as a common law defence in Australia ( John Fairfax Publications v Zunter [2006] NSWCA 227). Accordingly, her Honour considered whether the common law defence of justification had been established.  22Unlike the statutory defences where the contextual imputations must differ in substance from the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff, the common law defence operates with respect to imputations that do not differ from the pleaded imputations ( David Syme & Co Ltd v Hore-Lacey [2000] VSCA 24 ( 'Hore-Lacey' ), West Australian Newspapers Ltd v Elliot [2008] WASCA 172 ; Advertiser - News Weekend Publishing Co. Ltd. v Manock [2005] SASC 82).  23Her Honour recognised the potential contradiction in the respondent's argument. To succeed in relation to the contextual truth defence in NSW and Tasmania, the contextual imputations must be substantially different. To succeed in relation to the common law defence of justification the imputations must be substantially similar.  24It was for this reason, it would seem, that the respondent pleaded imputation 17. Her Honour determined that ""imputation 17...on its face, is a general statement which comprehends imputations 1 and 2"" and concluded that no additional prejudice would have resulted if the plaintiff had taken that imputation to the jury himself.  25As it happened the trial judge ultimately concluded that the appellant condoned the rape of women and accordingly found that imputation 2 had been proved substantially true. Her Honour allowed an amendment to plead truth to that imputation. Her Honour also determined that imputation 4 was substantially true and went ""a considerable way towards proof of imputation 1, that the plaintiff was a death squad commander"".  26Accordingly, her Honour found that the respondent had justified imputations 1 and 2 and concluded that, to the extent that imputation 3 had not been justified, the combined effect of the other imputations had ""effectively rendered nugatory any damage that could have been occasioned by imputation 3 had it stood alone"".  Grounds of Appeal  27There are 43 grounds of appeal. They are muddled, repetitive and in many instances entirely without merit. The task required of this Court has been little assisted by their form. In the main they challenge the trial judge's findings of fact as being ""unfair"", ""unreasonable"" or ""against the evidence."" Grounds 13 and 14 were abandoned at the hearing.  28The Notice of Appeal reads as follows:  1. Her Honour's judgment was unreasonable and against the evidence.  2. Her Honour's finding that contextual imputations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,13, 15 and 16 were conveyed by the article complained of was unreasonable.  3. Her Honour's decision in paragraph 154 of her judgment to accede to the respondent's request in its written submissions (after the close of evidence) to amend its defence to plead justification to imputation 2 was unfair and unreasonable.  4. Her Honour's finding that the respondent had proved the substantial truth of imputation 2 (the plaintiff has condoned the rape of women and girls) was erroneous because the respondent had neither particularised nor established in evidence that the appellant had condoned the rape of girls.  5. In making her finding on imputation 4 (the plaintiff had admitted committing a massacre) her Honour acted unreasonably because she held the Battle of Glina did not take place between 26 and 28 July 1991 but in mid July 1991.  6. Her Honour erred in finding that the statement made by the appellant to Ms McElvoy and referred to in paragraph 26 of the judgment was not made conditionally but made by the appellant contemporaneously with the attack upon the police station at Glina even though the statement was made nearly two weeks before the Battle of Glina.  7. Her Honour erred in finding the respondent had established the truth of imputation 5 (the plaintiff was before 1991 a criminal) because the appellant's convictions were insufficient to warrant the description ""criminal.""  8. Her Honour's finding that the respondent had established the truth of imputation 6 (the plaintiff before 1991 had underworld links) was unfair and unreasonable because the respondent led no evidence to support the truth of this imputation and had not particularised facts on which it relied to establish its truth but her Honour instead relied on her own knowledge as to what she said was the criminal situation in Melbourne in 1984.  9. Her Honour's finding that the appellant could not rely on parts of exhibit 2 (the Martic judgment) was unreasonable, inconsistent and unfair.  10. Her Honour's finding in paragraph 82 of her judgment that the appellant had denied procedural fairness to the respondent concerning the appellant's reliance on exhibit 2 to establish he did not mistreat or brutalise prisoners at Knin was unreasonable.  11. Her Honour denied the appellant procedural fairness by not allowing him to rely upon exhibit 2 when she herself, without prior notice to the parties, relied on exhibit 2 for a chronology of political events and the dates of various battles which she quoted in her judgment.  12. Her Honour's finding that the defendant had established the truth of contextual imputation 7 was against the evidence and in so finding her Honour failed to refer to or take into consideration the definition of a foreign state referred to in paragraph 3(2) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act.  13. Abandoned.  14. Abandoned.  15. Her Honour's finding the respondent had established the truth of contextual imputation 7 was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence.  16. Her Honour's finding the respondent had established the truth of contextual imputation 7 because the Krijina autonomous district ""did not conform to requirements of an independent foreign state"" was a finding based on no evidence led at the trial but based on her Honour's use of exhibit 2 thereby denying the appellant procedural fairness and the opportunity to make submissions on that issue.  17. Her Honour wrongly allowed the respondent's witnesses to give evidence as to what occurred to them and what was said to them before they arrived at the prisons and to give evidence as to what occurred and what was said to them in the prisons even though the appellant was not present and there was no evidence he controlled the prisons or authorised what was said or what occurred.  18. There was no evidence to justify her Honour's findings in paragraph 124 there was commission of torture and war crimes of torture by members of the Serbian paramilitary units under the plaintiff's command.  19. In finding that the appellant condoned or permitted torture in the prisons her Honour failed to take into account or even consider evidence the appellant was neither in charge of nor controlled the prisons.  20. Her Honour acted unfairly and unreasonably in not making separate findings in respect of each of the respondent's contextual imputations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 but instead making a collective ruling in respect of all six contextual imputations.  21. Her Honour erred in finding that the respondent had established the truth of each of imputations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.  22. Her Honour's finding that the respondent had established the truth of imputations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 was erroneous because there was insufficient evidence to support her findings.  23. Her Honour erred in finding the respondent had established the truth of contextual imputations 10 and 11 (the plaintiff condoned the commission of the war crime of torture and the plaintiff condoned the commission of torture) because there was no evidence to support these findings.  24. There was no evidence to justify her Honour's findings that the respondent had established the truth of contextual imputations 12 and 13 (the plaintiff committed the war crime of torture and the plaintiff committed torture).  25. Her Honour's adverse findings about the credit of the appellant in paragraphs 127-128 were unreasonable because it was never an issue that the appellant commanded military forces in the Battle of Glina.  26. Her Honour acted unfairly and unreasonably in not making separate findings in respect of each of the respondent's contextual imputations 14, 15 and 16 but instead making a collective ruling in respect of all three contextual imputations.  27. There was no evidence to support her Honour's finding that the respondent had established the truth of contextual imputations 14 and 15 (the plaintiff condoned the rape of women and the plaintiff participated in the organised rape of women) because no evidence was led by the respondent that women as distinct from a particular woman were raped.  28. Her Honour's finding that the respondent had established the truth of contextual imputation 16 (the plaintiff raped a woman) failed to take into account or even refer to evidence which contradicted the respondent's case on identification.  29. Her Honour acted unfairly and unreasonably when she refused the appellant leave to call alibi evidence in reply to the effect that the appellant was in Belgrade at or about the time Source A claimed she was allegedly being raped at Zvornik by the appellant.  30. Her Honour's finding in paragraph 144 that mistreatment and war crimes were carried out ""at the behest of, or with the authority of the Plaintiff"" were against the evidence and the weight of the evidence and were contrary to the finding of the Section 7A jury that imputations pleaded by the appellant to the effect the plaintiff authorised the torture, murder and rape of civilians were not conveyed by the article complained of.  31. Her Honour erred and was unfair to the appellant by allowing him to be identified in Court.  32. Her Honour's finding that the appellant had been identified by Source A was unreasonable because she did not refer to or take into account in her judgment evidence negating such identification.  33. Her Honour erred in finding that the respondent's witnesses identified the appellant.  34. Her Honour denied the appellant procedural fairness.  35. Her Honour erred in not referring to the onus of proof in support of her findings the appellant had committed serious criminal and war crimes.  36. Her Honour erred by failing to apply or by indicating she had taken into account the Briginshaw standard (Section 140(2) of the Evidence Act) when finding the respondent had established the truth of the plaintiff's imputations and the contextual imputations.  37. Her Honour erred by failing to take into account or refer to in her judgment the absence of any documentary or supporting evidence to corroborate the serious allegations made against the appellant by the respondent's witnesses.  38. Her Honour erred in finding that the respondent's defence of contextual truth had succeeded in New South Wales and Tasmania.  39. Her Honour erred in finding as she did in paragraph 155 that the respondent had succeeded in justifying imputations 1 and 2 because the respondent did not plead truth to these imputations and led no evidence or provided no particulars in support of their truth.  40. Her Honour's findings in paragraph 151 are erroneous and together with her findings in paragraph 155 amount to a finding of contextual justification in the States and Territories other than New South Wales even though there is no defence of contextual truth in those States and Territories.  41. Her Honour erred in her findings concerning contextual imputation 17.  42. Her Honour's findings in paragraph 155 that the respondent had succeeded in justifying imputations 1 and 2 and there was available to the respondent some type of contextual defence for the interstate publications were erroneous and not in accordance with law.  43. Her Honour did not as she should have done, find the appellant had succeeded on at least imputations 1, 2 and 3 in the other States and Territories of the Commonwealth and her Honour did not as she should have done award the appellant appropriate damages.  44. Her Honour erred and acted unfairly in finding imputations 1 and 2 had been justified in the other States and Territories and that imputation 3 was subject to a successful defence of contextual truth by reason of the justification of imputations 1 and 2.  29In this Court the appellant seeks verdicts in his favour in all States and Territories and an award of damages or in the alternative a new trial on the issue of damages.  30The form of the notice of appeal creates difficulties for an orderly discussion of the issues raised. The respondent helpfully undertook a grouping of various of the individual grounds to allow an orderly disposition of the appeal. I will follow the respondent's approach.  31As I have indicated, in various grounds of appeal the appellant contends that the findings of the trial judge were either ""unreasonable"", ""unfair"" ""against the evidence"" or ""against the weight of the evidence."" These assertions are found in grounds 1, 2, 8, 15, 22, 25, 30 and 32. They are also within grounds 18, 19, 23, 24, 27 and 37 where the substance of the complaint is that a finding was ""against the evidence."" The submission in support of these grounds is effectively that the decision below should have been made differently. No error amenable to correction by this Court is identified.  32In Mr Whippy Pty Ltd v Ocean Walk Pty Ltd (2008) NSWCA 8 this Court considered a ground of appeal which was pleaded as being ""against the weight of the evidence."" Giles JA emphasised that ""it is not an error of law to find against the weight of the evidence."" Giles JA said at [42]:  ""The sub-grounds may conveniently be considered together.  Ground 2(b) was not well expressed.  It is not an error of law to find against the weight of the evidence (see for example Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 155-7 per Glass JA, Samuels JA agreeing).  A ground of appeal that a finding was against the weight of the evidence has its origin in appeals against a jury's verdict, and in Bell v Thompson (1934) 34 SR 431 at 437 Jordan CJ said that it required that the evidence ""so strongly preponderate in [the appellant's] favour as to lead to the conclusion that the jury, in finding for the other party, have wilfully disregarded the evidence of [sic] failed to appreciate it""; see the discussion by Spigelman CJ in Waverley Municipal Council v Swain [2003] NSWCA 61; (2003) Aust Torts Rep 81-694 at [12]-[15].  The present appeal is from the decision of a judge sitting without a jury by way of rehearing pursuant to s 75A of the Supreme Court Act 1970, not an appeal after a jury verdict pursuant to s 102, and challenge to the decision of a judge sitting without a jury is not appropriately made by a ground in those terms.  The challenge to a finding or findings of fact should be more focussed than was ground 2(b).""  33The role of an appellate court when reviewing findings of fact was authoritatively determined by the High Court in Warren v Coombes (1978-1979) 142 CLR 531 and further discussed in Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118. A judge sitting without a jury is to determine the primary facts and any relevant inferences arising from them. An appellate court, which has not seen or heard the witnesses, has a more confined role. Although, when the issue is raised, its duty is to determine the facts for itself it must pay due regard to the opportunity afforded to the trial judge to observe the witnesses and may intervene to correct error where it is satisfied that a finding of primary fact made by the trial judge was not open or where it is persuaded that an inference drawn by the primary judge is wrong.  34It follows that ground 1 of the appeal must fail. Many of the other grounds must fail for the same reason. However, although perhaps unnecessary I have provided a short response to each ground but organised in the order adopted by the respondent.  Ground 2: Her Honour erred in finding that contextual imputations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 were capable of being conveyed.  35This ground challenges the trial judge's ruling that contextual imputations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 were capable of being conveyed. As it happens her Honour found that all of the respondent's contextual imputations were capable of being conveyed.  36The appellant submitted that her Honour erred by not applying the correct test when considering the behaviour of a reader of a newspaper.  37The trial judge referred to the judgment of Hunt J in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 165. Her Honour accepted that the decision was authority for the proposition that the ""reader of a newspaper article generally exercises less care than the reader of a book."" The appellant submitted that her Honour misunderstood what Hunt J had said, his actual words being that the reader of a book ""is assumed to read it with more care than he or she would read a newspaper"" Marsden 165E-F. The appellant emphasised that even when reading a newspaper the ordinary reasonable reader has to exercise care.  38I am not persuaded by the appellant's submission. It is relevant when considering whether an imputation is capable of being conveyed, to consider whether it has been published in a newspaper or in a book or in some other form. It is the common experience, although it is not always the case, that when reading a newspaper a person may read more quickly and superficially than when reading a book. However, her Honour did not suggest that the reader of a newspaper article does not exercise care when reading, but correctly observed that they will generally exercise less care than when reading a book.  39The appellant submitted that the ordinary reasonable reader would not have concluded that the article conveyed the imputation that the appellant raped a woman as pleaded in imputation 16. Consideration of paragraphs 2 and 4 of the article is sufficient to dispose of this ground of appeal. In those paragraphs the appellant was described as being in command of ""ruthless Serbian paramilitary units implicated in the war time rape, torture and slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia. ..."" and ""several paramilitary units alleged to have murdered hundreds of civilians and participated in the organised rape of women and girls."" Read with paragraphs 13 to 26 and mindful of the photograph of the appellant holding a skull the relevant imputations are clearly capable of being conveyed.  40The appellant further submitted that contextual imputations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 were not in fact conveyed. Although at one point the written submissions raised the same issue in relation to imputations 15 and 16 this was not pressed. Although it was not expressed with great clarity the appellant's submission, as I understand it, was that the imputation in each ""pair"" of these imputations are in substance the same. It was submitted that the ""only"" difference in each ""pair"" was the inclusion of the words ""war crime"" in imputations 8, 10 and 12 which was not in imputations 9, 11 and 13.  41No objection was taken at the interlocutory stage of the proceedings nor was any argument advanced to this effect in final submissions. No doubt it was recognised, at least at trial, that the submission was devoid of merit.  42Although ""crimes of torture"" may also be ""war crimes of torture"" the two expressions are not synonymous. A war crime of torture will be an occasion when torture is carried out in circumstances related to war. The physical act may be the same as one carried out in circumstances not related to war but the context in which it occurs will be a war.  Grounds 34, 39, 42, 43 and 44  Imputation 1: The plaintiff was a death squad commander  43These grounds of appeal and imputation 17 are considered later in these reasons. For present purposes, the appellant submitted that imputation 1 ought not to have been found to be justified. It was submitted that the plaintiff was denied procedural fairness because ""the respondent did not plead truth to these imputations and led no evidence or provided no particulars in support of their truth."" The submission should be rejected.  44Her Honour dealt with the relevant submission of the defendant in the section of her reasons for judgment entitled ""the Defence of Justification at Common Law."" Her Honour correctly identified the elements of the common law defence. She referred to the decision in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Hitchcock [2007] NSWCA 364 and quoted, as the summary of the principle, the following extract from the headnote to the report:  ""A defendant seeking to justify in the common law jurisdiction may only plead an imputation by way of defence to the plaintiff's imputation, if that imputation does not differ in substance from the pleaded imputation, and is one which the plaintiff would be permitted to put to the jury on the state of the imputations the plaintiff pleaded. David Syme & Co Ltd v Hore-Lacey [2000] VSCA 24; (2000) 1 VR 667, Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Moodie [2003] WASCA 273; (2003) 28 WAR 314; Advertiser-News Weekend Publishing Co Ltd v Manock [2005] SASC 82; (2005) 91 SASR 206 applied.""  45Her Honour then at [150] correctly identified the relevant test. Her Honour said:  ""The question whether a defendant's imputation differs in substance from the pleaded imputation may be answered by asking whether different evidence would have been adduced or whether the case would have been conducted on a different basis. The requirement that the imputation is one that the plaintiff would be permitted to put to the jury invariably dictates that the imputation is no more injurious than, or comprehended by, the plaintiff's imputation.""  46Her Honour continued [151]-[154]:  ""The defendant relies upon imputation 17 as one that does not differ in substance from the plaintiff's imputations 1, 2 and 4.  It is submitted that it was available to the plaintiff to seek a verdict on imputation 17 without relevant unfairness to the defendant.  If that is the case, then it is available to the defendant to plead that imputation by way of justification to the plaintiff's imputations 1 and 2 (not the subject of a truth defence).  Further, the plaintiff submits that imputation 3 is not substantially different from imputation 7 and that imputation 2 is not substantially different from the defendant's imputations 14, 15 and 16.  It is convenient to deal with this latter submission briefly. The difficulty with the defendant's proposition with respect to imputations 7, 14, 15 and 16 is that the law in NSW requires contextual imputations to be substantially different from the plaintiff's imputations under s 16 of the Defamation Act : Jackson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1981] 1 NSWLR 36 (at [39-40]). How then can the defendant maintain that those same imputations are not substantially different from any one of the plaintiff's imputations for the purposes of the common law defence of justification?  Imputation 17 falls into a somewhat different category.  It was not pleaded in NSW and, on its face, it is a general statement which comprehends imputations 1 and 2.  In other words, the plaintiff would have been entitled to go to a jury with the imputation that ""the plaintiff committed war crimes"" and no prejudice could have resulted to the defendant.  There is evidence, which has been accepted, that the plaintiff condoned the rape of women, albeit that Source A did not refer to ""girls"".  Whilst the defendant did not plead justification in defence of imputation 2, it has nonetheless been proved substantially true and there can be no prejudice to the plaintiff in allowing the defendant to amend, as it has sought to do.  The substantial truth of imputation 4, that the plaintiff admitted committing a massacre, goes a considerable way towards proof of imputation 1, that the plaintiff was a death squad commander.  The defendant has therefore succeeded in justifying imputations 1 and 2. To the extent that imputation 3 has not been justified, the combined effect of the remaining imputations has effectively rendered nugatory any damage that could have been occasioned by imputation 3 had it stood alone.""  47The appellant's submission was brief and suggested that her Honour erred by reason of the ""misapplication of the so called nuance justification defence."" The submission was not further explained. The holding by her Honour that imputation 1 was justified meant if it could be sustained, that the relevant defences (which were pleaded) were made good.  48The present issue is whether, in states other than NSW, imputation 17, which is concerned with ""war crimes"", differs in substance from imputation 1, that the appellant was a ""death squad commander"" for the purpose of the common law defence of justification. I am not persuaded that it does. Imputation 17 is concerned with crimes committed in time of war. The imputation that the appellant was a ""death squad commander"" conveyed, in the context of the article, that the appellant commanded a ""squad"" of persons intent primarily upon the death of others irrespective of whether their actions were justified in the particular circumstances. The article was of course concerned, inter alia, with the actions of the appellant at Glina, it being alleged that he had been responsible for the massacre of Croatians in the town. It should be remembered that imputation 4 concerned the appellant's alleged admission that he committed a massacre. The trial judge found that this imputation was true ie that the appellant made this admission. Although that finding was challenged in this appeal, to my mind it must fail.  49Although the situation at trial was obscure, on appeal the respondent formally applied for leave to amend its defence to plead truth to imputation 1. The respondent opposed this application and submitted that because the opportunity would not be available for the appellant to respond to the imputation the application should be refused. The evidence to support the respondent's assertion that imputation 1 was substantially true was the appellant's admission to committing a massacre, as discussed briefly above. In these circumstances I can discern no relevant prejudice to the appellant and would grant the respondent the necessary leave. It follows, in my opinion, that the defence to imputation 1 was made good.  50There is a further possible difficulty with respect to the contextual imputations. The appellant submitted that the respondent should be bound by its particulars of truth and that he would be denied procedural fairness if the Court did not ensure that this occurred. In support of this submission the appellant emphasised that the particulars of truth with respect to Imputation 17 relate to the war crimes of torture and the rape of women rather than being a death squad commander. The appellant made reference to John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake [2001] NSWCA 434 which was concerned with the NSW statutory contextual truth defence and emphasised the importance of precise particulars of truth.   51I have already concluded that the respondent should be granted leave to plead the truth of imputation 1 and that that defence was made good. With respect to the common law defence of justification and imputation 17, if bound by its particulars it could not operate with respect to imputation 1. However, having regard to my conclusion that imputation 1 is substantially true it is unnecessary to consider that issue further.   Grounds of appeal 3, 4 and 34  Imputation 2: The plaintiff had condoned the rape of women and girls  52After the close of the evidence the respondent sought leave to amend its defence to plead the defence of substantial truth to imputation 2. That imputation stated ""the plaintiff has condoned the rape of women and girls."" Leave to amend was granted by the trial judge, her Honour finding that there was no prejudice to the appellant if the amendment was allowed. Imputation 14 stated ""the plaintiff condoned the rape of women."" Her Honour found that imputation to be substantially true.  53The appellant submitted that her Honour erred in both allowing the amendment and finding that the respondent had justified imputation 2. Central to the appellant's argument was a submission that the respondent was obliged to prove true all material parts of the contextual imputation. Reference was made to Howden v Truth & Sportsmen Ltd (1937) 58 CLR 416 per Dixon J at 420-421 and Cross v Queensland Newspaper Pty Ltd (2008) NSWCA 80. It was submitted that the evidence was confined to evidence of the rape of one woman, being a witness who gave evidence under the pseudonym Source A, and contained no reference to the rape of girls.  54The trial judge found that the appellant both committed rape (imputation 16) and participated in pack rape (imputation 15). These findings were sufficient to prove the substantial truth of the imputation ""that the plaintiff condoned the rape of women."" Her Honour recognised that Source A did not refer to ""girls"" but concluded that this was not necessary to prove the substantial truth of imputation 2.  55The appellant emphasised that in Howden Dixon J at [421] said of the defence of substantial truth that ""every material part of the imputations upon the plaintiff contained in the words complained of must be true"". Although in some circumstances a distinction between women and girls may have significance, particularly if there is relevance in the age of the relevant person or persons, I do not believe that it has significance in the present context. Perhaps the situation would be different if the imputation had referred to ""young girls"" although I express no conclusion to that effect. The word ""girls"" is commonly used to describe women of various ages. In some contexts it can be legitimately used to describe women who might otherwise be thought to be of mature years. Nothing of significance turns on the use of both words in the present context. The finding which her Honour made was to my mind both available and correct.  Grounds 1, 40, 42, 43, 44  Imputation 3: The plaintiff was a mercenary  56The appellant submitted that imputation 3 was undefended. It was not. Contextual truth in relation to imputation 3 pursuant to the statute was pleaded with respect to New South Wales and Tasmania and truth and common law contextual truth were pleaded in all jurisdictions other than NSW.  57Her Honour's findings with respect to the statutory defence of contextual truth in NSW were not challenged in this appeal. With respect to imputation 3 in jurisdictions outside NSW her Honour found to the extent that imputation 3 had not been justified, the combined effect of the other imputations had ""effectively rendered nugatory any damage that could have been occasioned by imputation 3 had it stood alone"".  58The appellant challenged this approach submitting that in so finding her Honour upheld what purports to be a defence of contextual truth rather than a common law justification defence. I reject this submission. An assessment of injury to the appellant's reputation is undoubtedly relevant to establishing whether the common law justification defence operates in jurisdictions outside NSW: Hore-Lacey at 63.  59In any event, her Honour found that imputation 7, which states that the plaintiff ""went to a foreign state and engaged in hostile activity in that state"" was substantially true. The appellant argued at the trial and did not suggest otherwise in the appeal that imputation 7 was not substantially different from imputation 3. It follows that the common law defence of justification is made good in jurisdictions outside of NSW.  Grounds of appeal 1, 5, 6, 11 and 34  Imputation 4: The plaintiff had admitted committing a massacre  60The respondent's submission with respect to the substantial truth of this imputation was sourced from interviews of the appellant by a journalist which was published in ""The Times"" newspaper in London on 15 July 1991. The journalist Ms McElvoy gave evidence that she interviewed the appellant on 14 July 1991 when he said to her:  ""Nobody needs to be armed since I got here. I'm not here to kill people, just to neutralise the enemy. When the Croat side uses hospitals or police stations in their villages as fortified positions, I'm sorry, I just have to massacre them.""  61The appellant denied making this statement saying that he had not been engaged in active combat by 14 July. In his evidence the appellant said that his first active combat was at the Battle of Glina which he asserted occurred between 26 and 28 July 1991. This would put it at a time after the alleged interview with Ms McElvoy. Accordingly it was submitted that if the conversation with Ms McElvoy occurred the appellant was referring only to a possible future event not one which had already happened.  62Her Honour formed an adverse view of the appellant's truthfulness generally and rejected his denial. Her Honour found that he had made the statement.  63To my mind that finding is sufficient to reject these grounds of appeal. Whether the appellant had in mind the prospect of carrying out a massacre at some future date, his statement was clearly capable of being understood as confirming his previous actions. He speaks of the use of hospitals or police stations in a manner which clearly includes their past use and says that in response he has an obligation to commit a massacre. His remark is not dependent on a conditional use of the relevant facility and he did not speak of a future massacre. Although the appellant submitted otherwise it would not matter that the respondent did not prove that a particular massacre had occurred when the statement was made. The imputation was concerned only with the appellant's admission. It was immaterial whether the admission was true in fact.  64Her Honour made this point in [34] of her reasons when she said:  ""It is important, in my view, in determining the meaning of the plaintiff's statement to Ms McElvoy, to place it in its proper context. Ms McElvoy was specifically seeking the plaintiff's views on a practice which was occurring in the Krajina region, where the conflict between the Serbs and the Croats was most pronounced. The plaintiff's mission was, according to him, not to kill people, but to 'neutralise the enemy.' Immediately after this assertion, the plaintiff explains under what conditions he departs from that general rule. Given the focus of the conversation on the existence of the practice of targeting police stations and hospitals, it is more likely than not the plaintiff was referring to occasions that had already met the preconditions.""  65To my mind debate about the date of the Battle of Glina introduces a false issue in the proceedings. The problems it raises are apparent in the appellant's submission that the trial judge's finding was that the imputation ""that the appellant had committed a massacre"" was substantially true. Rather than being concerned with whether the appellant had actually committed a massacre, as the appellant suggested, the imputation was confined to an admission allegedly made to Ms McElvoy and is cast in the following terms:  ""The plaintiff had admitted committing a massacre."" (emphasis added)  66In the court below there was a discussion about a judgment of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 known as the Martic judgment. When considering the present issue her Honour said that because the date of the Battle of Glina was not in issue before the International Tribunal she could rely on it in the present proceedings. Accordingly her Honour determined that the Battle of Glina took place in mid-July 1991. I do not believe that reliance on the Martic judgment for this purpose was correct. The judgment was not and could not be tendered to prove the truth of its content. On occasions during the trial the appellant sought to rely on its content but that could not justify its use to prove that events recorded in it actually occurred.  67Although her Honour was not entitled to rely on the judgment it is of no moment to this appeal. As I have already indicated the actual date of the Battle of Glina was not relevant to understanding whether the appellant had made the alleged admission.  Ground of appeal 7  Imputation 5: The plaintiff was before 1991 a criminal  68The appellant accepts that he had criminal convictions in 1984 for receiving stolen goods and unlawful possession of goods. He was fined modest monetary sums. In April 1984 he was convicted of operating a brothel for prostitution and was fined $5,000. Each of these offences was prosecuted in a Magistrate's court.  69The trial judge found that, taking the every day meaning of the word ""criminal"" as a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence, then it was substantially true to say that before 1991 the appellant was a criminal. However, the appellant takes issue with her Honour's finding submitting that the word ""criminal"" may not always be a reference to a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence. It was submitted that it was necessary to consider the word in the context of the article complained of ( The Greek Herald v Nikolopoulos (2002) 54 NSWLR 165).  70The relevant imputation was conveyed by paragraph 3 of the article which states that the appellant ""was a Melbourne criminal with underworld links before he travelled to his homeland in 1991."" The appellant emphasised that the balance of the article refers to crimes such as murder, atrocity, wartime rape, torture and slaughter of Muslims and the murdering of hundreds of civilians. It was submitted that taken in context the meaning of the imputation that ""the appellant was before 1991 a criminal"" must refer to serious or violent criminal conduct rather than the less serious crimes of which the appellant had been convicted.  71I am not persuaded by the appellant's submission. The Macquarie Dictionary defines a crime as ""an act committed or an omission of duty, injurious to public welfare, for which punishment is prescribed by law, imposed in a judicial proceeding usually brought in the name of the state; serious violation of human law; any offence especially one of grave character; serious wrongdoing."" A criminal is relevantly defined as a ""person convicted of a crime.""  72It may be accepted that the crimes of which the appellant was convicted were of a significantly lesser order of seriousness than the acts which he was alleged to have committed in the former Yugoslavia. However, he could not avoid the fact that he had previously committed criminal offences. He admitted that he had convictions for those offences.  73The appellant emphasised the fact that prostitution has been decriminalised in Victoria since the appellant was convicted of operating a brothel. This may be so, but at the time he operated the brothel he did so in breach of the law.  74I am not persuaded that the meaning of the imputation ""that the appellant was before 1991 a criminal"" must be informed by the nature of the allegations in the published article relating to his subsequent conduct. The convictions were for criminal offences making it appropriate to describe him as a criminal before 1991. True it is that his subsequent activities were on a far more serious scale but this does not have the consequence that the description of his earlier activities was inappropriate.  Grounds 1, 8 and 34  Imputation 6: the plaintiff before 1991 had underworld links  75The appellant complained that there was no evidence that he had underworld links and that her Honour's finding was ""unfair"" and ""unreasonable"".  76The finding which her Honour made was that ""in Melbourne in 1984 the operation of a brothel was very much a part of the criminal milieu."" She said that ""vice and prostitution were a notorious link to organised crime."" She went on to find that the clandestine operation of a brothel ""necessarily involved the recruitment of those who were prepared to risk criminal convictions"" and that the appellant ""was linked to such people.""  77As I have previously indicated the appellant accepted that he had convictions for receiving stolen goods, unlawful possession and for the operation of a brothel. The commission of each of these offences would have involved the appellant dealing with persons who were also actively engaged in breaking the law. Such persons are commonly referred to as being part of the ""underworld"", being a ""world"" comprised of persons who both ignore and are prepared to break the law in pursuit of their own interests.  78At the trial, counsel for the respondent submitted that the appellant's conviction for operating a brothel demonstrated his connection with the underworld justifying the imputation that he had underworld ""links."" The finding which her Honour made was accordingly not made without the appellant having an opportunity to deal with it. To my mind that finding was clearly open. I reject these grounds of appeal.  Grounds of appeal 12, 13, 14, 15, 16  Respondent's contextual imputation 7 - the plaintiff, an Australian citizen, went to a foreign state and engaged in hostile activity in that foreign state which is contrary to Australian law  79The appellant complains that her Honour's findings with respect to this imputation were unreasonable and against the evidence. It was originally argued in grounds 13 and 14 that the appellant was denied procedural fairness because the trial judge did not give him an opportunity to make submissions about the Martic judgment in relation to the factual matters of the declarations of the Krajina Assembly and the establishment of the Krajina Autonomous District. These grounds of appeal have been withdrawn. However, under ground 16 the appellant complains that her Honour used the Martic judgment, there being no other evidence at trial, in her finding that the Krajina Autonomous District ""did not conform to requirements of an independent foreign state."" It was further submitted that the trial judge failed to take into account the definition of ""foreign state"" in paragraph 3(2) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth).  80The submission in relation to the opportunity to discuss the Martic judgment may be immediately dismissed. The appellant made extensive submissions to the trial judge with reference to the content of that judgment. Furthermore any suggestion that her Honour should not have referred to the judgment at all is entirely inconsistent with the submissions made to the trial judge that the document could be relied upon to prove his innocence in other respects.  81The appellant asserted that ""SAO Krajina"" (the Serbian Autonomous District of Krajina) was a ""political subdivision"" of a ""foreign state"" within the meaning of sections 6 and 3(2) of the Crimes Act. Section 3(2) of the Act extends the definition of ""foreign state"" to include any political subdivision of a foreign state. The evidence was that the appellant was engaged in military activity for the ""Serbian Autonomous region of Krajina."" However, as the evidence in particular from the appellant makes plain Krajina was not a foreign state nor a political subdivision of a foreign state. The appellant said in his evidence that:  ""Well, Krajina is a region which is now sort of failed. A state, or attempted state, which intended to secede from a state of Croatia at the time when Croatia was seceding from former Yugoslavia.""  82The appellant's argument to this Court was that he was given the rank of Captain in the Krajina armed forces and commanded a small team of soldiers at the Battle of Glina which took place within the Krajina area. The appellant said that he attacked the Croatian command post at Glina with the authority of the Minister of the Interior of Krajina.  83The appellant submitted that her Honour should have realised that the Krajina Autonomous District was ""a political subdivision of a foreign state"" with its own government and was therefore within the meaning of foreign state under s 3(2) of the Act. However, this submission fails because of the appellant's own evidence that Krajina was an attempted state which failed. It was neither a foreign state in its own right nor a political subdivision of Yugoslavia. The Serbian people were not engaged in military activity in the name of Yugoslavia. There is nothing to suggest that the Serbian Autonomous District of Krajina had any political affiliation with Yugoslavia. Its declared purpose was inconsistent with such an affiliation.  84As it happens, the Martic judgment records the history of the events without a suggestion of controversy. On 29 May 1991 a body known as the Krajina Assembly purported to establish itself as a government and adopted a constitution for the Serbian Autonomous District of Krajina. The Assembly announced that Milan Babic was to be the President and Milan Martic was to be the Minister of Defence. However, the Krajina Autonomous District did not have the power or authority to govern the region to the exclusion of the central government of Yugoslavia.  Grounds of appeal 1, 9, 10, 17 - 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34  The respondent's torture contextual imputations (8, 9, 10,11, 12, 13)  85The torture imputations in summary allege that the appellant as commander of Serbian paramilitary units bore responsibility for torture, condoned torture and that he himself committed torture.  86Her Honour found that the torture imputations were established. The appellant criticised her Honour's reasons submitting that she did not adequately set out the evidence which supported each imputation. It was further submitted that her Honour failed to distinguish between the ""war crime of torture"" and the ""crime of torture.""  87The respondent called seven witnesses to support the torture imputations. Five of them were inmates of the Old Knin Hospital prison and two were inmates of the Sremska Mitrovica prison (a Serbian prison in Bosnia). Her Honour accepted the witnesses' evidence that the appellant was present during various alleged assaults of inmates.  88Her Honour found that the appellant ""condoned the commission of torture by failing to act to prevent it"" when it could be presumed that he had the power to do so. The appellant submitted that this finding was not supported by the evidence. He denied assaulting prisoners and denied that any were assaulted in his presence. He said that he was not in charge of the Knin fortress or its prison and never attended the Old Knin Hospital prison. He said that he had no connection with the Sremska Mitrovica prison other than to visit it on two occasions.  89Her Honour did not accept the appellant's evidence. My examination of the transcript of the proceedings at trial confirms that her Honour's rejection of the evidence of the appellant was completely justified. There was a consistency in the evidence in support of the torture imputations. That evidence indicated mistreatment of prisoners including beatings, broken bones, severe bruising and inadequate nourishment leading to weight loss and starvation, electrical burns and psychological torment. It included a clear recollection by all witnesses of the appellant's name, accent, physical features and obvious position of authority. The respondent appropriately emphasised that according to his own evidence the appellant was a prominent identity in Krajina in 1991 and would have been known and recognised by local people.  90I am satisfied that the trial judge was entitled to reject the appellant's evidence which was beset by inconsistencies. At one point in his evidence the appellant said that the beret with a new inverted symbol was issued to his troops no more than 2 weeks before the Battle of Glina. Elsewhere he said that the only thing that changed after mid July was the colour of the beret stating that his troops starting wearing red berets after the Battle of Glina in late July 1991. Notwithstanding this evidence he also denied ""absolutely"" that any of this troops had worn a red beret in early August 1991. The denial is not believable and further justifies her Honour's adverse finding in relation to the appellant's credit.  91The witnesses Ackar and Perry gave evidence that they encountered the appellant at Sremska Mitrovica  in mid 1992. Described by Mr Perry as ""Captain Dragan"" there can be no doubt that Mr Perry met the appellant. As it happens the appellant said that he recalled meeting Mr Perry in the prison but under different circumstances.  92Mr Ackar gave a detailed description of a person consistent with that of the appellant. There is no reason to doubt his evidence that he saw the appellant and that the appellant struck him and watched other guards strike him.  93There is no reason to doubt the identification evidence given by other witnesses. Velibor Bracic gave evidence of two occasions when he saw the appellant in June and August 1991.  94Osman Vikic, who gave evidence by video link, described an incident in the Knin fortress in June 1991 where a man introduced himself as ""Captain Dragan, the commander of the militia SAO Krajina"".  95Darko Kauric and Milan Spoljaric, who also gave evidence by video link, described an incident at the Old Hospital in Knin in August 1991 where they were visited by a man who was addressed as Captain Dragan by the guards.  96Davor Hrnjica gave evidence in person about his encounters with the appellant at the Old Hospital between 3 July 1991 and his release on 14 August 1991. Mr Bracic, Mr Vikic, Mr Kauric, Mr Spoljaric and Mr Hrnjica each made reference to his physical characteristics and separately identified the appellant from a number of photographs. It is clear that there were consistent themes in the descriptions of the appellant.  97Source A said she was raped by the appellant. When giving evidence she identified the appellant in the courtroom. Her evidence was objected to but admitted. Her Honour indicated that there was nothing about the appellant's position in the court or his dress which made him stand out so that Source A's identification of him was unreliable. The position of an accused person in a criminal trial, who may be seated in the dock and dressed in prison clothing, may be quite different. The identification of the appellant by Source A was only a minor part of the respondent's case implicating the appellant in torture. The trial judge noted in her reasons that there was no serious dispute about whether the appellant was the ""Captain Dragan"" described by the prisoner witnesses. The real dispute was about his role in the torture and mistreatment of prisoners. Accordingly she did not accept the appellant's objections to the admission of Source A's identification evidence. I agree with this finding.  98The evidence of the witnesses was that they had been separately mistreated by persons when not in the appellant's presence before they arrived at Knin. This evidence was admitted in support of the respondent's argument that the later mistreatment of the prisoners which involved the appellant was the more reprehensible because of their previous mistreatment. Although the appellant complains about the admission of this evidence I am satisfied that it was properly admitted.  99In his submissions to this Court the appellant accepted that although he may have assaulted prisoners and been present when his troops assaulted them, they were not tortured either in his presence or with his knowledge. This was a surprising submission, particularly because it is contrary to the position which he adopted at the trial.  100At the trial the appellant denied any suggestion that he had assaulted prisoners or that his troops had done so. However, it is significant that he also accepted that it would be ""impossible ... absolutely"" for people to have been beaten up at the fortress without him knowing about it. He said that ""definitely if it happened, yes I would know of it.""  101The appellant submitted to this Court that the trial judge had made errors with respect to the appellant's authority over the troops responsible for the mistreatment of prisoners and that her findings were not supported by the evidence. This submission appears to have been made without recognition of this evidence from the appellant. Apart from his claim to have authority over his troops the evidence from witnesses at trial was that the appellant raped Source A, kicked the witness Bracic in the head as a demonstration to other soldiers about how to beat a prisoner and told the witness Perry that he was going to be executed, although the appellant had no intention of carrying it out.  102Although the appellant submitted to this Court that the respondent made no submission to her Honour as to the distinction between ""torture"" and ""the war crime torture"" this is not correct. In response to the appellant's submission at trial there was discussion as to whether the Court should adopt the definition of ""torture"" found in the Martic judgment. This effectively adopts the definition in the Geneva Convention and Protocols. This would have the effect, so the appellant's argument went, that the appellant would not have been responsible for ""torture"" unless he himself committed it and it was done for a proscribed ""prohibited purpose."" Whatever be the position in the Martic judgment the Australian statute relating to torture was, at the time these events occurred, in the Schedule to the Crimes (Torture) Act (1988) (Cth) which provided that the term torture means:  ""Any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.""  103This definition expanded the meaning to include the acts of others inflicted by and at the instigation of or with the acquiescence of a police official or other person acting in an official capacity.  104Given that the debate at trial was as to whether the Martic definition should be used or the definition in the Commonwealth Act, Her Honour was in my view right to decide that the latter should be adopted. If the imputation was to be understood by reference to a legal standard the standard adopted by Australian law was appropriate. However, there was a discussion during the hearing of the appeal as to whether the dictionary meaning of torture should be used rather than the statutory definition. The Macquarie Dictionary defines torture as being ""the act of inflicting excruciating pain esp. from sheer cruelty or in hatred, revenge or the like"" or ""a method of inflicting such pain"".  105The dictionary definition does not confine the physical abuse of an individual constituting the act of torture to any particular purpose. All that is required is that the relevant act be committed.  106To my mind the dictionary definition is the most appropriate in the present circumstances. Her Honour referred to it but did not expressly adopt it. Nevertheless I am satisfied that whatever definition is adopted the facts found by her Honour amply justified the imputations.  107The imputations relating to torture are imputations 8-13. I have previously concluded that the factual basis for torture and the war crime of torture may be the same, the latter occurring in connection with a war. Her Honour found that the evidence tendered by the respondent was common to a number of the imputations. In the same incident the appellant may have committed, condoned or commanded others to commit torture. Her Honour was criticised because she failed to make separate findings in relation to each imputation. However, her Honour accepted the evidence of each ""complainant"" and rejected the appellant's denials. Her Honour said:  ""124 Accepting that these witnesses were both truthful and reliable, as I do, there is overwhelming evidence of the commission of torture and the war crime of torture by members of the Serbian paramilitary units under the plaintiff's command.  Much of this evidence was not seriously challenged.  As I have already noted, the real challenge was directed to the evidence of the plaintiff's presence during these events and the extent to which the plaintiff can be held accountable for the actions of his men.  Once the witness' evidence of the plaintiff's presence during the various assaults is accepted, it follows that the plaintiff condoned the commission of torture by failing to act to prevent it.  125 Given the tenor of the plaintiff's evidence, it is also beyond doubt that he must be held accountable for the assaults perpetrated by his men.  According to that evidence, he was in command at the Knin fortress and enjoyed a legendary status among his men.  He exercised absolute authority and was kept very well informed, to the extent that ""nothing could have happened there without me knowing it"".  The plaintiff went so far as to say that it would be ""impossible .. absolutely"" for anyone to have been beaten at the fortress without the plaintiff knowing.  If beatings occurred then ""definitely if it happened, yes I would know of it.""  In so far as the assaults committed at the hospital prison are concerned, there is no reason to doubt that the plaintiff's authority over the guards who wore the same uniform and the same insignia as the plaintiff, was any less than the authority he exercised at the fortress.  One of the most striking features of the plaintiff's evidence was the obvious pride he took in recounting the complete respect and adulation he enjoyed from his men and from Serbs generally.  126 The evidence of Mr Perry, Mr Ackar and Mr Bracic also establishes that the plaintiff committed torture and the war crime of torture, either on the basis that the plaintiff himself seriously assaulted Mr Ackar and Mr Bracic, both of whom were in a very weak physical and psychological condition, or on the basis that the plaintiff instigated or consented to the infliction of severe pain or suffering upon them and upon Mr Perry.""  108I am not persuaded that more was required.  109The appellant further complained in the course of the oral submissions that because the jury found that imputations that the appellant authorised the torture, rape and murder of civilians were not conveyed by the article, her Honour could not find that ""acts of torture were carried out at the behest of or with the authority of (the appellant)."" To the extent that I understand the submission it is misconceived. Her Honour's finding is founded in the evidence of the relevant events given at the trial. It is not dependent on and is separate from any finding of the jury at the section 7A trial.  110With respect to the appellant's credit I am satisfied that it was open to the trial judge to reject him as a witness of truth. Although there was some variation his case at trial was that there had been no mistreatment of the witnesses that the respondent called. The trial judge said of the appellant:  ""127 The plaintiff's evidence was replete with contradictions.  I have already noted the attempt by the plaintiff to characterise his role in the Krajina 1991 as essentially responsible for the training of police officers (see [88] above).  The plaintiff maintained this assertion in the face of his answers to interrogatories (Exhibit 13) and in the face of a document filed in the Federal Court for the purposes of extradition proceedings.  This latter document included a statement that ""the applicant went to Knin and established a military training centre 8 km away in Golubic in Krajina.  The applicant became head military instructor and commander of the special forces unit of professional soldiers that he recruited.""  The plaintiff's explanation for these statements was that they were his solicitor's interpretation, that he probably saw the document but that he did not believe that he had read it before it was filed.  Later in the course of his cross-examination, the plaintiff asserted that his solicitor had retrieved these statements from a book written by the plaintiff.  I reject this evidence entirely.  128 Despite the fact that this aspect of the plaintiff's evidence was completely abandoned as relevant to the resolution of the issues in the proceedings, it cast a very unfavourable light upon the plaintiff's credit generally.  I formed the impression that the plaintiff was prepared to change or colour his evidence in an attempt to defuse the allegations made against him.  In short, he was loose with the truth when it suited his purposes.""  111Apart from the view that this Court may form of the appellant's credit by reading the transcript it is plain that her Honour, by observing the appellant give evidence, enjoyed a significant advantage, as against this Court.  112The appellant complains that he was only subjected to limited cross examination. In particular he complains that the allegations by the prisoner witnesses and Source A were not put to him.  113It must be remembered that the plaintiff did not give evidence in his own case. This is now common in defamation cases. It is adopted as a tactical manoeuvre in the hope that the defendant's evidence will fail to be sufficiently persuasive making it unnecessary for the plaintiff to give evidence in reply. Cross examination on factual matters which may justify the pleaded imputations is accordingly avoided. In this case when the appellant's case closed the respondent had not had the opportunity to put any of its case in justification of the imputations to the appellant by way of cross examination. The respondent then called all of its justification evidence, and the appellant was able to cross examine those witnesses with the benefit of an outline of that evidence which had been served before the trial. Its substance was also disclosed in the particulars of truth.  114After the respondent closed its case the appellant opened his case in reply. The appellant's counsel put to him each of the matters raised in the respondent's case which he proceeded to deny. In these circumstances it could not be suggested that he did not have an opportunity to refute any matter of relevance. His denials left no room for any unfairness in the respondent's subsequently submitting to the court that the evidence of Source A should be accepted as against the appellant's denials.  Grounds 1, 9, 10, 34 - Martic judgment  115These grounds of appeal relate to the attempt by the appellant to use the Martic judgment to establish that he did not mistreat or brutalise prisoners at Knin. Apart from the fact that the judgment was not admitted for the truth of its contents the reference to the Martic judgment for this purpose was made for the first time weeks after the evidence had closed.  116The appellant submitted that there were no findings in the Martic judgment to the effect that the appellant has mistreated or brutalised prisoners. It was submitted that to the contrary there were findings that the appellant had taken measures to address the criminal acts of others in respect of prisoners and in particular took action against Serbian soldiers who had mistreated prisoners.  117Her Honour rejected the submission for the reason that the judgment had not been admitted to prove the truth of its content. Furthermore she determined that because the issue was not raised during the course of the trial the respondent had no opportunity to ask questions about matters in the judgment.  118The appellant submitted to this Court that her Honour's ruling was erroneous and unfair. The appellant emphasised that five witnesses from Croatia had been cross examined about the identity of the prison guards and persons in charge of the prison referred to in the Martic judgment. Accordingly it was submitted that reliance on the judgment would not have involved a denial of procedural fairness to the respondent.  119I have already resolved the debate in relation to the relevance of the Martic judgment to imputation 4. However, it was further submitted that the Martic judgment could be used to establish the truth of other matters in particular that the appellant had not mistreated prisoners. The submission is misconceived.  120A reading of the Martic judgment makes plain that the issues before the Tribunal were not concerned with whether the appellant had been involved in mistreating prisoners at Knin. The judgment does not address any issue relating to the appellant's command at the Knin fortress which was in any event, as I understand the situation, a different location to the prison hospital. However, the judgment does indicate that the appellant's troops had a dormitory in the hospital at various times which is contrary to the appellant's assertion that his troops were ""strictly forbidden"" and ""not authorised"" to go there and that he himself had ""never set foot in the Knin prison until 1993.""  121Although the Martic judgment has no relevance to these disputed factual issues, if it did, it would not support the appellant's position.  Grounds of appeal: 1, 26 - 29, 31, 33, 34  Contextual imputations 14 - 16 - rape imputations  122The essence of the appellant's submission in relation to these imputations was that the trial judge acted unfairly and unreasonably in refusing to permit the appellant to call alibi evidence. It was further submitted, as I have previously indicated, that the trial judge should not have allowed Source A to identify the appellant in court. He also submitted that he was not given sufficient opportunity to respond to the evidence of Source A.  123Lastly, the appellant submitted that her Honour should have made separate findings with respect to each rape imputation.  124The evidence of Source A was not challenged apart from her identification of the appellant as her assailant. She gave evidence that the appellant raped her and she was raped by another in his presence and by others when the appellant had left the room. She also said that she and other women were raped on other occasions.  125The rapes allegedly occurred at the Hotel Vidikovac in Zvornik, Bosnia. The appellant admitted that he visited that hotel on more than one occasion between May and July 1992 which was the period of time when Source A was raped. The appellant said that his purpose in visiting Zvornik at about this time was to undertake charitable work but he offered no explanation for his visits to the hotel. His brother said that the appellant visited Zvornik to set up a military training camp.  126Source A gave evidence of the physical characteristics of her assailant. She was cross examined and challenged as to her description of her assailant's hair and the fact that she did not identify an abdominal scar which the appellant apparently has.  127Source A gave consistent evidence about the colour of the appellant's hair and other features. She said that her assailant's hair was ""a bit grey"" and that he was ""skinny not tall with a bit of a nose sticking out.""  128Her Honour dealt with the submission that Source A had not identified an abdominal scar on her assailant. Her Honour indicated that ""a proper reading of (Source A's evidence) discloses that the plaintiff only removed his lower clothing in order to rape her. That fact, coupled with the fact that the rape occurred at night discounts any criticism levelled at her evidence on that score."" Accordingly, her Honour accepted the evidence of Source A finding that imputations 14, 15 and 16 were substantially true.  129To my mind her Honour's findings justified this conclusion. Given the nature of the imputations a finding that the appellant raped Source A and that she otherwise accepted the evidence of course was sufficient to justify these imputations.  130The appellant suggested that he could provide alibi evidence which would exclude him from being at the hotel when the rape occurred. He sought to call this evidence in his case in reply but this application was refused by the trial judge.  131The background to her Honour's ruling was that there had been a complex set of procedures put in place before the trial for the taking of evidence from witnesses located in Croatia or Bosnia, who did not speak English. The necessary video link facilities were made available with considerable difficulty and delay. It was necessary for a Croatian judge sitting in Zagreb to preside over the video link evidence. The facilities were only available for a limited time. As a consequence the arrangements for the taking of overseas evidence were put in place before the trial and in circumstances where each party knew well in advance the evidence it would have to meet.  132The relevant assault was alleged to have occurred on 27 June 1992. Source A gave her evidence on 29 April 2009 in which she identified the relevant day by reference to a holy day in around July 1992. The appellant said that until this evidence was given he did not realise that Source A had been referring to the holy day of ""Vidovdan"" which occurs on 28 June each year. The course which the appellant wanted to take was to call evidence as to his whereabouts on 27 June 1992, the day before Vidovdan.  133In her judgment of 12 May 2009 the trial judge considered the advantages to the appellant and the disadvantages to the respondent of permitting this evidence to be called at the late point in the trial. Her Honour accepted that the appellant learned that there would be a reference to Vidovdan on the day before Source A was cross examined. She also identified the fact that when the appellant gave evidence on 5 and 6 May he did not mention the matter. The application to lead further evidence was not to be evidence from the appellant himself but from others.  134It was obvious that if the evidence was allowed the respondent would have had difficulty investigating the matter given the lack of notice. In her judgment of 12 May 2009, her Honour said:  ""The prcis of evidence from Source A, which was served by the defendant on the plaintiff in February 2009, contained a reference to this latter occasion as 'in around July 1992.' That is significant, in view of the plaintiff's counsel's submission that it was not possible for the plaintiff to anticipate the need for the evidence that he now proposes to call, until Source A gave evidence in the trial.  The prcis of evidence of the proposed witnesses Marko Josilo and Slavisa Djordevic are Exhibit A on this application. Both men describe themselves as war correspondents in 1991 and thereafter, reporting on the conflict in the Balkans and in particular in the Krajina area. Both men claim that they first met the plaintiff in May 1991 at Knin and that their association with the plaintiff continued until August 1991. Leaving to one side the evidence in respect of the colour of the beret worn by the plaintiff and his soldiers over that period of time, and the fact that both prospective witnesses claim that they each spoke to prisoners at the Knin fortress and the old hospital prison where no complaints were made of mistreatment, the proposed witness Mr Djordevic claimed that he attended a rally in Belgrade with the plaintiff on 27 June 1992. There is apparently a newspaper article from a Serbian newspaper in existence that refers to the plaintiff's presence at the rally. Mr Djordevic then states that the day after the rally, namely 28 June, is a religious celebration day for Vidovdan that commemorates the battle of Kosovo and the Serbian victory over the Turks.  Clearly, if evidence consistent with the precis is given, it would be open to the plaintiff to suggest that Source A should not be believed, in so far as he was not in Zvornik on 27 June 1992, being the day before the celebration of Vidovdan. I was informed from the bar table that the plaintiff's brother will also give evidence of the date of the festival, although he did not give that evidence when called immediately after the plaintiff and, as far as I am aware, the precis of his evidence omitted reference to that fact.  No satisfactory explanation was provided by the plaintiff for the late service of the precis of evidence outlined above, given the terms of Justice Kirby's directions, namely that the precis of any witness' evidence from overseas was to be served on the defendant before the start of the trial. It is no answer, in my view, to assert that the plaintiff was ignorant of the relevance of the reference by Source A in the precis of her evidence to July 1992 and the celebration of a holy day. The date of the celebration of Vidovdan must have been within the plaintiff's knowledge, if not also within his brother's knowledge, and it was always within the plaintiffs means, at least since February of this year, to make enquiries of those with whom he associated in June and July 1992, in order to rebut the evidence of the defendant's witnesses. It appears that no such enquiries were made until approximately a fortnight ago.  The real prejudice to the defendant in allowing evidence to be called without appropriate notice is demonstrated by the contents of Exhibit 1 on the application. Over the weekend, the defendant has been able to discover, via internet searches, a number of published documents, including one from the US Department of State, a report compiled at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal to the former Yugoslavia and a document sourced from the Helsinki Committee on Human Rights in Serbia, providing support for the proposition that Djordevic and Marko Josilo are apologists for the Serbian regime, who had close relations to persons indicted for war crimes. No doubt, a considerable amount of time would be required to verify these sources and obtain material which could provide the basis for fruitful cross examination. However, that opportunity could not be afforded to the defendant without further delay in the completion of the trial, not to mention further expense to both parties.  This Court has impressed upon practitioners, through its decisions, the importance of adherence to the terms of s 56(2) of the Civil Procedure Act 2005. That provision requires the Court in mandatory terms to give effect to the overriding purpose, that is to ""facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings"". That overriding purpose is reinforced in defamation proceedings by the terms of the Defamation Act 1974 and the terms of the Defamation Act 2005, both of which provide that one of its objects is to promote the resolution of proceedings for defamation in a timely manner and to avoid protracted litigation: Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWCA 37.  Those interests are not served by allowing the plaintiff to call the proposed evidence at this stage of the proceedings. The orders made by Justice Kirby would be effectively nullified and the considerable effort expended to ensure that matter was ready for trial would have been in vain. It (sic) all of these circumstances, the plaintiff ought not be allowed to call the proposed evidence.""  135In my judgment the approach which her Honour took to this issue was entirely appropriate. In the absence of any suggestion that the appellant would give evidence as to his whereabouts and the lack of an opportunity for the respondent to investigate the assertions as to his whereabouts at the relevant time the interests of justice were appropriately served by denying the application.  136In any event I am not persuaded that the evidence would have been of any assistance to the appellant. Although it may have proved that the appellant was in Belgrade on the day of the assault, given the proximity of Belgrade to Zvornik his presence in Belgrade would not have excluded him from being at Zvornik at the time Source A claims the rape occurred. There was no suggestion that the appellant proposed to lead evidence that he was in Belgrade on both 27 and 28 June. There may have been an explanation for his whereabouts on 27 June but neither the proffered witnesses nor the appellant himself proposed to give evidence that he was in Belgrade on 28 June 1992.  Grounds of appeal 35, 36  The standard and onus of proof  137The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred by failing to refer to the standard and onus of proof in ""support of her findings that the appellant had committed serious criminal and war crimes."" It was further submitted that her Honour failed to apply the Briginshaw standard ((1938) 60 CLR 336) when finding that the respondent had established the truth of the relevant imputations. These grounds are without merit. A variety of her Honour's findings were couched in terms of ""ample justification"" and she expressed herself to be ""mindful of the serious nature of these allegations."" On other occasions her Honour said that she was ""more than satisfied of a particular fact."" It is abundantly clear that her Honour understood that the respondent was required to prove its case and was mindful that she must have regard to the serious nature of the allegations when determining whether they had been proved.  Ground of appeal 38  The defence of contextual truth in NSW and Tasmania  138As I understand the situation, the appellant did not challenge her Honour's finding of a defence of contextual truth in NSW in accordance with section 16 Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). The focus of this ground of appeal was on her Honour's application of the defence of justification as found in section 18 Defamation Act 1957 (Tas).  139Section 18 of the Defamation Act 1957 (Tas) is in the following terms:  ""In an action for defamation in respect of words containing two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence of justification does not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff's reputation, having regard to the truth of the remaining charges.""  140The appellant submitted that this section applies only where there are two or more charges (imputations) pleaded by a plaintiff and where a defence of justification fails against one or more but succeeds on one or more. It was submitted that the section operates so that in relation to imputations pleaded by the plaintiff those imputations established by a defendant to be true can be weighed against those the defendant has failed to prove to be true.  141In the present case the appellant emphasised that the respondent did not plead truth to imputations 1, 2 and 3, said to be the most serious imputations, but only to the comparatively less serious 4, 5 and 6. It was submitted that the harm caused to the appellant by the false imputations 1, 2 and 3 would obviously outweigh any harm caused by the true imputations or a combination thereof of 4, 5 and 6.  142To my mind the submission must be rejected. Section 18 provides that in an action for defamation ""in respect of words containing two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff"", a defence of justification will not fail if the charges that remain unproved do not materially injure the plaintiff's reputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charges. The section does not exclude from consideration defamatory charges brought to the attention of the court by a defendant. Furthermore, to my mind, the section does not suggest that parliament intended the section to apply only to distinct defamatory charges raised by a plaintiff. The opening words of the section refer to ""words containing two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff"" a description of a publication without reference to the manner in which any proceedings in relation to it are pleaded.  143There is a similarly worded section in s 5 of the UK Defamation Act 1952. Decisions on that section do not assist the appellant: see Moore v News of the World [1972] 1 QB 441; Polly Peck (Holdings) v Trelford [1986] QB 1000. The reasons why the defence failed in Polly Peck was that the plaintiff had sued on only part of the article and the distinct charge relied upon by the defendant was not contained in that part. The present case is of course otherwise. The plaintiff sued on the entire article.  With respect to the position in New South Wales and Tasmania her Honour found that the damage to the appellant's reputation caused by the contextual imputations which she found to be true, subsumed the damage to the appellant's reputation occasioned by imputations 1, 2 and 3.  Ground 37:  Documentary Evidence  144Ground 37 was expressed in the following terms:  ""Her Honour erred by failing to take into account or refer to in her judgment the absence of any documentary or supporting evidence to corroborate the serious allegations made against the appellant by the respondent's witnesses.""  145This ground of appeal is entirely without merit.  146The appellant suggested that because there were no documents to support the allegation of the mistreatment of others or the role of the appellant in the relevant events, her Honour's findings as to relevant facts were erroneous. Whether any documents exist which may have supported the appellant's position is unknown. If documents did exist it is unknown whether they would have supported the respondent's position or the appellant's. Given the circumstances this would seem unlikely.  147Given that no documents were tendered to her Honour it is not surprising that she makes no reference to any written materials. However, this does not mean that given her Honour's factual findings as to the credit of witnesses and the lack of credit of the appellant were not justified.  Grounds 34, 39-44  The defence of justification at common law - in relation to States and Territories outside NSW  148The argument in relation to this defence at trial and in this Court created a great deal of confusion because of the use of outdated terminology and unnecessary complexity in the drafting of the pleadings. In large part the appellant's complaints have been addressed in [43] - [59] above.  149The respondent pleaded a defence described as ""Contextual Truth (Common Law)"" in respect of all jurisdictions apart from NSW. At trial, her Honour correctly noted that a defence of common law contextual truth is not available in Australia ( John Fairfax Publications v Zunter [2006] NSWCA 227). Her Honour suggested that ""justification"" was the appropriate defence and referred to the decision in Hitchcock.  150The defence of justification involves a defendant pleading and justifying an alternative meaning to the defamatory imputation pleaded by the plaintiff. In Polly Peck (Holdings) Plc v Trelford [1986] QB 1000 O'Conner LJ said (at 1032).  In cases where the plaintiff selects words from a publication, pleads that in their natural and ordinary meaning the words are defamatory of him, and pleads the meanings which he asserts they bear by way of false innuendo, the defendant is entitled to look at the whole publication in order to aver that in their context the words bear a meaning different from that alleged by the plaintiff. The defendant is entitled to plead that in that meaning the words are true and to give particulars of the facts and matters upon which he relies in support of his plea, as he is required to do by RSC, O 82. It is fortuitous that some or all of those facts and matters are culled from parts of the publication of which the plaintiff has not chosen to complain.  Where a publication contains two or more separate and distinct defamatory statements, the plaintiff is entitled to select one for complaint, and the defendant is not entitled to assert the truth of the others by way of justification.  Whether a defamatory statement is separate and distinct from other defamatory statements contained in the publication is a question of fact and degree in each case. The several defamatory allegations in their context may have a common sting, in which event they are not to be regarded as separate and distinct allegations. The defendant is entitled to justify the sting, and once again it is fortuitous that what is in fact similar fact evidence is found in the publication.  151This approach was criticised in the High Court in Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers Ltd [1998] HCA 37 (' Chakravarti') where, in dicta, Brennan CJ and McHugh J stated at [8],  With great respect to his Lordship, such an approach is contrary to the basic rules of common law pleadings and in many contexts will raise issues which can only embarrass the fair trial of the action. Leaving aside technical pleas such as pleas in abatement, defences are either by way of denial or confession and avoidance. A defence which alleges a meaning different from that of the plaintiff is in the old pleading terminology an argumentative plea of not guilty. Under the principles of pleading at common law, it could tender no issue and would be struck out as embarrassing. Under the modern system, articulating an alternative meaning could conceivably make explicit the ground for denying a pleaded imputation. But it would be only in such a case that a defendant's plea of a new defamatory meaning might be supportable as a plea which prevents the plaintiff being taken by surprise....In our view, the Polly Peck defence or practice contravenes the fundamental principles of common law pleadings.  152It is now accepted that the ""Polly Peck"" defence is not available in any Australian jurisdiction. The dicta in Chakravarti has been followed in subsequent decisions of intermediate appellate courts (see the authorities in [22] above).  153In Fawcett v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 139 ('Fawcett'), Simpson J considered the availability of a variant of the Polly Peck defence, termed the ""Hore-Lacey"" defence after the Victorian decision David Syme & Co Ltd v Hore-Lacey (2000) 1 VR 667 and concluded that this defence was available in all jurisdictions outside NSW. Her Honour relied upon the decision of the NSW Court of Appeal in Zunter to exclude the defence's operation in NSW (see [149] above).  154Simpson J distinguished the Polly Peck defence from the Hore-Lacey defence. Where there are several defamatory allegations, the Polly Peck defence allows a defendant to plead and justify a ""common sting"" which links or relates one defamatory allegation to another. It was this ""high level of abstraction"" that was criticised by Brennan CJ and McHugh J in Chakravarti .  155The Hore-Lacey defence allows a defendant to plead and justify an alternative imputation that is ""comprehended by or simply a variant of"" the plaintiff's imputation. However, the defendant's imputation must be one which the plaintiff could have put to the jury and would be no more injurious than the plaintiff's imputations already pleaded.  156In John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Hitchcock (2007) 70 NSWLR 484 at [233] this Court said that the defendant may plead an imputation by way of defence if it is not substantially different from the pleaded imputation and is one which the plaintiff would have been permitted to put to the jury without unfairness to the defendant. In order to answer the first question it is necessary to consider whether different evidence would be adduced or whether the case would be conducted on a different basis.  157In the present case, the defence as pleaded, provided 11 contextual imputations (including imputation 17) which were said to be ""not separate and distinct from the plaintiff's imputations"". This language, on its face, suggests a Polly Peck defence but it is clear from the respondent's later submissions that it relies upon the Hore-Lacey defence. Although pleaded in the manner that I have indicated, it appears that the respondent relied on imputation 17 as the foundation for the Hore-Lacey defence. The parties have proceeded on this basis.  158When applying the Hore-Lacey defence to the present facts, it is clear from Latham J's remarks at trial that her Honour appreciated that imputation 17 ""comprehends imputations 1 and 2.""  159Her Honour then, so it would seem, held correctly in my view, that imputation 17 was substantially true. Her Honour's findings in relation to rape, torture and the massacre of persons during a time of war more than justified that imputation. Accordingly as I understand her position, her Honour accepted the Hore-Lacey defence in relation to imputations 1 and 2. As it happens her Honour granted leave to the respondent to amend its defence to plead truth to imputation 2.  160The appellant criticised her Honour's approach to these issues. It was submitted that if her Honour found that imputation 17 did not differ in substance from imputations 1, 2 and 4 (the appellant obviously meant imputation 3 and not 4) it would not be permitted to rely on an imputation which did not differ in substance from another imputation. That submission is appropriate with respect to the statutory defence in New South Wales but not the common law position in the other jurisdictions. It was no doubt for this reason that the respondent pleaded imputation 17.  161The appellant criticised her Honour's findings with respect to imputation 17. It was submitted that since the respondent had not defined ""war crimes"" or distinguished ""war crimes"" from ""crimes"" it can be assumed that contextual imputation is identical to ""the plaintiff committed crimes"". I reject this submission. The definition of war crimes is discussed at [42] above.  Orders  162In my judgment the appellant fails in relation to each ground of appeal.  163I would dismiss the appeal with costs.  **********

		02 September 2011",2011-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2757758,REGINA v KB; REGINA v JL; REGINA v RJB [2011] NSWCCA 190,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: These are my reasons for joining in the order of the Court made on 12 July 2011 dismissing the appeals in these matters. 

2The respondents each pleaded guilty to the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 years (in company) on 23 October 2009 in contravention of s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. 

3On 11 March 2011, his Honour Judge Williams DCJ sentenced each of the respondents KB and JL to 15 months' imprisonment suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on them entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for that period and to accept the guidance of the Probation and Parole Service. The respondent RJB was directed to enter into a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to be of good behaviour for a period of 21/2 years and to accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service. 

4Pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Crown appealed against the sentences imposed on each of the respondents. The grounds of appeal relied on by the Crown were as follows: 

1 The sentences imposed failed to reflect the objective gravity of the respondents' crimes. 

2 Failure to give weight to the principle of general deterrence. 

3 Error in allowing a 25 percent discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas. 

4 Error in imposing a suspended sentence for KB and JL. 

5 Error in imposing a s 9 bond upon RJB. 

6 Error in the imposition of a sentence which is manifestly inadequate. 

The Statement of Agreed Facts 

5The parties tendered a statement of agreed facts at the sentencing hearing. These facts disclosed that on 23 October 2009 the child in question, KS, was walking in Peel Street, Tamworth, with her friend, KT, when two men in a van drove past them and yelled out to them. At the time KS was aged 12 years and 9 months whilst her friend was aged 13. The respondent KB was the driver of the van. He was aged 20 at the time. The passenger, RJB, was then 21 years of age. 

6The van pulled over and a conversation ensued in which the girls were asked what they were doing later. RJB asked KS for her phone number and she gave it to him. One of the males opened the side door and the girls saw JL asleep in the back with a beer bottle resting between his legs. The other two respondents asked KS to get the bottle for them and she did. JL woke up. JL was aged 18 years and 11 months. 

7KT told the police that KS informed the respondents that she was 16 years of age although KS had no recollection of this. The girls then proceeded to KS's grandmother's house. At 8.35pm KS received a phone call from RJB saying that he was near Big W and the girls should start walking that way. 

8KS's grandmother and another woman then drove the girls to a Liquorland bottle shop where two or three bottles of Passion Pop were purchased for them. At 9.03pm, the complainant called the respondents from a phone box to arrange to meet. KS and KT then walked down to meet the men. After meeting up, the respondents visited the Diggers Club and the girls waited outside. CCTV footage from the club showed the three men in company with the girls approaching the front door of the club. The men entered and left a short time later. The girls remained sitting on the footpath whilst the men were inside. Subsequently they walked to a bottle shop where JL and the girls waited while the other two men obtained more liquor. The group then walked to the train station and sat on the steps where they continued drinking. There was a discussion as to the possibility of some sexual contact between the men and the girls. 

9KS said that when she was at the train station ""I was pretty drunk but I was about to. [sic] I was walking in a straight line for a bit. Like, I was able to walk, I was energetic more than anything"". The statement of facts recorded that she was unable to remember anything after walking off following KT. Her next recollection was waking up in a hospital bed. 

10At about 10.30pm, two women who knew KT saw her and KS crossing the road towards the Diggers Club car park. One of them noticed that KT was having difficulty walking so she knew she had been drinking. She called out to KT to get into the car and she did. After the women and KT left, KS called out to the men to wait and she went to where they were. 

11KT told the women who had picked her up what had occurred and they became concerned and drove back to the car park. One of the women walked to the outskirts of the beer garden of the club. She saw a female (the complainant) lying on the ground with three young males surrounding her (the offenders). She observed that KB was sexually involved with the complainant. He was kneeling between the victim's legs, with his pants around his knees. His right hand was in the area of his groin and the complainant's vagina. KB admitted that he digitally penetrated KS's vagina and the plea was accepted on that basis. The woman saw that RJB was in the vicinity of the complainant but she could not make out what he was doing. The woman ran back to the club to get help whilst calling out to the other woman. She returned with a security officer and a supervisor of the club. In the meantime, the other woman had climbed the wall separating the car park and the scene of the crime. She saw RJB sitting on the ground with his legs out straight and his upper body twisted to the right. As she approached she saw JL with his penis in KS's mouth and saw that RJB was touching KS on the shoulders. 

12She told the men to get off KS and they left the scene. She noticed that KS appeared disoriented. Whilst she tried to stand she fell face first into wire mesh at the rear of the club and collapsed. She was taken to Tamworth Base Hospital where a blood test returned a blood alcohol concentration of .29 g / 100 ml. 

Additional Evidence at the Sentencing Hearing 

13During the course of the sentencing hearing KB gave evidence. He stated that he went to Tamworth one week in every five to go to TAFE to complete his apprenticeship. He said that on completion of the TAFE course on a Friday afternoon he and JL, who was also doing a TAFE course, used to head back to Ballina. On the day in question they instead decided to stay and have a few drinks with RJB. KB said that he did not know the girls prior to the incidents in question but stated that the girls had said that they were 16. He said that leading up to the incidents in question he had had a number of beers, probably half a bottle of port and four shots. 

14He stated that he recalled the girls saying they wanted to have sex and that they followed the respondents when they walked from the Diggers Club to the train station. He saw one of them get into a car and the other one kept following. He stated that KS demanded that they have sex with her. He stated that he assumed the girls were of legal age and he should not have made that assumption. 

15He was cross-examined and repeated that the girls kept following the respondents. He agreed that the fact they did not go into licensed premises triggered an alarm that their age was between 16 and 18. He was not cross-examined on what he said relating to consent. 

Subjective Circumstances of the Respondents 

16The Crown, in its written submissions, set out in an uncontroversial fashion the subjective circumstances of the respondent as they appeared at the sentencing proceedings. 

KB 

17KB was 20 years old at the time of the offence on 23 October 2009. He has no prior or subsequent convictions. KB was raised in a supportive family and was educated to year 10 leaving school at the age of 16. At the time of sentence he was employed as a second year apprentice diesel mechanic. 

18KB told the author of the pre-sentence report that ""he feels like he's been set up by the victims [sic] as he maintains that the victims [sic] told him that they were sixteen years old and they were led on by the victim"". His plea was described by the Prosecution as (at 8): 

"" ... entered on the basis that there was a belief held at the time as to her age, and it's in the facts that at least the friend heard her tell the boys that she was sixteen, but it's an honest belief, but it's conceded by the defence that it wasn't a reasonable belief in all the circumstances, and that they certainly should not have proceeded with any sort of sexual contact with the young girl in the circumstances that they were in."" 

19KB's evidence was that he had not been in a relationship for a period of about 10 months prior to the offence but that he was in a relationship at the time of sentence. 

20A pre-sentence consultation prepared by Jillian Mears, a Senior Specialist Psychologist working in the Sex Offender Programmes, was attached to the pre-sentence report. That three page report contained an actuarial, as opposed to a comprehensive, risk assessment of KB. The actuarial risk assessment used, the ""STATIC-99R"" produces estimates of future risk based on the number of risk factors present for any one individual. Ms Mears stated it had ""moderate predictive accuracy"". KB's score on the STATIC-99R was 4. Ms Mears stated (at 2): 

""This places him in the Moderate-High risk category. His score reflects the fact he is young, has never been in a relationship for two years and the fact his victim was an unrelated stranger."" 

21In her summary of the risk considerations, Ms Mears noted that it is (at 2): 

"" ... of concern that in the company of his co-offenders he was willing to agree to meet strange young females and later have sexual intercourse with the victim who was 'heavily intoxicated'. Given her age she was unable to consent but in her intoxicated state the offender could not have gained her verbal consent. Consideration must be given to the attitudes and sense of sexual entitlement that may have contributed towards this offence"". 

22Four testimonials were tendered on behalf of KB. One, undated, was from his then current employer who stated that should a non-custodial sentence be imposed he would continue to be employed in a full time capacity and supervised: ""In the event of his return to [the company], [KB] would be under the direct supervision of either myself, BH who is our supervisor or his father JB who is a senior member of staff."" 

JL 

23JL was 20 at the time of sentence and was 18, almost 19 years of age at the time of the offence on 23 October 2009, the offence being three weeks before his 19 th birthday. 

24At the time of the offence he had no prior convictions. However, on 18 March 2010, ie, after the offence in 2009 and before sentence on 11 March 2011, he was convicted in the Local Court of driving with the mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol as well as offences of driving unlicensed and resisting an officer in the execution of his duty. 

25A pre-sentence report by Bruce Allsopp dated 7 March 2011 was tendered. According to that report JL had completed three years of his apprenticeship at a local government organisation where his father was also employed as a heavy diesel mechanic. The report stated that JL (at 2): 

"" ... said that he met his male friends in the Police facts in the process of attending course work for his apprenticeship at Tamworth TAFE. The offender said that at the time of meeting the victims he had consumed ten to twelve schooners and stubbies but he claims to recall that both victims [sic] have there [sic] age as 16 years. After obtaining more alcohol [JL] said that he and his male friends drank alcohol and discussions of a sexual nature with the victim ensued. After the offence occurred, the offender and his male friends were declined entry to two hotels before being apprehended for the current matter by police at a third hotel."" 

26The pre-sentence report in relation to JL stated that (at 3): 

""The offender's risk of sexual or violent recidivism was assessed utilising an actuarial risk assessment instrument, the STATIC-99. The STATIC-99 employs static (or historical/unchanging) factors to estimate risk of recidivism amongst adult males who have been convicted of a sexual offence. Based on the sample group the offender's score on the Static-99 places him in medium high risk category."" 

27JL was employed as an apprentice heavy vehicle mechanic and one testimonial, from Sharon Greenfield dated 17 November 2010 stated that JL had been an ""exemplary employee"". 

28A forensic psychologist, Anna Robilliard stated that she interviewed JL on two occasions, first in December 2010 and then in February 2011. She reported that JL had been raised in a stable and supportive family and he had their ongoing concern, love and support. He was in a stable and committed relationship which predated the offence which took place when he was separated from his girlfriend. She reported that he had appeared to have applied himself to his apprenticeship, that he hoped to be fully qualified by the middle of 2011, and that he had talked of plans to go on to continue his studies to become a ship's engineer. Ms Robilliard stated that (at 11): 

""With regard to his habits and lifestyle [JL] admitted he had tried cannabis and ecstasy tablets on a very few occasions; behaviour that is probably not unusual for his generation. He described a binge pattern of drinking which commenced in early to mid-teens which is of more concern. His parents tried to monitor and control his drinking however on turning 18 [JL] acknowledged he drank more often and sometimes to excess. He recognised he had an alcohol problem. He further acknowledged the commission of the index offence and the subsequent drink driving charge was indicative of the problematic nature of his drinking. [JL's] scores on the Alcohol Dependence scale of his personality test administered at each of our meetings reflected an apparent change in his attitudes and behaviour with regard to alcohol. At our most recent meeting he said he had not consumed alcohol since his court appearance in November 2010 nor did he intend to recommence drinking and he was continuing to participate in counselling and education with regard to his drinking. 

The issue of risk of re-offending is always relevant in the case sexual offences [sic]. Research into risk of sexual re-offending has produced a range of instruments to predict risk of recidivism however using them with young offenders can be problematic and sometimes misleading. Research into juvenile offenders suggest adolescent sex offenders are not necessarily younger versions of adult sexual offender [sic]. Harris et at (2003) stated 'we have reason to believe the people who commit sex offences only as children or young people are a different profile than adults who commit sexual offences' (page 5). 

[JL] was having difficulty appreciating the implications of his responsibility for the index offence when he was initially interviewed. At our recent meeting however he spoke with insight and appropriate awareness of the impact on the victim and he did not hesitate to accept responsibility or express regret and remorse for his offence."" 

29JL's mother gave evidence that JL resided with his family, namely herself, his father and younger sister and brother. Mrs L stated that the family managed an 800 acre cattle farm for a local doctor and that JL worked with his father on a daily basis both at work, after work and on the weekend on the farm. 

30Mrs L stated that while JL had been remanded in custody time had been spent in protection, they had only been able to visit him on weekends, and that JL had presented to her as ""scared"". She stated that after he had subsequently been arrested for drink driving he had said to her that he would like to harm himself and ""I was gravely concerned and took him to the hospital where he was scheduled overnight, to keep him safe and secure"" (at 18). Since then she sated that JL has been regularly seeing a drug and alcohol counsellor at the Ballina Community Centre. 

RJB 

31RJB was 21 years old at the time of the offence on 23 October 2009 and 22 years old at sentence. RJB had no prior convictions but after the offence and before sentencing RJB was convicted and sentenced in the Local Court for a number of receiving and related offences. RJB was arrested on 5 April 2010 for those offences and at the time he appeared before his Honour Judge Williams for sentence upon this matter RJB was serving a sentence in relation to those matters. That sentence was subsequently reduced on appeal by the District Court. RJB is therefore now serving a sentence of 2 years and 7 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 7 months dating from 5 April 2010 and expiring on 4 November 2011 on which date he is presently eligible for release to parole. 

32The pre-sentence report tendered in relation to RJB had been prepared in relation to those other offences. That reported dated 16 November 2010 stated that RJB had grown up in a stable and supportive family and was particularly close to his paternal grandfather who lived with the family for 25 years before his death, an event that had significantly affected RJB. RJB's mother told the author of the report that RJB ""regularly went out of his way to assist others, particularly the elderly, in their rural community"". 

33It was also stated that he had left school at the age of 14 years in Year 8 but had completed Year 10 as well as a number of courses at TAFE. According to the report RJB had maintained ""consistent employment in a range of semi-skilled rural based occupations"". 

34According to the pre-sentence report, RJB had reported that he had been in a relationship for six years and was engaged to be married. He had been upset when his partner had a miscarriage while he had been in custody. 

35A report by a psychologist, Mark Howard, dated 20 February 2011, was tendered in the case for RJB on sentence. According to that report RJB had always lived on the family property in the Tamworth area and would return to live there on release. 

36RJB was suspended twice during secondary school causing him to leave school in Year 8. He was then from the age of 15 employed for 12 months in an abattoir which he left as he did not relate well to colleagues or enjoy the work. After that, for the next two to three years RJB worked in 20 different positions and ""related his transient work status to difficulties in settling into an enjoyable trade"". After that RJB worked towards an apprenticeship in shed building and told Mr Howard that he was employed in that job at the time of the offence in 2009. 

37RJB told Mr Howard that he had no history of substance abuse and could not recall any occasions in the past where he had become severely intoxicated. Nor was there any history of any mental health problems. 

38He claimed (contrary to the first two paragraphs of the agreed facts) that it was his co-accused who initiated contact with the complainant and her friend and that he was the designated driver for the evening. He stated this was why he drank ""bugger all"" that evening (at 6). 

39The history as recorded by Mr Howard was that: 

""[RJB] recalled at the time of the offence he believed he was witness to 'consensual oral sex' between the victim and the co-accused. He stated the victim said she was aged 16 years, and he had reason to believe this was the case 'she looked 16'. [RJB] maintained he had no sexual contact with the victim and referred to a stable relationship with his fiancee which did not include any history of infidelity. [RJB] expressed some distaste regards being witness to sexual activity; he reported making efforts towards being picked up by his fiancee or mother although he was unable to make contact with them."" 

40Mr Howard found after interviewing and assessing RJB that (at 7): 

""Objective testing of personality revealed a minimum of entrenched maladaptive patterns of behaviour, thinking or approaches to relationships. Assessment of mood indicated some mild symptoms of depression at present. These personality and mood scores are consistent with [RJB]'s presentation at interview and his reports of a history of general psychological stability, notwithstanding some current symptoms of hopelessness and avolition associated with his present incarceration and legal difficulties. The outcomes indicate that [RJB] would not currently meet clinical criteria for diagnosis of mood or anxiety disorder, an there were also few indications of disordered personality features."" 

RJB's intellectual function was within normal limits. 

41Mr Howard stated that (at 8): 

""Despite [RJB]'s account of events surrounding the index offence, he demonstrated retrospective remorse for the events and empathy for the experience of the victim. He showed understanding for the importance of interactions between consent and the age of partners."" 

42Mr Howard concluded there was a ""low risk of sexual re-offending"" (at 9). 

Remarks on Sentence 

43In his remarks on sentence the trial judge summarised the statement of agreed facts as I have outlined them above. He stated that he looked at the CCTV footage which showed five young people walking to the entrance of the Diggers Club and the three males entering. He observed that KS seemed to be smoking as well as drinking from a wine sized bottle and sharing both the bottle and the cigarette with one of the offenders. He stated that although it was difficult to judge it was fair to say that the victim looked somewhat older than her actual age. He stated that apart from not knowing how old the victim and her girlfriend were, what was depicted was nothing out of the ordinary and much what one would expect in a group of young people out for a night. 

44His Honour recorded that it was not disputed that JL had oral sex and KB digital sex with KS. He stated that there was no evidence of RJB sexually interfering with her but he was there providing comfort to the others. He stated from the facts it was impossible to work out exactly what RJB was observed to be doing. 

45Importantly, the sentencing judge accepted that the offenders did not force their wishes on the victim. He stated that the suggestion that the girls wanted to be with the offenders was borne out by the CCTV footage. In that context he said that whilst consent is not a defence, the fact that conduct may be consensual can in certain circumstances affect the criminality of the offender. This would seem to imply that his Honour accepted the evidence of KB on this issue, although it was not the subject of comment in the agreed statement of facts. 

46In dealing with the question of general deterrence his Honour made the following comments (at 8): 

""I recognise that the rationale behind legislation such as this is to protect the persons that the law regards as children, if necessary even from themselves. Objectively that is a worthwhile sentiment but must be governed by the subjective circumstances. One would have to question how general deterrence in circumstances such as the present is likely to affect like minded young men in any community, once alcohol becomes an issue and, in those circumstances, having consumed alcohol, they uncritically accept what they are told as to a girl's age. 

I prefer to look at the matter on the basis that a crime has been committed which, in a worse case scenario, merits 20 years imprisonment. This is a case that, while objectively serious, is also at the lower end of the spectrum for such offences."" 

47His Honour recorded that the Probation and Parole Service suggested that a medium to high level of intervention for KB and JL would assist their rehabilitation. He stated that the evidence established that each of them were of prior good character, in settled career paths and in otherwise normal relationships with family and members of the opposite sex. He said they had ongoing support from their partners and families. 

48His Honour did not specify a precise discount he gave for the utilitarian value of the plea. However, he stated that the plea came as soon as the indictment was amended to include the count to which the plea of guilty was made. He said he failed to see why an offender should suffer a practical penalty for declining to plead to an offence which he or she is in fact not guilty (in this case the more serious offence under s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900). He assumed that the change in the indictment occurred because the Crown recognised that it could not prove the more serious offence under s 61J. 

The Appeal 

49For the Crown to succeed on the appeal in relation to Grounds 1-3 it is necessary for the Crown to demonstrate error in the sentencing in the sense set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499: see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [3], [58]; Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at [15]. The appellant accepted at the hearing of the appeal that Grounds 4 and 5 were in effect incorporated into Ground 6. As the High Court recently pointed out in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 85 ALJR 195, by asserting manifest inadequacy the allegation is that the judge's orders were unreasonable or plainly unjust: see [58]. In these circumstances intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that the appellate court must have considered that in all the circumstances there was some misapplication of principle even though where or how is not apparent from the statement of reasons: see Hili supra at [59]; Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58]; Dinsdale v The Queen supra at [58]. 

50It is in that context that the appeal falls to be considered. 

Ground 1 - The sentences imposed failed to reflect the objective gravity of the respondents' crime 

51As Howie J pointed out in Mirza v R [2007] NSWCCA 248 at [16] the level of objective seriousness of a particular offence is a matter on which minds might differ. It is an assessment which is classically within the role of the sentencing judge. In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 Spigelman CJ stated the position as follows (at [37]): 

""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour."" 

In that case Spigelman CJ found that the characterisation adopted by the sentencing judge was open, although he expressed hesitation in so finding. 

52In the same case, Simpson J set out the position as follows (at [46]): 

""The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance."" 

53This is particularly so in the case of an offence of this nature which can occur in a very wide variety of different circumstances. That is not to say that appellate courts should not intervene once they have reached a concluded view that the sentencing judge was in error in his or her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. However, the approach in Mulato supra, emphasises the need for caution in reaching such a view and the importance of paying due regard to the opinion of the sentencing judge. 

54The Crown in its submissions stated that the sentences failed to mark the seriousness of the offence. It described the offence as a grave example of an offence committed in company particularly having regard to the simultaneous acts of digital/vaginal penetration and fellatio engaged in by KB and JL respectively. It submitted that his Honour failed to refer to this. Further, it is submitted that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the vulnerability of KS due to her gross intoxication as an aggravating factor. It submitted that the fact that KS was aged 12 years was trivialised in favour of the mitigation constituted by each respondent's mistaken belief as to her age. 

55Orally the Crown submitted that the Court should not proceed on the basis that KS consented to the sexual acts, but said that even if she had the offences were serious because of what senior counsel for the Crown described as the degrading circumstances in which the offence occurred, the simultaneous acts and her age. The only additional degrading circumstance identified was that the offences took place in the open. 

56It seems to me that it is relatively clear that the sentencing judge proceeded on the basis that KS consented to the sexual acts in question. That that is so appears from the following remarks he made at the sentencing hearing (at p 7): 

""I accept that the offenders did not force their wishes on the victim. Indeed the suggestion that the girls wanted to be with the offenders is borne out by the CCTV footage. Whilst consent is not a defence, the fact that conduct may be consensual can, in certain circumstances, affect the criminality of the offender."" 

Counsel for the Crown conceded that he could not challenge that finding. 

57It is in that context that the other matters referred to by the Crown must be considered. The fact that the offence was in company does not seem to me to be a matter of grave significance in this case. Although there was participation in a common purpose the common purpose was to have consensual sexual activity with a person who the participants believed to be over 16. There is no suggestion of any threat or coercion arising out of the presence of more than one person at the relevant time: see R v Button; R v Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159; (2002) NSWLR 455 at [120]; Gore v R; Hunter v R [2010] NSWCCA 330 at [100]-[102]. 

58It is plain that the age of the victim is relevant to the question of objective seriousness. This is because the younger the victim the greater the likelihood of exploitation: R v T (1990) 47 A Crim R 29 at [30]; MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93 at [22]. However, even that proposition must be considered having regard to the circumstances of the individual case. In the present case the age of the child was not known to the respondents. The agreed facts record that KT said to the police that KS had told the respondents that she was 16 (see at [7] above) and the sentencing judge having reviewed the CCTV footage considered that it was fair to say that KS looked older than her age. 

59Further, any suggestion of aggravation as a result of intoxication must be treated with caution. The Crown abandoned the charge of sexual intercourse without consent in contravention of s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900. In that regard, s 61HA(2) defines consent as free and voluntary agreement to the sexual intercourse whilst s 61HA(3) and (6) so far as relevant provide as follows: 

""(3) Knowledge about consent 

A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse if: 

... 

(b) the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or 

(c) the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse. 

For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case: 

... 

(e) not including any self-induced intoxication of the person. 

... 

(6) The grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse include: 

(a) if the person has sexual intercourse while substantially intoxicated by alcohol or any drug, ..."" 

60In these circumstances the sentencing judge was not entitled to rely on intoxication as an aggravating factor vitiating consent as such a finding would render the respondents liable to a more serious charge than that to which they had pleaded: see R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 392. The trial judge in his sentencing remarks proceeded on the basis that the probabilities were that the victim was heavily intoxicated. 

61The other circumstances of aggravation suggested by the Crown were the fact that the sexual acts took place simultaneously and that they were in the open. Again, these matters have to be weighed against the issue of consent. 

62In these circumstances the conclusion of the trial judge that the objective seriousness of the case was at the lower end of the spectrum was one which in my opinion, albeit with some hesitation, he was entitled to reach. Although minds might differ it cannot be said that in reaching this conclusion he erred in law. 

63Thus far I have dealt with the position of the three respondents together. RJB was in a different position to KB and JL as there was no evidence that he engaged in any sexual activity. The sentencing judge described his role as being there to give comfort to the others and noted that from the facts it was almost impossible to work out what he was observed to be doing. His Honour, in my view, was justified in reaching the conclusion that his offence was at the lower end of the range. 

64For these reasons, in my opinion, Ground 1 of the notice of appeal is not made out. 

Ground 2: Failure to give weight to the principle of general deterrence 

65There is no doubt the sentencing judge was required to have regard to general deterrence in sentencing the respondents. That is well established: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476: R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 597-598; R v Tak Fat Wong [1999] NSWCCA 420; (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 at [127]; Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 3A. The issue is whether or not his Honour erred in law by failing to have regard to this principle. 

66I have referred earlier (at [46]) to what the sentencing judge said on the question of general deterrence. 

67Although what his Honour meant in this passage with respect is by no means clear, it does not seem to me that he was ignoring the question of general deterrence but rather expressing the view that because of the particular circumstances of the case in question he did not regard it as a factor to which great weight should be given. The failure to give it adequate weight may in particular circumstances lead to a conclusion that the resulting sentence was manifestly inadequate but failure to give it sufficient weight as distinct from not taking it into account, in my opinion, is not an error in the sense required by House v The King supra. 

68It follows, in my opinion, that this ground was not made out. 

Ground 3: Error in allowing a 25 percent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea 

69The sentencing judge did not specify precisely what discount he allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea. Whilst regrettable, that does not of itself constitute error: see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [80]-[93]. 

70However, it does seem to me that the sentencing judge did grant the respondents a discount of 25 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea, being the maximum discount suggested as appropriate by this Court in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [152]. That is implicit in the recognition by the trial judge of the fact the plea came immediately after the indictment was amended to include the count on which the guilty plea was accepted as well as the count for the more serious offence under s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 . In this context, his Honour expressed his views as follows: 

""As a matter of logic, fairness and justice it is difficult to see why a person should be penalised for not pleading to a more serious offence that has been charged, if the facts do not justify a plea to that offence. If the prosecution charges as a higher level than is merited, I fail to see why an offender should suffer a practical penalty for declining to plead to an offence for which he or she is in fact not guilty. Where they then plead immediately to a lesser offence, they are in my view entitled to the benefits that follow."" 

In referring to benefits, his Honour presumably was referring to a full utilitarian discount. 

71The Crown argued that the approach of the sentencing judge was contrary to the decision in R v Thomson & Houlton supra as explained in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 in that it was not appropriate to grant a utilitarian discount of 25 percent when the pleas were only entered immediately before the commencement of the trial. 

72In his judgment in R v Thomson & Houlton supra Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated that one of the circumstances which would generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case was the time a plea was entered and that a plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian value than a plea entered at first listing in the District Court, which in turn has a greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial: see [154]. His Honour also stated that a discount at the top of the range should not be given, save in exceptional circumstances, after a matter has been set down for trial and that a discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, for example, on a day fixed for trial: see [155]. However, in his concluding remarks, Spigelman CJ emphasised that whilst the primary consideration was the timing of the plea, what was to be regarded as an early plea would vary according to the circumstances of the case and was a matter for determination by the sentencing judge: see [160] (iii). 

73In R v Borkowski supra the sentencing judge granted a discount of 25 percent for the utilitarian value of a plea to a charge of manslaughter when the plea was entered on arraignment and after a contested committal hearing. The explanation given was that one particular allegation by the Crown was disputed. Howie J pointed out that the respondent in that case could have pleaded guilty to manslaughter whilst denying the specific allegation (failure to stop at a red light). A similar option was not available to the respondents in this case up to the time the indictment was amended immediately prior to the trial. 

74In Borkowski supra Howie J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed stated what he described as the general practice as follows (at [31]): 

""As a matter of general practice, the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty should be awarded only to those accused persons who plead guilty in the Local Court and continue that plea of guilty in the District Court. There may be a valid reason in the exercise of discretion for awarding the maximum discount where the plea of guilty does not occur until the District Court but that would be exceptional and arise from the peculiar factual situation in a particular case."" 

75Howie J also set out (at [32]) what he described as general principles on this issue to be applied by sentencing courts. Of particular relevance are the following (citations omitted): 

""[32]1 The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount. 

... 

3 The utilitarian discount does not reflect any other consideration arising from the plea, such as saving witnesses from giving evidence but this is relevant to remorse ... nor is it affected by post-offending conduct. 

... 

8 Generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced. 

9 The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain; or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown; or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage, such as having matters put on a Form 1. 

10 An offer of a plea that is rejected by the Crown but is consistent with a jury verdict after trial can result in a discount even though there is no utilitarian value."" 

76In the present case the Crown submitted that the respondents had not previously indicated a willingness to plead guilty to a lesser offence at any time other than immediately prior to the commencement of the trial. Equally, there is nothing to suggest that the Crown demonstrated any willingness to accept such a plea at any earlier time. However, having regard to the principles laid down by this Court, particularly in Borkowski supra , it does not seem to me that it was open to the sentencing judge to hold that the circumstances in question constituted special circumstances justifying the grant of the full utilitarian discount. However, they did justify a significant discount. The Crown accepted that a discount of 15 percent would not be outside the appropriate range. I agree. Assuming in the case of KB and JL a total sentence of approximately 17 months (the 15 month suspended sentence together with the two months spent in custody before bail was granted) a variation in the discount from 25 percent to 15 percent would lead to an increase in the sentence of 2.6 months. In these circumstances, I would not interfere on this ground unless I was satisfied that the sentences otherwise were manifestly inadequate. 

77A court should exercise its residual discretion not to impose a substituted sentence where, if the court were to do so, the increase would be so slight as to constitute 'tinkering': Dinsdale v The Queen supra at [62]; R v Woodland [2007] NSWCCA 29 at [53]. To alter the sentence on the basis that the trial judge erred in granting a 25 percent rather than 15 percent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea would, in my view, constitute an increase in the sentence so slight as to constitute tinkering. 

Grounds 4, 5 and 6: Manifest inadequacy 

78Much of what I have said in relation to Ground 1 is relevant on these grounds. Once it is accepted that his Honour was entitled to treat the offence as within the lower range of offences of this nature, it does not seem to me that the sentences were unreasonable or unjust or that they demonstrated some misapplication of principle not apparent from the statement of reasons. The nature of this type of offence is such as to admit of a wide variety of sentences, including on occasions, a suspended sentence: See R v McClymont, Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 17 December 1992; R v Agnew, Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 6 December 1990; R v Schwenke [2004] NSWCCA 289; R v Priestley, Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 3 June 1997; R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260; (2005) 154 A Crim R 268; R v NJK [2011] NSWCCA 151. Accepting the wide variety of circumstances in these cases they do, in my opinion, provide a yardstick lending some support to the conclusion that the sentences in the present case were not manifestly inadequate: cf Hili v The Queen supra at [54]. 

79The fact that the sentences of KB and JL were suspended does not, in my view, make them manifestly inadequate. I have already indicated why, in my opinion, the sentence imposed (effectively 17 months) was not manifestly inadequate having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and taking into account the need for general deterrence. For similar reasons, in my opinion, the decision to suspend the sentence in the present case does not lead to the conclusion that the trial judge adopted a course which failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the manifest purpose of punishment taking into account the subjective circumstances to which I have referred above: See R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17; R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; (2006) 160 A Crim R 510. 

80So far as RJB is concerned his limited involvement in the offences and the circumstances surrounding it place his offence plainly at the lower end of the range of seriousness and does not, in my view, lead to the conclusion that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 

81It follows that Ground 4 is not made out. 

82In these circumstances the only error made by the trial judge was his approach to assessing the utilitarian value of the plea. As I indicated this on its own would not cause me to review the sentences imposed. Although there was prima facie error in sentencing the Court retains a discretion under s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to varying the sentence. As I indicated I do not think that the sentences were manifestly inadequate, nor do I think the error which in fact occurred is such to justify an increase of the sentences in the present case. 

83On the hearing of the appeal affidavits of KB, his mother and a person with whom he has a relationship were read. They disclose that since the time of sentencing KB has lived with his parents in his family home, has regular employment and has entered into a stable relationship. At the direction of the Parole and Probation Service he has had regular contact with a psychologist and has complied with the directions of the Service. 

84Affidavits from JL and each of his parents were read on the hearing of the appeal. These show that JL is also in a stable relationship, has completed his TAFE course and has sought the assistance of drug and alcohol counselling and psychologists engaged with the Probation and Parole Service and has complied with the direction of that Service. Each of JL and his parents deposed to his remorse and the anxiety which he has suffered pending the finalisation of these proceedings. 

85The factors which I have referred to above are all facts relevant to the exercise of discretion, particularly on the issue of personal deterrence: see R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 77 NSWLR 7 at [52]; R v Carroll [2010] NSWCCA 55; (2010) 77 NSWLR 46 at [66]. These factors would have caused me to exercise my discretion against varying the sentence even if I had come to the view that it was manifestly inadequate. Having regard to the provisions of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 any question of double jeopardy is excluded from consideration on these issues. 

86So far as RJB is concerned for the reasons I have given particularly his limited role, I would not vary his sentence. 

87In these circumstances I join in the orders of the appeal being dismissed. 

88BUDDIN J: For the reasons given by Bathurst CJ, I joined in the order dismissing the appeal. 

89HARRISON J: I joined the order dismissing the appeal for the reasons outlined above by Bathurst CJ.

		02 September 2011",2011-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757761,R v Perish; R v Lawton; R v Perish [2011] NSWSC 1111,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: On 15 August 2011, I indicated that I would provide further reasons for the matters of evidence arising from the Crown's application under s 38 Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine Witness E on the ERISP. I will now do so. 

2On 12 August 2011, Witness E was called by the Crown as a witness in the trial. During Witness E 's evidence in chief, Mr Crown, in the absence of the jury, made an application under s 38 Evidence Act to cross-examine Witness E . Ms Davenport SC , for Anthony Perish , initially objected to leave being granted, as did Mr Hanley SC for Matthew Lawton. Mr Terracini SC , for Andrew Perish , told me that he had nothing to add. 

3Mr Crown indicated that he proposed to cross-examine Witness E on the contents of an ERISP conducted between Witness E and police and upon the evidence given by Witness E during committal proceedings. 

4Mr Crown was asked to identify those parts of the ERISP and of the evidence given in the committal proceedings that would be the proposed subject of cross-examination if leave was granted and the application was adjourned to 15 August 2011. On that day, Mr Crown informed the court that he was content to rely on the ERISP to cross-examine Witness E and, following discussions with counsel for the accused, the ERISP had been edited and there was agreement between counsel as to the contents of the ERISP save for a few discrete matters which were then enunciated by Ms Davenport and Mr Hanley. Mr O'Sullivan for Andrew Perish did not raise any matters of objection. 

5The discrete matters raised by Ms Davenport were, after argument, excluded from the ERISP with the exception of Witness E 's representations to the police that Anthony Perish had a gun in his hand (ERISP T12 and T13) and that Matthew Lawton put on a gun before he got in the car (ERISP T12). All of the objections raised by Mr Hanley succeeded and were excluded from the ERISP. The ERISP was subsequently edited in accordance with my rulings. 

6Although there was broad based agreement between Mr Crown and counsel for the accused that Witness E was to be cross-examined on the edited ERISP, it was necessary for the court to determine for itself that leave should be granted. Relevant considerations impacting upon a grant of leave are to be found in a combination of sections under the Evidence Act , namely s 38 (6), s 59, s 60, s 135, s 136, s 137 and s 192: R v GAC (Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 April 1997, unreported), Lee v The Queen [1998] HCA 60, (1998) 195 CLR 594. 

7Section 38 of the Evidence Act is as follows: 

""38 Unfavourable witnesses 

(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: 
(a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or 
(b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or 
(c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. 
(2) Questioning a witness under this section is taken to be cross-examination for the purposes of this Act (other than section 39). 
(3) The party questioning the witness under this section may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness's credibility. 
Note. The rules about admissibility of evidence relevant only to credibility are set out in Part 3.7. 
(4) Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs. 
(5) If the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness is to be as the court directs. 
(6) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction under this section, it is to take into account: 
(a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave, and 
(b) the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party. 
(7) A party is subject to the same liability to be cross-examined under this section as any other witness if: 
(a) a proceeding is being conducted in the name of the party by or on behalf of an insurer or other person, and 
(b) the party is a witness in the proceeding. 

8Mr Crown was informed that I proposed to grant leave to enable Witness E to be cross-examined on the ERISP after he had given evidence in chief of the events that occurred during the journey to Girvan and at Girvan. Before venturing further I should make it plain that I was satisfied that: 
(i) The evidence given by Witness E was unfavourable to the Crown: s38(1) Evidence Act . 
(ii) Witness E had made a prior inconsistent statement: s 38(1)(b) Evidence Act . He had made statements inconsistent with his evidence in chief both in the ERISP and during the committal hearing. 

9Evidence had been given by Dr Haghighi on a voir dire conducted on 5 July 2001. Witness E had been diagnosed with bowel cancer and had undergone bowel surgery on 21 April 2011. On 1 July 2011 , he had a liver re-section for liver cancer that was secondary to the bowel cancer. Dr Haghighi said the surgery was uncomplicated and his patient was doing well. He expected that his patient would almost be back to normal activities within 3 to 4 weeks. 

10During cross-examination on a voir dire conducted on 11 August 2011, Witness E testified that he had been serving his sentence in isolation for about a year. He did think that his memory had suffered somewhat since recent events but he could not isolate that to the surgery he had had. His isolation had affected his psychological well-being and memory. Witness E recounted that without talking to anybody there was a lack of stimulus. He said he had started a course but Corrective Services had made it difficult for him to have computer access. He did have library access. He said that until he got to the MSU he did not have any educational support. 

11Dr Etties gave evidence that Witness E is not currently under any medication and is not taking painkillers. Witness E 's medical records were tendered on the voir dire. 

12Notwithstanding Witness E 's evidence that recent events and isolated custody had adversely impacted upon his memory, his refusal to see Mr Crown, his evident antagonism towards the Crown in court and contrived responses led me to conclude that he was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence about the events leading to the abduction of Terrence Falconer, the abduction itself and what occurred when Mr Falconer was taken to Turramurra. All of these are matters of which he may reasonably have been supposed to have knowledge. All three of the triggers under s 38(1) Evidence Act have been satisfied. 

13In granting leave I took into account, amongst other considerations, the following matters under s 192 Evidence Act : 

(i)the grant of leave was not likely to add unduly to the length of the hearing: s 192(2)(a) Evidence Act , and; 

(ii)there is some unfairness to Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton arising from the grant of leave. Witness E 's answers in the ERISP are not given under oath and are hearsay. Further difficulties may arise from Witness E 's asserted lack of recollection. Any unfairness to the accused may, however, be overcome by strict directions to the jury as to Witness E 's answers in the ERISP and his oral testimony in the trial: s 192(2)(b) Evidence Act , and; 

(iii)Witness E 's account in the ERISP of his dealings prior to the kidnapping with Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton, the kidnapping of Mr Falconer, Mr Falconer's arrival at North Turramurra, the events at North Turramurra, the journey to Girvan and the events at Girvan are of fundamental importance to the Crown case in respect of the charge of murder and the charge of conspiracy to murder: s 192(2)(c) Evidence A ct , and; 

(iv)the proceedings concern charges of murder and conspiracy to murder: s 192 (2)(d) Evidence Act , and; 

(v)the court intended to direct the jury about the grant of leave under s 38 Evidence Act and to provide further directions concerning Witness E 's answers in the ERISP and his oral testimony in the trial: s 192(2)(e) Evidence Act . The court has subsequently done so. 

14Specific consideration to those provisions of the Evidence Act , referred to in paragraph [6] above , was given when ruling upon the discrete matters raised by Ms Davenport and Mr Hanley. As I have said, the objections were successful with the exception of that part of the ERISP referred to in paragraph [5] above. I did not uphold Ms Davenport's objection to that part of the ERISP. Although there are representations made by Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton in this material , the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to either Anthony Perish or Matthew Lawton: s 137 Evidence Act . 

15Witness E 's accounts in the ERISP of what occurred at North Turramurra, on the journey to Girvan and at Girvan have substantial probative value. The possession of firearms by the accused and the representations made to Witness E have substantial probative value as the evidence could rationally explain why Witness E participated in the journey to Girvan and the dismemberment of the deceased's body. Any prejudice to the accused in my view could be eliminated by a direction under s 136 Evidence Act limiting the use that could be made of the representations made by the accused and further directions as to Witness E 's answers in the ERISP and his oral testimony in the trial. Those directions have subsequently been given.

		16 September 2011",2011-09-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757787,SEVASTOPOULOS v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 201,"Judgment  1TOBIAS AJA:  I agree with Hall J.  2JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hall J  3HALL J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace on 20 March 2008.  Particulars of the Offence  4The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to the indictable offence of supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited substance, namely cocaine, between 10 February 2005 and 14 March 2005, contrary to s.25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  That section provides:-  ""25   Supply of prohibited drugs  ...  (2)  A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence . ""  5Column 5 of Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act provides that a "" large commercial quantity "" in respect of the substance cocaine is one kilogram.  6The maximum penalty for the offence prescribed by that Act is life imprisonment.  The offence is also subject to a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  7The amount cocaine the subject of the charge supplied by the offender was 2.25 kilograms.  Particulars of Sentence  8The penalty for the contravention of s.25(2) is provided at s.33, which states:-  "" 33  Penalties for offences involving commercial quantities or cultivation for a commercial purpose  (1)   This section applies to the following offences:-  (a) an offence under section 23 (1A) or (2), 24 (2) or 25 (2) or (2A).  ...  (3)  Despite subsection (2), if the court is satisfied that the offence involved not less than the large commercial quantity of the prohibited plant or prohibited drug concerned, the penalty for the offence is:-  (a) except as provided by paragraph (b), a fine of 5,000 penalty units or imprisonment for life, or both...""  9A standard non-parole period of 15 years is prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  10The applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years.  The sentence commenced on 9 May 2005.  The applicant is eligible for release on 8 May 2014, with the balance of term expiring on 8 November 2017.  Remarks on sentence  11The sentencing judge noted that the charge of supply was founded on four individual supplies as described in the Statement of Facts.  12On 10 February 2005, ""Tom"" was instructed by one Hatfield to meet the applicant to discuss potential sales of cocaine imported in October 2004.  13On 17 February 2005, Tom met the offender and they again discussed the applicant's attempts to sell cocaine in October 2004.  The applicant on that occasion told Tom to tell Hatfield that he preferred the ""double-X"" because the quality was better.  14The sentencing judge noted that the supply of cocaine rested on four individual acts of supply, namely, on 24 February 2005 when 249.8 grams were supplied to Joe and Mario, 25 February 2005 when 500 grams were to be supplied to Billy, but who declined to proceed to buy it, on 28 February 2005 with the supply of one kilogram of cocaine to Elmir and on 14 March 2005 when 496 grams were sold to Elmir.  The total amount of cocaine to which the charge related was, as earlier stated, 2.25 kilograms.  15The sentencing judge observed (ROS 6):-  ""It is plain from the conversations and observations of the offender that his role was to arrange sales of large amounts of cocaine.  In relation to this offence, his principal supplier was Hatfield through the agency of Tom.  In the course of their conversations, the offender pressed Tom to ensure that Hatfield released cocaine of suitable quality, referred to complaints from purchasers about the standard of the cocaine supplied and negotiated prices based on the quality of the cocaine.  He received a commission on the sales he introduced.""  16In relation to the role of the applicant, the sentencing judge stated (ROS 7):-  ""... The conversations support a finding that far from being low level, the offender was engaged in broking significant quantities of cocaine.  On a number of occasions he indicated to Tom that he could move large amounts of cocaine provided that it was the same quality as the double-X.  That he was apparently paid a small amount of money by way of brokerage fee does not alter that finding.""  17Later in the remarks, the sentencing judge observed (ROS 7-8):-  ""... The conversations make it clear that the supplies which make up the offence were not an isolated lapse.  I find that the offender was well entrenched in the criminal enterprise to supply cocaine.  That finding and that of the offender's role are findings that I make beyond reasonable doubt on the facts available to me.""  18The sentencing judge observed that the offender, then aged 53 years, had previous convictions for drug offences.  In 1976 he had been convicted of selling a prohibited drug (Indian hemp) for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  He was again convicted of selling drugs in December 1996 and was sentenced, after appeal, to a fixed term of imprisonment of approximately six months.  In the years 1976, 2004 and 2005 he was convicted of possessing a drug.  19The sentencing judge observed (ROS 8):-  ""The offender has thus been convicted of crimes of a similar nature to that for which he is to be sentenced.  This heightens the need for a sentence which will speak strongly to specific deterrence.  His convictions mean that he will not be afforded the leniency usually expected to be given to a person of no or insignificant criminal history.  His criminal history demonstrates an attitude of continuing disobedience to the law.""  20The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing and, accordingly, the source of background information on the offender came from a pre-sentence report and other documents tendered at the hearing as well as from his ex-partner who gave evidence.  21The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had told the author of the pre-sentence report that he had become involved in the sale of cocaine to supply his drug habit and that his role was one of bringing buyer and seller together for a ""modest fee"" .  22The report of John Jacmon, clinical psychologist, was tendered in evidence.  The report records expressions of remorse by the offender.  Mr Jacmon, based upon the history given to him, said the offender had suffered from depression and anxiety and that he probably suffered from those conditions at the time of the offence, and that these probably arose from his drug use.  He also believed the offender had a substance abuse disorder.  He considered these two factors would operate to impair his cognitive function and his judgment.  23In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, her Honour considered, along with the amount and purity of the drug, the applicant's claimed addiction to cocaine (at pp.15-19), although she did not consider that the applicant was afflicted by the addiction to the point where his actions were impulsive and impaired.  She noted, at p.18, that "" the offender's conduct was planned and calculated "".  24In accepting the submission of the Crown on this point, it was noted that (ROS 23):-  ""... the offender had a far greater role and involvement in the movement of cocaine than any of those to whom I have referred and his offending was neither isolated nor could it be referred to as an error of judgment . ""  25In terms of subjective factors, the remarks on sentence reveal that her Honour took into account the efforts the applicant had made whilst in custody his undertaking drug and alcohol and counselling courses (ROS 12-13).  26Her Honour considered that the applicant should receive a discount for the plea of guilty of 15%.  It was noted that although substantial utilitarian benefit was obtained through the plea, in particular, obviating the need to cross-examine an informer who was pivotal to the Crown's case, it nonetheless remained the fact that the applicant had not entered the plea until quite late in the day, namely, subsequent to the committal proceedings and an unsuccessful Supreme Court challenge in respect of controlled operation certificates.  The applicant entered the plea of guilty on 2 July 2007 on the reading of the indictment.  27It had been submitted to her Honour that clemency ought be given on the grounds of the applicant's ill health at the time of sentence.  However, the evidence of such ill health was, in the sentencing judge's assessment, insufficient to impose undue privations upon the applicant.  28A finding of ""special circumstances"" was made due to the applicant's age and drug addiction (ROS 23).  29In relation to the submissions made with respect to the other members of the syndicate who were later charged with similar offences, her Honour stated (ROS 23):-  ""I find that there are significant differences between the offender and the others who have been sentenced particularly in relation to criminal history, character and subjective circumstances.  I do not regard the objective criminality of the offender to be on par with other offenders nor do I consider him necessarily to be on par with Elmir [the co-offender], whose role while significant, was not as extensive as this offender . ""  30The sentencing judge took into account the fact that the offender had a previous criminal record, which included offences for the supply of prohibited substances.  That fact, in conjunction with the matters referred to above, did not, in her Honour's opinion, warrant leniency in sentencing.  The sentencing judge considered that the sentence ought bring to account the need for deterrence (ROS 8).  Facts  31The statement of facts details the somewhat lengthy police investigation into the activities of the applicant, and the syndicate in which he operated.  32It is not necessary for the purposes of the present appeal to detail here the entire factual history of the operations.  The applicant's written submissions accepted that the charge to which the applicant entered a guilty plea consists of four separate transactions, namely, that the applicant:-  ""(i) on 24.2.2005 facilitated a supply by a police informer ('Tom') of 250 grams [of] cocaine to two men ('Joe' and 'Mario') for $40,000 and the applicant received $1,000 for brokering the sale;  (ii) on 25.2.2005 facilitated an offer to supply by 'Tom' [an amount] of 500 grams of cocaine to 'Billy' (the sale did not proceed);  (iii) on 28.2.2005 facilitated a supply by 'Tom' of 1 kilogram of cocaine to Elmir for $160,000 and the applicant received $3,000 for brokering the sale;  (iv) on 14.3.2005 facilitated a supply by Jabbour of 500 grams of cocaine to Elmir.""  33In respect of transactions (i)-(iii) above, evidence was obtained by way of listening devices on the informer ""Tom"" .  The transaction, (iv) above, involved dramatic circumstances.  After leaving the premises of Jabbour, the applicant and Elmir presumably saw an unmarked police vehicle directly behind them, which activated a blue rotating light and siren.  Rather than stop, Elmir, the driver of the vehicle, accelerated away from the scene.  The police lost sight of that vehicle.  34Intercepted telephone conversations between the applicant, Elmir and Jabbour revealed that the applicant had disposed of the parcel of cocaine at a location just off Bexley Road.  Jabbour attended the location, but could not find the parcel.  Later, the police who attended the scene found a parcel of cocaine which contained 496 grams of the drug at 85% purity.  35It was established that in many of the transactions the applicant acted as an intermediary, or a ""go-between"" in the sense that his role was to find potential buyers for the cocaine and facilitate their sale.  He often picked up the drug from one location, and attended at the sale of the drug.  In that sense, he was involved at both ends of the transactions.  36On sentence, a detailed statement of facts dated 18 October 2007 was tendered on behalf of the Crown which, inter alia, set out the details of the controlled operation conducted by the NSW Crime Commission which was investigating the activities of a Sydney based syndicate in respect of the importation, possession and supply of cocaine, and associated money laundering activity.  37The investigation was initiated by information received in December 2004 from a registered source referred to as ""Tom"" .  The information related to the distribution of imported cocaine by Hatfield.  Tom had told investigators that, between July 2004 and December 2004, he had supplied 200 kilograms of cocaine at Hatfield's direction and to customers of Hatfield.  38""Tom"" told investigators that he had met the applicant through Hatfield in August 2004.  39""Tom"" met the applicant on 10 February, 17 to 19 February, 21 to 22 February and on 25 February 2005 and a number of recorded telephone conversations occurred in that period.  Copies of transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations on specified dates were attached and marked ""F"" to the Statement of Facts.  40The applicant was arrested on 9 May 2005.  Grounds of Appeal  41The Grounds of Appeal to this Court, set out in the Notice dated 8 December 2010, were as follows:-  ""(a) The sentencing judge erred in concluding that the objective seriousness of the offence was in the middle of the range.  (b) The sentencing judge erred in the proportion between the non-parole period and the overall sentence.  (c) The applicant has a legitimate grievance arising from disparity of sentence.""  42In the Applicant's Reply submissions, it was stated that the second of these grounds (paragraph (b) above) was no longer pressed.  Ground 1:  That the sentencing judge erred in concluding that the objective seriousness of the offence was in the middle of the range  43The applicant contended that the offence ought not be considered in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for three primary reasons:-  (1) That the amount actually involved, being 2.25 kilograms, was towards the lower end of the range of large commercial quantities.  (2) That the applicant's role was as a broker, and he had no managerial function.  (3) That the applicant received a relatively small amount of remuneration, being $4,000 for all four transactions, or $1,000 on each occasion.  44It was contended for the applicant that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account that each transaction involved an amount of cocaine at, or less than, the amount giving rise to a large commercial quantity, notwithstanding that the total amount exceeded that threshold.  Indeed, in respect of the total amount, it only marginally exceeded the threshold in the sense that it was towards the lower end of the range of a large commercial quantity.  45The applicant further contended that his role as a broker could not justify a finding of being middle of the range of objective seriousness, particularly when taken in light of the fact that his monetary reward was ""minimal"" .  In Tyler v R;  R v Chalmers (2007) 173 A Crim R 458 at 471 per Simpson J, her Honour noted that:-  ""Those low in the hierarchy, such as couriers, are usually to be sentenced less harshly, because, although they are of fundamental importance in the execution of the object of the conspiracy - in a drug importation conspiracy, without couriers, no drug could or would be imported - they have no managerial or decision making function;  and, experience shows, usually derive the least monetary reward.""  46The applicant also submitted that his motivation, which was to feed his own addiction is not to be counted as an aggravating factor: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [86].  47The Crown, in reply, submitted that little turned on the submissions for the applicant as to the quantities of the cocaine.  Reliance was placed upon a recent decision of this Court in R v Sinkovich [2011] NSWCCA 90 at [58] as to the fact that the quantity of drug is not determinative of objective criminality.  Hoeben J observed:-  ""Another problem with the submission is that the differentiating feature between an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity and supplying a commercial quantity, is the quantity of the drug involved.  The individual circumstances of the latter offence may nevertheless cause it to be characterised as a more serious offence by comparison.  The quantity of drug involved is not necessarily determinative of the level of criminality.  The observation of the plurality in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25, (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [33] forcefully makes this point:-  '33  A serious fallacy in his Honour's reasoning is that it assumes that any case involving more than 250 grams of heroin is likely to be a worse case than any case involving only 250 grams or less.  That cannot be so in the virtually absolute terms in which his Honour puts it.  Little imagination is required to envisage a case involving a relatively small quantity of heroin, as being of very great seriousness, for example, supply to create an addiction in an infant. ...'""  48The Crown noted that there is no upper limit to a large commercial quantity and on that basis it is idle to compare what is or is not large for a large commercial quantity.  Similarly, it was submitted that the remuneration the application received, whilst small in percentage, was nevertheless large in terms of the task undertaken, namely, brokering the sale of the drug.  49With respect to the applicant's reliance on Tyler (supra), the Crown suggested that her Honour's reasons are not to be taken as applicable to the plethora of cases of drug importation and distribution that reach the courts, but rather are to be considered in the context of the facts of the individual case.  50In this case, the Crown contended, no linear hierarchy exists.  Indeed, the organisation, as it were, was one of ""flat"" control.  There was no "" manager "" that would fulfil the criterion to which Simpson J referred in Tyler (supra).  Furthermore, the Crown relied upon a number of factors that it contended pointed to the applicant having the ability to exercise some form of control over the brokerage and indeed having an assertive role to play in the organisation of the deals.  51In her remarks, her Honour noted that the applicant was not a ""low level cog"" (ROS 6-8) and, as noted above, she accepted that he had a greater role to play than some of the other accused involved in the syndicate (ROS 23).  52Finally, the Crown noted that her Honour took into account the applicant's previous convictions in determining sentence, which justified a finding that leniency ought not be given.  53Mr S Odgers SC on behalf the applicant submitted in his written reply that even if it is correct to say that there were no managers of the syndicate in the sense referred to in Tyler (supra), one can "" observe that the applicant had no managerial role when comparing him with a hypothetical abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness "" (Applicant's Reply at [2]).  Mr Odgers pointed to the fact that there was an "" absence of any managerial function ... financial contribution, the fact that he was to receive a payment rather than a share of the profits and the applicant's addiction to drugs "".  It was submitted that in light of the evidence on such matters, her Honour's findings that the offence fell into the middle of the range was unreasonable and erroneous.  54The applicant also contended in reply that her Honour should have found that he was entirely motivated to engage in the criminal activity in order to obtain drugs to feed his own addiction, and referred, in this respect, to a number of factors in support, such as:-  (1) The applicant being a significant user of cocaine over many years.  (2) The applicant having been gainfully employed before becoming addicted to cocaine.  (3) The applicant's ex partner's observation of him being under the influence of drugs.  (4) The fact that the applicant and his partner had been evicted from a number of residences and had their car repossessed, indicated that they had very limited funds.  (5) The applicant's motivation to avoid future drug use on release, bearing in mind his efforts to address his drug addiction and the observation of those who know him  (6) The finding of special circumstances because of the applicant's age and the fact and duration of his drug addiction.  55Mr Odgers observed that the applicant's previous criminal convictions had no place in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending conduct: Way (supra) at [92]; R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [24].  It was also submitted that the Crown's reliance on the fact of multiple transactions as being relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness was an error as it would constitute impermissible double counting: Cicciarello v R [2009] NSWCCA 272 at [19].  Consideration  56The amount of a prohibited substance is, of course, a relevant fact in the consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence.  57However, other factors, of course, must also be identified and taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence: Sinkovich (supra).  The amount of the drug, the subject of the charge (2.25 kilograms), is clearly a very significant matter.  58The total amount of it was more than twice the amount necessary to warrant a charge of supply a large commercial quantity.  As there is no upper limit, or further bracket of supply, I do not consider it correct to say that the amount, along with other factors, could not support a finding of mid-range seriousness.  In particular, the Court was not provided with any examples that would suggest that 2.25 kilograms is not what could be considered a mid-range amount of cocaine.  59I will deal with the managerial and remuneration factors simultaneously.  The transcripts demonstrate that the applicant acted as a broker or salesman of the drugs in the sense that he would actively seek out clients and bring them to the table.  He was not a courier.  He was not a ""mule"" .  I accept, as the Crown submitted, that he was a part of a flat hierarchy insofar as there was no indication that the applicant received orders or was directed by anyone.  He was an agent who took his cut, albeit a small one, at the end of the deal.  60The trial judge rejected the submission that the applicant was at a low level, and there is nothing that would suggest that her Honour was in error in doing so.  61As to the applicant's motivation, it is true that being part of such an enterprise is not an aggravating factor - but that does mean that it is an ameliorating factor either.  The factors raised on appeal that were said to render the offence towards the lower end of objective seriousness are, in my opinion, adequately accounted for by her Honour in her remarks on sentence and do not persuade me otherwise.  62This is not a case where, at least on the evidence, the applicant used the proceeds to pay business expenses or necessities.  Indeed, even if that had been the case, I do not see how that would result in a finding less than what her Honour considered.  63I would reject this ground of appeal.  Ground 2:  That the sentencing judge erred in the proportion between the non-parole period and the overall sentence.  64This ground, as indicated above, was not pressed.  Ground 3:  That the applicant has a legitimate grievance arising from disparity of sentence  65The applicant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to give effect to the principle of parity in sentencing the applicant in comparison with the sentencing of Pavan and Elmir, which gives rise, in the appellants submission, to a justifiable sense of grievance.  Reference was made in submissions to OM v R;  MH v R;  AA v R;  AS v R [2009] NSWCCA 267 at [27] and Lau v R [2010] NSWCCA 43 for the proposition that, all things being equal, a finding of special circumstances in relation to one offender and not another may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  66The submission in this regard, of course, relates to the amount of time reflected in the non-parole period.  The parity principle can apply where a finding is such that, all things being equal, the non-parole periods of some co-offenders are substantially different to that of another offender.  67The Crown contended that it could not be reasonably said that all things are equal between Pavan, Elmir and the applicant.  68It was accepted by the Crown that her Honour failed to differentiate the needs of the applicant and Elmir.  However, reliance was placed on the finding of a greater criminal culpability in respect of the applicant's offending.  In Lau (supra) at 15, McClellan CJ at CL stated:-  ""Because a finding of special circumstances reflects the personal characteristics of an offender, which will commonly differ between two co-offenders, disparity is unlikely to be found in relation to a finding of special circumstances in relation to one co-offender and not another.  However, Howie J accepted, as I do that there may be cases where all relevant facts and circumstances being equal, a finding of special circumstances in the case of one offender and not in the other may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. ""  69The applicant noted that in R v Pavan [2009] NSWDC 82, which involved the supply of three kilograms of cocaine in the course of three events, in which a similar role was played by Pavan, a finding of special circumstances was made and a lower non-parole period than that of the applicant was determined.  70The Crown relied upon the reasons of Berman DCJ in Pavan (supra) as to the finding of special circumstances as the basis for its submission that a comparison cannot be made.  71I would reject the applicant's ground of appeal in respect of parity.  I note the decision of Howie J in R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253 at [15] that a breach of the parity principle will not have occurred "" simply because different non-parole periods are specified for different co-offenders because of different findings as to the existence, or extent, of special circumstances "".  See also Lau (supra) at [15].  72With respect to Elmir, I note that there are a number of similarities between him and the applicant.  Both were part of the same organisation and both were found to have been engaged in long-term acts of offending of this type (Elmir ROS 20).  I note that her Honour determined that Elmir was "" lower than that of... the facilitator "" (Elmir ROS 20).  The sentencing judge noted (ROS 23):-  ""I do not regard the objective criminality of the offender to be on par with other offenders nor do I consider him necessarily to be on par with Elmir, whose role while significant, was not as extensive as the offender"" .  73Her Honour was entitled to make that finding and there is nothing before me that would suggest such a finding was in error.  Moreover, a substantially lesser amount of cocaine (1.5 kilograms) occurred in relation to the charge against Elmir.  74Her Honour did not specifically address in her remarks the sentence imposed on Pavan.  A number of factors should be noted concerning the sentence imposed on Pavan.  Pavan supplied a greater amount of the substance than the applicant: Pavan (supra) at [18].  Additionally, the sentence imposed resulted in Pavan's first time in custody.  A longer time served on parole can be said to have been appropriate in that case.  The applicant, on the other hand, had been convicted of both supply and possession offences dating back to 1976.  75It was also the case that the sentencing judge appeared to consider the remorse of Pavan genuine, particularly with respect to the effect that it had on his family: Pavan (supra) at [12].  That can be contrasted with her Honour's opinion of the remorse of the applicant, which she described as remorse "" for the position in which he now finds himself "" and "" his remorse and distress is for himself "" (ROS 14).  76As such, I am not of the opinion that the principle of parity is infringed by the lengthier non-parole period imposed upon the applicant than those applicable to the co-offenders.  77Although the description of the ground of appeal was confined to the issue of disparity of sentence, both in written and oral submissions on behalf of the applicant, complaint was made that, notwithstanding the finding of special circumstances, the consequential variation in their non-parole to parole period was very minor and did not reflect the basis upon which the finding of special circumstances had been made.  78That finding was based upon two matters.  The first was the offender's age (he is presently aged 56 years) and the second was the fact and duration of the applicant's addiction (ROS 23).  79There is no doubt on the evidence that the applicant had a long history of drug addiction which was extremely serious.  He had been admitted several times as a result of overdosing, at Royal North Shore Hospital in 2000, St Vincent's Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital in 2001.  A Hospital Admission Summary Sheet in relation to the applicant's admission on 31 October 1993 referred to an earlier cocaine overdose requiring acute care.  80In the evidence before the sentencing judge was a report from Ms Christine Bridekirk, Alcohol and Other Drugs Worker, Metropolitan Special Programmes Centre dated 28 February 2008.  The letter evidences the fact that the applicant had referred himself to the AOD Services in MSPC Area 1 on 1 November 2006 and that he had since had regular contact with those services and had completed a Relapse Prevention Programme on a one-to-one basis.  The letter stated that the applicant had shown a great interest in an assessing programme to treat his long-standing cocaine addiction and his desire to attend an intensive pre-release therapeutic programme.  81The ratio of the non-parole to the parole period (respectively 9 years and 12.5 years), was a ratio of 72%.  It was contended, as indicated above, that a special circumstances finding having been made, the ratio was erroneous.  82The basis for the finding of special circumstances was a combination of the applicant's age and his cocaine addiction.  Accordingly, the rehabilitation of the applicant was an objective to be achieved through the sentence that was to be imposed.  The contention for the applicant was that ratio of the non-parole period to the parole period would not assist in any material way in achieving that objective.  83It was submitted for the applicant:-  ""13. In the present case, there was a powerful case for a significant variation of the ratio between non-parole period and parole period in order to improve the prospects of the applicant remaining drug free and, as a result, avoiding further criminality.""  84Mr Odgers observed in his written submissions at [13] that the additional term was only extended by a period of 19.5 weeks, although a finding of special circumstances was made on the basis of the applicant's age and the fact and duration of his drug addiction.  Reference was made to other cases in which a slight reduction in the non-parole period despite a finding of special circumstances was held not to achieve the purpose of the special circumstances finding.  Amongst the cases referred to was R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225, in which the ratio of 70% (producing a reduction of the non-parole period of 3 months) was found to be inadequate and was changed on appeal to 61.5%.  85I have concluded that a non-parole period of 8.5 years which would result in a parole period of 4 years would strike the correct balance, having regard to the reasons behind the finding of special circumstances in this case.  In other words, a non-parole period of 8.5 years with an appropriately supervised parole period of 4 years would, in my opinion, achieve the correct balance in maximising the prospects of the applicant's rehabilitation, taking into account his long-standing drug addiction.  86I consider, in all the circumstances, that error has been established in the failure to give meaning and effect to the finding of special circumstances having regard to the somewhat unique facts of this case.  I observe that I do not consider that a reduction of the non-parole period by a period of 6 months (and the resultant increase in the parole period) to be an inconsequential adjustment to the sentence.  A period of 6 months directed towards the rehabilitation of an offender with the applicant's history is, at least, potentially a significant period towards achieving that objective.  Orders  87I propose the following orders:-  (1) Leave to appeal be granted.  (2) The appeal, in part, be upheld.  (3) That the applicant be re-sentenced to a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months commencing on 9 May 2005 and expiring on 8 November 2013 with an additional term of 4 years commencing on 9 November 2013 and expiring on 8 November 2017.  (4) Accordingly, the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 9 November 2013.

2757792,Potier v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 204,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : The applicant seeks bail pending determination of an appeal, presently pending in this Court, against his conviction for soliciting another person to murder his former de facto wife. The matter comes before the Court by way of an application to review the refusal of a request for bail, which was before RA Hulme J, on 8 October 2010, judgment being delivered on 18 October 2010: Potier v R [2010] NSWCCA 234. 

2The background to the proceedings may be dealt with briefly, as it was covered in the judgment referred to above and, even more recently, in a judgment delivered by this Court (differently constituted) on the morning of the hearing of this application: Regina v Potier [2011] NSWCCA 170. 

3In 1999, Mr Potier came to this country with his daughter, using a false passport or passports. He was arrested and placed in immigration detention as an unlawful non-citizen: Migration Act 1958 (Cth), s 189. Whilst being held in the Villawood Detention Centre in Sydney, according to the prosecution case, he took steps to arrange for the murder of his former de facto wife, then in Queensland with his daughter, and her new partner. In October 2001 he was convicted and later sentenced for two such offences. Before being sentenced, he was charged with a third similar offence. 

4An appeal against his conviction on the first two offences was dismissed by this Court on 17 February 2006: Potier v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 27 (McClellan CJ at CL, Hislop and Rothman JJ agreeing) (""the first conviction appeal""). Critical evidence against the applicant, set out in that judgment, involved a number of conversations by telephone to an acquaintance in Melbourne, Ms Conway. Evidence was given of nine such conversations. At his trial, the applicant contended that the tapes of the intercepted conversations were either false or had been altered. As explained in the first conviction appeal, there were problems in respect of the telephone call records: 

""35 There was an issue at the trial as to whether the recordings that were tendered were of phone calls that had actually been made. Apparently, telephone providers are able to provide what is referred to as 'web trace' of a particular telephone service, which provides details of phone calls made to and from a particular number. The web trace of Ms Conway's telephone service did not contain a record of some of the calls. 

36 This matter was addressed in evidence given by David Finlay, an officer of the Optus telephone company. His evidence indicated that, on occasions, the Optus trace may not be complete because it would not record calls from a Telstra service, that are forwarded through more than one exchange."" 

5The applicant submits that Mr Finlay answered more precisely that the web trace might have failed to identify calls for one of two reasons, the first being that they had been routed through a Telstra service, the second being that the calls were not made. Importantly, Mr Finlay's explanation apparently led the police to make inquiries of Telstra, but not until late in the trial. Thus, Acting Superintendent Laidlaw, the officer in charge of the case, wrote to Telstra seeking information and noting the urgency of the requirement, saying ""the defense [sic] likely to conclude their case tomorrow, Thursday, 11 th October 2001"". The primary judge noted that the document provided by Telstra was in fact dated 11 October 2001: at [12]. 

6The first conviction judgment stated at [49]: 

""I have already referred to the position in relation to Mr Finlay's evidence. With respect to the Telstra material, the Crown tendered evidence on the appeal, which indicates that the relevant material was included in the Crown brief, which was provided to the appellant's solicitors before the trial. Accordingly, any submission that the material is fresh evidence, which could now be of assistance to the appellant, must be rejected."" 

7That statement, the applicant suggested, demonstrated a misunderstanding of the facts. On that basis, he contended that an application for leave to appeal to the High Court should result in the judgment of this Court being set aside and the matter remitted to this Court for rehearing: cf Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218. 

8RA Hulme J considered that Burrell was distinguishable. Further, and importantly for present purposes, he explained the relevance of the challenge to the appeal against the first convictions (two offences) in respect of the second conviction (the third offence) in the following terms at [9]: 

""In the trial that occurred in the District Court in 2006 [the trial for the third offence] the Crown placed evidence before the jury of the applicant's conduct that brought about the convictions in 2001 and, indeed, placed evidence before the jury of the fact of those convictions. The evidence of his conduct in respect of the two counts of solicit to murder in May 2000 was relied upon by the Crown as tendency and coincidence evidence. With Mr Potier being vindicated in respect of the May 2000 offences, he will then argue that placing such evidence before the jury in his second trial in 2006 led to a miscarriage of justice."" 

9The other judgment handed down by the primary judge on 18 October 2010 dealt with two matters, one being an application for the attendance of a juror from his first trial, who had written a book about the trial, indicating that the absence of the Telstra records was a factor taken into account by the jury in assessing the prosecution case. The application to subpoena the juror, though on a somewhat different basis, had been rejected in R v Potier [2005] NSWCCA 336. The fresh application was rejected on the basis that it was the responsibility of the Court to make its own assessment of the evidence and the impact which the fresh evidence might have had on the trial: [2011] NSWCCA 170 at [28], referring to Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26; 160 CLR 392 and Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259. 

10The second matter involved a request to cross-examine an officer of police responsible for the adequacy of the Commissioner's compliance with a subpoena issued on 29 June 2008, at the request of the applicant. That application was also dismissed. There is, accordingly, no further material potentially available to the applicant in support of his challenge to the convictions and the 2006 determination of this Court on the appeal against the convictions for the first and second offences. 

Jurisdiction of Court 
11Before addressing the merits of the application, it is necessary to consider the power of this Court to grant bail and the basis on which it may have jurisdiction to review the determination of the primary judge. This was not an issue raised by the parties, but was raised by the Court with the parties at the hearing on 28 July 2011. Each party was given leave to make further submissions in respect of the jurisdictional issue. The Court proposed to determine it before addressing substantive issues. 

12The power of this Court to grant bail is to be found in s 30 of the Bail Act 1979 (NSW), which relevantly states: 

"" 30 Power of Court of Criminal Appeal to grant bail 

The Court of Criminal Appeal may grant bail in accordance with this Act to any person accused of an offence if, in connection with the offence: 

(a) an appeal is pending in the Court, 
... 
(e) an appeal from the Court is pending in the High Court."" 

13It is, of course, inapt to refer to the applicant as a ""person accused of an offence"", ignoring his present status as a convicted person. However, that language is defined to include a reference to a person convicted of an offence: s 4(2)(a). That expanded definition operates generally to references in the Bail Act . Accordingly, the power conferred on the Supreme Court to grant bail to any person accused of any offence includes the power to grant bail to a person who has already been convicted of an offence. 

14Section 4 of the Bail Act contains a number of definitions; relevantly for present purposes, the definitions of ""Court of Criminal Appeal"" and ""Supreme Court"" in each case are stated to include ""a Judge of that Court"". The definition is important in respect of the Court of Criminal Appeal because, absent that provision, there is no basis for concluding that a single judge of this Court has power to grant bail. Whether the definition was intended to impose on the intra-curial arrangements for the administration of the Court a new power, to be exercised by a single judge of the Court, may be doubted. In relation to the Supreme Court, there is specific provision for the organization of the Court in Divisions and for a single judge to constitute the Court for the dispatch of all business: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), ss 38-41. 

15In the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), there is provision for certain powers to be exercised by ""any judge of the court in the same manner as they may be exercised by the court"": s 22(1). That language is not readily accommodated within the statutory constitution of the Court, as provided by the Criminal Appeal Act , s 3: 

"" 3 Constitution of court 

(1) The Supreme Court shall for the purposes of this Act be the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the court shall be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct."" 

16There is authority for the proposition that the Court is not the Supreme Court and has no power except that conferred upon it by the Criminal Appeal Act : see R v Burns (1920) 20 NSWSR 351 at 358 (Gordon J, Pring J agreeing). That statement should, however, be understood in its context. The question there considered was whether, the proviso to s 6 of the Act having been held inapplicable, the Court could amend an indictment so as to cover the case actually made by the evidence adduced at the trial: p 359. The Court held that it had no such power under the Criminal Appeal Act . However, that statement cannot be read as precluding the conferral of powers by other statutes, if the Parliament thinks appropriate. There is no reason to read down the powers apparently conferred by the Bail Act on this Court; nor, that Act being a later statute dealing with a specific aspect of the criminal jurisdiction, should it be seen to be inconsistent with s 22 of the Criminal Appeal Act . No doubt the legislature could have amended s 22 to include the power of a single judge to grant bail, but a conferral of power under the Bail Act itself was equally effective: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Cassaniti [2006] NSWCCA 335; 204 FLR 152 at [12]-[13]; applied in Regina v JS (No 2) [2007] NSWCCA 309; 179 A Crim R 10 at [5] (Spigelman CJ, Mason P, McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden and Howie JJ agreeing). 

17In addition, as was explained in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Moradian; Saliba and Sparos [2010] NSWCCA 27, at [6], this Court constitutes ""the Supreme Court"" for the purposes of s 73(ii) of the Constitution: see Stewart v The King [1921] HCA 17; 29 CLR 234 at 240. Section 3 may also have consequences with respect to the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the Supreme Court and its judges who may from time to time, constitute this Court. However, as appears from the second limb of s 3(1), the Court is not ""constituted"" by any judge or judges of the Supreme Court unless and until the Chief Justice so directs. 

18The practice of the Chief Justice, at least in recent years, has been to constitute the Court by written direction for a specific period, usually being particular dates. As was explained in Cassaniti , unless a particular judge who granted (or refused) bail was a member of this Court as constituted on that day, he or she would not be sitting as this Court and therefore could not exercise the power conferred on the Court by s 30 of the Bail Act : at [14]. The Court further noted at [15]: 

""The practice of constituting the bail judge as a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal for the purpose of dealing with a bail application by an appellant is not known to this Court."" 

19In Cassaniti , the Court was content to assume that the single judge had been sitting as a judge in the Common Law Division. (Comments in Cassaniti in relation to the operation of ss 45 and 46 no longer apply, since those provisions were replaced and repealed, respectively, in 2008.) 

20The heading on the transcript of 8 October 2010 referred to the primary judge sitting in the Common Law Division. However, the judgments of the primary judge of 18 October 2010 were both intituled ""in the Court of Criminal Appeal"". Further, his Honour's other judgment of 18 October 2010 - Potier v R [2010] NSWCCA 231 - commenced at [1]: 

Mr Potier has made three applications that I heard on 8 October 2010. There are two applications that persons be required to attend and give evidence and in relation to those I was sitting as a single judge pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The third application was for bail, a matter I deal with in a separate judgment. 

21There is no issue in this Court as to the correctness of the statement with respect to the first two applications. In respect of the bail application, his Honour, correctly, did not suggest that he was determining the application pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Appeal Act . Accepting that a judge of this Court, sitting alone, can make a bail determination under the Bail Act, it does not follow that the primary judge sat as the Court of Criminal Appeal in considering the application for bail. To do so, he would have had to be constituted, contrary to the practice noted in Cassaniti , by a direction of the Chief Justice. This Court, having made appropriate inquiries of the Registrar, should take judicial notice of the fact that there was no direction of the Chief Justice constituting the primary judge as a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal, for the day in question. Accordingly, despite the manner in which the judgment in the proceedings was intituled, it was a judgment given by the primary judge sitting in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. There is no doubt that he had power to deal with the application for bail in that capacity. The form in which the judgment appeared probably reflected a belief that, because the substantive proceedings were the appeal or application for leave to appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the bail determination constituted an interlocutory judgment in those proceedings. That was not so: the bail application was a separate proceeding determined otherwise than in the course of the criminal appeal. 

22It should therefore be accepted that RA Hulme J, as a judge of the Supreme Court, was properly exercising power conferred by the Bail Act in determining the applicant's request for bail pending determination of his appeal. It is not in doubt that this Court has power to review ""any decision in relation to bail of the ... Supreme Court (however constituted)"": Bail Act , s 45(1)(b). Such a review may only be carried out by this Court constituted otherwise than by a judge sitting alone: s 45(3). Accordingly, the Court has power to entertain the application of Mr Potier. 

Further steps in proceedings 
23Because the hearing on 28 July 2011 was diverted into consideration of the jurisdiction of this Court to review the decision of the primary judge, the applicant did not have a proper opportunity to present, through counsel, his submissions on the merit of the application. Determination of the application must therefore await a further hearing. So that the matter may be dealt with efficiently on the next occasion, it is desirable to give directions as to how the matter will then proceed. 

(a) pre-conditions to grant of bail 
24First, it is desirable to indicate the parameters of the exercise. As the primary judge correctly noted, bail could not be granted, ""unless it is established that special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying the grant of bail"": Bail Act , s 30AA. 

25In R v Wilson (1994) 34 NSWLR 1, consideration was given to the circumstances which would warrant a grant of bail to a person convicted of a serious offence, pending determination of his appeal. Kirby P (with whom Sheller JA agreed) considered that something more than an arguable point was required, the applicant needing to establish that his appeal was ""most likely to succeed"" on the merits: p 6C-D. Hunt CJ at CL suggested an arguably higher test, namely ""an extraordinarily high prospect of success"" or a ground ""which is certain to succeed"": p 7E. Those remarks must, however, be read in context: they are directed to a case where reliance on the prospects of success is put forward as the relevant special or exceptional circumstance. Further, it is inappropriate to abandon the words of the statute (special or exceptional circumstances) in favour of some different test. 

26The importance of considering all aspects of the case in determining whether special and exceptional circumstances have been made out, is revealed in the judgment of Callinan J in Marotta v The Queen [1999] HCA 4; 73 ALJR 265 at [18]. That approach was followed by this Court in R v Velevski [2000] NSWCCA 445; 117 A Crim R 30 at [23]-[33] (Barr J, Spigelman CJ and RS Hulme J agreeing). 

27One factor which might give rise to a special or exceptional circumstance would be that, through no fault of the applicant, fresh evidence had become available towards the end of the non-parole period. In circumstances where an applicant was likely to get parole when first eligible, it may well be that prospects of success assessed at something less than a certainty may suffice. Thus, in Petroulias v R [2010] NSWCCA 95, Barr AJ (Hodgson JA and Rothman J agreeing) stated at [34]: 

""While I appreciate that the Court must look at the aggregate effect of all the matters relied on as constituting special or exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail, it is worth noting that, at least where the grounds of appeal are put forward as the only or the principal factor to demonstrate special or exceptional circumstances, an applicant has to show much more than that the grounds seem arguable. It was said in R v Wilson (1994) 34 NSWLR 1 that the applicant must appear 'most likely to succeed' (at 6)."" 

(b) the approach of the primary judge 
28Before the primary judge the applicant asserted that Burrell demonstrated he enjoyed a high prospect of success in the High Court. This reliance appears to misunderstand what was decided by the High Court in Burrell . The procedural background involved two judgments of this Court. The second sought to reopen the first, on the basis of acknowledged factual errors. The first decision was, however, confirmed by the second judgment. In the High Court, the second judgment was set aside on the basis that the Court had no power to reopen its earlier perfected judgment, applying Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; 60 CLR 431, and Elliott v The Queen [2007] HCA 51; 234 CLR 38 at [7]. The High Court made no assessment of the factual errors, simply noting that there being ""no dispute that the first orders were pronounced on an infirm factual foundation, those orders must also be set aside"": at [29]. 

29After referring to the error in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal and noting a possible explanation, which appeared to be inconsequential, the primary judge then stated at [14]: 

""Before any conclusion could be reached that Mr Potier's confidence in success on appeal is well founded, he would need to establish a high likelihood that a number of things would occur, including that (a) the High Court would grant an extension of time in which to apply for special leave to appeal after so much time has elapsed since delivery of the judgment of this Court; (b) it would regard the matter as being of sufficient significance that it would grant special leave to appeal; (c) that it would allow the appeal and remit the matter to this Court for rehearing; (d) that this Court would accept that the Telstra material had not been disclosed as Mr Potier contends and that it would treat it as 'fresh evidence'...; and (e) that this Court would conclude that there had been a miscarriage of justice."" 

30It was conceded in the course of argument before this Court that the applicant had made no application to the High Court in respect of the first conviction appeal: Tcpt 28/07/11, p 1(36). Accordingly, no question arises of any grant of bail pending determination of any proceedings in the High Court. Furthermore, even had he done so, the applicant would not require bail in respect of the convictions and sentences for the first and second offences. Following an appeal to this Court, the orders of the sentencing judge were varied to make the sentence on the second offence partly cumulative upon the sentence of the first offence. In the result, the later of the two non-parole periods expired on 7 August 2006; the full term of the sentence expired on 7 January 2009. Accordingly the applicant is not serving any sentence in respect of the first two offences. His custody relates solely to his conviction for the third offence. Any issue of bail arises only in respect of that offence. 

31It follows that, if the applicant seeks to pursue his bail application, he needs to identify the following matters: 

(1) the terms of the sentence which he is presently serving; 
(2) the pending proceeding in respect of which bail is sought ( Bail Act , s 30); 
(3) the relevant grounds of appeal; 
(4) the reasons for delay in having the pending proceedings determined; 
(5) the date when the pending proceedings are likely to be heard; 
(6) any other circumstances relied upon as ""special or exceptional"" for the purposes of s 30AA. 

32So that the matter may be dealt with expeditiously, and now that, as it appears, the applicant has access to a computer and to counsel: 

(1) the folder of materials should be amended to remove duplicated material and any material not relied upon (including letters of a procedural kind) and a single typed index identifying each document included; 

(2) the applicant should file and serve a single document containing written submissions prepared by counsel, not to exceed 15 pages in length and not adopting other documents by reference; 

(3) the respondent should file and serve submissions in reply, not to exceed 15 pages in length and not adopting other documents by reference; 

(4) the matter will be listed before the Registrar for directions at 9am on 22 September, 2011. The directions shall include a timetable for the preceding steps. 

33SIMPSON J : I have read in draft the judgments of Basten JA and Garling J. 

34In my opinion, the jurisdictional issue in this matter can be determined by no more than reference to the application filed by the applicant, dated 18 September 2010, for bail. It is a handwritten document, apparently prepared by the applicant himself. It is on a pro forma that is designed for use in various applications, that is headed: 

""APPLICATION FOR REVIEW OF BAIL DETERMINATIONS"" 

35In the applicant's application, the words ""review of"" and ""determinations"" are struck out, leaving the words "" Application for Bail "". The pro forma contains provision for identification of the court in which the application is made. In that space, the applicant has written the word ""Supreme"". Below that, he has completed a space provided for identification of his next court appearance as ""Court of Criminal Appeal"" on 23 September 2010. The latter insertion indicates (as would be expected from the applicant's history) that he was familiar with the distinction between the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Supreme Court. He made his application in the Supreme Court. 

36That is supported by his application for review of the bail determination of R A Hulme J. There, he asserted that he had been last refused bail by: 

""Supreme Court, Common Law Division"" 

37The judgment of R A Hulme J is entitled, and given a medium neutral citation number appropriate to, a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. It seems that his Honour was under the misapprehension that he was dealing with the application as a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal. That, no doubt, came about because the application was one of three dealt with by his Honour on the same day. In Potier v R [2010] NSWCCA 231, his Honour said: 

""Mr Potier has made three applications that I heard on 8 October 2010. There are two applications that persons be required to attend and give evidence and in relation to those I was sitting as a single judge pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The third application was for bail, a matter I deal with in a separate judgment."" 

38In his judgment on the bail application (entitled Potier v R [2010] NSWCCA 234) his Honour noted that the applicant had applied for bail in respect of a matter in which an appeal was pending in the Court of Criminal Appeal, and said that the power of the court to grant such an application is provided by s 30 of the Bail Act 1978. Section 30 confers jurisdiction on the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant bail in specified circumstances. 

39Notwithstanding that, there being no evidence that the application was transferred from the Supreme Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, I am satisfied that the reality is that his Honour was sitting as a judge of the Supreme Court. That leaves beyond doubt the jurisdiction of this Court to review the determination: Bail Act s 45(1)(b). 

40That being so, and being the common understanding of all members of this Bench, I expressly refrain from embarking on consideration of whether R A Hulme J was properly constituted as the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 3 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The question is simply irrelevant. Specifically with respect to para [21] of the draft judgment of Basten JA, I have not been party to any inquiries made of the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal concerning the constitution of the court on the days in question. Had I been invited to take part in any such inquiries, I would have declined. 

41I note, however, that s 3 provides that the ""Supreme Court shall for the purposes of this Act [ie the Criminal Appeal Act ] be the Court of Criminal Appeal"" (emphasis added), and ""be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct."" 

42On any view, the application made by the applicant was made to the Supreme Court under the Bail Act . It was not made ""for the purposes of the [ Criminal Appeal Act ]"". By s 4 of the Bail Act , the Court of Criminal Appeal includes a judge of that Court (ie the Court of Criminal Appeal); R A Hulme J is a judge of the Supreme Court; by s 3 of the Criminal Appeal Act he is a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

43Section 3(1) has been part of the Criminal Appeal Act from its introduction in 1912. It has not kept pace with subsequent amendments: for example s 22, which confers power on single judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise certain specified powers, (not including the grant of bail) but does not expressly require direction of the Chief Justice as to constitution of the court. Plainly, the requirement of s 3 that the court be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court does not apply to the exercise of powers under s 22; and it is at least debateable whether the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 30 of the Bail Act to grant bail is limited to the court constituted as prescribed by s 3. 

44Questions of the interaction of the Bail Act and the Criminal Appeal Act may arise for determination at some time. They do not call for consideration or determination in this case, and I expressly refrain from stating a view in relation thereto. Nor do I join in the observations contained in the judgment of Basten JA at [23] - [31]. In respect of the further pursuit of his application for review of the bail determination, the applicant should take such advice as is available to him. 

45Since no orders are proposed, it is sufficient simply that I express my agreement that there is no jurisdictional barrier to the further hearing of the application for review of the determination of R A Hulme J of 18 October 2010. 

46GARLING J : I agree with the conclusion of Basten JA that this Court is engaged on the hearing of a review under s 45(1)(b) of the Bail Act of a decision of the Supreme Court (R A Hulme J) to refuse a bail application made by Mr Potier. 

47I also agree that the directions proposed by Basten JA in [32] above ought to be made in order to facilitate the efficient conduct of the review by this Court. 

48However, I reach that conclusion by a different path, and therefore express my reasons separately. 

49The only extant sentence that Mr Potier is presently serving is that based upon a conviction after his trial for the third offence as the judgment of Basten JA clearly demonstrates. An appeal against conviction has been filed in this Court, and as well an application for leave to appeal against sentence. Those proceedings await hearing. 

50The judgment of R A Hulme J, from which this application for review has been made, is entitled as if his Honour was sitting, albeit as a single judge, in the Court of Criminal Appeal. A question has arisen as to whether that was so. The determination of the question is important because it goes to the power of this Court to engage in a review. 

51Ordinarily, a single judge of the Supreme Court determines all applications for bail: s 28 of the Bail Act . Where that occurs, a party aggrieved by the decision has a right to have the decision reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal: s 45(1)(b) of the Bail Act . 

52Thus the statute provides for both an original decision and an appellate review of that decision. 

53The Court of Criminal Appeal is empowered to grant bail in certain circumstances: s 30 of the Bail Act . 

54Where bail is granted (or refused) by the Court of Criminal Appeal, there is no provision for any review of that decision by the Court: ss 44 and 45 Bail Act . In this case, the Court of Criminal Appeal is exercising an original jurisdiction. 

55In the circumstances which exist in this case, whether the original bail application is being considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal or the Supreme Court, the effect of s 30AA of the Bail Act , is to limit a grant of bail to cases which depend on exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail. 

56The evidence and material placed before the Court demonstrate the following: 

(a)The original application for bail was filed by Mr Potier in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. 

(b)The written submissions filed by Mr Potier in support of his application for bail were also filed in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. The submissions sought "" the grant of Supreme Court Bail to the applicant "". 

(c)The written submissions filed by the Crown did not suggest that it thought that the application was being determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Its reliance on s 30AA of the Bail Act , which was a significant part of its opposition to the grant of bail, would be equally applicable to a grant of bail by either the Supreme Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

(d)The transcript of the proceedings records that R A Hulme J was sitting in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. 

(e)The transcript records that at the end of the submissions, R A Hulme J delivered an ex tempore judgment. The uncorrected transcript of that ex tempore judgment is not available, but there is no reason to think that it would record anything other than that the proceedings were being conducted in the Common Law Division. 

(f)The published judgment by R A Hulme J is entitled as being in the Court of Criminal Appeal. Although no party referred in the course of submissions to s 30 of the Bail Act , his Honour refers to it in [1] of his judgment as the source of his power to grant bail. Clearly s 28 of the Bail Act was, in the circumstances, also a sufficient source of power because Mr Potier was "" a person accused of an offence "" within the meaning of s 4(2)(a) and (c) of the Bail Act . 

(g)Neither party to this application has brought any evidence to demonstrate that R A Hulme J was, or was not, constituted as a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal for the purpose of sitting on 18 October 2010, nor whether any of the Court's internal administrative processes supported one conclusion or the other with respect to the Court in which his Honour was sitting. 

57In my opinion, if a party to any proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal such as this application seeks to challenge the validity of the appointment of a judge to the Court, or the constitution of the court, that party is obliged to do so, by placing evidence before the court. That evidence is then available to be challenged or contradicted, if appropriate, by any other party to the proceedings. A party is not entitled to expect, or else require, the Court itself to undertake factual investigations of this kind. 

58In this case, no evidence was filed by either party directed to this issue. Accordingly, the issue becomes one of resolution of what appears to be inconsistent documents relating the hearing before and judgment of R A Hulme J. Is the transcript (and uncorrected ex tempore judgment) correctly entitled or is the published judgment correctly entitled? 

59I am satisfied that what is likely to have occurred here is a clerical error. A slip has occurred in the title of the published judgment. It ought to have recorded that R A Hulme J was sitting in the Common Law Division. 

60The remark of R A Hulme J at [1] does not seem to me to stand in the way of this conclusion. That his Honour had power to hear and determine the application was not in doubt. The statement of power adds nothing to his judgment. As can be seen, either by application of s 9D of the Bail Act or else by the application of s 30AA of the Bail Act , the parties had to demonstrate exceptional circumstances to warrant a grant of bail. His Honour's approach to the bail application did not depend upon whether he was sitting in the Common Law Division or else the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

61When confronted with a choice of interpretation, as the Court is, between two apparently inconsistent documents, it is not unjust to the applicant to choose the alternative which allows, rather than denies, to him a right of review. It is, I am satisfied, in the interests of justice to interpret the documents in this way. 

62I conclude that the judgment of R A Hulme J on the application for bail by Mr Potier was delivered in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. Consequently, this Court has the power to review this decision by way of a review under s 45(1)(b) of the Bail Act .

2757793,Carroll v R [2011] NSWCCA 200,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agree with Harrison J. 


2BUDDIN J : I agree with Harrison J. 


3HARRISON J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on her by Freeman DCJ at the Sydney District Court on 25 June 2010. The applicant was found guilty following a trial with her co-accused Joshua Lowe at Coffs Harbour in April 2010 on one count of robbery in company. She was sentenced to a total term of 5 years imprisonment commencing on 16 April 2010 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months expiring on 15 July 2012 and a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months commencing on 16 July 2012 and expiring on 15 April 2015. 


4The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

Ground 1 : It was not open to his Honour to find that the offence fell somewhere ""higher up the scale"" than the guideline. 

Ground 2 : The applicant suffers a real sense of disquiet that her sentence was not more significantly lower than that of the co-offender. 

Ground 3 : His Honour failed to take into account the applicant's affectation by drugs and alcohol at the time of the offence. 

Ground 4 : His Honour erred in finding that the lack of harm to the victim was not a mitigating factor. 


Background 


5The indictment alleged that on 21 March 2009, whilst in the company of Joshua Lowe, the applicant and Mr Lowe robbed the victim of $300, some papers and a mobile phone. The victim had gone to the Coffs Harbour Hotel late on the evening of 20 March 2009 where he played the poker machines. He was not drinking. He won a jackpot of $1,000. The applicant approached the victim several times whilst he was playing the machines. The applicant worked as a prostitute and the victim had engaged her professionally several times in the past. The applicant was aware that the victim had won a large payout that evening. She offered him her services for the night but he declined. She gave the victim her phone number. 


6Later that evening the applicant rang the victim. They agreed that she would come to his premises. The applicant met Mr Lowe at the hotel as it was closing at about 2.00am. They did not know each other and fell into a conversation. They went more or less together to the vicinity of the victim's premises. The applicant rang the victim and told him that she was in the laneway outside his flat. She said she was nursing a sprained ankle. She was crying loudly and sought the victim's assistance to make it across the laneway into his building. The victim came down and crossed the lane to assist the applicant. In doing so he stooped down whereupon the applicant took a very strong hold of him across his shoulders. A male's arm was then suddenly clamped around his throat. The applicant said, ""Don't hurt him or kill him"". The male offender Mr Lowe relaxed his hold of the victim but pushed him to the ground. The applicant then took his wallet. One of them took the victim's phone. The applicant and Mr Lowe then ran away. 


7The learned sentencing judge found that whatever may have been the applicant's motive for saying the words that she said, they had the effect that Mr Lowe released his hold upon the victim. As the victim knew the applicant, he was able to give the police sufficient information for them to apprehend her. The applicant and Mr Lowe gave competing accounts of what occurred, both of which the jury rejected. 


Ground 1 


8In R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [161] - [165], this Court proposed the following guideline: 

""[161] In the cases now before this Court, the Crown has propounded a starting point for New South Wales of six years full term, in circumstances where there is a plea of guilty. 

[162] It appears from the cases that come to this Court, including the present proceedings, that there is a category of case which is sufficiently common for purposes of determining a guideline: 

(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history 

(ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury 

(iii) Limited degree of planning 

(iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof 

(v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver 

(vi) Small amount taken 

(vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 

[163] Whilst it is possible to determine a starting point in a case of this kind, i.e. a sentence of X years imprisonment, I do not believe that the Court should do so. Rather, I propose the Court should identify a narrow sentencing range within which this Court would expect sentences in such cases to fall. 

[164] There are two principal reasons why a sentencing range is appropriate for this offence: 

(i) The seven characteristics identified above do not represent the full range of factors relevant to the sentencing exercise. 

(ii) Many of the seven identified characteristics contain within themselves an inherent variability, eg different kinds of knives or weapons in (ii); extent of ""limited actual violence"" in (iv); degree of vulnerability in (v); amount in (vi). 

[165] In my opinion sentences for an offence of the character identified above should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. I have arrived at this figure after drawing on the collective knowledge of the other four members of the Court with respect to sentence ranges. I have also reviewed the sentences which this Court has imposed on occasions when it has intervened, including in Crown appeals where the principle of double jeopardy applies. The proposed range is broadly consistent with this body of prior decisions in this Court."" 


9In R v Murchie [1999] NSWCCA 424; (1999) 108 A Crim R 482 at [20], Simpson J commented as follows: 

""[20] The legislature has prescribed the same maximum penalty for robbery in company as it has prescribed for armed robbery. I consider that the guideline promulgated by this Court in relation to armed robbery offences is equally applicable to offences of robbery in company which can be seen as broadly equivalent. I would therefore proceed on the basis that the sentence promulgated in Henry in relation to offences of armed robbery provides equally a guideline in relation to offences of robbery in company. Of course, as was stressed in Henry and Jurisic 1998 45 NSWLR 209, a guideline sentence is precisely that and is not to be applied inflexibly."" 


10In R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [30], Sperling J also observed as follows: 

""[30] In Thomson and Houlton , it was made clear that the reference to a plea in Henry was to be taken as meaning a late plea. Thomson and Houlton propounded a discount of 10 to 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. The guideline range in Henry was accordingly to be taken as having allowed a discount of 10 per cent for a late plea. In the case of an early plea, a discount on the Henry range of up to 15 per cent was accordingly to be allowed."" 


11His Honour in the present case proceeded to list the Henry criteria, as they appeared to apply to the applicant, noting the following. The applicant was relatively young. She had a limited criminal history. There was limited planning involved in the offence. The offending conduct was relatively unsophisticated and opportunistic, as his Honour expressly acknowledged. The amount of money involved was relatively small. Finally, the victim was not appropriately described as vulnerable in the sense covered by the guideline. 


12His Honour then described the offence in the following terms: 

""This was, however, a robbery in company with actual violence and together with the absence of pleas of guilty provides ample basis in my view to determine that this crime should certainly not be treated less [ sic , ""more""] leniently than that in the guideline, indeed, it falls somewhat higher up the scale."" 


13The applicant took issue with this assessment. His Honour did not in terms provide any indication as to what influence or role a plea of guilty had in the Henry analysis. In this case the applicant was found guilty after a trial. However, given his Honour's findings that the applicant was relatively young, had a limited criminal history, that there was limited planning and a small amount of money involved, and that the victim was not relevantly vulnerable, the applicant contended that an assessment of the crime as ""somewhat higher up the scale"" simply could not stand. There was no weapon capable of killing or of inflicting serious injury. There was limited violence. 


14Her Honour Simpson J dealt with the issue of violence in Murchie at [19] in these terms: 

""[19] There are, as I have indicated, some of the features nominated in Henry which are not here present. The first is the existence of some kind of weapon, such as a knife or gun, in the commission of the offence. However, that fact is balanced in my opinion by the fact that this was an offence committed by four young men who, it can be seen from witness statements and from the photographs, behaved in a violent and very aggressive fashion. As I observed during the course of argument during the application, we have been able to see that the applicant is a large, well built and apparently fit and healthy young man and the photographs suggest that the same description can be applied to the co-offenders. 


15Counsel for the applicant sought to emphasise the difference between that case and the present, where the applicant insisted at the time of the offence that her co-offender not hurt or kill the victim when the co-offender took hold of him. His Honour dealt with this in his remarks on sentence as follows: 

""Counsel for [the applicant] seeks to derive considerable benefit from the fact his client had uttered this caution, ""Don't hurt him or kill him"". It is to her benefit but her remark is open to a number of interpretations. One is that she had not contemplated her co-offender taking hold of the victim. Another is that she was simply anxious to ensure that no more serious crime was committed. Counsel submits the first of those interpretations is to be preferred. The idea that the actions of Lowe came as a complete surprise to [her] seems to me to come dangerously close to traversing the jury's verdict. I would, in any event, be more impressed if her statement was unequivocally expressive of surprise, for example, ""Take your hands off him"", or ""Let him go"", or ""What are you doing?"" so as to indicate that what was being done was not part of the plan. I think the latter interpretation is the more likely, namely that the instruction was given partly out of self-interest rather than as indicating that the role being played by her co-offender was entirely unexpected, but whatever be her motivation the fact is that her direction had, from the victim's point of view, the desired effect and the pressure on his neck was loosened."" 


16In my opinion it is somewhat difficult to see how his Honour came to the view that the instant offence was somewhat more significant that the hypothetical offence contemplated by the Henry guideline. The only real departure from the clutch of factors called up for consideration is the issue of the plea of guilty. That is itself an interesting factor in this case for other reasons, inasmuch as the applicant was well known to the victim. Indeed, her relationship with him was instrumental in enticing him into the situation that became this offence. In those circumstances her ultimate identification and detection were a foregone conclusion. Precisely upon what basis the applicant sought to defend the charge before a jury is therefore something about which one can only speculate. 


17His Honour clearly decided that a starting point beyond and above the upper end of the contemplated Henry range of 5 years was appropriate. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that this was a finding that was not open to him. In support of that contention the applicant argued that a head sentence at the top of that range must mean that the learned sentencing judge failed to take account of other significant factors that should have indicated a somewhat lower head sentence. The most significant of those factors was assistance given by the applicant to the police in identifying her co-accused. To understand that submission it is instructive to examine the way that his Honour dealt with that issue. In his remarks on sentence he said this: 

""As to assistance, I refer to the judgment of the Court of criminal Appeal in Cartwright ...It seems to me that the principle enunciated in that decision may be regarded as a single edged blade. It cuts in favour of the offender so as to increase the discount provided for assistance, if that assistance was motivated by remorse and/or a genuine desire to assist the process of justice. If however, the provision of information is motivated by some less worthy cause such as revenge, or as in this case, a desire to exculpate herself at the expense of her co-offender, the principle does not cut so as to diminish the advantage gained as long as the information is accurate and truthful. It is the effectiveness of the assistance into which the Court is obliged to inquire. Here there can be no doubt that the information was effective. Absent the identification of her co-offender, Lowe would not have been arrested, would not have been charged and consequently would not have been convicted."" 


18Part of what passed between counsel for the applicant and the bench in the course of the oral argument in this Court is also instructive. It was as follows: 

"" O'NEIL : His Honour dealt with assistance at the foot of page 9 referring to Cartwright and concluded that even if the assistance or whatever basis for the assistance, it's the effectiveness of the assistance right at the foot of the line which this Court is obliged to enquire. Here there can be no doubt that the information was effective, absent the identification of her co offender, Lowe would not have been arrested, would not have been charged, and consequently would not have been convicted. That is assistance of some significance and that's a factor which must be taken into account external to the factors set out in the guideline. 

BATHURST CJ : It does not appear that the learned sentencing judge did take that into account. 

O'NEIL : He did take that into account but what that means, in my respectful submission, is if he ended up with a head sentence of five years which is at the top of the range of the guideline, then prior to getting to five years, notionally there must have been some greater figure because the [ sic ] had to incorporate the matters external to the guideline or additional to the guideline, the subjective factors including the assistance and including his Honour's assessment of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation as reasonable with a lot of help at about 9.25, so that notionally the approach in the way I am suggesting is his Honour's starting point was above five years and outside the guideline."" 


19The applicant argued that the Henry analysis, if properly applied in this case, could not have propelled the starting sentence higher than the term of 5 years, which his Honour imposed. In other words, 5 years was the outer limit because a comparison of this case with the guideline judgment indicated that the present case was at worst at the top of, but not beyond, that range. If that is correct, his Honour could not have given the applicant a discount for the assistance she provided, because the sentence would necessarily have been lower than the outer limit of the Henry guideline. The problem has been exacerbated by the fact that the size or extent of the discount for assistance has not been nominated. 


20It is difficult to think that a proper discount for the assistance given by the applicant in this case would not have been in the order of approximately 20 per cent. Having regard to its unambiguous utility, it is arguable that a higher figure may have been adopted. Applying that percentage to a starting point head sentence of 5 years necessarily produces a sentence of 4 years. 


21I consider that his Honour erred in finding that this case fell somewhere higher up the scale than the 4 to 5 year range referred to in Henry . The violence was in realistic terms fairly mild in the scale of violent robberies and assaults. No blows were inflicted, no weapons were used, no serious, enduring or significant injuries were sustained, the victim was not vulnerable, the amount of money involved was small in the overall scheme of things and the use of the term ""planning"" in the context of what occurred almost does injustice to the language. To my mind a better description of what occurred would be ill considered opportunism. There is some suggestion from the evidence that any so-called planning that may have been involved occurred at a time when the applicant was under the influence of, and affected by, drugs. Whatever motivated the offence was clearly not overridden, in the case of the applicant, by any rational fear of detection. 
 
22Allowing for the countervailing fact that the applicant took her chances before a jury, for whatever unexplained and possibly inexplicable reason, I would have thought, having regard to what was said in Henry , that 5 years represented the upper limit of any starting point for the head sentence in this case. I consider that an allowance or discount for assistance should have been applied to that starting point. I consider that his Honour was in error to impose the sentence that he imposed. It is at one level difficult to reconcile his Honour's view that the offence fell ""somewhat higher up the scale"" than that indicated by the Henry guideline on the one hand, and his Honour's later comment that he ""accept[ed] the Crown formulation that this offence [fell] within the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of this nature"" on the other hand. I remind myself that the Henry analysis emphasised ""a narrow sentencing range within which this Court would expect sentences in such cases to fall"". I consider that his Honour's sentence in this case was erroneously outside that range and that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. Something in the order of a head sentence of 4 years is in my view a proper starting point for the applicant's offending in all of the circumstances of this case. 


Ground 2 


23In my opinion there is no merit in this ground of appeal, except to the extent that the applicant's disquiet arises from the matters to which I have already referred. That is not germane to this ground of appeal. In other words, I do not consider that there is any basis flowing from the principles of parity upon which to conclude that a comparison between the applicant's sentence and the sentence imposed on Mr Lowe of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years could give rise to any justifiable sense of grievance. 


Ground 3 


24The applicant did not suggest that his Honour did not extensively refer to her drug and alcohol history or that drugs and alcohol affected her at the time of the commission of the offence. His Honour in fact specifically noted that at that time the applicant was ""apparently affected"" by amphetamines, Ritalin, possibly morphine and that she was certainly heavily affected by alcohol. 


25In the course of his remarks on sentence his Honour specifically referred to the fact that her mother had introduced the applicant to drugs. She then later became her mother's carer. Her life was surrounded by discord, violence and substance abuse. She commenced using cannabis and alcohol at the age of 13, amphetamines at 17, heroin at 20 and she has also used morphine and cocaine. The applicant has used prescribed methadone since 2004 but since then she has also been abusing other prescription drugs including Oxycontin, Valium, Serapax and Xanax. 


26The applicant's specific complaint is that his Honour did not discuss her history of drug and alcohol abuse or her affectation by drugs and alcohol at the time of this offence as a factor warranting consideration. I agree that his Honour does not in terms make reference to this fact. However, it seems to me to be implicit in his remarks about her drug and alcohol abuse that he assumed or operated upon the basis that the offence was committed in a desperately drug affected or intoxicated state. As I have already indicated, the certainty of detection would appear to be a strong indicator of that fact. 


27The applicant emphasised that the offence was so out of character with her prior criminal history that it could not reasonably be explained on any basis other than the overriding effects of substance and alcohol ingestion. Whilst I accept that as a matter of probability in this case, it does not to my mind translate into the identification of an error in the way in which his Honour sentenced the applicant. Her life was a tragic one and his Honour appears clearly to have recognised this. Whereas others may have taken a different view about the way in which or the extent to which that should have been factored into the production of a lesser sentence, I cannot detect error in his Honour's approach. 


Ground 4 


28His Honour said this about the offence and its effect upon the victim: 

""As to the impact on the victim there is little evidence apart from the fact that [he] was greatly discomforted in giving evidence and spoke of his shock and fear at the time he was robbed. I do not regard the absence of more evidence as indicat[ing] that the harm done to him was not substantial. It is not therefore a mitigating factor. There is, however, no basis on which I would be prepared to find that this was an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g)."" 

29His Honour also observed that the ""victim was shocked and sustained minor scrapes to his neck and leg"". The applicant submitted that the level and extent of harm suffered or sustained by the victim as a result of the offence was less than one would anticipate to be the normal consequence of such a crime and as such the lack of harm was a mitigating factor within the terms of s 21A(3)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as follows: 

"" (3) Mitigating factors The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 

(a) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial,..."" 


30In the applicant's view, the only evidence before his Honour suggested unambiguously that any injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused to the victim by the offence was not substantial. The applicant contended that it was not permissible in these circumstances for his Honour not to have given the applicant the benefit of a mitigating factor with statutory recognition in the absence of evidence indicating and establishing that something more substantial in the nature of injury and the like resulted from the crime. She submitted that such an approach was indicative of error. 


31The onus of establishing the existence of facts supporting the existence of a mitigating factor would in the normal course of events rest with the applicant on the balance of probabilities. At the heart of the present submission would appear to be a tacit recognition of the problem confronting someone in the applicant's position, faced with the prospect of having to establish through a potentially hostile witness (the victim) that any injury, loss or damage suffered by him or her of whatever kind was not substantial. Issues of access to sufficient material to establish the facts may be difficult, and questions of privilege may also arise. 


32In the present case his Honour expressed the view that the state of the evidence was such that he was not prepared to come to the view that the relevant injury was not substantial. His statement was on one view a comment upon the adequacy of the evidence upon which the applicant could rely, or to which she could point, to prove the true position. His Honour in effect found that the applicant had not proved that the injury to the victim was not substantial. It seems to me that his Honour was entitled to take that view and that he was not in error in doing so. Consistently with the view that his Honour would appear to have formed about the state of the evidence, he was also not prepared to conclude that the injury to the victim was such that it amounted to or established an aggravating factor. In other words, his Honour was not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to make a finding either way. I can detect no error in the way that his Honour approached the matter. 


Conclusions 


33For the reasons I have given in relation to Ground 1, I consider that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. Against the contingency that this Court were minded to resentence the applicant, a number of affidavits were read in her application. Some of the matters referred to in those affidavits include the following. 

34The applicant's sister is a police officer. The applicant was assaulted in prison on 20 June 2011 and has been in limited protective custody since that time. The applicant considers that there is a connection between the assault and her sister's occupation. Furthermore, on 6 July 2011 the applicant was moved from the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre to Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre. The applicant understands that this move was the result of her being placed in protective custody. This is now a significant distance from her family in Coffs Harbour. Her family includes her two children aged 8 and 6 years, one of whom has a medical condition involving enlarged lymph nodes in his neck. 

35The applicant has undertaken an impressive list of courses whilst in custody. Her certificates of achievement are in evidence. They include a Certificate III in Business (Medical Administration), Theory in Hygiene Operations, Fair Trading Skills program and several others. The applicant is now drug free and has sought regular psychological assistance from the Department. She appears to have developed considerable insight into her prior offending and her current predicament. 


Orders 

36I consider that the applicant should be re-sentenced. In lieu of the sentence imposed by his Honour a head sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months should be imposed. This has the effect of reducing the original head sentence of 5 years by 1 year and of reducing the non-parole period by 6 months. The applicant would become eligible for release on parole on 15 January 2012. 


37The formal orders I propose are as follows: 

1. Grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. 

2. Quash the sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ on 25 June 2010. 

3. In lieu of the sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months commencing on 16 April 2010 and expiring on 15 January 2012 and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 16 January 2012 and expiring on 15 April 2014. 

4. The first day upon which the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole is 15 January 2012.

2757794,WAMIR v R [2011] NSWDC 152,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Cen Wamir appeals against two sentences of imprisonment imposed upon him in the Local Court for offences which section 233A of the Migration Act insists are to be known as ""people smuggling"". 

2It is most unusual to find in an Act of Parliament an expression such as this: ""An offence against subsection (1) is to be known as the offence of people smuggling."" Now is not the time to speak at length about why it would be that parliament requires that the defence be described in that way beyond noting the highly unusual nature of such a provision. I can certainly say that when I look at the appropriate penalty for this offence I will not be influenced by that description; instead I will look at the nature of what the appellant did in determining the objective gravity of the offences. 

3What he did was , as the person in charge of a relatively small vessel, he brought two people to Australia who were not entitled to enter the country. Those people were introduced to the appellant in Indonesia. They clearly voluntarily went with the appellant on a relatively lengthy voyage from Indonesia to Australia. They were detected when the appellant approached a fishing vessel asking for assistance. Police were contacted, customs officers eventually found the vessel and the appellant was arrested. 

4The offences to which the appellant pleaded guilty are laid under s 233A of the Migration Act . It provides the maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. The jurisdictional limit of two years applies where the matter is dealt with summarily, as this matter was. I was told that there is an aggravated form of that offence where five or more people are brought into the country. Where that occurs the mandatory minimum non parole-period is three years imprisonment. 

5As there were two people brought into the country by this appellant, he of course is not charged under the aggravated form of the offence. 

6It is important to note the difference between a jurisdictional limit and a maximum penalty. The Court of Criminal Appeal explained the difference in a decision called R v Doan (2000 ) 50 NSWLR 115. It is not the case, to put matters bluntly, that the jurisdictional limit is imposed only for a case in the worst category of offending. What a sentencing judge or magistrate does is to look at the offence and all the relevant features of the offender, determine the appropriate penalty using the maximum ten years as a guide, and if the result of that assessment is that a penalty of two years or more is appropriate, the jurisdictional limit of two years is the sentence imposed. 

7Of course, in determining the appropriate penalty the sentencer must bear in mind all the purposes of sentencing including general deterrence and specific deterrence. In this case it is important that others who may be tempted to offend in the way the offender has, are made aware that if they are detected committing similar offences they will serve a significant time in custody by way of punishment. The offender, himself, must also be deterred; that is particularly relevant in this case because the offender has prior convictions involving the use of a vessel in Australian waters. I must take into account also that the offender is serving his sentence in a foreign country. Not too much can be made of this, of course, because it was the offender's decision to come to Australia but I do take into account that his time in custody is harder than would otherwise be the case. Material before me suggests that the offender is a poor Indonesian fisherman who attempted to make some money using his vessel in a different and, of course, illegal way. 

8The magistrate imposed a sentence of eighteen months with a non-parole period of thirteen months, two weeks. The reasoning appears to be that a 25 per cent discount for willingness to facilitate the course of justice was allowed, reducing the penalty from the jurisdictional limit of two years to eighteen months and then a 75 per cent ratio was chosen as the ratio to be applied between non-parole period and head sentence. If that is the reasoning which led to the eighteen months head sentence being imposed then it may be inconsistent with Doan , and I will have a bit more to say about the choice of the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence later. 

9As far as the head sentence is concerned I consider that it is appropriate. A significant period of imprisonment is required to fulfil the various purposes of sentencing. It is also appropriate that the sentences be served concurrently. That brings me to the selection of the non-parole period and here I need to go into a bit of history. 

10Before amendments to State legislation, in particularly, the Probation and Parole Act in the late 1980s, it was common place for the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence to be in the order of 40 per cent. Changes to the Probation and Parole Act later reproduced in the Sentencing Act which in turn were reproduced in the current legislation, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  introduced the idea of what is known as the ""three-quarter rule"", that is, absent special circumstances the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence should be 75 per cent. Of course this was all State legislation. For Commonwealth offences, authorities from the Court of Criminal Appeal said that ordinarily the ratio between non-parole period and head sentence should be somewhere between 60 and 66 per cent. But the High Court has recently in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 held that those authorities are no longer good law. 

11So given that the Court of Criminal Appeal authorities do not apply and given that the three-quarter rule under State law does not apply, how do I select the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence? I am not unguided in this respect. High Court decisions such as Bugmy v R [1990] HCA 18;(1990) 169 CLR 525 , Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 and Hili and Jones tell me what I should do: A non-parole period is the minimum period that the offender should serve in custody. But I do take into account that in determining that period it was the common approach of judges before the rules changed in the late 1980s to impose a non-parole period of about 40 per cent of the head sentence. The combined wisdom of judicial officers suggested that non-parole periods of about that ratio would ordinarily be the minimum that an offender should serve before being released on parole. 

12Having considered the specific circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that a non-parole period of much less than 75 per cent is appropriate. Indeed, were it necessary I would be prepared to say that a non-parole period of less than half the head sentence would be appropriate, but it is not necessary for me to decide precisely the appropriate ratio given that the offender has served today exactly ten months in custody. I am satisfied that that is the longest non-parole period that would be appropriate. If he had served nine months or less in custody I would probably make a similar order to that which I am about to make. 

13The appeal is allowed. On each matter the head sentence of eighteen months be served concurrently to date from 7 November 2010 is confirmed but instead of the non-parole period ordered by the magistrate, I impose a non-parole period of ten months which will therefore expire on 6 September 2011 which was yesterday.

		06 October 2011",2011-09-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757796,Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 205,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA : On 10 June 2010 the appellant was found guilty by a jury in the District Court of an offence under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) of dealing with money intended to become an instrument of crime, the value of the money being in excess of $50,000. On 3 November 2010 he was convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment for 2 years, 6 months to date from 25 October 2010. His Honour also fixed a non-parole period of 1 year, 6 months which is due to expire on 24 April 2012. In addition, the appellant was ordered to pay a fine of $25,000. 

2On 21 March 2011 an application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence was filed. By that stage he had served almost 5 months of the 18 month non-parole period. The notice contained six grounds of appeal against conviction. On the same date, 21 March 2011, written submissions were filed in support of the appeal, although neither the grounds nor the submissions adequately articulated the two bases upon which senior counsel for the appellant ran the appeal against conviction. Nevertheless, and quite properly in the circumstances, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions raised no objection to the first ground as then identified. 

3For reasons set out below, the first ground has been made good and the conviction must be set aside. The appellant is entitled to an acquittal. Accordingly, it is not necessary to address the second ground or the separate challenge to the sentence. 

Statutory scheme 
4On 11 May 2010 the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (""the Director"") laid a charge that the appellant ""[b]etween about 1 January 2003 and about 30 September 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, dealt with money that he intended would become an instrument of crime and at the time of the dealing the value of the money or property was $50,000 or more"". Such conduct was a contravention of s 400.5(1) of the Criminal Code . That section provides: 

"" 400.5 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc. - money or property worth $50,000 or more 

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 

(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
(b) either: 

(i) the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or 
(ii) the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 

(c) At the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $50,000 or more. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 15 years, or 900 penalty units, or both."" 

5Various parts of this provision involve defined terms. The charge in this case relied on paragraph (1)(b)(ii). Section 400.1(1) contains a definition of ""instrument of crime"": 

"" instrument of crime : money or other property is an instrument of crime if it used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)."" 

6Section 400.1(2) provides, for avoidance of doubt, that a reference to "" money or other property includes a reference to financial instruments, cards and other objects that represent money or can be exchanged for money, whether or not they have intrinsic value"". There is a further significant definition in s 400.2 (as in force at the time of the conduct the subject of the charge): 

"" 400.2 Meaning of dealing with money or other property 

(1) For the purposes of this Division a person deals with money or other property if: 

(a) the person does any of the following: 

(i) receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property; 
(ii) imports money or other property into, or exports money or other property from, Australia; 
(iii) engages in a banking transaction relating to money or other property; and 

(b) the money or other property is proceeds of crime, or could become an instrument of crime, in relation to an offence that is a Commonwealth indictable offence or a foreign indictable offence."" 

7Section 400.2(2) provided a further definition of dealing with money or other property, involving the same conduct as that set out in sub-s (1)(a) but including, in (b), ""by means of a communication using a postal, telegraphic or telephonic service within the meaning of paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution"": s 400.2(2)(b)(ii). (The curious reference to pl 51(xx) has been amended to refer to pl 51(v).) 

8Before considering the nature of the offence as presented to the jury, it is necessary to identify more precisely the manner in which the prosecution alleged that the money would become an instrument of crime. That was, primarily, by way of an offence against s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (""the FTR Act""), which provides: 

"" 31 Offence to conduct transactions so as to avoid reporting requirements 

(1) A person commits an offence against this section if: 

(a) the person is a party to 2 or more non-reportable cash transactions; and 
(b) having regard to: 

(i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following: 

( A) the value of the currency involved in each transaction; 
(B) the aggregated value of the transactions; 
(C) the period of time over which the transactions took place; 
(D) the interval of time between any of the transactions; 
(E) the locations at which the transactions took place; and 

(ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted; 

it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that: 

(iii) would not give rise to a significant cash transaction .... 

... 
(3) A person who commits an offence against this section is punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for not more than 5 years."" 

9The term ""cash transaction"" is defined to mean ""a transaction involving the physical transfer of currency from one person to another"": s 3(1), "" cash transaction "". The term ""significant cash transaction"" in par (b)(iii) is defined to mean ""a cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value"": s 3(1), "" significant cash transaction "". The principal object of the Act is defined as being ""to facilitate the administration and enforcement of taxation laws"": s 4(1). 

10Read by itself, s 400.5 appears to require a single ""time of the dealing"", at which time the value of the money can be identified. However, s 400.12 must be considered in this respect: 

"" 400.12 Combining several contraventions in a single charge 

(1) A single charge of an offence against a provision of this Division may be about 2 or more instances of the defendant engaging in conduct (at the same time or different times) that constitutes an offence against a provision of this Division. 

(2) If: 
(a) a single charge is about 2 or more such instances; and 
(b) the value of the money and other property dealt with is an element of the offence in question; 

that value is taken to be the sum of the values of the money and other property dealt with in respect of each of those instances."" 

Particulars of offence 
11There were no written particulars provided by the Director, but the case was opened in the following terms to the jury (Tcpt, 31/05/10, p 16): 

""You will hear evidence, this will be produced largely through documents, that there were between those 2 critical dates 1 January 2003 and 30 September 2004, 150 transactions whereby money was transferred overseas on behalf of the accused and that that 150 transactions came to a total of just over $1 million. 

Now I say that on behalf of the accused the Crown doesn't say that he personally went to the bank on each of these 150 occasions and presented cash amounts that could be transferred to overseas accounts. Rather the Crown case is that there were 150 occasions where this was done either by him or by other people on his behalf. 

Of those 150 transactions 142 of them were of an amount less than $10,000 and I will come back to the relevance of that figure of $10,000 later, it probably doesn't sound much of an amount but it is important and I will come back to that to explain why. 

The total of those 142 transactions came to just less than $1 million - $957,080. 

Now of those 142 transactions the Crown alleges ... that 13 of these were in fact carried out by the accused himself. In other words, there were 13 occasions on which he personally went to the bank and conducted this transaction leading to money being sent to an overseas account. 

... 

And those transactions in particular are the transactions that are the subject of the charge before you. 

Those 13 transactions where he himself went to the bank and remitted money in an amount of less $10,000 to go ... overseas."" 

12The Director did not suggest that the money constituted proceeds of crime. On the contrary, it was fully explained to the jury that the applicant ran an extensive business involving the sale of telephone cards allowing consumers to make cheap international telephone calls: Tcpt, p 15(1). In 2004, the business, which was conducted through two companies controlled by the applicant, failed, leaving the companies insolvent and certain telecommunication carriers as substantial unsecured creditors. 

13Adopting the language of ss 4 and 5 of the Criminal Code , counsel for the Director then explained the ""physical elements"" and ""fault elements"" of the offence. The first physical element was said to be that ""the accused dealt with money"": Tcpt, p 19(40). The prosecutor continued: ""The definition that deals with money provides that it includes engaging in a banking transaction relating to money or other property."" The prosecutor said: ""these remissions of money were made overseas and on 13 occasions ... the handwriting goes with the pieces of paper that accompanies those sendings of money overseas was that of the accused"": Tcpt, p 20(5). 

14The prosecutor then identified the ""fault element"", namely that ""at the time he dealt with the money ... [he] intended that that money would become an instrument of crime"": Tcpt, p 20(18)."" There was reference to the definition of the phrase ""instrument of crime"" and the opening proceeded (Tcpt, p 21): 

""It is enough that the Crown is able to satisfy beyond reasonable doubt that the money was intended by the accused to become an instrument of crime in the sense that it would be used in the commission of an offence. 

Whilst the prosecution do not need to prove that the accused intended that the money be used in the commission of one particular offence, they need only prove that he intended the money used in the commission of an offence. Obviously if the prosecution can point to a particular offence that the accused did intend to use the money in the commission of, that makes it more straightforward when considering whether or not it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that he held the necessary intention, which was an intention to use the money in the commission of an offence. 

The prosecution can and do intend to point to evidence that it is anticipated will be led here that goes to the commission or the intention to commit a particular offence by the accused, through the use of this money.... 

That particular offence ... is an offence against section 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act. ... 

... I should say in the alternative bearing in mind the prosecution need not prove that the accused intended that the money be used in the commission of a particular offence, in the alternative the prosecution says you would also be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended that the money be used in the commission of offences again[st] the revenue. In other words, offences related to the non-payment of tax. 

I will return to that later, but suffice it to say for now that the Crown does [not] need to say what exactly that offence might have been in terms of an offence against the revenue because it doesn't have to prove that the accused intended to commit by the use of that money a particular offence."" 

15Next, the prosecutor explained the offence created by s 31 of the FTR Act, colloquially referred to as a ""structuring offence"". The jury were told that the FTR Act required that banks report to the government cash transactions of $10,000 or more and that it was an offence for a person to break a transaction down into amounts of less than $10,000 to avoid the reporting requirements. The prosecutor then returned to the alternative basis and stated (Tcpt, pp 23-24): 

""As I have said before while the Crown need not prove that he intended that a particular offence be committed with the use of that money, the Crown says may include a taxation offence, such as for instance the intention to dishonestly cause a loss to the Commissioner of Taxation by the failure to declare income. The Crown does not say that is the particular offence that he intended to commit. That is just an example of the type of offence that might arise as an offence against the revenue. 

16Finally, the prosecution turned to a further physical element (Tcpt, p 25(11): 

""The second physical element, and again you will see quite clearly from the indictment, that at the time of the dealing the value of the money or property was $50,000 or more. That's a relatively straightforward matter of calculation. The Crown anticipates that you will hear evidence that those 13 transactions, if you add them all up you come to a sum in the amount of $81,030. In other words, an amount more than $50,000 which is the figure on the indictment."" 

Nature of offence as charged 
17The drafting of these provisions has a superficial simplicity which is belied by any attempt to apply them. As explained by Simpson J in Ansari v R [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89 at [15], in relation to the similarly structured s 400.3: 

""The distinguishing feature between the first and second offence in each pair is temporal: the first is an offence where an indictable offence has already been committed, yielding the money or property as proceeds; the second is an offence where an indictable offence is envisaged or contemplated in the future."" 

(a) offence in contemplation - FTR Act, s 31 
18Where the dealing is a single act, that is no doubt so; where there is a series of acts charged as a single offence the temporal dichotomy becomes difficult to identify. For example, in the present case, the first transaction relied upon, being for an amount of less than $10,000, would not have constituted an offence against s 31 of the FTR Act, because it involved only one non-reportable cash transaction. At that stage, it may have been appropriate to say that the applicant intended the money to become an instrument of crime, at some point in the future. However, there would not have been a contravention of s 400.5 at that stage because the dealing did not involve $50,000 or more. On the other hand, where a single charge is laid in respect of a number of instances of conduct, engaged in at different times, the value of the money is to be calculated, pursuant to s 400.12, at the time of the last transaction: before that, the sum of the values of the money cannot be known. Yet at no time was the money the subject of any particular transaction properly describable as proceeds of a crime committed in the past, because the crime had not been committed until that transaction was complete. 

19The key problem in this regard is that the dichotomy identified in Ansari is not readily applied in respect of multiple transactions engaged in over a period of time. Once it is accepted that these provisions, including s 400.5, speak of past offences and future offences respectively, it follows that they do not speak of current offences. The dichotomy is exhaustive because it flows from the language of the statute. 

20As the case was opened to the jury (as set out above) it would seem that, had the prosecution been required to particularise the acts constituting the dealing with money for the purposes of s 400.5 and the relevant transactions, for the purposes of s 31 of the FTR Act, the conduct would in each case have been the same. However, s 400.5 does not contemplate that the dealing with money, being the primary physical element of that offence, can itself be the physical element of the ""second tier of inchoate crime"", to use the language of Simpson J in Ansari at [24]. Referring to the offence under s 400.3 as a ""money laundering offence"", she noted that the ""money laundering offence is, for relevant purposes, committed where a second crime is in contemplation"". That case involved a conspiracy to commit a criminal act, her Honour explaining in that context that: 

""... where the criminal act alleged to be the subject of the agreement is money laundering, the Crown must also prove that the person accused has in contemplation a second crime. That is because money laundering is, by definition, committed where another crime is envisaged - and is not committed unless some other crime is in contemplation (or has been committed)"". 

21That analysis cannot apply where the money laundering offence and the second tier inchoate crime are one and the same. Despite s 400.12, it is not possible to read the operative provision, in this case s 400.5, as being engaged where there is only one physical element. The fact that the same physical element may give rise to separate crimes does not overcome the problem that s 400.5 requires contemplation of a future crime involving the same money. 

22Nor is this analysis undermined by the statement in the Criminal Code that a ""physical element ... may be"" a result of conduct, or a circumstance in which conduct or a result of conduct occurs: s 4.1(1). Although an offence may be inchoate until a number of steps have been taken, each step is nevertheless a physical element of the completed offence. At least, that approach is open and was the way this case was put to the jury. 

23The consequence of this reading of the section is that, as a matter of law, and accepting as proved all the facts relied upon by the prosecution, no offence was committed under s 400.5 in respect of any future offence, if the latter offence were identified by reference to the operation of s 31 of the FTR Act on the same transactions. 

(b) offence in contemplation - tax evasion 
24It follows that the conviction can be upheld only if there was some other second tier inchoate crime upon which the prosecution could and did rely. As noted above, the alternative basis was said to be some offence relating to the evasion of income tax. The prosecution in Ansari relied upon a similar alternative, described by Simpson J as use of the money ""in the commission of a tax evasion offence"": at [27]. That alternative was apparently included in the course of the trial: see [54] (Howie J). The sufficiency of a crime so identified was not, however, discussed in Ansari , either in this Court or in the High Court. 

25The prosecution asserted that it was entitled to rely upon an unparticularised crime as vaguely expressed as the evasion of tax, in part because such a course was permitted by s 400.13 of the Criminal Code . That section provides: 

"" 400.13 Proof of other offences is not required 
... 

(2) To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division an intention or risk that money or property will be an instrument of crime, to establish that: 

(a) an intention or risk that a particular offence will be committed in relation to the money or property; or 
(b) an intention or risk that a particular person will commit an offence in relation to the money or property."" 

26For present purposes, the reference to ""risk"" may be put to one side: that element would be relevant to the lesser offence under s 400.5(2). There is a fault element which the prosecution recognised as having to be proved beyond reasonable doubt for the purposes of s 400.5. In opening, the prosecutor stated, ""according to the legislation that creates this offence, intention is defined as where a person means money to become an instrument of crime"": Tcpt, p 20(27). He continued: 

""The phrase 'instrument of crime' is also defined. That might be less clear in terms of every day use but the definition in the legislation that creates this offence provides that money will be an instrument of crime if it is used in this commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth that may be dealt with as an indictable offence."" 

27Having been told so much, the jury needed to know what precisely the prosecution identified as the relevant indictable offence. So far as the jury was aware, the money was all the proceeds of business, being legitimate revenue acquired by the appellant's companies. The first transmission relied upon was dated 6 May 2003, in an amount of $5,000. All the remaining transactions took place, it appears, in the 2003-2004 tax year. The jury was told that the companies defaulted in payment of their creditors in early 2004. There was no evidence to support the view that any of the companies failed to disclose their income to the Commissioner in any particular year or years. Nor was there any evidence that the appellant himself had failed to disclose his true income to the Commissioner in any particular year or years. Nor were the jury told of the circumstances in which a failure to disclose income would constitute an offence, nor whether such an offence was necessarily an indictable offence. 

28As already noted, the jury were told that an amount of approximately $1 million had been transmitted to China by means of approximately 142 ""structured transactions"". Given the inability of the companies to pay their debts by early 2004, an inference may have been available that the appellant was attempting to remove assets from the jurisdiction so as to render the companies incapable of paying tax as assessed. Whether that conduct constituted ""tax evasion"", and if so if it were an indictable offence, was another matter not explained to the jury. 

29The treatment of the alternative intention in the prosecution's opening, stands in stark contrast to the care with which the nature of the structuring offences was explained to the jury. If the jury were to be permitted to rely upon the alternative basis, a similar course should have been undertaken. That is not to require more than the statute requires of the prosecution, reading s 400.13 with the relevant operative provision. First, the proper approach to questions of construction would not readily permit a person to be rendered liable to imprisonment for 15 years (or more, in relation to greater sums) by dealing with money with an intention that it will become an instrument of crime, without some conduct capable of constituting an indictable offence being relied upon. To this end, it is unnecessary to identify a particular offence, either in terms of timing or of individuals involved. So much is clear from s 400.13. On the other hand, an intention that the money will be used in the course of conduct constituting an indictable offence must be properly proved. 

30Had the alternative basis been squarely analysed before it was left to the jury, there is a real doubt as to whether it should have been so left. It is sufficient for present purposes to consider whether the matter was left with proper instructions and whether a conviction based on this ground (being the only ground available at law) would be an unreasonable verdict, or one that cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1), first limb. 

31It is necessary, therefore, to consider the way in which this issue was left to the jury. His Honour dealt first with the possible crime under the FTR Act: Summing up, 10/06/10, pp 13-15. He dealt with the second alternative more briefly, stating (pp 15-16): 

""Alternatively the Crown says another crime that can be identified in the conduct of the accused in the making of these overseas transfers was because of the intention to avoid the reporting requirements or avoid having to make a report, to adopt the language of the legislation, the accused's intention was to divert sums of money away from the attention of the Taxation Office in order to avoid payment of income tax for which the accused would have otherwise been liable. 

Now I am not going to burden you with a detailed exposition of the relevant provisions of the income tax legislation. You can accept that the deliberate hiding of or diversion of funds in a manner which removes them from the scrutiny of the Taxation Office is an offence against the relevant income tax legislation, and, therefore, again if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was an intention of the accused in the conduct of these overseas transfers, that would make out the intention ingredient of the offence. 

I have been at pains to emphasise that alternative because that was given far less attention, for very obvious reasons, in the evidence and in the address of both counsel. Much of their attention was directed at the first of those two, but it is important to keep in mind that the Crown has attempted to make a case on either or both, as the case may be."" 

32His Honour referred again (at p 19) to the evidence of large sums being transferred by way of remittances to Hong Kong as a basis for concluding ""that the intention behind the process was to avoid the reporting requirements of the Commonwealth legislation and therefore the intention to commit an offence, either under that legislation or against the Taxation Revenue Legislation of the Commonwealth"". The matter was addressed again at pp 31-33, in largely repetitive terms. His Honour returned to the question in reminding the jury of submissions made by counsel for the accused (pp 34-35): 

""Another point in this general context which was made by Mr Jamieson [for the accused] was that the ultimate collapse of the two telephone companies, Sun City and General Online, meant that by the end of the 2003/2004 financial year there was no tax issue that might have been in some way connected with the purpose of sending the money overseas in a way which escaped the reporting requirements. Because the companies were in liquidation there was, at that stage, no prospective tax implications to be pursued so that you might therefore think that it would difficult to infer, as the Crown invites you to infer, that when the money was sent overseas in the first place it certainly did not have any illegal intention with regard to income tax associated with it. 

I would however make the point that what Mr Jamieson had to say about that did direct your attention to what I will call the ultimate outcome of the story, which does not offer you a great deal of assistance when it comes to what you might conclude, by way of inference, the accused had in mind when all the money was being sent because certainly at that stage the companies were still operating, and the ultimate taxation implications were not known."" 

33This was an inadequate basis for leaving the alternative prospective criminality to the jury. 

34When the matter came before the trial judge for sentencing, his Honour referred to the alternative basis of conviction in the following terms (Judgment on sentence, 03/11/10, pp 7-8): 

""The alternative Crown case was that the other criminal intent was the evasion of and breach of relevant provisions of the income tax legislation which was evidenced by the ultimate return of a very substantial proportion of the funds transmitted overseas in toto for the purpose of the purchase of the family home. When that broader picture was examined it was the Crown case that the jury might also be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that a further criminal intent accompanying the pattern of transfers overseas was to divert moneys that would otherwise have been subject to income tax but had the ultimate intention of returning for the purpose of the purchase of the family home in Australia. That aspect of the Crown case was more open to doubt, I have to acknowledge, on the evidence than the first alternative and, as Mr Glissan [for the accused] submitted, the jury may well have reached its verdict of guilty without being persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that there was an intention based on that larger body of evidence to subvert the revenue laws of the Commonwealth. There was, for example, the temporal problem, and I am not here raising any matters that were not addressed comprehensively in addresses to the jury. There was what I will call the temporal aspect of the ultimate return of the money to Australia. At the time that the moneys were transferred overseas there was some evidence that their immediate purpose was to establish a financial resource in China for the purpose of the expansion of the telephone card business into that country and that therefore the return of the money to Australia was only an aftermath of the collapse of the telephone card business as a result of which the moneys were no longer needed in China for that purpose. It hardly needs to be said - and I only use this by way of example - that if the jury's assessment of that evidence was to at least raise some reasonable doubt in their mind about the initial purpose of the transfer of the larger sums of money and therefore the absence of any necessary criminal intent at the relevant time that they would not have been persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused on that alternative basis. But in my own assessment of the evidence I certainly have no corresponding difficulty in accepting that the jury were persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of the association between the transfer of the sums of money specifically referred to in the indictment and an intended breach of s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act in that more direct and limited sense."" 

35His Honour proceeded to sentence on the basis that the anticipated criminal activity was the intention to breach s 31 of the FTR Act: Judgment, p 10. 

36There are available arguments as to the possible contemporaneous operation of money-laundering and structuring offences, as described by Simpson J. The conceptual framework is, however, complex, if not legally fraught. It raises questions which were not expressly analysed before the jury, nor indeed as to their legal availability, in this Court. They do not need to be addressed, because the case was not left to the jury in these terms. Had it been, the applicant would undoubtedly have had grounds to challenge such directions. The case must be disposed of on the basis of the way the Director particularised the charge and the way the trial judge left it to the jury. 

Conclusions 
37It is clear from a reading of the addresses by each party, together with the summing up, helpfully summarised by his Honour in the passage from the judgment on sentence extracted above, that the primary basis on which the matter was left to the jury was an intention that the money be an instrument of crime, being a contravention of s 31 of the FTR Act. Not only was that ground at the forefront of the case, but it was clearly made out. Because the primary basis upon which the matter was left to the jury was unavailable in law, the appeal should be upheld. As the relevant ground involves a question of law alone, leave is not required. 

38It is unlikely that the jury would also have been satisfied of the alternative, for which the relevant inferences were less readily capable of being drawn, which it did not need to address if the first alternative were accepted and which was treated in the prosecution case as a back-up position. In any event, the failure to particularise the nature of the offence, across a range of possibilities, would have rendered a conviction based on that alternative unsupported by the evidence. 

39The conclusion with respect to the operation of s 400.5 in relation to s 31 of the FTR Act arises because of the commonality between the conduct relied on for each offence. Given the range of possible ways in which conduct might constitute dealing in money, and in which one or more offences under s 31 of the FTR Act could be identified, the relevant offences could arguably be particularised in many different ways: Arora v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2011] NSWSC 552, at [18]-[20] and expanded upon by her Honour below. However, there is no reason to permit the Director to run a different case at a retrial. Accordingly, the conviction should be set aside and an order for acquittal substituted. 

40In these circumstances, it is not necessary to address an additional ground upon which the conviction was challenged, nor to address questions relating to the severity of the sentence. If the fine has been paid, the money must be reimbursed. 

41The Court should make the following orders: 

(1) Allow the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence entered on 3 November 2010. 

(2) In lieu thereof, acquit the appellant of the charge laid under s 400.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). 

(3) Direct that the appellant be reimbursed the amount of the fine, if paid. 

42SIMPSON J : I have read in draft the judgments of Basten JA and Garling J. I have come to a different conclusion in respect of the issue that has been determined, which was never articulated as a ground of appeal. My reasons are as follows. They depend substantially upon the construction of various provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth) (""the Code""). 

43The relevant parts of the Code commenced on 1 January 1997. Over the years, it has been progressively expanded by the enactment of additional provisions. Chapter 2, which commenced on 15 December 2001, is entitled ""General principles of criminal responsibility"". It brought with it radical new terminology for traditional concepts of the criminal law. What had formerly been known as the "" actus reus "" of crime was relabelled ""the physical element(s)"". What had formerly been known as "" mens rea "" or "" the mental element"" was relabelled as ""the fault element"". 

44Since 15 December 2001 these concepts have applied, not only to offences against the Code, but to all offences against laws of the Commonwealth (Code, s 2.2). 

45The physical element(s) of an offence may be: 

""(a) conduct; or 

(b) a result of conduct; or 

(c) a circumstance in which conduct, or a result of conduct occurs."" (s 4.1(1))"" 

""Conduct"" is expansively defined to mean: 

"" ... an act, an omission to perform an act or a state of affairs."" (s 4.1(2)) 

The fault elements for a particular physical element many be: 


intention; 
knowledge; 
recklessness; or 
negligence 

46The appellant pleaded not guilty to an indictment presented on behalf of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""the Director"") in the following terms: 

""For that he between about 1 January 2003 and about 30 September 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales dealt with money that he intended would become an instrument of crime and at the time of the dealing the value of the money or property was $50,000 or more."" 

Put very briefly, the Director alleged that, over the period specified in the indictment, the appellant, by himself or an agent, engaged in multiple transactions in which he deposited into bank accounts cash, in sums less than $10,000, for transfer overseas. 

47The charge in the indictment is an allegation of the offence shortly known as ""money-laundering"". Because the total value of the money with which the appellant was alleged to have dealt was $50,000 or more, the offence charged is one of the six created by s 400.5 (part of Div 400) of the Code, and one of 37 created by Div 400 of the Code, which is part of Ch 10 (entitled ""National Infrastructure""). Both Part 10.2 (of which Div 400 is part) and Div 400 are entitled ""money-laundering"". 

48In Ansari v R [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89, at [10] - [15] I analysed the structure of six of those offences, those created by s 400.3. (The thirty-seventh, created by s 400.9, is of a different kind, of receiving, possessing, concealing, or disposing of or importing into or exporting from Australia, money or property in circumstances in which it would be reasonable to suspect that it is the proceeds of crime. That offence is presently immaterial.) 

49The remaining offence-creating sections of Div 400, s 400.3, s 400.4, s 400.5, s 400.6, s 400.7 and s 400.8 are all concerned with offences of money-laundering of the same kind; they vary one from the other only in respect of the value of the money or property involved. They are precisely parallel to the offences created by s 400.3. Assuming that my analysis in Ansari was correct, it applies equally to s 400.5. 

50Within each of these offence-creating sections are six separate offences. Three are offences of dealing in money or property to the requisite value that is the proceeds of crime (ie crime already committed). Three are offences of dealing in money or property to the requisite value that is intended to, or as to which there is a risk that it will, become an instrument of crime (ie crime to be committed in future). Within each trio, the offences vary one from the other in respect of the mental state of the offender (ie the fault element) - in descending order of gravity, intention, recklessness, and negligence. 

51This is fully explained in [11] and [12] of Ansari , and does not need repetition. 

52For the purposes of this appeal, the relevant provisions of the Code are to be found in s 400.1, s 400.2, s 400.5, s 400.12 and s 400.13. They are as follows: 

"" 400.1 

... 

instrument of crime : money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence). 

400.2 Meaning of dealing with money or other property 

(1) For the purposes of this Division a person ""deals with money or other property"" if: 


(a) the person does any of the following: 

(i) receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property; 
(ii) imports money or other property into, or exports money or other property from, Australia; 
(iii) engages in a banking transaction relating to money or other property; and 


(b) the money or other property is proceeds of crime, or could become an instrument of crime, in relation to an offence that is a Commonwealth indictable offence; or a foreign indictable offence."" 

400.5 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc.-money or property worth $50,000 or more 

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 

(b) either: 

(i) the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or 

(ii) the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 

(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $50,000 or more. 

400.12 Combining several contraventions in a single charge 

(1) A single charge of an offence against a provision of this Division may be about 2 or more instances of the defendant engaging in conduct (at the same time or different times) that constitutes an offence against a provision of this Division. 

(2) If: 

(a) a single charge is about 2 or more such instances; and 

(b) the value of the money and other property dealt with is an element of the offence in question; 

that value is taken to be the sum of the values of the money and other property dealt with in respect of each of those instances. 

400.13 Proof of other offences is not required 

(1) ... 

(2) To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division an intention or risk that money or property will be an instrument of crime, to establish that: 

(a) an intention or risk that a particular offence will be committed in relation to the money or property; or 

(b) an intention or risk that a particular person will commit an offence in relation to the money or property."" 

(The definition of ""instrument of crime"" and s 400.2(1) are reproduced in the form in which they stood in 2003 and 2004, the period during which it was alleged that the appellant committed the offence. They were amended in 2010 and 2006 respectively to take their present form. The variations are immaterial to this appeal.) 

53The appellant was not charged with an offence involving the proceeds of crime. There was no suggestion that the money with which he dealt was otherwise than legitimately obtained through a business that he conducted. The offence with which he was charged was that identified in s 400.5(1)(b)(ii). It was an offence containing the following elements: 


that the appellant dealt with money; 
that the appellant intended that the money would become an instrument of crime; 
that, at the time of the dealing, the value of the money was $50,000 or more. 

54Since the prosecution allegation was that the ""dealing"" was constituted by multiple instances of the appellant engaging in the conduct alleged, by s 400.12(2), the value of the money was taken to be, not the amount involved in any individual transaction, but the total of the money involved in the various transactions upon which the Director relied. 

55It is now necessary to identify the manner in which the Director opted to put his case. As can be seen from the definition of ""deals with money ..."" in s 400.2, dealing with money can be constituted by a number of forms of conduct. They include receiving, possessing, concealing and disposing of money (s 400.2(1)(a)(i)); importing or exporting money (s 400.2(1)(a)(ii)); and engaging in a banking transaction relating to money (s 400.2(1)(a)(iii)); the legislative references being references to the provisions as in force at the date of the offences. These are the available physical elements of an offence of money-laundering. 

56In his opening to the jury, the Crown prosecutor unequivocally elected to particularise as the physical element of the offence upon which the Director relied ""engaging in a banking transaction relating to money"". The transcript records that he said: 

"" ... the first physical elements [sic] of the indictment is that the accused dealt with money. ... 

The definition that deals with money provides that it includes engaging in a banking transaction relating to money or other property. So it is relatively straight forward in this case and it is relatively clear what the Crown is alleging here in terms of how the Crown makes it [sic] case, that Mr Chen dealt with money. ..."" 

57Although, by s 400.13(2), it was not necessary that the Director prove an intention on the part of the appellant to commit any particular crime, the Crown prosecutor nevertheless identified as the primary allegation an offence against s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (""the FTR Act"") as the crime of which he asserted the appellant intended the money to become an instrument. That is an offence shortly known as ""structuring"", a shorthand term that I will adopt. Section 31 is in the following terms: 

""(31) (1) A person commits an offence against this section if: 

(a) the person is a party to 2 or more non-reportable cash transactions; and 

(b) having regard to: 

(i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following: 

(A) the value of the currency involved in each transaction; 

(B) the aggregated value of the transactions; 

(C) the period of time over which the transactions took place; 

(D) the interval of time between any of the transactions; 

(E) the locations at which the transactions took place; and 

(ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted; 

it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that: 

(iii) would not give rise to a significant cash transaction; or 

(iv) would give rise to exempt cash transactions. 
(2)... 

(3)..."" 

58For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that a 'non-reportable cash transaction"" is a cash transaction involving an amount less than $10,000: see the explanation in Arora v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2011] NSWSC 552 at [9]. A cash transaction in an amount of $10,000 or more is a ""significant cash transactions"", and attracts mandatory reporting provisions: s 7, FTR Act. 

59The offence of structuring is committed where two or more cash transactions, each involving an amount less than $10,000, are made in circumstances that warrant a conclusion that they are so structured in order to avoid the mandatory reporting conditions. A structuring offence is an indictable offence. (As set out in the judgment of Basten JA, the Director adopted an alternative scenario, a proposition that the crime of which the appellant intended the money to become an instrument was an unspecified taxation offence. Having regard to the view to which I have come in relation to the assertion concerning a structuring offence, it is unnecessary to delve further into the difficulties associated with that proposition: see Ansari v The Queen [2010] HCA 18; 241 CLR 1299 at [43].) 

60The language in which the physical element of an offence against s 31 is expressed is significant. It is expressed in the passive voice. The physical element of an offence of structuring is being a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions with the requisite characteristics. I repeat that the physical element of an offence may be: 


conduct; 
a result of conduct; or 
a circumstance in which conduct or a result of conduct occurs (s 4.1(1) of the Code), 
and ""conduct"" may be: 

an act; 
an omission to perform an act; or 
a state of affairs (s 4.1(2)). 

61Being ""a party to a transaction or transactions"" may be seen to be conduct in the conventional sense; but to my mind, it fits more readily into the concepts of ""a result of conduct"" or ""a state of affairs"" as envisaged in the extended meaning given to ""conduct"" by the definition. See the judgment of Brennan J (as he then was) in He Kaw Teh v The Queen [1985] HCA 43; 157 CLR 523, and the discussion thereof by Bell J, when a member of this Court, in R v Saengsai-or [2004] NSWCCA 108; 61 NSWLR 135 at [58] - [60]. Those physical elements are not coextensive with the physical element(s) of a money-laundering offence. 

62It was not necessary that the Director opt for ""engaging in a banking transaction"" as the physical element of the offence of money-laundering on which he relied. It would have been sufficient to have opted for ""possession"" of the money, immediately before engagement in the banking transaction: see Arora . Had he done so, the anomaly identified by Basten JA (at [20]) would not have arisen. However, the Director took the course that he did, and cannot now avoid the consequence of that particularisation. 

63Having regard to the various statutory provisions and definitions, and the manner in which the Crown prosecutor stated the Director's case to the jury, what was alleged against the appellant could accurately be formulated as follows: 

""Between 1 January 2003, and 30 September 2004 the appellant engaged in a series of banking transactions relating to money, to a total value of $50,000 or more, intending that the money the subject of the transactions would be used in the commission of, or to facilitate the commission of, a structuring offence contrary to s 31 of the FTR Act"". 

64As I understand his Honour's judgment, the flaw Basten JA finds in the manner in which the Director put his case lies in the asserted identity of what was alleged to have been the physical element of the money-laundering offence (engaging in a banking transaction, or a series of banking transactions) and the physical element of the crime (structuring) of which the appellant was alleged to have intended the money to be the instrument (being party to, or engaging in, two or more banking transactions of the requisite value) (at [20]). 

65That was precisely the argument that was advanced in Arora, which I found it unnecessary to decide, because, at the point which that prosecution had reached, it was open to the Director to revise his particularisation of ""dealing"" in order to rely on the possession of money, rather than the engagement in a banking transaction. That avoidance is not here open, and, as I have said, the Director is bound by the way his case was put to the jury. 

66Basten JA accepts a ""dichotomy"" identified by me in Ansari (NSWCCA) (at [15]) in relation to the ""pairs of offences"" created in each relevant section of Div 400 of the Code. That dichotomy is temporal, and concerns offences of (put briefly) dealing in money that is the proceeds of (past) crime; and dealing in money intended to (or that might) become the instrument of (future) crime. That dichotomy was (I hope) apt in the circumstances of the issues that arose in Ansari . It was not intended to be, or at least can now be seen not to be, exhaustive or definitive. The dichotomy is inadequate to deal with offences involving multiple transactions undertaken over a period of time. But that is not only because the banking transactions constituting the ""dealing"" (ie the physical element of the money-laundering offence) were undertaken over a period of time. It is to do with the nature of the offence of structuring. 

67I am now of the view that there is a third alternative to those I proposed in Ansari . The third alternative arises where the crime of which it is said the money is intended to be an instrument is an offence of a continuing, or accumulating, or ongoing, or incremental, nature. Section 31 of the FTR Act creates an offence of that kind. A structuring offence against s 31 may be complete when a person has been party to a second non-reportable cash transaction having the requisite characteristics; but there is no upper limit on the number of such transactions that may together constitute a single offence. In alleging that a person has committed an offence against s 31, the Director is not confined to alleging that the offence is constituted by two transactions: he may allege (and prove) a single offence constituted by multiple - any number of - transactions. Equally, in alleging that a person contemplates a crime of structuring (for the purpose of proving a money-laundering offence) the Director is not confined to alleging a contemplated offence constituted by two transactions. The contemplated structuring offence may be constituted by multiple (envisaged) transactions. 

68While an offence of structuring might not be seen to be ""continuing"" in the same sense as, for example, a conspiracy, or an offence of possession of prohibited items, I perceive an analogy. In Sloggett v Adams (1963) 70 WN (NSW) 206 at 208, Street CJ said: 

""The question whether the offence which has been committed is a continuing offence, or one which was committed once and for all at a specified time, depends upon consideration of the language of the Act in question. Some offences once committed are complete and concluded and exist only in the past. Other offences, however, are continuing offences and are committed day by day so long as the state of affairs which is forbidden continues to exist, and the person responsible for creating that state of affairs is liable day by day for those offences. The test, it seems to me is one which was prescribed in Ellis v Ellis [(1896) P 251 at 254], by Sir Francis Jeune, who said, 'the test whether an offence is to be treated in law as continuing is, I think, whether its gravamen is to be found in something which the offender can, at will, discontinue'."" 

69Although no consideration appears to have been given to the analysis of what the Director intended to allege, it is, in my opinion, clear that what he alleged (and proved) was that the appellant contemplated the structuring offence within the same temporal parameters as the money-laundering offence pleaded in the indictment - that is, between 1 January 2003 and 30 September 2004. The structuring offence upon which the Director relied was not complete until the last of the banking transactions in which the appellant engaged. That is not to say that the Director could not have prosecuted, and prosecuted successfully, at an earlier time. But it was open to him to treat the contemplated structuring offence as one constituted by ongoing or cumulative or incremental transactions. The element of futurity in s 400.5 (and the parallel sections of Div 400) is as to the use that will be made of the money (or property). It is not essential that the entirety of the crime of which it is intended will (or as to whether there is a risk that it will) become an instrument is in the future. It may be intended that it will become an instrument of crime that is, at the time of the dealing, in the process of commission. It is in this respect that the ""dichotomy"" mentioned in Ansari is non-exhaustive. 

70The money involved in each banking transaction could have become an instrument of the ongoing structuring offence. The physical elements of the money-laundering offence and the physical elements of the contemplated structuring offence, could be seen to be of the same or similar kind, but they were not the same conduct: each banking transaction involved a subsequent increment to the contemplated structuring offence. That is on the assumption that the physical element of the structuring offence is conduct of engaging in the banking transactions. The point is stronger if the physical element of that offence is either the result of conduct (the banking transaction) or a state of affairs (being a party to the relevant number of transactions). 

71If that alone is unpersuasive, it is supported by the expansive definition of ""instrument of crime"" in s 400.1. Money is an instrument of crime if it is, inter alia , used to facilitate the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, having regard to the jury verdict, it is clear that the money the subject of each banking transaction was intended by the appellant to be used to facilitate the accumulating or ongoing incremental offence of structuring. 

72I therefore do not accept that there was relevant identity of the physical element of the alleged money-laundering offence and the physical element of the alleged contemplated structuring offence. 

73Even if that were wrong, and the physical element of the structuring element offence is taken to be engaging in banking transactions, it is still not co-extensive with the physical element of a money-laundering offence. A single banking transaction does not, and cannot, constitute the physical element of a structuring offence: there is no physical element of the structuring offence unless and until (at least) a second transaction has been completed. 

74I appreciate that no offence against s 400.5 was committed by the appellant by any of the individual banking transactions, because none reached the commencement point of $50,000 for an offence against that section (see Basten JA at [18]). That does not mean that no money-laundering offence was involved in those transactions. Each transaction undertaken with the requisite intent constituted a money-laundering offence, against either s 400.7 or s 400.8 (respectively, dealing in money to the value of $1,000 or more, or of any (unspecified) value). It was when the accumulation reached the value of $50,000 that those transactions, together, constituted the offence against s 400.5. 

75I do not accept that this analysis is inconsistent with the way in which the Crown case was conducted at trial. I do accept that no specific attention was given to the question of the ongoing nature of the structuring offence. But that the structuring offence on which the Crown relied was made up of multiple transactions is, in my opinion, clear. In opening to the jury, the Crown prosecutor referred to 142 transactions, amounting to just under $1 million. He told the jury that, in 13 of those transactions, it was the appellant himself who physically made the deposits. In his final address, he said (as recorded in the transcript): 

"" ... each and every one of those 13 transactions that were carried out by the accused was in an amount of under $10,000. ... Now the Crown says that is a pretty good starting point for finding that it is reasonable to conclude he acted as he did to avoid those reporting requirements, given the amount of cash that was coming into his company. 

... you've heard on a number of occasions that there were no less than 150 transactions carried out by the accused or his associates, whereby money was sent overseas during the charge period that is between 1 January 2003 and 30 September 2004. And of those 150 transactions, no less than 142, including those 13 of the accused, were in amounts of less than $10,000. There must be a system at play here. It's no coincidence that a 142 [sic] out of a 150 [sic] transactions in terms of the sending of money overseas are in amounts of less than $10,000. I suggest to you that you would not accept that evidence; 142 out of 150 I would suggest is relatively obvious evidence that there is a design at play in terms of the selection of a figure below which to send money overseas."" (AB 358) 

76In summing up his Honour directed the jury to s 31 of the FTR Act and then said: 

""So to tie all of that together, what s 31 of the [ FTR ] Act is saying is that it is a crime to conduct a series of transfers, two or more, in Australian dollars overseas in a way that it would be reasonable to conclude was conducted for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that no report would have be [sic] made. 

Now to tie that together in what I will call 'laymen's language' and the way in which the Crown has quite sensibly presented it to you. What that means is on the Crown case the offence in the indictment, that is the offence of dealing with money with the intention it would become an instrument of crime, is established in this case, because the evidence shows that the accused was engaged in a series of transfers in a manner which had the sole or dominant purpose of avoiding the reporting requirements of the [FTR Act], and that is a crime as defined in that Act."" (AB 473) 

77I am of the opinion that the appellant's argument on this issue should fail. Ordinarily, that would require consideration of the remaining grounds of appeal as pleaded, and of the application for leave to appeal against sentence. I am highly conscious, however, that this is a minority view, and that, on the opinion of the majority, the appellant is entitled to acquittal, and to release from custody. In those circumstances, it seems to me that the interests of justice are best served by my not taking further time to consider the other grounds of appeal, which would be no more than an academic exercise. 

78GARLING J : I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA. I desire to add some observations of my own. 

79The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions charged the appellant with an offence against s 400.5(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). That offence, ""money laundering"", is a very serious one, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment or a fine, or both. 

80The Director, on the proved facts, could have charged the appellant with an offence against s 31 of the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1998 (Cth). This offence, ""structuring"" is less serious than money laundering and carries a maximum of five years imprisonment. 

81No doubt, the more serious offence was charged because the Director thought that the criminality of the appellant was such as to warrant imposition of the more serious penalties. 

82Unfortunately, the Director has, in proceeding in this way on the facts proved here, not adequately addressed the elements of the more serious offence which are required to be proved. 

83Simpson J recorded in Arora v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2011] NSWSC 552 at [19], the plaintiff's argument that: 

""...sub-para (1)(b)(ii) of s 400.3 ...require(s) an intention that the money the subject of the dealing will (that is in the future) become an instrument of crime. But...when the dealing is completed, the offence of structuring is also completed. There is no scope for a crime to be committed in the future. The dealing and the structuring, being, in effect, identical transactions are necessarily simultaneous."" 

84Although her Honour described the argument as "" ... perhaps rest[ing] on a firmer foundation ..."" , she did not explicitly accept it, as it was not necessary for the determination of the issues posed in that case. However, I find the logic of that argument, when applied to the facts proved in this case, persuasive. 

85Because the terms of s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) are identical, except for the sum of money, to the terms of s 400.5(1)(b)(ii), I am satisfied that the argument as summarised by Her Honour, is entirely apposite in this appeal. 

86The attempt by the Director to use acts which constituted the less serious but completed crime of structuring, to prove the necessary elements of the more serious crime of money laundering failed to grapple with the plain meaning of s 400.5 of the Criminal Code , in particular, the future tense expressed in the words ""... intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime "". 

87All that the Director proved in this case was that ""... the money or other property... "" was or had become an instrument of crime, not that it would become an instrument of crime at some time in the future. 

88There was no basis in the structuring offence as it was particularised in the trial here, which was capable of proving the more serious money laundering offence. 

89The alternative case relied upon by the Director, which has been comprehensively described by Basten JA, was also wholly flawed. As is apparent, relying on the provisions of s 400.13 of the Criminal Code, the prosecution disclaimed the need for it to identify any specific indictable offences which it alleged the appellant intended to commit. 

90Nowhere did it name an Act or a provision of an Act that it said was breached. It did not identify anything other than a generalised allegation of tax evasion. 

91As far as I can ascertain, the terms of s 400.13 of the Criminal Code have not yet been the subject of any decision of a Court interpreting its meaning. 

92The central word that requires interpretation is "" particular "" when used in the phrase "" particular offence "". It is to be remembered that the context for s 400.13 of the Criminal Code is to be drawn from the combination of statutory provisions and surrounding definitions. The definition of "" instrument of crime"" is here the relevant context. Section 400.1(1) contains this definition of the phrase: 

""...money or other property ... used in the commission of or used to facilitate the commission of, ... an indictable offence ..."" 

93In an expanded way, s 400.5 of the Criminal Code requires that the prosecution prove, on the facts of this case: 

(a)the appellant dealt with money and other property; and 

(b)the appellant intended that the money or other property would be used in the commission of, or to facilitate the commission of, an indictable offence; and 

(c)the value of the money and other property was $50,000 or more. 

94But s 400.13 of the Criminal Code provides that it is not necessary for the prosecution to establish that there was an intention that a particular offence would be committed, or else that there was an intention that a particular person would commit the offence. 

95A distinction can be observed, which is an important one, between the phrase "" an indictable offence "" and "" a particular offence "". The usage of the different terms provides a clear path to the meaning of the latter phrase. 

96The prosecution must establish the evidence of a specific intention in the appellant to commit an indictable offence but not a particular offence. 

97It is an error to interpret the provisions of s 400.13 of the Criminal Code as a statutory form of excuse which permits the prosecution, proceeding under s 400.5 of the Criminal Code , to refrain from identifying an indictable offence in the commission of which, or the facilitation of the commission of which, the money or other property is constituted as an instrument of crime. 

98Unless the prosecution identifies the relevant indictable offence, then it is not open to a jury to conclude that the money or other property constituted an instrument of crime. 

99The effect of s 400.13 of the Criminal Code is only to excuse the prosecution from proving a particular offence, that is, an offence particularised by reference to a person, date, time, place, and any other specific fact, matter or circumstance which would need to be particularised either in the indictment or else to enable an accused to prepare a defence to a specific charge. 

100The prosecution in this case made no attempt to identify an indictable taxation offence, which could have made the appellant's conduct come within the relevant definition. On the contrary, the vague assertions of the prosecutor, together with the generality of the submissions to the jury by the prosecutor, and the consequent summing up by the trial judge of that part of the prosecution's case, were cast in such a way that it was not open to the jury to convict the appellant on that alternate basis. 

101Had careful attention been be paid to the terms of the more serious charge and the elements required to be proved, then either the particulars of the money laundering charge may have been different, or else only the structuring offence would have been proceeded with. It is the prosecution's failure to address these matters which means that the appeal must be upheld and the orders proposed by Basten JA made.

2757805,Dwayne William SMITH v R [2011] NSWCCA 209,"Judgment 

1BASTEN JA: I agree with Hidden J. 

2RS HULME J: I agree with Hidden J. 

3HIDDEN J: The applicant, Dwayne William Smith, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of special aggravation, an offence under s 113(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. He also asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of common assault. He was sentenced, in round figures, to imprisonment for 6 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing on 17 December 2009, when he was taken into custody at the conclusion of the proceedings on sentence. 

4In fact, the sentence imposed was imprisonment for 6 years, 9 months and 18 days with a non-parole period of 5 years, 1 month and 5 days. It would seem that that somewhat unusual head sentence was the result of his Honour's applying to a starting point of 8 years the discount of 15% which he allowed for the applicant's plea of guilty. The equally unusual non-parole period was the result of the application of the statutory proportion to the head sentence. Of course, it would have been open to his Honour to have rounded off the figure for the head sentence after the 15% discount, and that, in turn, would have simplified the process of arriving at the appropriate non-parole period. As Grove J observed in Bou-Antoun v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 1 at [33], there was no obligation on his Honour ""to undertake sentencing in a precise mathematical manner"", 

5The applicant seeks leave to appeal against this sentence. 

Facts 

6The facts were set out in his Honour's remarks on sentence as follows: 

""In November 2008 the offender's mother, Mrs Terri Taylor, was employed at the Woolworth's Supermarket at Emerton. One of Mrs Taylor's co-workers was Mr Nathan Keaton who at that time was aged 24 years. 

On 9 November 2008 at about 1.30am Mr Keaton made the first of a number of telephone calls that morning to Mrs Taylor's landline service and mobile phone. Mr Keaton thought Mrs Taylor did not and would not know who was sending these calls. 

The precise number of telephone calls in not in evidence but there may have been appropriately (sic) half a dozen. The contents of the calls were highly offensive. They mostly involved offers by the caller to participate in explicit sexual activity with Mrs Taylor. In one however Mr Keaton said, ""I killed your father"" which Mrs Taylor took to be a reference to her husband, who had died two years previously. 

Mrs Taylor was upset by these phone calls so she contacted one of her sons, David Taylor, the offender's brother. David Taylor went to his mother's house and in circumstances not in evidence was able to establish that the person making the offensive telephone calls was Nathan Keaton. 

At about 2am David Taylor then contacted the offender and told him about the telephone calls. At about 8.45am on 9 November 2008 Mrs Taylor and David Taylor drove to the offender's house. The three of them then drove to Mr Keaton's home at Bidwell. The offender took with him a piece of timber sixty centimetres in length and three to four centimetres in diameter. 

Unlike Mrs Taylor and David Taylor the offender did not know Nathan Keaton but either Mrs Taylor or David Taylor or both gave him a description of Mr Keaton. 

The driver of the motor vehicle stopped it a short distance from Mr Keaton's home. The offender got out of the motor vehicle and walked to Mr Keaton's home armed with the piece of timber. 

The front of Mr Keaton's home was secured by a closed but not locked screen door and a locked front door. The offender opened the screen door in an orthodox fashion and then kicked in the front door, causing the wooden surrounds to splinter. The offender then entered the premises with the intention of assaulting Mr Keaton. 

Mr Keaton did not live alone in the Bidwell premises. He shared the premises with his brother, Bradley, aged sixteen years, and three young women. Without intending any disrespect to them I shall for convenience and ease of reference hereafter refer to the two Keaton brothers simply by their given names. 

The offender first entered a bedroom in which two of the young women were asleep. He left the room apparently without disturbing the occupants. 

The offender next entered the bedroom in which Bradley was sleeping. Bradley suffered from cerebral palsy with right-sided weakness. The offender wrongly assumed that the person sleeping was Nathan. The offender proceeded to strike Bradley ten times with the wooden object. He was repeatedly beaten to various parts of his body. 

Bradley adopted a foetal position to try to protect himself, particularly his right arm. He rolled out of the bed and onto the floor where the beating continued. 

During the offender's attack on Bradley Nathan came into the room. When Nathan challenged the offender, the offender grabbed Nathan by the throat and pushed him against a wall and told him to go to his room or he, the offender, would kill him. At the same time the offender demanded to know from Nathan if he knew 'Jason Taylor'. I have not been told the significance of that name; however I assume it was the name of Mrs Taylor's deceased husband. 

After Nathan denied knowing anyone of that name the offender released his grip on him and he then ran to his room and barricaded the door. In the meantime one of the young female occupants telephoned triple zero. The offender then went to Nathan's room and kicked the door open and again demanded to know if Nathan knew Jason Taylor. At the same time the offender raised the wooden object over Nathan's head. 

After Nathan repeatedly denied knowing Jason Taylor the offender left the premises. 

Bradley was taken by ambulance to the Nepean Hospital. He gave a history of injury to his forehead, left arm, left leg and back pain. Because of his cerebral palsy a CT scan of Bradley's head was performed. The scan showed a small right front subgaleal haematoma, that is bleeding inside the soft tissues. There was a laceration to his right forehead through all layers of skin and soft tissues. It was eight centimetres in length and required nine sutures. X-rays of Bradley's limbs did not reveal any fractures. He did require morphine to control his pain. He was discharged from the Emergency department of the hospital to the care of his general practitioner. 

There is no evidence of any ongoing physical or psychological problems for Bradley. However as the violent attack was initiated without warning and while Bradley was asleep in his own home it must have been a terrifying experience."" 

7It is in the light of these facts that the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty must be understood. It was in these terms: 

""On 9 November 2008 at Bidwell in the State of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of Bradley Keaton ... with intent to commit a serious indictable offence namely, to assault Nathan Keaton and occasion to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, namely being armed with an offensive weapon, in circumstances of special aggravation, namely at the time of the offence he did wound Bradley Keaton."" 

The charge of common assault taken into account on the Form 1 arose from the applicant's action in seizing Nathan Keaton by the throat and pushing him against the wall. He was arrested later the same day and, when interviewed by police, made full admissions about the matter. 

8His Honour assessed the offence as falling at the mid-range of objective seriousness, notwithstanding what he described as the ""entirely misguided motive underpinning it"". He said that that motive underscored the importance of considerations of deterrence, general and specific. As he put it, the courts could not be seen ""as endorsing people taking the law into their own hands"". He noted the time lapse between the applicant receiving the call from his brother at 2.00am and his being picked up by his brother and mother at 8.45am. He saw this as indicative ""of a calculated and planned reaction to the disgraceful conduct of Nathan Keaton,"" rather than a spontaneous response. 

9For her role in the incident, the applicant's mother pleaded guilty in the Local Court to being an accessory after the fact to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. She was placed on a 2 year good behaviour bond. The remarks on sentence of the magistrate who dealt with her are not available, and the factual basis of her plea is unknown. 

Subjective case 

10The applicant was 27 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 30. He has a short criminal history between 2000 and 2004, comprising offences of dishonesty, drug offences and traffic offences. He had previously been sentenced to imprisonment on two occasions, one of them a term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 15 months for demanding property with menaces. 

11He left school after obtaining his school certificate and had been in fairly consistent employment, mainly as a labourer. He had been in a relationship with his partner for 5 years. He had had a drug habit, mainly the abuse of cannabis, but had been free of that for some years. He gave evidence in the sentence proceedings that he had given up cannabis after meeting his partner, and it seems that it was the combination of those factors which enabled him to avoid further conflict with the law between 2004 and the present offence. However, he acknowledged having an ongoing problem with alcohol and with anger management. 

12His Honour received into evidence a psychological assessment of the applicant and a pre-sentence report. Both reports noted his need to address issues of alcohol abuse and anger management, and the psychological report also recommended treatment for symptoms of depression and anxiety. The applicant expressed remorse for his crime to the psychologist and to the author of the pre-sentence report, and he did so briefly in his evidence. However, what he said to the Probation and Parole officer indicated a lack of insight into the gravity of his crime. She noted that he expressed ""genuine remorse for the pain and suffering he inflicted on the victim,"" but he also stated that ""his only regret was the fact that the victim had nothing to do with the phone calls."" His Honour was not satisfied that there was ""real remorse"" on his part. 

13His Honour found that there were no special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. As I have said, he discounted the sentence by 15% in recognition of the applicant's plea of guilty. 

The application 

14Counsel for the applicant in this Court, Mr Lowe, argued that his Honour had fallen into error in three specific respects: 


in declining to find special circumstances; 

in allowing an inadequate discount for the plea of guilty; and 

in giving inadequate weight to the element of provocation in mitigation of sentence. 

He also argued that, in all the circumstances, the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

Special circumstances 
15Mr Lowe submitted that his Honour had not given proper consideration to the question of special circumstances, given that there were a number of factors in the evidence which might have warranted such a finding. Mr Lowe referred to the applicant's relative youth, and his need for treatment, particularly in relation to alcohol and anger management. Moreover, Mr Lowe argued, his lack of insight into the extent of his criminality was a matter which itself pointed to the need for an extended period of conditional liberty. Mr Lowe also noted that in his remarks his Honour made no finding about the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. Indeed, he made no reference to that issue. 

16Of course, it is well established by decisions of this Court that whether these are special circumstances is a matter for judgment in the light of the facts of the case at hand, in the exercise of a discretion with which this Court would not lightly interfere. It is sufficient to refer to R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, 53 NSWLR 704, per Spigelman CJ at [68] and [73]. In the present case, notwithstanding the matters raised by Mr Lowe, it was open to his Honour to find that there was no need for a period of parole eligibility greater than that afforded by the statutory proportion. This appears to have been an isolated and atypical criminal episode, committed in unusual circumstances by a man who had maintained a law abiding lifestyle for some years and had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. This ground is not made out. 

Discount for plea 

17The applicant's plea of guilty was entered shortly after the day on which the matter had been listed for trial. The first count in the indictment was an offence under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act , charging the applicant with breaking and entering Mr Keaton's dwelling and committing a serious indictable offence, the reckless wounding of Mr Keaton, in circumstances of aggravation and of special aggravation. That offence carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years. The charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty, under s 113(3) of the Act, was the second count. His plea of guilty to that count was accepted in discharge of the indictment. 

18His Honour noted that the plea was entered when that alternative charge was first included in the indictment, but added that it was ""a statutorily available charge to which the offender could have earlier pleaded guilty."" In this Court it was common ground that in that observation his Honour was in error. The various alternative verdicts available in respect of offences in the relevant part of the Crimes Act are to be found in s 115A. That section does not provide for a verdict of guilty of an offence under s 113(3) as an alternative to a count under s 112(3). 

19Mr Lowe submitted that the discount should have been 20%, citing R v Newman and Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102, 145 A Crim R 361, per Howie J at [44]. That was also a case in which the applicants' pleas of guilty to an offence under s 113(3) had been accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of an indictment which contained another more serious count. The sentencing judge had allowed a discount of 20% for the pleas. At [44] Howie J, delivering the leading judgment, observed that although ""the Crown prosecutor conceded that it was the first reasonable opportunity for the accused to plead to the indictment presented, the discount was appropriate in the light of the plea coming at that stage of the proceedings."" 

20However, the discount for the pleas was not an issue with which the Court was concerned in that case. I understand his Honour to have been saying no more than that, despite the Crown prosecutor's concession, the pleas did not merit the full discount of 25% because of the time at which they were entered. The 15% discount allowed in the present case is consistent with the later examination of this issue by Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102, 195 A Crim R 1. 

21Ultimately, the discount to be allowed for the applicant's plea was a matter very much within his Honour's discretion and I am not persuaded that discretion miscarried. His Honour's view that a plea of guilty to an offence under s 113(3) was available as a statutory alternative where the indictment charged an offence under s 112(3), although erroneous, was not necessarily significant. As the Crown prosecutor in this Court pointed out, the applicant could have offered to plead guilty to a lesser charge at an earlier stage but did not do so. This ground is also not made out. 

Provocation 

22Mr Lowe submitted that his Honour failed to have regard as a mitigating factor to the provocation of the appellant by the behaviour of Nathan Keaton. This factor, he argued, lessened the need for the sentence to reflect personal deterrence. I have referred earlier in these reasons to his Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of the offence, to his characterisation of the applicant's motive as ""entirely misguided"" (while acknowledging that Nathan Keaton's conduct was ""disgraceful""), to the fact that the applicant's response was not spontaneous, and to his Honour's observation that the applicant's motive ""underscored"" the importance of general and personal deterrence. 

23Mr Lowe referred to R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47, in which the decision of Smith J in R v Craddock [2004] VSC 397 was cited with approval. It is unnecessary to refer to the facts of either case, except to observe that in both of them the offenders had sought vengeance against the victim for alleged criminal behaviour much more serious than that of Nathan Keaton. In Craddock , Smith J had this to say about deterrence as the issue arose in that case: 

""General deterrence must not be overlooked and is a weighty consideration in determining the appropriate sentence. People cannot be allowed to take the law into their own hands as the prisoner did and exact a revenge for wrongs done to them. ... 

As to personal deterrence, it has a role to play but less than might normally be the case. There is no evidence of remorse but Dr Walton expresses the opinion that the prisoner's violent behaviour, as he understands it, was an out-of-character event, which is reassuring in terms of his re-offending aggressively. He also suggests that the circumstances surrounding the killing with a specially targeted victim would suggest there is no other person readily identifiable as being at risk. The crime was a victim specific offence and the prisoner it seems does not have a reputation for violence. ..."" 

24In Swan , Spigelman CJ (with whom Barr and Howie JJ agreed) set out that passage from Craddock at [57]. The Chief Justice continued: 

""[59] The principle that a person is not entitled to take the law into his or her own hands is well known. ... 

[60] However, the principle is, in large measure, a manifestation of the principle of deterrence, both general and personal. In that respect it is affected by other sentencing principles which impinge upon the weight to which personal and general deterrence is entitled in the circumstances of a particular case. ... 

[61] The Crown submitted that the Applicant's motive did not diminish the 'seriousness of the offences.' This submission, unless limited to a narrow concept of the objective gravity of the offences, should be rejected. Motive is always a relevant factor. It affects the moral culpability of the offender, the weight to be given to personal deterrence and may affect the weight to be given to general deterrence. ..."" 

25Of course, in the present case the unfortunate victim was not the person who had engaged in the provocative behaviour and was innocent of any wrongdoing whatsoever. Nevertheless, the principles examined by the Chief Justice in Swan are relevant to the assessment of the applicant's criminality. Although he acknowledged his need for anger management counselling, it seems that he, like the offender in Craddock , did not have a history of violence. His criminal record, which is old in any event, contains no entry for an offence of violence. As I have said, the evidence conveys that the offence was the product of unusual circumstances and was out of character, and the community is unlikely to be at risk from violent conduct on his part. 

26It does not appear that his Honour gave the applicant's motive such weight as it deserved in assessing the objective gravity of his crime. Misguided as it undoubtedly was, that motive did lessen his culpability, although not to a marked degree. It also diminished to an extent the need for personal deterrence. While I accept that general deterrence remained an important factor, I am of the view that his Honour fell into error in concluding that the applicant's motive underscored the need for personal deterrence. This ground is made out. 

Manifestly excessive? 

27As error has been established in his Honour's approach to sentence, it is open to this Court to re-sentence the applicant. That being so, it is strictly not necessary to determine the question whether the sentence passed is manifestly excessive. The Crown prosecutor in this Court submitted that it was within the range of sentence properly open to his Honour, but acknowledged that it is ""stern."" 

28We were not taken to any statistics on sentencing for offences under s 113(3). I would think that it is a charge not frequently laid. Nor were we taken to any comparable cases on sentence for that offence except for Newman and Simpson , to which I have referred. The facts of that case are significantly different from the present case and, standing alone, it does not assist in determining the appropriate sentence for the applicant. Nevertheless, in all the circumstances, I am satisfied that a lesser sentence was warranted. 

Re-sentence 

29The offence with which the applicant was charged, involving breaking and entering a dwelling house in circumstances of special aggravation, is, beyond doubt, a serious offence. That is reflected in the maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. The circumstance of special aggravation, as defined in s 105A, permits a penalty twice that available for breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein: s 113(1). Circumstances of special aggravation can involve wounding or maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, or being armed with a dangerous weapon. It is clear from these descriptions that the specially aggravated form of the offence can cover events involving widely different degrees of seriousness. 

30Accepting that the applicant falls for sentence under the specially aggravated offence, and taking into account the assault charge on the form 1, it is nevertheless doubtful that the offence falls within the mid-range of objective seriousness, as assessed by his Honour. The Crown prosecutor contended that, this not being an offence subject to a standard non-parole period, his Honour's assessment of the range of objective seriousness was otiose and could be disregarded. However, while his Honour's finding reflects the language of s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, he was clearly entitled to express a view about the objective gravity of the offence. His finding explains why, in all the circumstances of the case, the sentence imposed was, as the Crown prosecutor acknowledged, ""stern"". 

31That view appears to have been reflected in his calculation, which commenced with a sentence of 8 years before reduction. Given the circumstances of the case, such a sentence is unduly harsh for a person who had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and no history of violence. In my view, the appropriate starting point is imprisonment for 5 years. I would recognise the plea of guilty by a reduction of 15%, producing a sentence of 4 years and 3 months. I would not find special circumstances. Applying the statutory ratio to the sentence of 4 years and 3 months, the non-parole period would be a little over 3 years. I would round it off at 3 years. 

32I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and quash the sentence passed in the District Court. Taking into account the offence on the Form 1, I would sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 17 December 2009 and expiring on 16 December 2012, and a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 17 December 2012 and expiring on 16 March 2014.

		16 September 2011",2011-09-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757815,JG v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 198,"Judgment 

1THE COURT : The applicant sought to appeal, pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the dismissal of a notice of motion in which he claimed orders that the evidence of a witness be excluded and the proceedings be permanently stayed. Section 5F(3) relevantly entitled him to appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order if this Court gave leave to appeal. 

2At the conclusion of the hearing we ordered that leave to appeal be refused, with reasons to be given later. These are our reasons for refusing leave to appeal. 

Circumstances 

3On 6 February 2009 the applicant was charged by way of an ex officio indictment with having on or about 12 January 2002 murdered his wife CG. CG disappeared on 12 or 13 January 2002. No remains have been found, but for present purposes it may be accepted that CG is no longer alive. 

4The trial was listed to commence in August 2009 before Buddin J. Before the jury was empanelled, counsel for the applicant foreshadowed objection to ""the entirety of the evidence of"" CV. CV was the daughter of CG and SV. CG had since married the applicant, and CV lived with CG and the applicant. As at 12 January 2002 she was nine years old. 

5The evidence of CV on which the Crown proposed to rely was contained in two videotaped interviews conducted on 7 January and 10 January 2003 by members of the Joint Investigation Response Team (""JIRT"") of the New South Wales Police Force. It could constitute CV's evidence in chief pursuant to s 306U of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

6CV was aged 10 at the time of the interviews. She was further interviewed, with videotaping, on 7 August 2003. On 3 October and 20 October 2003 she was subjected to hypnosis in sessions conducted by a hypnotherapist, not a member of JIRT, with a view to eliciting further information. Further detail of the various interviews and sessions may be found in the judgments later mentioned, and we do not repeat it. 

7The evidence in the interviews in January 2003, if accepted, would establish that on the evening of 12 January 2002 CV had told CG, and the applicant when he joined them, that the applicant's father AG had sexually interfered with her. 

8On the Crown case, this was apt to have brought serious conflict between CG and the applicant, particularly when at the time arrangements were under way for them and CV to go and live with the applicant's father, to the point of a motive for the applicant to murder CG in order that she not take the allegations against AG to the authorities. On 7 February 2002 the applicant provided a statement to police in which he said that he had had no contact with CG since the morning of 13 January 2002, when she had packed her bags and left the matrimonial home following an argument. CV's evidence would be linked by the Crown to the applicant's reference to an argument. 

9Further, on the Crown case it was particularly unlikely that CG would have packed her bags and left on the morning of 13 January 2002 when she was protective of CV, there had previously been alleged sexual interference with CV by an uncle N, and CG had real reason to remain in the light of the allegations of sexual interference by AG. 

10Buddin J conducted a lengthy hearing pursuant to s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995. On 7 September 2009 his Honour ruled that the evidence should not be admitted. He published reasons for the ruling on 7 October 2009: R v JG [2009] NSWSC 1053; (2009) 199 A Crim R 299. 

11The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the ruling, pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act . By majority (Basten JA and RS Hulme J, Schmidt J dissenting), on 30 September 2010 the appeal was upheld: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v JG [2010] NSWCCA 222. 

12Buddin J's ruling had been founded on the general law concerning reception of evidence when a witness had undergone hypnosis in order to enhance memory, as had occurred with CV, and as well upon s 137 of the Evidence Act whereby the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. On appeal, the majority held that the admissibility of CV's evidence was to be decided by regard to s 137 rather than general law principles, and that his Honour had erred in his assessment and balancing of probative value and danger of unfair prejudice. It was held that on a correct assessment and balancing, the evidence was admissible. 

13At a mention before the trial judge, Price J, further objection to CV's evidence was foreshadowed. The applicant then filed a notice of motion seeking orders that CV's evidence commencing with her interview by police on 7 January 2003 and thereafter should be excluded pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act , and that the proceedings should be permanently stayed. 

14Section 138 of the Evidence Act , whereby improperly obtained evidence is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting it outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way it was obtained, had been raised in the hearing before Buddin J, but had not been considered in his Honour's decision or on appeal. 

15The trial judge conducted a pre-trial hearing over a number of days in April 2011. He gave judgment on 6 May 2011, dismissing the notice of motion: JG v R (No 2) ( unreported, no media neutral citation ). 

16The applicant filed his application in this Court on 12 May 2011. 

The trial judge's reasons 

17The trial judge recorded that the focus of the exclusion pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act was upon the two interviews in January 2003. The objection to CV's evidence was founded upon what was said to be impropriety of the conduct of the interviews by the police. 

18His Honour found that there was no impropriety in any of the respects on which the applicant relied, and also that there was no causal connection between the asserted improprieties and the obtaining of CV's evidence. His Honour considered that the evidence had ""at the least, significant probative value"" (at [124]), and said that if, contrary to his view, there had been any impropriety it would not be of a major kind, and that on the balancing exercise the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained as it had been obtained. 

19As to the stay application, the trial judge recorded its basis in terms which were later repeated in the relevant ground of appeal in this Court, namely - 

""(a) The police, in the first interview with CV, through a combination of systemic failure and individual recklessness, unfairly generated damaging evidence against the accused. 

(b) The resultant evidence is unquestionably unreliable. 

(c) Because of the nature of the police questioning, the factors operating to make the evidence unreliable cannot now be nullified. 

(d) The degree of unreliability - particularly after the interview under hypnosis - cannot now be quantified. 

(e) Even with the evidence of the subject interviews the case against the accused is not strong. 

(f) Any trial permitted to be based on the subject interviews would be so permeated by the improper police conduct that it would be rendered unfair to the accused."" 

20Matters particularly mentioned in his Honour's account of the applicant's submissions were that even if CV's evidence was admitted the prosecution was ""still doomed to fail""; that apart from unreliability, unfairness was ""a separate head of abuse in the context of the stay application""; that even if the Crown did not seek to establish that AG had in fact sexually interfered with CV (because the relevance in the Crown case was only that CV told CG and the applicant that he had), AG's credit as a witness in the applicant's case would be undermined and the applicant would have to defend the allegations against AG in order to defend himself; and that the prosecution should not be permitted to use CV's evidence against the applicant when, because of its unreliability, the Crown did not use it in proceeding against AG. 

21The trial judge directed himself in accordance with Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20 and its citation from R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592. A permanent stay ""will only be ordered in an extreme case and there must be a fundamental defect of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences"": R v Glennon at 605-606 per Mason CJ and Toohey J, cited in Dupas v The Queen at [18]. There is a public interest in having those charged with criminal offences brought to trial, whereby ""fairness to the accused is not the only consideration bearing on a court's decision as to whether a trial should proceed"": Dupas v The Queen at [37]. 

22The trial judge did not consider that the applicant had established ""a fundamental defect that goes to the root of the trial"" (at [137]) or that the case was ""extreme"" (at [140]) so as to call for a permanent stay. In brief, his Honour considered that the reliability of CV's evidence was a matter for the jury, subject to any cross-examination and possibly expert evidence and a warning under s 165(1) of the Evidence Act , and that any evidence from AG should he be called in the applicant's case was also a matter for the jury. He did not think that unfairness to the applicant had been demonstrated in permitting the Crown to call CV and to play the recorded interviews with the JIRT officers as her evidence in chief. He did not think that the submission that the prosecution was doomed to fail was soundly based when the complete Crown case had not been put before him and its strength had not been canvassed. 

Appeal in relation to the evidentiary ruling 

23As was succinctly stated in Gedeon v R [2009] NSWCCA 278 at [15] - 

""15. It is established that under s 5F a decision on a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is not an interlocutory judgment or order. Thus, no appeal lies under s 5F from a ruling on evidence: Steffan (1990) 30 NSWLR 633 at 639-642; Glossop [2001] NSWCCA 165 at [15]-[19]; Lavender [2002] NSWCCA 511; 37 MVR 491 at [8] 492; Kocer [2006] NSWCCA 329 at [1], [10], [15] and [18]; and EK [2009] NSWCCA 4 AT [11]-[12] at [19]."" 

24Appeal does not lie from the trial judge's ruling that that the evidence of CV should not be excluded pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act . The applicant nonetheless sought to contest the ruling on the basis that the evidence was fundamental to the Crown case, and that if it was inadmissible the prosecution was not maintainable and so the proceedings should be stayed. 

25In R v Steffan (1990) 30 NSWLR 633 at 640-41 the Court (Hunt CJ at CL and Grove and Sharpe JJ) said - 

""It was submitted by the Crown that, in order to prevent the circumvention of the restricted terms of s 5F, this Court should always refuse leave to appeal from a refusal of a stay where that decision is based upon a ruling as to the admissibility of evidence. We are not prepared to accept that submission in the absolute terms in which it was expressed. Although it is not easy to formulate an example, there may well be the rare case where a ruling upon the admissibility of evidence in favour of the accused would demonstrate a proper basis for a stay of proceedings, so that it would be appropriate to grant leave to appeal from a refusal of a stay in such a case notwithstanding that the principal legal issue which would be determined in the appeal was the admissibility of evidence. This Court's decision in R v Groves did not go so far as this submission by the Crown goes."" 

26R v Groves (CCA, 2 April 1990, unreported) was an appeal against the refusal of a stay application, substantially on the basis that the trial judge should have rejected certain identification evidence. 

27In a joint judgment Clarke JA and Wood and Studdert JJ observed that it was difficult to see why the then applicant should be permitted to have a review of the decision of the stay application ""when the relevant rulings during the trial could not have been reviewed save by appeal after conviction pursuant to s 5 of the [ Criminal Appeal Act ]"", and - 

""As the decisions in Edelsten and Powch show appeals under s5F are to be kept within strict confines. This Court should be slow to permit those decisions to be watered down by allowing parties to pursue, as grounds for stay applications, matters which are more properly the subject of rulings or decisions in the trial and are amenable to appeal under s5."" 

28After referring to the exceptional nature of the jurisdiction to grant a permanent stay and to matters relevant to its exercise, and explaining why they were not satisfied that a stay was warranted, their Honours said - 

""Although we do not wish to foreclose entirely the possibility that considerations relative to the ability of the Crown to call a case sufficient to go to the jury, or relative to the integrity of a verdict, cannot be taken into account on a stay application brought prior to trial, we cannot as presently advised envisage circumstances in which that might be appropriate. The present is certainly not in that category ... "". 

29The observations in these cases were adopted in R v Marchione [2002] NSWCCA 131; (2002) 128 A Crim R 574 (Bell J, Heydon JA and Dowd J agreeing) at [18] and again in Gedeon v R (Allsop P and Howie and Hislop JJ) at [19]-[21]. In the lastmentioned case the Court said at [24] that, while it ""should not be stated categorically that the Court should always refuse leave to appeal from a refusal of a stay where that decision is based on a ruling as to admissibility of evidence"", and that no factor in that case ""takes the matter out of what would ordinarily be the fate of such an application"". 

30In the present case the stay application is not wholly founded on the admissibility of CV's evidence. In conformity with these cases, however we do not think that the applicant should be permitted to contest the trial judge's ruling that her evidence should not be excluded, and consideration of leave to appeal and any appeal in relation to the stay application should be confined accordingly. This is not a case of the kind postulated in R v Steffan . It may be accepted that the evidence of CV is important to the Crown case, but it is far from clear that the prosecution would be unmaintainable if it was excluded. Further, the applicant's submissions made no real attempt to identify appealable error in the trial judge's reasons for declining to find impropriety or a causal link between any impropriety and obtaining the evidence, or for the conclusion to which his Honour came in the balancing exercise. While it would not be appropriate to express a concluded view, the submissions were not persuasive of error, in particular of error in his Honour's view of the nature of any impropriety which there may have been when balanced against the probative value of the evidence and its importance in the proceedings. 

Appeal in relation to the refusal of the stay 

31The applicant's case as to a stay should thus be addressed on the basis that CV's evidence is admissible. 

32The relevant sub-grounds in the applicant's ground of appeal, putting aside the first concerned with admissibility of CV's evidence, repeated the bases for a stay as recorded by the trial judge and added - 

""(viii) His Honour erred in not finding it was unfair for the Crown to select to not use the compromised evidence in proceedings against AG but then seek to lead it in these proceedings against JG."" 

33The applicant's submissions again made no real attempt to identify appealable error in the trial judge's reasons. It was submitted, in substance, that the reliability of CV's evidence was distinct from its admissibility, that in accordance with R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 unreliability had not been taken into account in determining admissibility, and that it was an important consideration on the stay application. It was submitted that the unreliability, and the unfairness to the applicant to which use of the evidence would give rise, were such that the prosecution should be stayed. As indicated by the repetition in the sub-grounds, there was essentially repetition of what appears to have been put to the trial judge with a view to this Court coming to a different conclusion. When pressed to identify error, counsel for the applicant said little more than that the trial judge was in error in failing to find that there would be a fundamentally defective trial. 

34No issue was taken with the trial judge's self-direction in accordance with Dupas v The Queen. It had been preceded by (for example) Jago v The District Court of New South Wales (1989) 169 CLR 23 to like effect in the context of delay, see at 30-31, 34 (Mason CJ), 49-50 (Brennan J), 60 (Deane J), 75 (Gaudron J). In R v Littler [2001] NSWCA 173; (2001) 120 A Crim R 512 at [5] Hodgson JA described a stay as ""a remedy of last resort, only used in most exceptional circumstances, where any trial would involve such oppressive unfairness, incapable of being overcome, that it would be an abuse of process"". 

35We do not think that an arguable case of error has been made out. The trial judge correctly considered that the reliability of CV's evidence was a matter for the jury, and we do not think it has been shown that there is such unreliability that it could not be accepted by the jury. There is some hyperbole in the sub-grounds; we repeat that the submissions were not persuasive of error in the trial judge's conclusion that impropriety had not been shown. It should be remembered that the Crown does not seek to establish that AG did sexually interfere with CV, only that she told CG and the applicant that he did, and no doubt the jury will be given appropriate directions to ensure they appreciated the limited respect in which that aspect of her evidence was relied on by the Crown. We do not think that in these circumstances requisite unfairness to the applicant has been demonstrated. 

36We do not accept that, even if CV's evidence be admitted, the prosecution must fail: the complete Crown case is not before us, and it would be a matter for the jury whether the evidence of CV should be accepted and, if it is, whether having regard to the complete Crown case and to the challenge to it and any defence evidence they are satisfied of the applicant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. We should say that the submission that it would be unfair to use the evidence of CV against the applicant when the evidence had not been used and was not proposed to be used in proceedings against AG, according to the submission because of its unreliability, is not well founded. No more is known than that, after investigation, the police decided not to lay charges against AG. That is not relevant to whether the proceedings against the applicant should be stayed. 

37If the applicant be found guilty, his appeal rights in relation to the evidence of CV and in relation to the fairness of the trial remain. In that event, and if there is an appeal, any decision can be come to upon matters as they have been established in the course of the trial.

2757833,Alfred TIGHE v R [2011] NSWDC 231,"Judgment


1Alfred and Geoffrey Tighe were each charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Charges arose from an incident that was said to have happened on the night of 6 November 2010 here at Moree. 

2The charges arose because a Mr Joshua James Kenneth Nichols complained that he was walking past where the two men (who are brothers) were when they started to throw bottles and rocks at him and he was injured. Part of the case against the brothers comprised photographs of the injuries. 

3Geoffrey and Alfred Tighe were prosecuted in the Local Court before his Honour Magistrate Holmes who, on 24 May 2011, found them both guilty of the offence.

4They both have appealed to this Court against those convictions. When a person appeals to the District Court from being convicted of a crime in the Local Court, the District Court judge rehears the evidence in the sense of reading a transcript of what happened before the Local Court and the exhibits. Permission can be given to admit fresh evidence.

5In this case Mr C P Taylor of counsel who appears for Mr A Tighe applied for that leave which was not opposed. He tendered some material which I will refer to in a moment. I have read the transcript of the evidence before Magistrate Holmes and the exhibits and the material which Mr Taylor tendered which became exhibit AT1.

6As I said, it was Mr Nichols' account that he had been attacked by two brothers. In the Local Court Mr Raymond Tighe, the father of the two men, was called as a witness. His account was that it was Mr Nichols who threw bottles at him and in fact hit him in the shoulder that night. Mr Raymond Tighe went on to say not only that, but some hours before - at about 1.00am that same morning - Mr Nichols had been in the area again and threw a bottle at Mr Raymond Tighe's car and it broke the window in the car.

7When Mr Nichols gave evidence in the Local Court he denied smashing the car window earlier in the same day and denied throwing any bottle towards Raymond Tighe which hit him in the shoulder. 

8The only witness in the prosecution case was Mr Nichols. Exhibit AT1 tendered by Mr Taylor which, although admitted in Mr Alfred Tighe's appeal will also be relevant to the appeal of Geoffrey Tighe for whom Mr P M Schmidt appears, comprises court documents. 

9The relevance of those documents is this. When Mr Nichols was giving evidence he acknowledged that he had been charged with some offences arising out of what had happened on both occasions on 6 November 2010. The Court documents in AT1 demonstrate that Mr Nichols pleaded guilty to two charges in the Local Court since giving evidence against Alfred and Geoffrey Tighe. One of the charges he pleaded guilty to was damaging property and the other was common assault. It is apparent from the facts which were part of the Court documents that the malicious damage was throwing a bottle at Mr Raymond Tighe's car at 1.00am in the morning of 6 November 2010 and the common assault was throwing a bottle towards Mr Raymond Tighe that same night which hit Mr Raymond Tighe in the shoulder.

10Two other things appear from the facts. One is that they indicate that Mr Nichols appeared to start the disagreement on that night by some verbal abuse. The second is that the events that night ended by Mr Nichols running away and falling over. That scenario - Mr Nichols falling over - was put to him and denied in the case against the Tighe brothers as the explanation for his injuries.

11Without making any specific finding about the evidence which Mr Nichols gave, it appears clear to me that I can find there are clear inconsistencies between the evidence he gave in the proceedings in which the brothers Tighe were convicted and what he admitted to in the later proceedings. Based upon that his evidence is in my opinion unreliable and certainly cannot form the basis for a finding of guilt. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of either Geoffrey or Alfred Tighe of these offences.

12Accordingly the formal orders which I make in each appeal are these. Under s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine these appeals against conviction by setting aside the convictions. 

13The exhibits will go on the Court file.

		01 May 2012",2011-09-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757838,RILEY v R [2011] NSWCCA 238,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : The Court made orders in this appeal on 14 September 2011 and indicated that it would publish its reasons on a later occasion. These are my reasons for joining in the orders of the Court. 

2This appeal raises issues with respect to the provision by one person of dangerous drugs to another person who dies. Some of the issues in the present appeal were considered by this Court in R v Burns [2011] NSWCCA 56. However, the factual circumstances of the present case are different. 

3The appellant suffered from chronic depression for which he took Moclobemide (Aurorix) and Venlaxafine (Effexor). On occasions he took the drugs in combination. Taking these drugs in combination may induce a ""high"" in the taker but is also accepted to be dangerous and can be fatal. 

4In circumstances which I relate below, the appellant associated with Shaun Bateson and Brian Hadfield. Shaun Bateson died in May 2004 and Brian Hadfield in July of that year. The evidence proved conclusively that a combination of Moclobemide and Venlaxafine caused Bateson's death but this conclusion was not available in relation to Hadfield's death. Other persons John Willans, Amanda Ryan and Michael Wilson also took drugs while they were in a car with the appellant in January 2005. They all fell sick to differing degrees but did not die. 

5The appellant faced seven charges: 

Charge 1 For that he on 4 May 2004 at Miranda in the State of New South Wales did feloniously slay Sean Bateson. 

Charge 2 Further that he on or about 1 May 2004 at Miranda in the State of New South Wales did maliciously cause to be taken by Sean Bateson a poison or other destructive or noxious thing so as to endanger the life of Sean Bateson. 

Charge 3 Further that he on 15 July 2004 at Surry Hills in the State of New South Wales did feloniously slay Brian Hadfield. 

Charge 4 In the alternative he on or about 15 July 2004 at Surry Hills in the State of New south Wales did maliciously cause to be taken by Brian Hadfield a poison or other destructive or noxious thing so as to endanger the life of Brian Hadfield. 

Charge 5 Further that he between 11 January 2005 and 16 January 2005 at Nowra and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did maliciously cause to be taken by John Willans a poison or other destructive or noxious thing so as to endanger the life of John Willans. 

Charge 6 Further that he between 11 January 2005 and 16 January 2005 at Nowra and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did maliciously cause to be taken by Amanda Ryan a poison or other destructive or noxious thing so as to endanger the life of Amanda Ryan. 

Charge 7 Further that he between 11 January 2005 and 16 January 2005 at Nowra and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did maliciously cause to be taken by Michael Wilson a poison or other destructive or noxious thing so as to endanger the life of Michael Wilson. 

6The appellant pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. He was found guilty of charges 1, 4 and 7 and not guilty of charges 2, 3, 5 and 6. He was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. He appeals his conviction. 

Some Factual Matters 

7The evidence established beyond doubt that taking Effexor and Aurorix in combination was potentially fatal. The evidence also established that the appellant knew this to be the case at the time the offences were alleged to have been committed. The expert evidence established that even the consumption of one tablet of each of these drugs in combination could be dangerous. They operate to alter the concentration of serotonin in the body by inhibiting the reabsorption of serotonin into the nerve cells in a phenomenon known as Serotonin Syndrome. 

8It was the Crown case that from at least the year 2000 the appellant had been experimenting with Effexor and Aurorix in combination to give him a ""high"". Because of the dangers doctors would not prescribe these two drugs together but the appellant obtained them from different doctors and had his prescriptions filled at different pharmacies. He did this regularly for a number of years. 

9Evidence was given by Dr Scott-Orr, a psychiatrist at Port Macquarie Base Hospital, that in mid June 2001 the appellant offered the doctor ""a partnership in his 'concoction' of Effexor and Aurorix which he'd invented about a year ago."" The appellant told the doctor that it ""was as good as cocaine and legal"" and they could ""change the hydrochloride to less affect to (the) cardio muscular system in varying his concoction."" 

10Ms Jodie Bailey gave evidence that she had met the appellant in 1997 and became his girlfriend in a relationship which lasted until about 2004. She was studying psychology as well as a course involving drugs and alcohol. She gave evidence that the appellant had used her medical text books, the internet and the ""MIMS"" manual to obtain information about the drugs. She indicated that the appellant had also obtained a medical research video about the two drugs and a paper relating to Serotonin Syndrome. Ms Bailey gave evidence that the appellant had ""told me that the two drugs, Effexor and Aurorix had contraindications. He told me that they can produce a high together. He had also told me that they can potentially be a fatal combination 'producing' an excess of serotonin in the system."" The appellant told Ms Bailey that he could take a lot of pills because he had built up a tolerance. 

11Ms Nicole Mullane first met the appellant in Port Macquarie Base Hospital in mid April 2000. After she had been discharged the appellant visited her arriving with a bag containing about 30 tablets. Ms Mullane recognised one of the tablets as Aurorix but she did not recognise the other one. 

12Ms Mullane gave evidence that the appellant offered her a combination of the drugs saying ""these combined will make you feel like you're floating on a cloud."" Although she asked the appellant what the other drug was she said that he would not tell her. She said that the appellant did not warn her of any dangers. Ms Mullane said she took the tablets and they then settled down to watch television. 

13Ms Mullane was adversely affected by the pills. Within an hour she felt ""quite shaky"" saying ""like I needed to vomit."" She said that ""her bowels wouldn't work, nothing would work so I didn't feel well at all."" She said ""not long after that I collapsed and started to have a fit on the floor and my eyes started rolling back."" She said that the appellant remained in her apartment while this was happening. 

14Ultimately ambulance officers were called. Ms Mullane remembers waking up in hospital after she came out of a coma. She was hospitalised from 29 July to 4 August 2000 and for a time was maintained on life support. She gave evidence that she was ""quite ill for a long time"", ""couldn't walk"", ""had to use a wheelchair"", ""quite weak"" and ""a bit confused about everything."" 

15The medical evidence confirmed that Ms Mullane had consumed both Moclobemide and Venlafaxine. Her blood also contained amphetamine which she had apparently taken on the day before the appellant gave her the pills. Her diagnosis confirmed that she was suffering from Serotonin Syndrome. 

16There was evidence from Ms Bailey that the appellant had admitted to her that he had given the pills to Ms Mullane. Ms Mullane was vulnerable as she had been prescribed a variety of anti-depressants since the age of 14 years and was an intravenous user of amphetamines. 

17In previous years the evidence indicated that the appellant had been hospitalised for abusing the two drugs. Hospital records include a reference on 20 June 2001 to ""Daniel was 'holding court' with fellow residents looking up in MIMS various narcotics and other drugs."" A further entry on 1 April 2004 reads ""patient well educated on anti-depressants however patient readily admits to misusing anti-depressants."" 

18The appellant was admitted to hospital from 31 August 2004 to 21 September 2004 after taking the combination of drugs. The hospital record entry on the day of his admission reads ""... shopped today for Effexor XR Aurorix and has taken unknown quantities of both (claims one of each). Refusing to divulge many details. Claims a few of his friends have died as a result of this drug combination."" 

19The records indicate that the appellant was admitted with Serotonin Syndrome having taken an accidental dose while trying to obtain a high from taking excess anti-depressants. The record indicates that the appellant may have been taking ""a couple of each (pill) per day."" 

20There are further entries which indicate that the appellant had deliberately taken the pills in combination and was aware that he had previously been admitted to hospital for Serotonin Syndrome which had been self induced. 

The death of Shaun Bateson on 4 May 2004 - count 1 

21The charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of Shaun Bateson was based upon one or both of two allegations. The Crown first alleged that the appellant caused the death of Shaun Bateson by an unlawful and dangerous act which was particularised as maliciously causing the deceased to take the combination of Effexor and Aurorix so as to endanger his life. This act also constituted the alternative charge. The Crown did not put the case on the basis that the unlawful and dangerous act was the supply of the two drugs to the deceased without a medical prescription. 

22The main element in dispute was causation. The trial judge's directions in relation to the meaning of the words ""cause the deceased to take"" the combination of drugs have caused difficulty and is the subject of the fifth ground of appeal. 

23The second basis upon which the charge was advanced with respect to the death of Mr Bateson was manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. The Crown alleged that the appellant owed the deceased a duty of care which he breached by providing the two drugs to Mr Bateson to be taken in combination, when he knew of the dangers of so doing. 

24The circumstances concerning Mr Bateson's death commence with the knowledge that Mr Bateson, Mr Steven Pobi and the appellant were three of five people living at a half way house run by the Reverend George Capsis in Miranda. Mr Bateson's room was next to the appellant's room. 

25On Saturday 1 May 2004 the appellant was seen at about lunch time with Mr Bateson at Miranda Shopping Centre. He met Mr Derwent who was a friend of Mr Bateson. Mr Bateson introduced the appellant. They had a conversation. 

26The appellant said ""we haven't been to bed yet"" with Mr Bateson adding ""yeah, we've been up all night partying."" Mr Derwent gave evidence that Mr Bateson appeared very agitated; he ""couldn't stand still, left foot, right, foot just he wasn't calm."" He said that Mr Bateson's eyes were blood shot and ""it appeared to me that he was on something"", ""he was as high as a kite on something."" 

27The evidence indicates that after Mr Derwent saw the appellant and Mr Bateson they must have separated. Later that afternoon at 4.30 pm the appellant was apprehended in the Miranda Shopping Centre for shoplifting. He was alone at that time. When he was arrested he was found to be in possession of a pamphlet discussing depression and 16 tablets. He told the police that the tablets were Effexor. The appellant was released from Miranda Police Station at 8.10 pm. It would have taken him 10 to 15 minutes to walk back to where he was residing in Miranda. 

28Mr Steven Pobi gave evidence that on that Saturday he went to work but returned to the premises at about 6 pm. He said that he walked past Mr Bateson's room and saw him lying on his bed in a somewhat unusual position and snoring. 

29When the appellant arrived home from the police station he observed Mr Bateson to be very ill. He knocked on Mr Pobi's door, told him that Mr Bateson was not breathing properly and asked him to come quickly. Mr Pobi found the deceased lying on his bed unconscious and gasping for breath. Mr Pobi rang for an ambulance. When they arrived the ambulance officers asked ""what did he take?"" The appellant replied that Mr Bateson must have come into his room and taken the Effexor and Aurorix. The appellant produced an empty box of Aurorix and two sealed boxes of Effexor as well as two empty wrappers one labelled Effexor and the other Aurorix from his room. 

30It was the Crown case that the appellant's version was false and was an attempt by the appellant to distance himself from the drugs that caused the deceased's death. 

31Mr Bateson died on 4 May 2004. He was found to have both Venlaxafine and Moclobemide in his system at levels which exceed the therapeutic level. It was determined that he died from Serotonin Syndrome. 

32At the trial there was no dispute that the drug which had caused Mr Bateson's death had come from the appellant's stock. The question for the jury was whether they could be satisfied that the appellant had given Mr Bateson the drugs which caused his death or whether the deceased had helped himself to the drugs at a time when he was not affected by any drug which may have been given to him by the appellant. 

33There was evidence of a conversation between the appellant and Mr Pobi at Sutherland Hospital after Mr Bateson had been admitted. Mr Pobi allegedly asked the appellant what had happened and the appellant replied ""oh we just went out for some drinks and he, Sean (sic) took some, you know, this Effexor and Acuix (sic) - clearly a reference to Aurorix - took that mix of drugs."" 

34Ms Bailey gave evidence that the appellant told her that he had given Mr Bateson some tablets ""to make him feel better."" She said that the appellant said to her ""I gave them to him but he was feeling pretty down he was pretty depressed, I thought it would help him."" The appellant made this remark after he had apparently denied giving the deceased any tablets and suggested that the deceased must have come into his room and taken them himself. 

35Mr Pobi also gave evidence that about two days before 1 May 2004 the deceased had told him in confidence that the appellant had ""found something on the internet that if you mixed two drugs together you can get really stoned and off your head."" Mr Pobi said that the deceased had told him that the appellant was ""suggesting for Sean (Shaun) to get into it."" He said that Shaun was ""very uncomfortable"" about doing it. Shaun had told him that in the past he had been shot in the head with a cross bow which had given him some mental problems. It was apparent to Mr Pobi that Shaun did have mental problems. He had observed him to burn glue in a circle, burn his own arm and speak of UFOs having landed. 

36The appellant also told another person, Ms Roberts that he had given a friend some of his pills and that his friend had died. Sometime later in a hand written note which became Exhibit W in the proceedings (also known as the ""Dear Dr George letter"") written to a doctor, and to which I refer in greater detail below, the appellant admitted that the deceased had asked for some of his medication and he had given it to him. 

Poisoning of Brian Hadfield on 15 July 2004 - count 4 

37The jury returned a verdict of not guilty in respect of the charge of manslaughter of Mr Hadfield. However, they found the appellant guilty of the alternative count of maliciously causing him to take a poison so as to endanger his life. The element in dispute, as in the case of Mr Bateson, was causation. Unlike the situation with Mr Bateson there was no agreement as to the cause of Mr Hadfield's death. 

38After Mr Bateson died the appellant moved from the half way house into a large private hotel called the Edward Eagar Lodge in Surry Hills. The Lodge had about 6 or 7 levels. Mr Hadfield lived there and he and the appellant became friends. 

39Mr Kim Withers was living at the lodge. He gave evidence that at about 8 - 8.30 pm on 14 July, the evening prior to Mr Hadfield's death, Mr Hadfield and the appellant came into his room asking for marijuana. He said that he refused to provide them with any marijuana because Mr Hadfield ""didn't look very good."" He said Mr Hadfield looked ""unsteady and ... really bad."" He said the appellant ""seemed out of it, but ... still alright."" 

40About 1 hours later the appellant came to Mr Withers and again asked for marijuana. Mr Withers was concerned about Mr Hadfield's condition and asked the appellant what he had taken. The appellant replied with a smile that he had given him something but ""didn't say what. I can't remember what it was."" 

41After Mr Hadfield died Mr Withers again asked the appellant what he had given him. The appellant responded that he ""shouldn't have taken that many"" or ""I told him not to take that many."" 

42Mr Withers also gave evidence that some hours prior to Mr Hadfield and the appellant coming into his room he had seen Mr Hadfield standing in his bedroom with the door open. He observed Mr Hadfield taking pills while he had a beer in his hand and observed him to consume a variety of drinks that night. 

43Mr Milo Nedelson lived on Mr Hadfield's floor at the Lodge. He said that at about 7 pm on 14 July Mr Hadfield invited him into his room for a drink. Mr Hadfield was in a jovial mood. He observed a box of Effexor on his bed. Mr Hadfield told Mr Nedelson that he had taken it to try and get a ""high."" Mr Nedelson said that he warned him that Effexor was an anti-depressant and he should not take it whilst he was drinking. Mr Nedelson was familiar with Effexor and its potential hazards. 

44On the morning of 15 July Mr Nedelson saw Mr Hadfield in his room. He ""was violently shaking and trying to hang onto himself."" He said that Mr Hadfield told him ""he'd taken half a packet (of Effexor) the night before"" and had ""drunk the half a bottle of gin."" 

45Ms Frances Roberts gave evidence that she spoke to the appellant after Mr Hadfield had died. She said that she opened the conversation by asserting that the appellant was the one who had given Mr Hadfield the pills. The appellant asked her how she knew and she reminded him of the conversation they had had a week or so earlier. The earlier conversation had occurred during a casual meeting at Taylor Square. The appellant allegedly said to her that he had given some of his pills to a friend ""they went out one night and came home after taking pills and his mate dropped dead."" She understood the appellant to be saying that ""another mate had died in a similar kind of situation."" The appellant told Ms Roberts ""not to say anything and not to go writing a statement"" and that she ""f...ing wouldn't want to."" 

46The police searched the deceased room and found a small box containing 2 capsules of Effexor. Although forensic pathologists gave evidence which indicated that Serotonin Syndrome was the likely cause of death they indicated that they could not be certain about this. Screening for common drugs proved negative although amitriptyline and metabolites of cannabis were found in the deceased's system. Dr Botterill who performed the autopsy considered it ""very unlikely"" they contributed to toxicity or death. The doctor identified Moclobemide and Venlafaxine, both at levels higher than the therapeutic range. 

47Dr Botterill concluded that the direct cause of death was ""undetermined"". He indicated that when Moclobemide and Venlafaxine are taken together there is a significant increase in the chance of a reaction occurring in the body that can result in death even if the level of those drugs found in the body are not in the toxic or necessarily fatal range. However, Serotonin Syndrome could not be positively diagnosed after death and although Mr Hadfield had signs of the syndrome before his death no doctor had examined him in this period. 

48Dr Duflou, a forensic pathologist, agreed with Dr Botterill. He considered that it was a ""reasonable possibility"" that Mr Hadfield died of Serotonin Syndrome but there was ""no firm evidence"" that he did. He confirmed that it was difficult to express a conclusive opinion when the deceased had not been medically examined prior to his death. The situation was different with Mr Bateson who had been admitted to hospital some days before he died. 

The ""Dear Dr George Letter"" (Exhibit W) 

49The appellant was arrested and charged on 8 February 2007. Police searched his caravan and found a photocopy of a handwritten 22-page document in the form of a letter. It was addressed to ""Dear Dr George"" and dated 24 October 2006. It contained a number of corrections and additions which suggest that it may have been a draft rather than a final version. 

50Broadly speaking, the document was a narrative of the appellant's problems, centred very much on chronic depression throughout his life. Towards the end of the document there was a section containing references to Sean (Shaun) and Brian. No doubt these were Mr Bateson and Mr Hadfield. The prosecution wanted parts of this letter tendered as admissions. After argument, those parts were admitted. The defence wished other parts of the document also to be tendered, so that in the end most of the document was tendered as Exhibit W. 

51The complete section of the letter in relation to Shaun and Brian is: 

""After leaving the psych ward I was discharged under George Capsis (what I had thought was care and understanding) oversight to stay at his share house. I was paying around $120 per wk for a drab room. I had to walk to buy food etc. I was told I was expected to go out and look for work. I had no car, licence, family, friends, son, girlfriend, and why would anyone want to be with me I had nothing and was fighting for air to breathe for (end of page 16/beginning of page 17) the agony of weight of sadness upon my chest. I was enveloped in a suicidal depression. I didn't eat or leave my room for days just sobbed into my pillow so no one would hear me. I heard George come to the house and talk to one of the older guys about me and said among other things ""this is not a doss house, if he doesn't pull his socks up, he'll be asked to leave"". I feel so sad for that person and all who know the place of despair I was in. It makes me weep and I want to go back and help them (me) and comfort then in that place of utter despair and blackness. I was terrified of being homeless and alone. When it was quiet I crawled through the clutter in the garage and began inhaling petrol from a mower. I had no pride left, I sat there crying and sniffing so as to in any way to numb away the sadness. I had my last useless antidepressants, poured petrol on a cloth and sort of crying and stumbling toward the doctors or the bottle shop first. I got the only other medication that had any effect left together to lift the despair. I had been trying yet again not to take them because they had so ---after often distorted all mind, reason and judgement and personality causing me such embarrassment, suffering and death. 

*this is all too much of an absolute understatement. 

*my recollection is poor so please forgive my corrections at doubting my ... I had such self hate at being so pathetic. I took some of the meds. We went out (Sean and I) but it wasn't me it was the manic person whose mind had been list lost again. Sean kept asking me what I was on, he told me all the drugs he used to take. When I told him, he said he had been on antidepressants (*sorry for all the scrawl and mess. I can barely write this) and was depressed about his eyesight. What is so horrifying is that in the past I had had no memory of having given him any of the medication but I have a vague memory. He asked me for a couple and I (end of page 17/ beginning of page 18) gave them to him. We stayed out all night and the next day I marched off in a dream to ""steal"" some new clothes fuelled by some delusion. I would have confidence in them to meet a girl and thus suddenly everything would start to finally come together this time. All I had to do was look the part. I do not understate - this was the dementia going around in my head. I got caught because I was apparently in the change room for over an hour or something. I had no concept of anything. Then when I was caught I suddenly woke up to what had happened but I could never tell anyone because it was all too insane so I went through the motions. After the Police released me I went back to the house. I found Sean and called the ambulance. 

*please forgive me not writing about how I felt and feel about this at seeing him like that and what happened. I cannot yet get my mind around what has happened. I know I'll be asked about it at the inquest but I cannot process it. It leaves you with such a sick awful feeling such as I cannot ever define. And to have it happen again is a horror of a burden and vexation that twists me up inside. It's hard enough to talk about what has happened to me but I think I find it so hard to talk about Sean and Brian simply because I would never ever want to hurt anyone and I cannot get around that was not me but a personality outside normal reason and sense when around them and other people who wh e r e were more influenced by that persons excited, reality burred mind which they envied as fun while seeing and knowing nothing of the true, misery, nightmare prisoner existence that was me also. 

Sean had an incredible story and could have helped so many young people. He encouraged me. If I make it it will be to always keep what has happened as a force to help others. This is not the 'expected sentiments speech' it is a (end of page 18 / beginning of page 19) poor attempt to find a way to try and find traction to go forward via the only means left - to fight for truth for the lives of others. 

After Georges house I think I was at Nowra at my mums and being so sick ended up being then in derelict houses. I had all sorts of agonising pain in my back, body, head. Nightmares, sleeplessness, blackouts, insanity, police, hospitals, psych wards - 

*really over the last half page I have just hit burnout, emotions. May be I can now write point forms. 

I went to live with a helper in Menai. I was too much strain on them. 

He took me to the lodge in Darlinghurst. I came under deep depression for which the option epilum was useless and worsened. I couldn't leave my room for days. Black and terrified. 

At what point into being there I came under severe depression I don't know. I think I was on other antidepressants again, being terrified of effexor and aurorix which by those years nothing else lifted the depression but they gave me blackouts, fainting, seizures, sweats, shocks and stabs in the brain, nightmares, mental insanity, mental retardation. When manic or insane I think outwardly I appeared fine most of the time but I was in my own world/mind. Whatever I was on or had resolved gave way to blackness and I began drinking again. Bryan was or we were best friends there. In the end I was again putting hope in the medications (I never wanted to take against out of horror at Seans death) to lift me out of the depression that came down with a vengeance when whatever I was on ceased to have effect and I grew worse and worse. 

As I see it, the warped relationship one has to the lethaly addictive mind slave medications is like a pharmacological version of Stockholm syndrome. All your life has become - all you know, see, hear and feel is a distorted reality from that (end of page 19 / beginning of page 20) which has taken you captive and you are totally under the power and control of. You are its prisoner, and though it has stolen you, and killed you, and is destroying you, - yet you are still utterly dependent on it, and so you need it, and therefore value, if not twistedly love it. It is so abominably sick and perverse. 

Brian was a beautiful person. We would do little things like getting a homeless person something to eat and drink. That similar heart was why we became best friends. Then the crushing despair came down again I hid away. Crying in bed for days. Later told people I'd gone away. 

Later when manic (poisoned again) I was probably mindlessly espousing the wonders of the very medications that had utterly killed me and laid my life waste and which things terrified me and I hated. But having brought me out of utter suicidal darkness into delusional psychosis again, I was probably singing their praises. I dont blame Brian for envying another persons happiness. I just wish I could go back to before I had ever taken prozac. Because Brian did not see a happy person he saw a manic fool whose demeanour came from a mind affected by poisons. The very antidepressant poisons that also cause him suicidal despair in spite of taking those other misnomers, 'mood stabilisers' and 'antipsychotics'. 

I can only think and write at all (all be it still very poorly) because of the proper and true diagnosis (conclusively proven by blood tests) and medical treatment I've finally been receiving after 36 years and that with vital full time carer/support and in education of these toxic drugs I've finally been able after an absolute nightmare 2yr life and death struggle to wean off and break free of them. 

I can see similarities between the two tragedies in that both Sean and Brian had previously been on and were talking of antidepressants (end of page 20 / beginning of page 21) when they witnessed my total change in mood which probably they misconstrued as being a 'positive antidepressant effect'. I must have seemed like a convincing ad for these things and in some strange capacity may have thought I was helping them by telling them to go see their doctor, and when asked - giving them, a sample of mine. When I found Sean I had been convinced it was a day or two later or something and I asked him if he's taken more and how many but he couldn't even speak. It was like everything was going on outside of you, being in a dream. It has been that way really to some degree since first ever being prescribed these things. But I can only now clearly discern that, being off them all. I am and will forever be hauntingly burdened. 

I had left Brians room at his insistence at needing to get sleep for work. I only left him because I felt sure he was Ok, being conversant and normal. Others had said they had seen him ok as well, so it can't have been imagined. I mean it must have been so. I don't know what happened after that. I don't know what of my medication he may have taken earlier on in the night when I'd gone downstairs and left my bag there because I can never clearly remember or think. He'd just grin that grin of his. I never knew he was taking some other medications besides. 

How could I have had anything positive or praiseworthy to say to Sean and Brian or anybody else about these things? They hadn't taken away my depression they'd cast me into suicidal despair, then into insanity. Then I'd been given more drug poisons, and still more. On Lithium or Epilim I had been overcome with a metallic tasting nausea and begun vomitting, shaking and sweating profusely. I had an horrific nightmare hallucination I was vomitting up my insides and was screaming in terror trying to stuff them back in my mouth. Made to appear like a returning dog."" 

The Other Charges 

52Approximately six months after the death of Mr Hadfield the appellant, Mr Michael Wilson, Mr John Willans and Ms Amanda Ryan went on a binge of drug taking over a number of days. They consumed Moclobemide and Venlafaxine. 

53Mr John Willans met the appellant at a psychiatric clinic to which he was admitted for depression towards the later part of 2004. They became friends. Mr Willans also met Ms Ryan at the clinic and she became his girlfriend. She suffered from a bipolar mood disorder. The appellant was released from the clinic at a different time from the other persons. Mr Wilson was also a patient of the clinic. 

54The appellant was charged with three counts contrary to s 39 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) that the appellant maliciously caused a person to take a poison or noxious thing so as to endanger his or her life. The jury acquitted the appellant of the charges in relation to Mr John Willans and Ms Amanda Ryan but convicted him of the charge involving Mr Michael Wilson. 

55Mr Wilson gave evidence that the appellant offered him the two drugs to be taken in combination. He said the appellant referred to the drugs as ""lollies."" He told Mr Wilson that he would get ""high"" and that if he consumed them with beer he would ""get a better high"". Mr Wilson gave evidence that he was not warned about the dangers of taking the drugs in combination. He said that for a few days after taking the drugs and alcohol he was sick although he did not seek medical attention. 

56The specific incident, which is the subject of the charges, took place between 11 and 16 January 2005. Mr Willians drove with Ms Ryan to Nowra. At that time he was prescribed Effexor tablets morning and night. They picked up the appellant from a house in Nowra and drove to another house in East Nowra where Michael Wilson lived. The appellant asked them if they wanted some pills indicating they would ""have a trip effect"" and give them a high. 

57According to Mr Willans the appellant gave him one tablet each of Aurorix and Effexor. He gave Ms Ryan half a tablet of each, although her evidence was that she was given one of each. Ms Ryan said that she knew one tablet to be Effexor but did not know the identity of the other tablet. Mr Wilson was also given tablets. 

58According to Mr Willans the appellant told them the pills were dangerous and they should not take too many and that because he knew the right amount to take he would hold onto the box. Mr Willans last memory ""except for little snippets of hazy memories"" was getting into a car. He understood that they travelled to a pub or club in Sydney. He was effectively ""missing"" for 4 days being ultimately pulled over in his car by the police and later waking up in the Prince of Wales Hospital. 

59By the time of the trial of the appellant, Ms Ryan was dead. Accordingly, the evidence she gave at the Local Court was read to the jury. She said that they had travelled to Sydney and on the way back to Nowra they were pulled over by the police. Mr Willans was driving. The police told them to wait by the car and sober up which they did after which they drove to Mr Wilson's place at East Nowra and there they took more of the appellant's pills. 

60Not far from Mr Willans' house at Falls Creek they were again pulled over by the police. Ms Ryan was shaking and ill and was taken to Shoalhaven Hospital and then to Shellharbour Hospital. 

61Mr Willans was also taken by the police to Shoalhaven Hospital. He was treated by Dr Meischke. The doctor gave evidence that Mr Willans had told him he had taken a lot of Venlafazine pills ""maybe 100"". The doctor made a provisional diagnosis of Serotonin Syndrome and gave Mr Willans medication to which he responded and thereafter became less confused. 

62Dr Meischke also treated Ms Ryan although she was uncooperative. She told him that she had taken ""heaps of Venlafaxine."" 

63One of the issues at the trial was whether Mr Willans and Ms Ryan had entered a suicide pact. There was evidence that Mr Willans had admitted to having anti-depressants and intending suicide with his girlfriend. However, there was also a record from the Prince of Wales Hospital where he denied attempting suicide and indicated that his intention was to get a ""high"" and that his overdose was accidental. 

64Dr Meischke also questioned Ms Ryan about her motive. She said that she wanted to die and a record was made of ""attempted suicide"". However, there are also hospital records in which she denies making a suicide pact with her partner. 

65There was also evidence that during the course of the group's journey on that day and night the appellant and Ms Ryan went into a doctor's surgery and obtained scripts for more pills which they filled at a chemist. The doctor gave evidence of having seen two new patients within ten minutes of each other on the morning of 14 January 2005. The doctor first saw the appellant and gave him a prescription for Aurorix and Epilim after being told he was out of medication. Ten minutes later the doctor saw Ms Ryan and prescribed Effexor as she claimed she was out of the drug which was necessary to treat her bipolar disorder. 

66Mr Wilson gave evidence that after Mr Willans, Ms Ryan and the appellant arrived at his house they drank a considerable quantity of beer. The appellant offered him ""lollies"" and said that he could get a high from them. The appellant asked how many Mr Wilson wanted and he said ""four of each."" Mr Wilson consumed the pills. He said that the appellant did not warn him about any dangers but told him that ""drinking them with beer you get a better high out of it."" The appellant apparently also took some tablets. 

67Mr Wilson said that the effect of the tablets was not immediate. He said that some hours later they took more pills ultimately consuming 7 of each pill. It was when they ran out of pills that they arranged to replenish their stock from a pharmacy. 

Grounds of Appeal 

68The appellant relies on the following grounds of appeal: 

Ground 1 The verdict of the jury on charge 1 (felonious slaying of Shaun Bateson) was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 

Ground 2 The verdict of the jury on charge 4 (having maliciously caused Brian Hadfield to take a poison) was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 

Ground 3 The verdict of the jury on charge 7 (having maliciously caused Michael Wilson to take a poison) was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 

Ground 4 The trial judge erred in law in admitting particular tendency and coincidence evidence. 

Ground 5 The trial judge erred in law in his direction to the jury on what constituted causing a person to take a drug. 

Ground 6 The trial judge erred in law in his direction to the jury on manslaughter by criminal negligence. 

Ground 7 The trial judge erred in law in admitting into evidence Exhibit W. 

69Section 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) states that the Court of Criminal Appeal ""should allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence"". 

70The appropriate test was discussed by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at [493], where it was stated that a court of criminal appeal must ask itself whether it thinks that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty, bearing in mind that the jury has the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence and has had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. 

71The appeal court must undertake its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand; M at [492] - [493]. 

72More recently in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13 French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ said at [13]-[14]: 

""The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say: 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.' 

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter. 

In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act , by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA , the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated: 

'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1) The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'."" 

Ground 1: The verdict of the jury on charge 1 (felonious slaying of Shaun Bateson) was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 

73The trial judge instructed the jury as to the elements of the offence of ""felonious slaying"" in writing. It reads as follows: 

1.Shaun Bateson died on 4 May 2004; 

2.Unlawful and dangerous act: 
a) maliciously 
b) cause to take 
c) a substance that was a poison (or other destructive or noxious thing) 
d) endangering life; or 

3.Manslaughter by criminal negligence 
a) duty of care is owed 
b) conduct breached duty of care 
c) act merited criminal punishment 
d) act caused death 

74As I have already indicated the major dispute in this appeal concerns the element of causation in relation to both unlawful and dangerous act and gross criminal negligence manslaughter. 

75The appellant accepted that Mr Bateson died from the combination of Aurorix and Effexor tablets. He also admitted that he gave Mr Bateson some of these tablets before lunchtime when they were seen together at the shopping centre. However, the appellant submitted that the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant supplied Mr Bateson with the ""fatal dose of tablets"" that actually caused his death. It was submitted that it was more likely that Mr Bateson took the fatal dose of tablets that caused his death after he was seen at the shopping centre from the stock of tablets in the appellant's room and when the appellant was not present. 

76The Crown's response was to emphasise that Dr Kennedy said that Serotonin Syndrome ""normally"" starts developing 2 to 4 hours after the tablets are consumed but there are variations amongst individuals. He said ""there's individual variations, yet most people you'd expect it to come on within about 6 hours, but that can vary."" It was submitted that the sighting of Mr Bateson when he was snoring and very ill was within this ""time frame."" Dr Kennedy said that the effects of serotonin build up can increase over time. The Crown emphasised that when Mr Derwent observed Mr Bateson at the shopping centre he observed him to be ""high"" and ""very agitated."" 

77The ""Dear Dr George letter"" is relevant to this issue. In the letter the appellant described the condition of himself and Mr Bateson when they parted company that day. He wrote, ""He asked me for a couple and I gave them to him"", ""we stayed out all night and the next day I marched off in a dream to steal some new clothes fuelled by some delusion."" It was submitted that the letter could be understood as expressing the appellant's belief that the combination of drugs he had given Mr Bateson was responsible for his death. 

78The Crown submitted that it did not have to establish a precise act causing death in order to establish manslaughter: R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256 at [46]. It was submitted that it was a misapplication of principle to seek out the principal or ""fatal dose"" of tablets and all that needed to be proved was the supply of the combination of drugs to Mr Bateson ""substantially contributed to his death""; R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174; (2000) 112 A Crim R 201 at [66], [71]. 

79The Crown submission was founded upon the evidence of Dr Kennedy who indicated that Venlaxfaxine increased the level of serotonin between the nerves and is accordingly prescribed to avoid depression. Moclobemide stops the serotonin from being broken down and released from the nerves. The doctor said ""it's like a double effect ... of serotonin build up."" Serotonin Syndrome is an excess of serotonin. Accordingly the Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to conclude that the combination of these drugs which had been given to Mr Bateson by the appellant prior to them being seen at the shopping mall had substantially contributed to the build up of serotonin in his system and ultimately his death irrespective of whether or not Mr Bateson had helped himself to more tablets. 

80The appellant emphasised that the evidence did not provide any detail of the circumstances in which the appellant gave the tablets to Mr Bateson. Additionally, there was no evidence relating the circumstances in which Mr Bateson actually took the tablets. Importantly, the appellant emphasised that there was the opportunity for Mr Bateson to have accessed the appellant's room during the afternoon to obtain tablets which was not excluded by the Crown. 

81The appellant also emphasised that having regard to Dr Kennedy's evidence it was unlikely that Mr Bateson took the fatal dose of tablets during the course of the night of 30 April 2004 when he was out partying. Although it was possible that the severe effects of consuming the tablets may have emerged after a longer time Dr Kennedy's evidence was that they would usually become apparent within 2 to 4 hours of the taking of the drugs. 

82The appellant emphasised that Mr Bateson was seen by Mr Derwent just after midday on 1 May 2004. The evidence indicates that at that time Mr Bateson showed no sign of irrationality or confusion consistent with a diagnosis of Serotonin Syndrome and had no difficulty walking. The appellant submitted that accordingly it was more likely that Mr Bateson took the tablets which caused his death at a time after his meeting with Mr Derwent and at a time when he was not in the company of the appellant. Although the appellant was not apprehended for shoplifting until around 4.30pm on 1 May 2004, there was no evidence that the appellant was with Mr Bateson after 12.30pm or that any drugs were given to Mr Bateson in the shopping centre after the meeting with Mr Derwent. 

83I accept the appellant's submission. Although it is possible that the tablets which the appellant gave to Mr Bateson earlier in the day may have caused his death it is not possible to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that this was the case. There can be no doubt that the appellant and Mr Bateson were separated for some hours during the afternoon during which time Mr Bateson could have, if he had chosen to do so, accessed the appellant's room where the tablets were kept. Given the fact that Mr Bateson was in search of a ""high"" it would be entirely possible that he sought out further tablets without reference to the appellant and that it was that overdose that triggered Serotonin Syndrome. 

84I accept the Crown's submission that it was not required to identify a fatal dose given by the appellant to his victim but can prove the offence by proving that the combination of drugs given to Mr Bateson by the appellant substantially contributed to his death. However, given the timing of the events on the afternoon of 1 May 2004 and the expert evidence as to the time frame for the onset of the symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome, to my mind there is insufficient evidence to make the finding beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs known to be supplied by the appellant before they were at the shopping centre substantially contributed to Mr Bateson's death. 

85The evidence does not enable a conclusion that it was the appellant who gave Mr Bateson the tablets which contributed to or caused his death. 

86I would uphold this ground of appeal. 

Ground 2: the verdict of the jury on charge 4 (having maliciously caused Brian Hadfield to take a poison) was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 

87The appellant was acquitted of the manslaughter of Mr Hadfield but was convicted of the alternative count of having maliciously caused him to take a poison or other noxious thing, the taking of which endangered life. It is likely, as the appellant submitted, that the verdict of acquittal on the manslaughter charge was the result of the fact that the medical evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hadfield had died of Serotonin Syndrome. 

88The fundamental complaint of the appellant again relates to the element of causation. The appellant accepts that there was evidence capable of proving that the appellant gave the two drugs to Mr Hadfield. However, the appellant submitted that although there was evidence capable of proving the appellant had given drugs to Mr Hadfield there was also evidence that Mr Hadfield was consuming tablets in his room at a time when the appellant was not present. 

89One of the residents Mr Milos Nedelson gave evidence that he had seen a box of Effexor in Mr Hadfield's room about a week before 14 July. Mr Nedelson warned Mr Hadfield not to take it while he was drinking. Mr Hadfield told Mr Nedelson that he had been taking the drug to get high. Mr Hadfield told him that he had obtained the Effexor from Daniel, clearly a reference to the appellant. 

90At about 7 pm on 14 July Mr Nedelson saw Mr Hadfield in his room. He was walking past and Mr Hadfield invited him in for a drink. Mr Hadfield had some bottles of beer and a large bottle of gin or vodka. Mr Nedelson again saw a box of Effexor in the room. He gave evidence that Mr Hadfield was ""off his head and incoherent."" 

91At about 8 am the next morning Mr Nedelson again saw Mr Hadfield in his room. He saw the packet of Effexor and Mr Hadfield told him he had taken half a packet during the night and had also been out at a hotel drinking for a couple of hours. Mr Nedelson went out for a time and soon after returning at 10 am found Mr Hadfield unconscious or perhaps already dead on the floor. There was other evidence of Mr Hadfield drinking on the afternoon and evening of 14 July as well as consuming tablets. By 8.30 pm the evidence indicated that Mr Hadfield was swaying on his feet and Mr Withers thought he was drunk. 

92The appellant's submission identified the fact that although the appellant supplied Mr Hadfield with the drugs the evidence does not indicate that Mr Hadfield took them when the appellant was present and the evidence did not exclude the possibility that Mr Hadfield took the combination of tablets ""voluntarily."" More significantly it was submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant did not tell Mr Hadfield that in combination and together with alcohol the tablets were dangerous or that Mr Hadfield already knew that to be the case. 

93The Crown's response was that the submissions involved a misapplication of principle. The evidence indicates that the appellant believed that the combination of drugs he had given to Mr Hadfield caused his death. The Crown emphasised that the appellant told Ms Roberts ""they went out one night and came home after taking the pills and his mate dropped dead."" 

94The Crown submitted that there was evidence to support its submission that Mr Hadfield did not know that the two drugs were dangerous or that the appellant did not tell him this. The Crown pointed to the following evidence: 

a. Evidence of a tendency not to inform or fully inform those persons who took those drugs in combination the dangers of which he was aware; 
b. The appellant's reference in the ""Dear Dr George letter"" to talking of anti-depressants Brian Hadfield had been on, his witnessing the appellant's change in mood and ""positive anti-depressant effect"" and this being a ""convincing ad""; 
c. There was no suggestion Mr Hadfield intended any self harm. 

95The Crown emphasised that Mr Hadfield was vulnerable and it was submitted that the appellant was in a position of influence over him and ""commanded Mr Hadfield's compliance"" to take the tablets with the expectation of forthcoming positive mood change. 

96Assessment of the evidence in relation to the death of Mr Hadfield for the purpose of this ground of appeal requires consideration of the meaning of ""cause to take"". This issue is the subject of a separate ground of appeal under ground 5. 

97However, it is sufficient for me to indicate that having regard to my conclusion in respect of ground 5 of the appeal, I am not persuaded that the Crown has proved, to the relevant standard, that the appellant was in a position of influence over Mr Hadfield. The evidence also indicates several instances where Mr Hadfield, having received warnings from other residents about consuming both drugs and alcohol, continued to do so in the absence of the appellant. The consequence is that the evidence is insufficient to find that the appellant caused Mr Hadfield to take the relevant drugs. 

Ground 3: the verdict of the jury on charge 7 (having maliciously caused Michael Wilson to take a poison) was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 

98The offence relating to Mr Michael Wilson was an alleged contravention of s 39 of the Act. Mr Wilson gave evidence that the appellant did not warn him of any dangers in taking the drugs. In fact he said that he was told that taking them with beer would give a ""better high."" 

99The Crown emphasised that there was evidence from Mr John Willans that the appellant took control of the box of tablets when dealing them out. It was submitted that as a consequence this was evidence of a ""position of influence over the others, directing if and when tablets could be consumed."" Mr Wilson stated that on the occasions that he received tablets, he did so from the appellant. He always received a combination of the two. 

100The Crown accepted that the trial judge misdirected the jury in relation to the concept of ""cause to take"" which I discuss under ground 5 below. However, it was submitted that had the proper direction been given the jury would still have concluded that the appellant was guilty of the offence. 

101The appellant's submission involves a detailed consideration of the relevant evidence. The sequence of events commenced with Mr Willans and Ms Ryan driving to Nowra to meet the appellant in January 2005. They then drove to a house where Mr Willans was living. At the house, Mr Willans said in his evidence that each person took tablets of Aurorix and Effexor, given to them by the appellant. Mr Willans thought the appellant gave Mr Ryan half a tablet of each, but one of each to himself. He said that the appellant spoke of the effects, saying ""that it'd make you feel good. He also said it would be dangerous."" 

102After this, the four got into Mr Willans' car. He was driving. He did not recall taking any more tablets. His memory of what followed was ""little snippets of hazy memories."" 

103Mr Willans had no memory of having drunk alcohol over this period. In previous evidence, which he said was true, he had been asked whether the appellant had said ""if you were going to take any, take no more than one each"", to which he had replied ""Yes, that's why he had handed them out."" He also agreed that the appellant had said he was going to take control of the box because he was worried about anyone taking more than one, and that the appellant had warned several times that you shouldn't take more than one of each. In his statement made in November 2006, he had said ""I remember Daniel telling us it's dangerous if you take too many. I know the right amount to take so I will hold on to the boxes."" 

104Ms Ryan gave evidence of events that took place at Mr Wilson's place. She said that she and Willans were ""quite cranky"" because they had had a fight with Mr Willans' mother, and then the appellant said that he had some pills, and asked them if they wanted some. He said ""that they have a trip effect and give us a high."" She said that she and Mr Willans talked about it, and told the appellant they would like some. 

105She said that she took two tablets. One was Effexor, which she had taken before, but she could not remember the name of the other. Mr Willans and Mr Wilson also took them, but she could not say how many. They made her feel ""a bit more full of life."" 

106They stayed at the house until 9 or 10 pm then drove to Warilla looking for a bottle shop. Not finding anything, they drove to Sydney, arriving about 4 am. They waited for a bottle shop to open, and at 6 am bought a case of 24 beers. They all drank them. They then returned to Jamberoo, where police stopped them, searched the car, and told them to wait by the car a few hours until they had sobered up. They then drove to Mr Wilson's place at East Nowra, where they all took more tablets. She had two of each. They remained at the house all day. She, Mr Willans and the appellant finally left in the car. They ran out of petrol, got stuck in dirt, and had to be towed out by the fire brigade. Later they were again pulled over by police. She could not get out of the car, and was vomiting. Ultimately she was taken to hospital. She did not remember taking pills other than on the two occasions at the house, as outlined above. 

107Ms Ryan had no recollection of going to a doctor to get a prescription during the trip, nor of going to a chemist to get pills. 

108According to Mr Wilson, when Mr Willans, Mr Ryan and the appellant arrived at his house, Mr Willans had a few beers with him, which they drank. They then went and bought another carton of twenty four, which they also drank. The appellant had some pills, and asked if they wanted some to get a high. Mr Wilson said there were two different types of anti depressants. One he knew was Aurorix because he read the pamphlet that came with it, but he did not know what the other was called. 

109Mr Wilson said that he said ""I'll have some"" and took another four of each. Mr Wilson said ""we took them regularly throughout the night"", and ""we all took some at the same time."" He said they drove to Port Kembla for more beer, but the place was closing. He said he had more tablets, probably three, on the way to Port Kembla. They decided to go to Kings Cross, where Mr Willans and the appellant bought a carton of long neck beer. They drove to the waterside and sat in the car drinking. He said he took tablets frequently throughout the trip to Sydney, and got them from the appellant. 

110On the way back, they stopped at Sutherland where Ms Ryan and the appellant went to a doctor's surgery to obtain more pills, because they had run out. Mr Wilson and Mr Willans went to a hotel to wait, and Mr Wilson had a drink. Ms Ryan and the appellant came out of the doctor's surgery with scripts, and went to a nearby chemist, where they got more of the tablets they had been taking. 

111They travelled back through Jamberoo, and while stopped on a track near a paddock, a police car arrived. Mr Willans was breath tested. They all had black rings around their eyes, which Ms Ryan had painted with texta. ""The police told us to go down to a local creek just over a bit of a hill, go for a bit of a swim and try and straighten out before we all headed home."" They eventually returned later that day to Mr Wilson's house. He got out of the car and the others drove off. 

112He was feeling lethargic and lacking in energy. This continued for two to three days. He did not seek medical treatment. 

113It is relevant to an analysis of this ground that the appellant was acquitted in relation to the charges involving Mr Willans and Ms Ryan and convicted only in relation to the charge of Mr Wilson. This may be explained by the suggestion that both Mr Willans and Ms Ryan had suicidal tendencies. Their hospital records confirm the situation. As indicated previously there was also evidence that the appellant had warned Mr Willans that the combination of pills ""would be dangerous"". 

114The appellant submitted that the evidence points only to a voluntary taking of the tablets, without persuasion by the appellant, and with the appellant having given a warning at least along the lines attested to by Mr Willans. It was submitted that all four persons were together throughout the episode and that the warnings heard by Mr Willans must have been given in the hearing of the others. The tone of their evidence is that they were either knowingly or recklessly indulging in the use of drugs. 

115As I have already indicated the resolution of this ground of appeal is dependent upon the correct understanding of ""cause to take"" which I discuss under ground 5. To my mind the appellant is correct in his analysis of the evidence. It could not be concluded that the appellant was relevantly in a position of influence over the others and directed them to take the tablets. No doubt he influenced them and made the tablets available but I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that applying the relevant test he caused Mr Wilson to take them. 

116I would uphold this ground of appeal. 

Ground 4: The trial judge erred in law in admitting particular tendency and coincidence evidence and allowing the Crown to address on the basis of such a tendency 

117The trial judge was required to rule in relation to the admission of six separate categories of tendency evidence. The appellant challenges his Honour's ruling in respect of only one alleged tendency being: 

""A tendency not to inform or fully inform those persons who take the drugs in combination of the dangers of which he was aware of taking the drugs in their combination."" 

118The Crown relied on five categories of evidence to support this tendency: 

29 July 2000 hospitalisation of Ms Mullane - asked if he gave her any warning of dangers she said ""none whatsoever."" 

Mid January 2005 - John Willans - he said: ""The main things I remember from the conversations were they'll make you feel better, but it also was dangerous, but I have to say I didn't ask too many more questions. The whole sort of time in my life that it happened, I wasn't too well myself."" Later asked about any conversation before taking the medication or any time later in the evening, he answered: ""I remember him saying they were dangerous and you shouldn't take too many of them. And then I don't remember anything after taking the first two..."" 

Mid January 2005 - Amanda Ryan - she could only remember being told by the appellant that the pills ""have a trip effect and give us a high."" 

Mid January 2005 - Michael Wilson - he was asked whether he recalled anything said by the appellant about danger or warnings or the effect the combination of pills had had on other people he knew, and answered ""no"". 

A particular reference in the ""Dear Dr George letter."" 

119The appellant submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant knew that the drugs in combination were dangerous before the incident involving Ms Mullane. The incident involving Ms Mullane occurred in July 2000. Although the appellant submitted that before that incident there was no evidence that the appellant had knowledge of the possible effect of the drugs in combination Ms Bailey did give evidence that the appellant was researching the effects of the combination of the anti-depressants before Ms Mullane's difficulties. Ms Bailey said that the appellant's research and interest in the issue ""continued for years but he started prior to the Taree (Ms Mullane) incident."" There was of course other evidence which indicated that the appellant must have known that the drugs in combination were dangerous. Pharmacists were required by law to warn purchasers of the potential dangers and warnings are found on their packets. 

120With respect to the second basis advanced by the Crown of the failure to warn, it could not in my opinion found the relevant conclusion. Mr Willans' evidence, insofar as it is reliable, includes a recollection of a discussion about the danger associated with the drugs and included the statement ""I remember him saying they were dangerous and you shouldn't take too many of them."" 

121The third and fourth bases are affected by the fact that the evidence indicated that the appellant and Mr Willans, Ms Ryan and Mr Wilson were involved in a joint escapade. There is little doubt that the recollections of the relevant events are not entirely clear and given Mr Willans' recollection that he was told the drugs were dangerous the evidence of Ms Ryan and Mr Wilson would be an unsatisfactory foundation for the relevant inference. 

122With respect to the ""Dear Dr George letter"" the Crown directed attention to the following passage in the letter: 

""Both Sean and Brian ... were talking of antidepressants when they witnessed my total change in mood which probably they misconstrued as being a 'a positive antidepressant effect'. I must have seemed like a convincing ad for these things and ... may have thought I was helping them by telling them go to see their doctor, and when asked - giving them a sample of mine."" 

123It was submitted that rather than containing a warning the appellant was singing the praises of his concoction. 

124I do not accept the Crown submission. At best the statement is equivocal. Although the appellant was undoubtedly giving positive indications with respect to the use of the drugs it provides no evidence that he had a tendency to promote their use without giving a warning. 

125The consequence of this analysis is that in my opinion there was insufficient evidence to support the alleged tendency. However, as it happens the trial judge did not refer to this matter when summing up to the jury. This of course was to the appellant's advantage and accordingly although this ground is well founded I do not believe it occasioned a miscarriage of justice. 

Ground 5: the trial judge erred in law in his direction to the jury on what constituted causing a person to take a drug. 

126In written directions in relation to counts 4 and 7, being offences contrary to section 39, the trial judge set out the elements of the offence being that the appellant: 

1. maliciously; 
2. caused the named person to take a substance; 
3. the substance was a poison (or other destructive or noxious thing); 
4. the taking of which endangered life. 

127The written directions provided instruction in relation to the second element - ""cause to take."" This direction was also relevant to the directions with respect to unlawful and dangerous act of felonious slaying in count 1. 

128It is unnecessary to set out the whole of his Honour's directions concerning ""cause to take"". However, the written directions included the following: 

""Meaning of 'Cause to Take' 

What is meant by causing the named person to take a substance? Before this element is made out beyond reasonable doubt, it is necessary that you be satisfied that the accused induced the named person to take the poison or noxious thing. 

To be induced the named person must be persuaded, in the sense that his or her decision to take the substance was substantially influenced, by what was said or done by the accused in relation to taking of the substance. Merely encouraging the named person to act in this way is insufficient. The named person must actually be induced to act in this way."" [Emphasis not in original] 

129There were two issues raised by the appellant. The first concerned the use of the expression ""substantially influenced."" The appellant submitted, relying upon the decision of the High Court in O'Sullivan v Truth & Sportsman Ltd (1957) 96 CLR 220, that the instruction to the jury, that the person must be ""substantially influenced"", was a misdirection. In O'Sullivan the publishers of a weekly newspaper had sent bundles of their newspaper in the course of their business from Melbourne to newsagents in Adelaide. The High Court held that the publisher did not thereby ""cause to be offered for sale"", within the meaning of a South Australian statute (the Police Offences Act) an offending newspaper which was sent. It was the view of the High Court that, since the newsagents offered the papers for sale of their own free will, the defendant did not ""cause"" their actions. Dixon CJ, Wilson, Webb and Fullager JJ cited (at 228) a passage from the 3 rd ed. of Halsbury's Laws of England: 

""Before a man can be convicted of causing he must be in a position of dominance and control so as to be able to decide whether the act should be done or not (authority cited), and it must be established that he gave some order, command, direction or authority to the person doing the act (further citation of authority)."" 

130Although this passage was cited with apparent approval the conclusion expressed in the joint judgment shortly thereafter (at 228) did not include the necessity for there to be ""some order, command, direction"" to the person doing the act. Rather the joint judgment referred to the act being the ""consequence of his exerting some capacity... to control or influence"" the other. The conclusion reached was that when it is made an offence to ""cause"" the doing of a prohibited act: 

""It should be interpreted as confined to cases where the prohibited act is done on the actual authority, express or implied, of the party said to have caused it or in consequence of his exerting some capacity which he possesses in fact or law to control or influence the acts of the other. He must moreover contemplate or desire that the prohibited act will ensue."" [Emphasis added] 

131Kitto J agreed with the majority but published a separate judgment. His Honour said that for a person to cause another's act the person needs to express it as his will that the act shall be done by the latter who makes a decision to submit to the former's will. His Honour highlighted two matters. Firstly, the expression of the will need not be couched in the language of command. Secondly, although an expression of will can be ""readily seen"" where the person occupies a position of dominance and control, a position of dominance and control is not an indispensable condition. Kitto J said (at 231): 

""A man may surely cause a letter to be posted by asking someone whom he meets in the street to be kind enough to post it. If the person he asks is one over whom he has some kind of authority, or to whom he is in a position to do some later favour, that may account for the latter's compliance. But there may be no such situation - the two may be strangers to one another, for example - and the explanation of the compliance with the request may be found simply in the obliging nature of the person to whom it is made."" 

132This decision was recently considered by Howie J in the context of causing a person to take a poison contrary to s 39 of the Act; R v Wilhelm [2010] NSWSC 334; 200 A Crim R 413 (19 April 2010). The directions in the present trial were given in August 2009 - prior to this decision. In Wilhelm the accused offered a dose of a drug to Mrs Brimble which he said was like ecstasy but made you ten times hornier. The ingestion of the substance led to her death. Howie J held the offence was not made out if proof went no further than demonstrating that the accused gave Ms Brimble the drug and influenced or encouraged her to take it rather than the taking of the drug being a result of the influence of the provider of the drug over the other person. His Honour said: 

""... But the offence is not one of encouraging or inciting or influencing a person to take a poison, it is one of causing a person to take a poison. 

... But there is a difference, in my view, between a person being in a position of influence over one person and a person influencing another person. They are two very different concepts... 

In my view the use of the words ""cause another person to take"" is to cover that situation where a person in authority over another, for example an adult over a child, orders, commands, or directs the child to take the drug and, therefore, brings about the consequences that the section covers..."" 

133In the present case the Crown concedes the trial judge's instruction to the jury that the person must be ""substantially influenced"" was a misdirection of law. The Crown accepted Howie J's analysis that there is a difference between influencing (or in this case 'substantially influencing') and being in a position of influence over another. 

134The second issue concerned the trial judge's direction that the recipient must make a ""fully informed and voluntary"" decision. The written directions included the following: 

""So the question here is, is it reasonably possible that the named person made a fully informed involuntary ( sic ""and voluntary"") decision to take the poison or noxious thing? Whether that decision was based on their own knowledge and experience of potential dangers associated with taking prescription drugs or based on something that they were told by the accused in the form of a warning about the prescription drugs then you could not be satisfied that the element of the accused causing the named person to take the drugs as been made out. That is you would find that the Crown has not proved this element to you."" (Emphasis added) 

135The concept of a ""fully informed and voluntary decision"" and its relevance to the concept of causation was discussed in R v Kennedy (No. 2) [2008] 1 AC 269 in respect of s23 Offences Against the Person Act 1861 , materially similar to s39 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The House of Lords in Kennedy (No. 2) at [14] and [18] said that a ""voluntary and informed decision"" by a deceased to take drugs was fatal to any contention that the appellant caused the drug to be taken by the deceased. 

136More specifically, Lord Bingham stated at [25] that an act performed by a ""fully-informed and responsible adult"" will always break the chain of causation between the drug supplier and deceased where the deceased freely and voluntarily self-administered the drug and the drug killed him. 

137The appellant submitted that because, in the present case, no explanation was given by the trial judge of the word ""fully"", the jury would have understood that to avoid liability the warning required to be given by the appellant needed to be very extensive. The appellant submitted that no assistance was given to the jury about the content of the warning and whether it must include all relevant pharmacological information about the side effects, the communication of warnings given by suppliers or some lesser level of information. 

138It is clear from the trial judge's direction that his Honour was mindful of the decision in Kennedy (No. 2) . However, Kennedy (No. 2) does not offer any insight into the intended meaning of ""fully"" in this context. Given that the word must be understood in the context of the potential criminal liability of a supplier of a dangerous drug it could not mean the level of knowledge of a person who has all the knowledge that might be available about the drug. To my mind, the fully informed person will be a person who has been given the knowledge which the person who supplies the drug has about the properties and prospective dangers of consuming the drug. This may in some cases be minimal and probably inadequate. In other cases where the supplier has a greater knowledge it may be quite extensive. But I do not believe the criminal law should impose liability by requiring the supplier to pass on knowledge which may be available elsewhere in the community but which he or she does not have. 

139At trial, the appellant made an application for acquittal in respect of counts 3 and 4 (the two charges relating to Brian Hadfield) on the basis that the forensic evidence did not prove a specific cause of death of Mr Hadfield. The application was not made in the terms advanced under this ground of appeal Accordingly leave under rule 4 is required. I would grant that leave. 

140To my mind, the trial judge erred in his written directions on ""cause to take"" in two respects. The term ""fully informed"" was not adequately explained to the jury. Furthermore, as the Crown accepted, the instruction to the jury that a person must be ""substantially influenced"" was not correct. These errors occasioned a miscarriage of justice. 

141I would uphold this ground of appeal. 

Ground 6: The trial judge erred in his direction to the jury on manslaughter by criminal negligence. 

142The trial judge gave directions in relation to manslaughter by criminal negligence which included directions with respect to causation which incorporated the difficulties discussed in ground 5. 

143The Crown also conceded in oral argument that the jury were not given a sufficient direction in relation to the content of the duty of care. The direction given by the trial judge was in the following terms: 

""I direct you therefore as a matter of law that the duty of care which you are called upon to apply here is: a person who has specific knowledge as to the dangers of the use of the two prescription drugs when taken in combination assumes a duty of care to those to whom he can foresee a risk of injury, if he provides the drugs to them believing that they will take them in combination. The person acts in breach of that duty when he or she does something which a reasonable person in his or her position would not do in the circumstances"". 

144Although not explored in the argument the concession made by the Crown was appropriate. However, without the matter having been discussed it would be unwise to embark upon a discussion of the matters which should have been included. 

145Accordingly this ground of appeal must succeed. 

Ground 7: The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence Exhibit W 

146When deciding to admit portions of the ""Dear Dr George"" letter, extracted in part above, His Honour said that a detailed judgment would be provided in due course. That does not seem to have happened. 

147The appellant emphasised that the document contained several references to the appellant's state of mind: 

""my mind and memory are hopelessly inadequate at present to carry out this task. This history is so inadequate to convey the truth of how bad things have been."" (page 8) 

I am tormented as though in a nightmare of burden that the hands of time can never go back and lift when in writing this remember the past, especially that which and must write this history concerning. (page 10) 

my recollection is poor (page 17) 

I can never clearly remember or think"" (page 21) 

148Furthermore, it was submitted that the account of the events involving Mr Bateson and Mr Hadfield appears to have been written in October 2006, that is, 2 years and 5 months after the Bateson incident, and 2 years and 3 months after the Hadfield incident. On the matter in issue in relation to Mr Bateson, the letter says: 

""What is so horrifying is that in the past I had had no memory of having given him any of the medication but I have a vague memory. He asked me for a couple and I gave them to him."" 

149The letter was said to reveal a troubled individual with a rambling and incoherent recollection of many events. 

150In relation to Mr Hadfield, the letter says: 

""Later when manic (poisoned again) I was probably mindlessly espousing the wonders of the very medications that had utterly killed me and laid my life waste and which things terrified me and I hated. But having brought me out of utter suicidal darkness into delusional psychosis again, I was probably singing their praises. 

I must have seemed like a convincing ad for these things and in some strange capacity may have thought I was helping them by telling them to go see their doctor, and when asked - giving then a sample of mine."" 

151It was submitted by the appellant that the evidence should have been excluded either pursuant to s. 90 of the Evidence Act , as being unfair to the appellant or pursuant to s. 137 of the Act because its minimal probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 

152In response the Crown emphasised that the appellant does not challenge the fact that Exhibit W contains relevant admissions. The Crown identified that some of these admissions include (but are not limited to) the fact that: 

Shaun Bateson ""told me all the drugs he used to take"" 
""He [Bateson] asked me for a couple and I gave them to him"" 
""When I was caught I suddenly woke up to what had happened but I could never tell anyone"". 
""Being terrified of effexor and aurorix which by those years nothing else lifted the depression but they gave me blackouts, fainting, seizures, sweats, shocks and stabs in the brain, nightmares, mental instability, mental retardation"". 
""I must have seemed like a convincing ad for these things"". 

153The Crown submitted that Exhibit W was open to competing inferences. Rather than indicating that the appellant had a poor memory and was reconstructing events relating to Hadfield, it was submitted that another reasonable interpretation was that the letter contained snippets of unguarded admissions in narrative form. Accordingly, it was submitted that the interpretation of and inferences to be drawn from Exhibit W were an appropriate question for the jury; R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142. 

154The Crown submitted that the arguments put before this Court about the unfairness of the admission of Exhibit W were made in the Court below and it was within his Honour's discretion to admit the evidence ( Em v R [2006] NSWCCA 336). 

155It has been authoritatively determined that the ""reliability of evidence (is) a factor affecting the fairness of [the admission's] use""; Em v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 67 at [72]. Furthermore, there are suggestions in R v Nelson [2004] NSWCCA 231 at [54-55] that where the characteristics of the person making the admission may affect the reliability of that admission (for instance, intoxication), exclusion under section 90 may not be justified if ""the jury [would be] well able to assess and evaluate [such matters] in weighing the evidence"". 

156In R v Em [2003] NSWCCA 374 at [110] Howie J indicated ""that an assessment of probative value has little significance in the exercise of the discretion"". 

157To my mind, the letter clearly indicates the appellant's confused state of mind and although not contemporaneous does not necessarily involve a reconstruction of events. Relevantly, the trial judge cautioned the jury against accepting the evidence as truth and reminded the jury that the appellant was affected by drugs and psychiatric illness at the times the events were happening. 

158To my mind the admission of Exhibit W did not result in unfairness to the defendant. Any prejudice caused by the unreliability of the letter would have been readily apparent to the jury members and in any event was relevantly addressed by the directions given by the trial judge. 

159With respect to the discretion in s 137 of the Evidence Act the Crown submitted that the fact that the appellant made reference in the letter to his poor memory does not, of itself, show that any probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 

160The Crown also submitted that the directions that were given to the jury properly addressed any prejudicial effect of Exhibit W. This included a warning that the evidence may be unreliable, specific reference to the fact that the letter was not contemporaneous and that the appellant may have been affected by his drug use or psychiatric illness. 

161Neither the appellant nor the Crown made submissions as to how this Court should review the decision of the trial judge. In Vickers v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 60 at [76], Simpson J stated that an ""evaluation"" under s137 ""may only be reviewed on the principles stated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499"". This principle was restated by Howie J in Smale v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 328 at [32] where his Honour said that an appeal court ""will not hold that the discretionary judgment that the application of the section involves has been wrongly determined in favour of the Crown unless it was not reasonably open for the trial judge to admit the evidence"". However, this Court has previously stated that where the facts have been established or are undisputed, ""an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to make that particular decision and thus to conclude that the trial judge was in error"" ( R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 citing Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531 at 551). 

162In the present case I am of the view that the trial judge did not have an advantage over this Court. This Court may consider for itself the ""correct"" result of the balancing exercise. 

163I have indicated that no reasons were provided by his Honour. However, in my view the probative value of the letter is not outweighed by any unfair prejudice and its admission was not unfair to the appellant. To my mind, given the directions by his Honour there was no real possibility that the evidence would have been used by the jury to adopt an illegitimate form of reasoning or that the jury would have given the evidence unfair weight. 

164I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Orders 

Accordingly, for those reasons I joined in the making of the following orders: 
1. Appeal upheld. 
2. Quash the conviction in relation to counts 1, 4 and 7 and order that verdicts of acquittal be entered with respect to those counts. 

165HOEBEN J: I agree with the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL. 

166GROVE AJ: I agree with the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL and hence for joining in the orders made on 14 September 2011 in this appeal.

		09 November 2011",2011-09-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757853,R v Smith (No 4) [2011] NSWSC 1082,"Judgment  1Darren Paul Smith (the offender) stands for sentence following his conviction by a jury of the murder of Russell Lyons at Fairfield on 3 June 1995.  The maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment.  As the offence was committed before the legislation which provides for the fixing of standard non-parole periods was introduced, it follows that no standard non-parole period is applicable in this case.  2It now falls to me to determine the factual basis upon which the offender should be sentenced.  In doing so I must proceed in accordance with the principles enunciated in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377 - 8.  My task in this regard is made considerably easier because the areas in relation to which the parties are in dispute fall into a narrow compass.  3The deceased's body was located in a carpark at the end of a laneway which runs off Smart Street in Fairfield at about 8.40 am on 3 June 1995.   According to Dr Peter Ellis, who conducted the post-mortem, his death was caused by head injuries with alcohol toxicity also said to have been a contributing factor.  Indeed the deceased had a blood alcohol reading of 0.287.  When his body was discovered, the deceased was fully clothed but his  wallet and shoes were missing.  Despite a lengthy police investigation, it was not until 7 June 2009 that the offender was arrested.  Indeed, he only came to the attention of investigating police when a DNA profile matching his profile connected him to the crime scene.  His DNA profile was not entered onto the national database until 2008 following his apprehension in Queensland in relation to an offence of stealing a bicycle.  Following analysis, a match was made between the offender's profile and DNA material that was located inside each shoe of a pair of Adidas running shoes.  The shoes themselves were located on 5 June 1995, a short distance from where the deceased's body was found.  Also found on the shoes was blood which matched the deceased's DNA profile.  A DNA profile matching that of the offender was also located in the area of the rear right pocket of the jeans which the deceased was wearing when his body was discovered.  The Crown case, which the jury clearly accepted, was that the offender killed the deceased whilst he was in the process of robbing him of his wallet.  It is common ground that it is implicit in the jury's verdict that the Adidas shoes had been worn by the offender but had then been discarded by him when he realised that the deceased's blood had found its way onto them during the course of the fatal attack.  It is quite possible that the offender then placed the deceased's shoes on his own feet when he left the scene.  4The narrative of events however commenced several hours prior to the discovery of the deceased's body.  At about 3.30 am an attempt had been made to steal the deceased's wallet during an altercation which occurred on The Crescent, Fairfield.  That incident was witnessed by the deceased's friends and drinking companions, John Byrne and Ian Cross.  Their evidence was to the effect that they had been out drinking in the company of the deceased at various establishments that evening and that they were making their way home at the time that the incident occurred.  It is apparent that each of them was, by that stage, extremely intoxicated.  Each of them gave evidence that the deceased had crossed the street when they heard him call out words to the effect of ""he's got my wallet"".  The effect of their evidence is that they then ran across the road in order to assist the deceased.  They described his assailant as being an Australian with a goatee beard.  It is common ground that the jury must have concluded that that person was the offender.  I will proceed upon that basis.  Their evidence also establishes that the deceased retrieved his wallet which had fallen to the ground.  Shortly thereafter three males, described as being of Islander appearance, joined in the altercation.  In due course the deceased ran from the scene of the altercation and turned into Smart Street.  He then ended up in the carpark to which I referred earlier.  The jury clearly accepted that it was at that location that the deceased received the fatal injury or injuries, having been pursued there by the offender.  5However, the evidence is silent as to precisely what occurred to the deceased between the point in time after he turned into Smart Street following the altercation on The Crescent which, as I have said, was at about 3.30 am and the discovery of his body some 5 hours later.  That being so, it will now be necessary to refer to the conflict in the evidence between John Byrne and Ian Cross as to what occurred once the three Islander men involved themselves in the altercation.  Ian Cross gave evidence that the three Islander men became engaged in an argument with the group which consisted of himself, the deceased and John Byrne.  This was after one of the Islander men, whom he identified as having dreadlocks, had struck the offender.  That had apparently occurred after the Islander man had been informed that the offender had attempted to steal the deceased's wallet.  In response, the offender had said that in fact he was the victim of a theft at the hands of the deceased, an exchange that prompted the Islander man to then strike the deceased.  Ian Cross gave evidence that he saw that man strike the deceased twice.  He observed that those blows caused the deceased to bleed.  The next thing that he observed of the deceased was that he had moved some distance away to the intersection of The Crescent and Smart Street.  He said that at that location he had seen the same Islander man ""belting into"" the deceased.  The effect of his evidence was that the deceased had been struck by the man, in all, on four occasions.  In re-examination he said that he thought that the blows were struck to the deceased's face and that he was bleeding from the mouth in the way one does after sustaining a cut lip.  6John Byrne, on the other hand, gave evidence that the Islander man merely kicked the deceased in the leg.  He also said that he saw the offender turn around the same corner (which was clearly a reference to Smart Street) that he had seen the deceased go around.  The distance between them, he estimated, was ""probably 20, 30 metres"".  Clearly enough, the blow which he observed the deceased receive could not have been fatal.  7The Crown submitted, on this aspect of the matter, that the evidence of John Byrne should be preferred to that given by Ian Cross.  I would not be prepared to accept the evidence of John Byrne on any issue that was not otherwise corroborated.  That is because of the astonishing amount of alcohol which he admitted having consumed, over an extended period of time, in the lead-up to the events about which he gave evidence.    Moreover, his perception of events, and his capacity to recall them, must also have been affected by the fact that, as he said in his evidence, he had also been assaulted by one of the Islander men.  That said, the fact that Ian Cross, by his own admission was also significantly intoxicated at the time, must also have affected his reliability.  Nevertheless, he had been drinking for about 8 hours less than John Byrne.  I am prepared to accept his evidence that he observed the Islander male strike the deceased about the face.  Indeed, there is a measure of support for his version of events in the observations of two other persons, Alan Jones and Constable Black, who each gave evidence of having seen a person (whom it can be inferred was the deceased) go to the ground in that general area at about that stage of the night. I am unable, however, to determine the precise number of blows that were inflicted, or indeed the extent of any injuries that may have been occasioned to the deceased at that time beyond the fact that whatever occurred caused him to bleed.  The consequence of that finding is that I accept that at least some of the injuries which the deceased sustained and which were apparent when his body was discovered, were not caused by the offender.  On the other hand, the jury's verdict clearly establishes that, regardless of how many blows were administered to the deceased on The Crescent by the Islander male, that man did not cause his death.  8Dr Ellis created a number of diagrams which revealed the nature and extent of the deceased's injuries.  It is readily apparent that the accused sustained a number of abrasions to his body and to the area of his head and face.  The fatal injury however was a large subdural haematoma which he sustained to the back of his skull.  Detective Flippence gave evidence that there were blood spatter patterns on the ground in front of where the deceased was lying as well as on a nearby wall.  That evidence lent support to the proposition that the event that had caused those patterns had occurred in that vicinity and, in turn, to the related proposition that the fatal injury or injuries were occasioned to him in the area in which his body was located.  Moreover, the fact that no trail of blood was found leading from The Crescent to where the deceased's body was located lends further credence to that conclusion.  It is also clear that the extensive injuries which the deceased sustained were not capable of being completely explained by the kind of attack which Ian Cross described as having been inflicted upon him.  9The Crown case, being entirely circumstantial in nature, depended upon the drawing of inferences.  The Crown relied upon a number of pockets of evidence, the centrepiece of which was the DNA evidence to which I have already referred.  It was given by Dr Bruce, a forensic biologist with the Division of Analytical Laboratories.  In respect of the DNA evidence, the jury was directed that there were two intermediate facts that had to be established by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt.  The first was that the DNA profiles which were located inside the Adidas shoes and on the deceased's jeans were in fact those of the offender.  (I interpolate that there was evidence that other DNA profiles had been located on the shoes and that the offender had been excluded as a contributor to those profiles).  The second intermediate fact was that the DNA was deposited in the shoes and on the jeans in the circumstances asserted by the Crown and not as a result, for example, of contamination or secondary transference. Although a spirited challenge was made to the DNA evidence, particularly in relation to the issue of secondary transference, it is readily apparent that the jury accepted the Crown's contention that there was no reasonable doubt about either of those intermediate facts.  Next, there was evidence, from which it could be inferred that the offender had had the opportunity to commit the crime, because for a period of time during the first part of 1995 he had lived on The Horsley Drive, Fairfield.  That location was within walking distance of the crime scene.  There was also evidence that the offender matched the description given by the eyewitnesses, John Byrne and Ian Cross, of the person who had attempted to steal the deceased's wallet on The Crescent.  Although there was no direct evidence of his appearance on 3 June 1995, there was photographic evidence, as well as oral evidence given by witnesses who knew the offender during the relevant timeframe, that he was accustomed to sporting a goatee beard at around that time.  There was also evidence from a podiatrist, Dr Paul Bennett, who compared the Adidas shoes which were seized from the crime scene with footwear taken from the offender, together with impressions and plaster casts made of the offender's feet, in 2009.  Dr Bennett's opinion was that he was unable, in light of his conclusion that there were points of similarity between the wear patterns on the Adidas shoes and those on the offender's footwear as well as the other items to which I have referred, to exclude the offender as the probable wearer of the shoes.  The effect of his evidence was that whilst the offender may have been the wearer of the Adidas shoes, equally he may not have been.  The jury was nevertheless warned about the potential unreliability of Dr Bennett's opinion.  10As was his entitlement, the offender did not provide his version of events to police.  Nor did he give or call evidence in his case at the trial.  The case which was presented on his behalf was that he was not responsible for the death of Russell Lyons, or for attempting to steal his wallet on The Crescent.  It was contended by counsel for the offender that there were a number of other persons who could have been responsible for the death.  Indeed, there were a not inconsiderable number of persons whom the police initially suspected may have been responsible for his death (who were described as ""persons of interest"") together with other persons upon whom suspicion should, so it was submitted, have descended.  Understandably, there was considerable focus upon that issue at the trial because the Crown was required, in seeking to prove its case, to exclude the reasonable possibility that someone other than the offender was responsible for Russell Lyons' death.  In that context, counsel for the offender was critical of various aspects of the initial police investigation and, in particular, the failure to explore lines of enquiry which, it was suggested, ought to have been pursued.  Counsel for the offender submitted to the jury that one of the persons who either was, or should have been, under suspicion, may have been one of the three unidentified Islander males who involved themselves in the altercation with the deceased on The Crescent.  11An alternative submission was put to the jury on behalf of the offender in the event that it concluded that he was the person who attempted to steal the deceased's wallet on The Crescent.  It was again central to this submission that the fatal blow was administered by the unidentified Islander male on The Crescent.  The submission rested upon the evidence of Ian Cross, to which I referred earlier, and to parts of the evidence of Dr Ellis.  In cross-examination Dr Ellis conceded that one punch may have caused the fatal injury.  Furthermore, he agreed that he could not exclude the reasonable possibility that that punch may have been inflicted during the altercation on The Crescent.  Moreover, he agreed that he could not exclude the reasonable possibility that the deceased had then made his way around the corner and into the laneway where his body was discovered.  He also agreed that he could not exclude the reasonable possibility that the deceased had then fallen onto the concrete slab causing the fracture of his nose.  Finally, Dr Ellis concluded that he could not exclude the reasonable possibility that the deceased had then tried to raise himself up but had once more fallen onto the concrete slab where there was a pooling of his blood.  The jury also rejected this alternative argument.  12The Crown case on murder was put on alternative bases.  According to the first basis, the offender caused the death of Russell Lyons by an unlawful and deliberate act that was done with either an intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm.  According to the alternative basis, which is described as either felony murder or constructive murder, the offender caused the death of Russell Lyons by an unlawful and deliberate act done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission by him of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.  The foundational crime upon which the Crown relied in the present case was an offence of stealing or robbery committed in circumstances of aggravation.  The relevant elements of that offence, which is to be found in s 96 of the Crimes Act 1900, are that the offender stole property from the person of Russell Lyons (being his wallet and shoes) and during the course of that theft he used physical violence upon Russell Lyons thereby inflicting grievous bodily harm to him.  The parties are in agreement that I should proceed to sentence the offender upon this alternative basis.  I see no reason not to do so.  Certainly the location of a DNA profile consistent with that of the offender inside the deceased's rear right pocket (which is where he kept his wallet) provided powerful evidence that the offender was intent on robbing the deceased of his wallet, which as I have said, was not recovered.  The location of a profile consistent with the offender's DNA profile inside each of the Adidas shoes serves to strengthen that inference.  As I have said, no evidence was adduced to explain the presence of that material.  13In summary, I accept that the offender followed the deceased from The Crescent into the carpark off Smart Street and whilst there again attempted to rob him of his wallet.  Even though he was very intoxicated, it is highly likely that the deceased offered some form of resistance.  I infer that in seeking to overcome that resistance, the offender then struck the deceased the blow to the back of his head which caused the subdural haemorrhage that proved fatal.  The number of separate injuries which the deceased sustained to his face and head, and their location, tend to suggest that the deceased was struck on more than one occasion by the offender.  That said, I accept that some of the abrasions may well have been caused when the deceased's head hit the ground.  In any event, I am unable to determine precisely how many such blows were struck and indeed how they were administered.  I am acutely aware that I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any fact that would serve to aggravate the offence.  That being so, I cannot, for example, determine to the requisite standard that the deceased's blood found its way onto the Adidas shoes as a result of his having been kicked by the offender.  What makes this case unusual is that at least some of the injuries which the deceased sustained, although not of course the fatal injury or injuries, were occasioned, as I have found, by someone other than the offender.  That feature of the case also serves to complicate the sentencing process.  In those circumstances, considerable mystery still remains as to the precise circumstances in which Russell Lyons died.  14As I have said, the offender stands to be sentenced upon the basis that he is guilty of constructive murder.  In that respect, I must be guided by what was said in R v Jacobs ; R v Mehajer (2004) 151 A Crim R 452, in which Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said:  Constructive murder is not to be regarded as less serious, and thereby attracting a lighter total sentence or non-parole period than that which is appropriate for other categories of murder: R v Mills (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, Gleeson CJ, Cole JA and Sperling J, No 60306 of 1994, 3 April 1995). Just as is the case for the other categories, there are degrees of seriousness of constructive murder, and the determination of the appropriate  sentence for any individual offence depends upon the nature of the offender's conduct and the part which he or she played in the events giving rise to death: R v JB [1999] NSWCCA 93. [at para 332]  15I have received victim impact statements from Russell Lyons' mother, Lorrain Lyons, his sister, Michelle and his brother Jason.  The feelings which they have so eloquently and poignantly expressed and the grief which they and the remainder of their family have suffered is entirely understandable.  It is quite impossible to adequately summarise that sense of loss in a few sentences and to do so, or to attempt to do so, would detract from the contents of their statements.  Clearly, no sentence which any court could impose can ever begin to make good that loss.  I extend to the family and friends of the deceased my deepest sympathy.  The approach of a sentencing judge to statements of this kind is nevertheless now well settled:  see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; R v FD & JD (2006) 160 A Crim R 392; MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226.  16I have gleaned some background information about the offender from a psychological report, which was prepared on his behalf by Ms Debbie Case.  The offender was born in 1966 and is now aged 45.  His childhood was unremarkable.  He grew up in the Liverpool area and left school after completing Year 8.  He has two sisters with whom he remains in intermittent contact.  His parents separated when the offender was 16.  His relationship with his alcoholic father was marred by conflict and he has had only infrequent contact with him in recent years.  However, the offender remains close to his mother and it is a measure of her enduring support for him that she attended his trial on a daily basis.  17When the offender first left school he was employed as an upholsterer.  Since then he has worked as a truck driver and in a variety of positions entailing manual labour.  Although for many years he lived a transient existence, he appears nonetheless to have remained in fairly regular employment.  The offender's history suggests that he has developed a significant dependence upon alcohol and that he has been, for many years, a regular user of marijuana.  He has been involved in a number of relationships, none of which have apparently lasted.  In 2007 he met a woman in Bowen and they formed a relationship.  The relationship flourished to the extent that the couple were due to be married in September 2009.  A month prior to his arrest, the offender's first child, a daughter, was born.  After he was remanded in custody the offender was able (at least initially) to maintain contact with his partner and their daughter.  However, upon his release to bail some time later, his partner terminated the relationship and he has not had contact with either of them since.  The offender expressed genuine distress and despair at the loss of that contact.  He told Ms Case that he has experienced feelings of hopelessness about his present circumstances.  He is also said to be anxious about the sentence which he will receive.  Ms Case administered various tests to the offender and concluded that there was ""no evidence of any formal thought disorder"".  It is accepted by counsel for the offender that since he continues to maintain his innocence, he is unable to obtain the benefit of any reduction of sentence for remorse.  18I have also been furnished with affidavits sworn by Carol Ann Smith and Diana Micallef.  Ms Smith is married to the offender's father and had contact with the offender after he moved to Bowen in the period around 2006/2007.  She confirms the strength of his feelings towards his daughter and the sense of loss that he experienced when he lost contact with her.  Ms Micallef is a very close friend of the offender's mother and has known the offender all his life.  She also spoke of the offender's sense of grief following the loss of contact with his partner and their daughter.  She reported that during the period whilst he was on bail, the offender undertook gardening and landscaping work at the property which Ms Micallef shared with her husband.  Ms Micallef spoke highly of his personal qualities.  She also reported that the offender had, whilst in custody prior to obtaining bail, ""commenced studying the Christian faith and ... was regularly reading the Holy Bible"".  She also said that he had attended church services whilst in prison, a practice which he continued when he was released on bail.  19The offender has a criminal record both in this State and in Queensland.  His criminal record in New South Wales commenced in 1982 when he was placed on probation in the Children's Court in respect of offences of break, enter and steal.  Over the following twelve months he was dealt with on three further occasions in the Children's Court for offences of goods in custody;  break, enter and steal; malicious injury and drive in a manner dangerous.  In 1986 he appeared in the Local Court on three separate occasions and was dealt with for further offences of dishonesty.  In 1987 he was convicted of a lower range PCA offence.  His only prior offence of violence in this State was a conviction in 1988 for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in respect of which he received a fine of $150.  In 1989 he was dealt with for behaving in an offensive manner.  His only conviction in New South Wales since then was in 2003 when he was dealt with for possessing a prohibited drug.  None of his convictions in New South Wales have resulted in the imposition of a custodial sentence.  20His Queensland record commenced in 1985 when he was dealt with for minor driving offences.  Between 1988 and 1993 the offender appeared in courts in that State on a reasonably regular basis in respect of offences of receiving, wilful damage, possessing stolen property, possessing a prohibited drug and for breaching various court orders.  In 1990 he was placed on a good behaviour bond for stealing from the person.  Since 1995 he has been before the courts in that State on two occasions.  In 1999 he was fined $200 in respect of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and in 2007 he was placed on a good behaviour bond for 6 months for stealing a bicycle, a matter to which I referred at the outset of these remarks.  His only custodial sentence in Queensland was for a period of five months in 1990 in respect of an offence of unlawful use of a motor vehicle.  21In approaching the task of sentencing the offender, I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act).  I must also pay due regard to the various aggravating and mitigating factors identified in s 21A of the Act which have particular relevance to the case.  22The starting point for any assessment of the objective gravity of the offence is the fact that the life of an entirely innocent and blameless young man has been taken as a result of the offender's actions.  It may be accepted that the death of Russell Lyons was not intended, and perhaps not even contemplated, by the offender.  Nor is there any evidence that a weapon was used in the fatal attack.  That said, and notwithstanding the fact that the Crown does not contend that the offence entailed the presence of any aggravating features, it is nevertheless to be observed that the offence occurred against the background of an attempt by the offender to commit the serious crime of robbery.  Furthermore, the offence features a degree of persistence on his part.  It is apparent that he was not deflected from his plan to rob the deceased of his wallet by what occurred during the altercation on The Crescent.  On the contrary, he followed the deceased into Smart Street with the intention of completing his task.  He was nothing if not determined.  Moreover, it can be inferred that the deceased's state of intoxication made him an easier target in that respect than might otherwise have been the case, especially because, as I have found, he had already sustained injuries as a result of the assault upon him by the Islander man on The Crescent.  23Because the offence was committed more than 16 years ago, it is appropriate to repeat what I said in R v Armstrong [2010] NSWSC 800.  In that case I had occasion to sentence an offender for a murder committed in 1991.  I there said that:  ...it is plainly apparent that the sentencing regime that now exists would expose the offender to a decidedly more severe penalty than the one which prevailed at the time of the offence. However, it is common ground that I must sentence the offender in accordance with sentencing practices and patterns which prevailed at the time the offence was committed: see R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368. Although caution must be exercised in relying upon statistical material, I have nonetheless derived considerable assistance from the Judicial Commission's report entitled ""Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1990-1993"". I have had regard only to the sentences imposed upon the offenders to whom s 19A of the Crimes (Life Sentences) Act 1989, which was inserted on 12 January 1990, applied. 93 such offenders were sentenced in the period covered by the study. 43% of those offenders received a minimum term greater than 8 years but not exceeding 12 years, whilst 35.5% of offenders received a minimum term greater than 12 years but not exceeding 16 years. 64.5% of offenders received a full term greater than 14 years and up to 20 years. The authors of the monograph conclude that ""the typical sentence for murder under s 19A might be described as a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of 6 years, making a total sentence of 18 years"". In so concluding, it would appear that the authors made no differentiation between those offenders who pleaded guilty and those who did not.  [at para 28]  24My attention has been drawn to a subsequent report entitled ""Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1994-2001"".  It records the following information:  Head sentences imposed on murder offenders in this study ranged from a minimum of 9 years to a maximum life sentence. Life sentences were imposed on 17 offenders. ...  Non-parole periods imposed on murder offenders ranged from 5 years to life, while the longest determinate non-parole period was 35 years. The median non-parole period was 13 years 6 months.  These figures were consistent with the Judicial Commission's first homicide study, in which all murderers received prison sentences of at least 9 years duration and a typical sentence for those sentenced under the new s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 was a full term of 18 years with a minimum period of 12 years.  Other research has also shown that in recent years, the sentencing pattern for murder has been quite consistent. Baker reported that murder sentences for the 8-year period of 1990-1997 were ""stable"", with the average non-parole period for 6 of the 8 years being in the range of 11 years to 12 years 2 months.  Fitzgerald reported murder sentences as stable over the 11-year period of 1990-2000, with the annual average non-parole period ranging from 11 years 2.4 months to 15 years 8 months. Seven of  the 11 years recorded average non-parole periods for murder in the range of 11 years 8.8 months to 13 years 2.9 months.  25I have also been furnished with summaries of 11 instances of what are said to be comparable cases decided in the period between 1991 and 1995, being cases in which the death in question occurred during the course of a robbery.  Although I am of course aware of the limitations in considering material of that kind, I have nonetheless derived some additional assistance from an examination of it.  26I referred earlier to the offender's criminal record.  It contains a number of entries for matters of dishonesty which the offender committed more than 20 years ago.  Of greater relevance in the present context are convictions in 1989 for assault occasioning bodily harm and in 1990 for stealing from the person, although the penalties which those offences attracted suggest that they were not particularly serious instances of such matters.  Although his record does not reflect favourably upon him, it merely operates to deprive him of the type of leniency that might otherwise have been afforded to him had he not come to the notice of the authorities.  27Since the commission of this offence in 1995, the offender appears to have matured considerably and the only matter of any real significance is the conviction in 1999 for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  In all the circumstances to which I have referred, and given the age which he will have reached by the time he is eventually released on parole, I would regard his prospects of rehabilitation as being more than reasonable.  Indeed, the Crown did not suggest to the contrary.  28It is clear from what I have said that there has been a delay in bringing the proceedings to finality.  In R v Blanco (1999) 106 A Crim R 303, Wood CJ at CL with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said:  The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left;  secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period;  and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach:  see, in addition to Todd and Mill , the decisions in Harrison (1990) 48 A Crim R 197 at 198-199 and King (1998) 99 A Crim R 288.  [at para 16]  29I have already referred to the offender's ""demonstrated progress towards rehabilitation"".  This is not a case in which the state of ""uncertain suspense"" should weigh in the offender's favour.  See R v Hathaway [2005] NSWCCA 368 [at 43] and R v Shorten [2005] NSWCCA 106 [at 19].  I am prepared however to factor, albeit in a fairly limited fashion, ""a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach"" into the overall sentencing process on account of the lengthy delay which has occurred in this case.  30The material contained in the Judicial Commission monographs reveals that the relationship which the minimum term or non-parole period bore to the head sentence during the relevant time period was usually less than the normal statutory proportion of 75% which now exists.  The parties agreed that that consideration provides a sufficient basis for making a finding of ""special circumstances"".  Nevertheless in setting the non-parole period, I have borne in mind the need to fix the minimum period which the offender must spend in custody: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704.  31I have referred several times to the fact that the offender was for a period of time on bail.  It is common ground that the offender spent 14 months and 8 days in custody prior to being released on bail.  Bail was revoked on 7 July 2011 following the jury's verdict.  In those circumstances, it is also common ground that the sentence should commence on 30 April 2010 to reflect that period of pre-sentence custody.  Sentence  32For the murder of Russell Lyons, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 years with a total term of imprisonment of 18 years to date from 30 April 2010.  The total term will expire on 29 April 2028 and the offender will be eligible for release on parole on 29 April 2022.          .  33I recommend that the warrant be endorsed in the following terms:  That Darren Smith be monitored closely in connection with suicidal ideation.  Furthermore that Darren Smith be assessed by an appropriate health professional in the Corrective Service institution where he is remanded and that he receive appropriate treatment.  34I direct that the report of Ms Debbie Case, dated 10 August 2011, be attached to the warrant and that it be brought to the attention of the appropriate authority within Corrective Services (NSW).  **********

2757863,Police v William Michael CANNON [2011] NSWLC 29,"JUDGMENT and Reasons for Decision 

Background 

1The Accused comes before the Court charged with three counts of obtaining a benefit by deception, contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. The matter came before the Court on 21 December 2010, at which time it was specially fixed for a two-day hearing to commence on 16 March 2011. The matter was set down for mention on 22 February 2011, at which time the special fixture was confirmed. The Accused was legally represented on 21 December 2010 when the matter was fixed for hearing and, indeed, on the two prior occasions when the matter came before the Court. 

2On 4 March 2011, the Accused's then solicitor wrote to the Court advising that he no longer held instructions and withdrew from the proceedings. On the morning of the hearing on 16 March 2011, the Accused appeared unrepresented and made an application to vacate the hearing date. Notice that such application would be made was not provided to the Court until oral submissions were made by the Accused on the morning of the hearing. Notice that such application would be made was not provided to the prosecution until the day before the hearing when the Accused telephoned the prosecutor to inform him of his position. The application was opposed by the prosecution and, after considering the matter, I delivered an ex tempore decision for the refusal of the application to vacate the special fixture as I was not satisfied that there were cogent and compelling reasons to depart from the practice of ensuring the efficient and expeditious conduct of proceedings, as required by Practice Note 1 of 2001 - Vacating Hearing Dates and Applications for Adjournment applicable in this jurisdiction. I do not propose to replicate my reasons for the refusal in this judgment. A short adjournment was granted to enable the Accused to make a phone call, and upon resuming, the matter proceeded by way of a defended hearing, the Accused being self-represented. 

3At the close of the prosecution case on the second day of the hearing, the Accused made a further application for an adjournment to enable witnesses in support of the Defence case to be called, some of whom were said to be incarcerated and others in respect of whom attendance arrangements were simply not made whether by way of subpoena or otherwise. The prosecution opposed the application, but was mindful of the necessity that the Accused be afforded every opportunity to present all relevant evidence in support of his case. Given that the prosecution case had closed, I carefully considered the application and acceded to the Accused's request in order to ensure that his right to a fair trial was not infringed and so as to avoid the possibility of a miscarriage of justice having regard to his lack of representation. The matter was adjourned and continued on 25 May 2011 and 29 August 2011, on which days the Accused was legally represented and the Defence case was put. 

4The three Court Attendance Notices on which the prosecution was founded particularised the alleged offences as follows: - 

Sequence 1: Obtaining money/valuable thing/financial advantage by deception between 10.00 a.m. on 1 March 2009 and 10.00 a.m. on 3 April 2009 at Belfield, in that the Accused dishonestly obtained for himself the sum of $400,000.00 by deception, namely, by submitting a mortgage application for Mark Anthony, that was guaranteed by his parents, without consent. 

Sequence 2: Obtaining money/valuable thing/financial advantage by deception between 10.00 a.m. on 1 April 2009 and 10.00 a.m. on 17 April 2009 at Clemton Park, in that the Accused dishonestly obtained for himself the sum of $70,000.00 by deception, namely, by submitting a mortgage application for Mr and Mrs Abouhaidar without their consent. 

Sequence 3: Obtaining money/valuable thing/financial advantage by deception between 10.00 a.m. on 1 May 2009 and 10.00 a.m. on 30 May 2009 at Hillsdale, in that the Accused dishonestly obtained for himself the sum of $120,000.00 by deception, namely, by submitting a mortgage application for Mr and Mrs Vaxavanis without their consent. 

5Oral evidence was adduced by the prosecution from the following persons: 

(a)The officer in charge, Senior Constable Warren Metcalfe; 

(b)Mr Michael Foy, the sole director and secretary of M Foy Pty Limited and Speedy Gantry Hire Pty Limited, companies being listed as lenders/mortgagees under various loan agreements; 

(c)Ms Stella Kitson, the daughter of, and donee under a Power of Attorney from, Mrs Frida Vaxavanis, an elderly lady listed as one of the co-borrowers under a Loan Agreement and Mortgage between M Foy Pty Limited (as lender/mortgagee) and Mr Hercules Vaxavanis and Mrs Frida Vaxavanis (as borrowers/mortgagors) (""the Vaxavanis loan""); 

(d)Mr George Abouhaidar, listed as one of the co-borrowers under a Loan Agreement and Mortgage between Speedy Gantry Hire Pty Limited (as lender/mortgagee) and Mr George Abouhaidar and Mrs Monica Abouhaidar (as borrowers/mortgagors) (""the Abouhaidar loan"");

(f)Mr Melhem Azzam, with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter, listed as one of the co-mortgagors/co-guarantors under a Loan Agreement, Mortgage and Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity between Speedy Gantry Hire Pty Limited (as lender/mortgagee), Mr Mark Anthony (as borrower) and Mr Melhem Azzam and Mrs Therese Azzam (as mortgagors/guarantors) (""the Azzam loan""); 

(g)Mrs Therese Azzam, with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter, listed as one of the co-mortgagors/co-guarantors under a Loan Agreement between Speedy Gantry Hire Pty Limited (as lender/mortgagee), Mr Mark Anthony (as borrower) and Mr Melhem Azzam and Mrs Therese Azzam (as mortgagors/guarantors); and 

(h)Mr Mark Anthony, the son of Mr Melhem Azzam and Mrs Therese Azzam, listed as the borrower under a Loan Agreement between Speedy Gantry Hire Pty Limited (as lender/mortgagee) and Mr Jeremy Anthony (as borrower). 

6Oral evidence was adduced by the Defence from the following persons: - 

(a)The Accused; and 

(b)Mr George Gourlas, the solicitor for M Foy Pty Limited and Speedy Gantry Hire Pty Limited, companies being listed as lenders/mortgagees under various loan agreements. 

Overview 

7This is a case in which it was alleged that the Accused, a finance broker, dishonestly obtained the proceeds of three loans, totalling $590,000, by deception, via three separate loan transactions resulting in the lenders' interests being secured over the properties of each purported borrower, mortgagor and guarantor, without their knowledge or consent. 

8Putting aside the loan documents executed by Mr Mark Anthony, the son of Mr Melhem Azzam and Mrs Therese Azzam, listed as the borrower under a Loan Agreement between Speedy Gantry Hire Pty Limited (as lender/mortgagee), Mr Mark Anthony (as borrower) and Mr Melhem Azzam and Mrs Therese Azzam (as mortgagors/guarantors), it was alleged that all other loan and mortgage documents were forged. 

9Expert evidence as to this fact was not adduced. Whilst I have reservations as to the authenticity of the signatures purporting to be of the various borrowers, mortgagors and guarantors, and indeed the witnesses to those signatures, in the absence of expert evidence, a conclusion of forgery and associated motive can only be arrived at via inferential means, to which reference is made later in these reasons. 

Applicable legal principles 

10The charges preferred by the prosecution were founded on s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900, which was the relevant provision at the time of the alleged offences. Section 178BA has since been repealed by the Crimes Amendment (Fraud, Identity and Forgery Offences) Act 2009, which commenced on 22 February 2010 and made extensive amendments to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), as it pertains to fraud, identity, forgery and other related offences. The amending Act inserted an exhaustive statutory definition of dishonesty (an element of the offence the subject of the current proceedings) and increased various maximum penalties prescribed by statute. The successor to s 178BA is now contained in s 192E of the Crimes Act 1900 . To avoid doubt, these reasons are based entirely on the law as it stood at the time of the respective alleged offences between March 2009 and May 2009. 

11At the relevant time, section 178BA(1) and (2) provided as follows: 

178BA Obtaining money etc by deception 

(1) Whosoever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 

In subsection (1): 
""deception"" means deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law, including:

(a) a deception as to the present intentions of the person using the deception or of any other person, and 
(b) an act or thing done or omitted to be done with the intention of causing: 

(i) a computer system, or 
(ii) a machine that is designed to operate by means of payment or identification, 
to make a response that the person doing or omitting to do the act or thing is not authorised to cause the computer system or machine to make. 

12If there were any issue as to whether the financial advantage said to have been obtained by the Accused was obtained through or for his business entity, WC Financial Services, s 21(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 resolves this issue by providing a definition for ""person"" as including an individual, a corporation and a body corporate or politic. 

13As the total amount under the various loans, namely $590,000, being the value of the money which the prosecution alleges was obtained by the Accused in contravention of s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900, exceeded $5,000, the proceedings were dealt with summarily as neither the prosecution nor the Accused elected that they be dealt with on indictment: Schedule 1, Table 1, Part 2, Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

14In R v Licardy (unreported, NSWCCA, 26/5/95), the Court of Criminal Appeal summarised the elements of an offence under s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) as: 

(1)The Accused by a deception, 
(2)Dishonestly obtained for himself or another person, 
(3)Money, a valuable thing, or a financial advantage. 
 
15I refer, later in these reasons, to the additional ingredient that there be a causal connection between the deception and the financial advantage. 

16It is appropriate at this point to outline some of the salient principles which bear upon the decision this Court is ultimately required to make. 

17By virtue of the definition of 'deception' in s 178BA(2), the import of the word is widely encompassing. 

18In Corporate Affairs Commission v Papoulias (1990) 20 NSWLR 503, Allen J (at 506) described deception as being the ""intentional inducing in another of a state of mind which [the accused] knows does not accord with fact."" 

19In Balcombe v De Simoni (1972) 126 CLR 576, Gibbs J (at 593) (with whom Menzies J agreed) adopted the reasoning outlined in Re London and Globe Finance Corp Ltd [1903] 1 Ch 728 (at 732) as to what ""with intent to defraud"" meant: - 

To deceive is, I apprehend, to induce a man to believe that a thing is true which is false, and which the person practising the deceit knows or believes to be false. To defraud is to deprive by deceit: it is by deceit to induce a man to act to his injury. More tersely it may be put, that to deceive is by falsehood to induce a state of mind; to defraud is by deceit to induce a course of action. 

20Matters such as this often call for an instruction as to the legal nature of the elements of the offence. As to the appropriate trial direction in matters of dishonesty, in Glenister v R [1980] 2 NSWLR 597, which involved the fraudulent misappropriation of company property by a director, and in which the Court of Criminal Appeal treated fraud and dishonesty as synonymous at law, the Court held (at 607) that: 

It will be sufficient if the trial judge instructs the jury that the Crown must prove that the accused acted dishonestly. It is unnecessary for him to go further and define dishonesty. It is enough if he informs the jury that, in deciding whether an application was or was not dishonest, they should apply the current standards of ordinary decent people: R v Feely [1973] 1 All ER 341. 

21The effect of this decision was to set in train a multitude of decisions that became a matter of some controversy. Notwithstanding that the present proceedings were dealt with summarily, the Court, sitting both as the trier of fact and law, is required to ensure that it properly instructs itself as if it were directing a jury had the matter been dealt with on indictment. 

22The decision in Glenister v R was preceded, and influenced to a great extent, by the English Court of Appeal decision in R v Feely [1973] 1 All ER 341, where it had been decided that dishonesty, under the legislation in question, related only to the state of mind of the accused. The decision in Glenister v R was followed by the English Court of Appeal decision in R v Ghosh [1982] 2 All ER 689 which held that dishonesty described not a course of conduct but a state of mind which could not be established independently of the knowledge and belief of the accused and, in determining whether the accused had acted dishonestly, the test was first whether the accused's actions had been dishonest according to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people and, if so, whether the accused himself had realised that his actions were, according to those standards, dishonest. 

23In R v McQueeney (1989) 39 A Crim R 56, a similar approach was arrived at whereby the Court of Criminal Appeal (per Gleeson CJ, as he then was) held that: 

The principal complaint that was made about the directions given by the learned trial judge in relation to the ingredients of the charge of fraudulent misappropriation was that his Honour inappropriately confused ""subjective"" and ""objective"" aspects of dishonesty. In my view that is not a valid criticism of the summing up of the learned trial judge. His Honour pointed out to the jury that subjective dishonesty was a necessary element of the charge of fraudulent misappropriation, and in that connection he informed the jury that a person may engage in objective conduct which, on its face, looks as though it is or may be dishonest, but that it is nevertheless necessary to go on and investigate the question whether in truth, in all the circumstances, the person had a guilty mind. He also emphasised that it was not sufficient to conclude that the applicant had engaged in conduct that was negligent, or even grossly negligent. He made it plain to the jury, on a number of occasions, that fraud involving personal dishonesty was alleged and had to be established beyond reasonable doubt. There was, in my view, ample evidence on which the jury could have reached the conclusion that the Crown case was made out. 

24The decisions in R v Feely and R v Ghosh created a divergence of judicial opinion, the ratios of which were applied in Queensland, but not in Victoria and New South Wales. It was not until the decision of the High Court of Australia in Peters v R (1998) 192 CLR 493 that the division of judicial opinion was resolved and the Court departed from the approach taken in R v Ghosh . In the joint judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ, their Honours held that the Ghosh test ""distract[ed] from the true factual issue to be determined and conflat[ed] what [were] really two separate questions"" . It was held that: 

[18] In a case in which it is necessary for a jury to decide whether an act is dishonest, the proper course is for the trial judge to identify the knowledge, belief or intent which is said to render that act dishonest and to instruct the jury to decide whether the accused had that knowledge, belief or intent and, if so, to determine whether, on that account, the act was dishonest. Necessarily, the test to be applied in deciding whether the act done is properly characterised as dishonest will differ depending on whether the question is whether it was dishonest according to ordinary notions or dishonest in some special sense. If the question is whether the act was dishonest according to ordinary notions, it is sufficient that the jury be instructed that that is to be decided by the standards of ordinary, decent people. However, if ""dishonest"" is used in some special sense in legislation creating an offence, it will ordinarily be necessary for the jury to be told what is or, perhaps, more usually, what is not meant by that word. Certainly, it will be necessary for the jury to be instructed as to that special meaning if there is an issue whether the act in question is properly characterised as dishonest. 

25In most cases, the question as to whether an act, done with some particular knowledge, belief or intent, is properly characterised as dishonest is usually not in issue. Save for exceptional cases in which it is in issue, Toohey and Gaudron JJ held (at [28]) that: - 

....it is sufficient for a trial judge simply to instruct the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the knowledge, belief or intent alleged by the prosecution before they can convict. Alternatively, the trial judge may instruct the jury that, if satisfied as to the knowledge, belief or intent alleged, the means in question are properly characterised as dishonest and they should so find. 

26It is this tenet, in my view a highly instructive one, which should serve as the basis from which this Court's decision should flow when considering the delineation between questions of fact and questions of law, the latter of which require me to direct myself as though I were directing a jury on the application of the law on the facts, as they found them to be, in matters prosecuted on indictment. These and other cautionary criminal trial directions apply to a magistrate or judge sitting alone as they do to a trial before a judge and jury: Fleming v R (1998) 197 CLR 250. For abundant clarity, I have directed myself in accordance with the reasoning advanced by the High Court in Peters v R . 

27It should also be noted that dishonesty can be negatived by a genuine belief by the accused in a legal entitlement to the property taken: Langham v R (1984) 12 A Crim R 391. To the extent that the Defence case relied upon the Accused's assertion, via his oral testimony, that he was entitled to act in the way that he did and as an intermediary for the lender, it was held, in R v Balnaves (2000) 117 A Crim R 85, that clear and unambiguous directions should be given to the jury that the accused's state of mind is relevant to the question of dishonest or fraudulent intent and that they must bear in mind the explanation given by the accused, including whether there was a genuine belief in an entitlement to the property or money taken. 

28This line of reasoning was followed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Adler [2002] NSWCCA 180, in which Bergin J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Barr J agreed, in a case also involving offences alleged under s.178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), held that the fact that the jury were directed by the trial judge to 'dismiss from their minds any thoughts' of an alternative hypothesis, that being a circumstantial case, meant that they were left with the task of considering the evidence without the capacity to consider whether the payments could have been induced by something other than a criminal deception. The exclusion of that capacity would, her Honour found, very likely have impacted upon the jury's consideration of the evidence and any doubts they may have had in relation to certain evidence would have been given much less weight. 

29Although the present case is a partly circumstantial case, the need for careful scrutiny of the explanation proffered by the Accused, moderated by the clear and unambiguous directions a trial judge would be required to give to a jury in relation to the Accused's state of mind, is a necessary exercise in which to engage in determining the question of dishonest intent, as an element of the charges faced by the Accused, including whether he held a genuine belief in an entitlement to the money received, but not, of course, whether there was a legal right to practise the deception. Lest there be any doubt, I have directed myself in accordance with the reasoning advanced above. 

30Of course, the ingredients of the offence referred to earlier in these reasons, without more, do not adequately represent the true position at law. The overarching principle to be borne in mind is that there must exist, to the requisite criminal standard, evidence of 'intent'. For fear of reciting the obvious, an intent to do the physical act involved in the offence with which an accused has been charged is indispensable to criminal responsibility: R v O'Connor (1980) 146 CLR 64. Upon this fundamental proposition rest a number of subtle ancillary considerations. 

31First, general proof of an actual desire or wish to do an act of the proscribed character is proof of general intent: R v Reynhoudt (1962) 107 CLR 381. 

32Secondly, in the absence of direct proof, the question becomes one of the drawing of inferences for all the proved facts and objective circumstances in an individual case. In inferring a person's intention from his or her words or actions, the trier of fact is entitled to take into account its own experience of life and to evaluate the intention that would normally be inferred from such words or actions. However, it must be appreciated that: 

(1)It is the intention of the particular accused in question which is in issue, not that of some hypothetical reasonable person: Pereira v DPP (1988) 82 ALR 217; 
(2)In such cases the question always remains one of actual knowledge; 
(3)Where knowledge is inferred from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence, knowledge must be the only rational inference available. 

33Thirdly, an accused's knowledge of, or expertise concerning, the relevant circumstances, in the inquiry of whether the accused ought to have known that his conduct was unlawful and likely to produce the result that ensued, may be proved by direct evidence or by inference. If the prosecution relies on inference to prove that the accused knew the relevant circumstances, the inference may be established by proving other facts that make it logical to infer that the accused knew the circumstances: Simpson v R (1998) 194 CLR 228 (per Gaudron and McHugh JJ). 

34That being the case, the thread common to all of the observations referred to above is that it is the subjective intention of the accused, ordinarily, which is determinative. In Cutter v R (1997) 143 ALR 498, Kirby J (at 511) held: 

It is important to draw a distinction between the intention of the accused and his or her motives, desires, wishes or hopes in doing the act alleged to constitute the crime charged.... [T]he better view is that the word ['intent']...should not be defined but should be left to the trier of fact without elaboration as to its meaning... Clearly enough where there is no direct evidence to which the trier of fact can safely resort, so as to draw an inference as to the 'subjective' intention of the accused, the principal focus of attention will ordinarily be the facts surrounding the alleged offence. Windeyer J explained why this was so in his reasons in Parker v R (1963) 111 CLR 610 at 648-9: 
'In every case where intent is in question, the question is what did the accused ... intend. Of that, the acts he did may well provide the most cogent evidence. I some cases, the evidence that the acts provide may be so strong as to compel an inference of what is intent was, no matter what he may say about it afterwards. If the immediate consequence of an act is obvious and inevitable, the intentional doing of the act imports and intention to produce the consequence' 

35I should, at this stage, also stress the importance of one further ingredient in the assessment process, that is, that there be a causal connection between the deception and the benefit or advantage obtained. Although not expressly referred to in s 178BA, the causal connection to which I have referred is an inherent characteristic of the offences with which the Accused has been charged and is a matter which bears some weight when conducting the fact finding exercise. 

36In Flack v R [2011] NSWCCA 167, the applicant (for leave to extend the time within which to file an appeal) was convicted of five counts of obtaining a financial advantage, contrary to the same provision with which the present case is concerned, after he obtained loans from financial institutions for the purpose of purchasing buses which did not exist. The applicant submitted that the trial judge erred in rejecting a no case to answer submission claiming that there was a lack of nexus between the deception and the financial advantage obtained. In assessing the merits of the appeal for the purpose of determining whether to grant an extension of the time within which to appeal, Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed, held that there was no error. His Honour held (at [37] - [40]): 

37 What must be established, however, is a causal connection between the deception used and the financial advantage obtained. The deception must have been the means whereby the financial advantage was obtained, or the effective cause of the financial advantage being obtained. It is an essential ingredient of an offence under s.178BA that the cause of the giving of the financial advantage was the deception used by the accused person: R v Stanhope (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 September 1987, pages 6-8); R v Clarkson [1987] VR 962 at 980; R v Ho; R v Szeto at 147. 
38 The question whether the deception was an operative cause of the obtaining of financial advantage, falls to be answered as a question of fact by the members of the jury applying their commonsense: R v King [1987] 1 QB 547 at 553. 
39 As the Crown submitted in this Court, commonsense and inferences had a role to play in this case. The loan documents required identification details of the "" goods involved"" . This was by way of engine and VIN numbers. There needed to be a certificate of currency for the "" goods"" . There was also a requirement for the "" goods"" to be insured. There were in fact insurance policies taken out for each of the five "" goods"" , separately identified by individual VIN and engine numbers. The evidence revealed that these policies were for existing property (T767). There was a requirement, for at least some of the loans, that there be an acknowledgement that the "" goods"" had been inspected by the borrower."" 
40 The applications to the financial institutions in each case contained considerable details which could be inferred as identifying a particular bus which was in existence, including insurance coverage for an identified bus. The representations contained in the documentation supporting the applications were available to establish that those representations were deceptive, and were an operating factor on the conduct of the financial institutions in approving the loans. This inference was available with respect to each of the five counts. It was not necessary that the actual person who processed the loan give evidence."" 

37The final matter for consideration before turning to the application of the principles to the facts of the present matter relates to the assessment of a witness's evidence. In assessing the evidence adduced in the trial, the Court may, as the trier of fact, decide which evidence is believed and how much weight is to be placed on the testimony of each witness. In carrying out that task, it is to be borne in mind the trier of fact may use common sense and experience in order to assess the credibility of each witness. It is within the Court's power to accept some part of a witness's evidence, some part of the Accused's evidence, while rejecting other parts: R v Manunta (1990) 54 SASR 17. Ultimately, the burden of proof rests with the prosecution to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, every element or essential fact that comprise the offences with which the Accused has been charged. The fact that the Accused has himself given, and called from others, evidence in the trial does not shift the onus or place upon him any burden to prove his innocence. It is entirely for the prosecution to prove the Accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 

38Although some of the above principles may be trite, their restatement, in my view, is desirable in giving transparency to the decision making process upon which the Court is set to embark. 

Analysis 

39The evidence of the lenders' director, Mr Michael Foy, was that he had met the Accused in 2008 when their children were playing soccer for the same club. The Accused had introduced himself as a mortgage broker and an association developed whereby the Accused offered Mr Foy better returns on funds than Mr Foy has been earning on his investments. The first transaction involved short term lending for a principal sum of $70,000 with an interest rate of 6% per month. Apparently, the Accused produced a loan agreement prepared by lawyers retained by him, which had already been executed by the borrowers, and Mr Foy executed the documents and arranged for the transfer of funds into the Accused's business account, WC Financial Services, there being a verbal agreement that the Accused would attend to providing the funds to the borrowers himself. Mr Foy conceded that it was this transaction that set the precedent for the three loans, the subject of the charges, which followed. I gathered from his evidence that since the Accused had been timely in repaying the principal and interest in the antecedent loan, Mr Foy was comfortable in dealing with him for the subsequent loans. 

40The subsequent three loans were based on similar terms, except that Mr Foy, on behalf of the lenders, retained his own lawyer, Mr George Gourlas, to act for the lenders on those transactions. Whilst I accept that there is a market for short-term loans, the interest terms in the respective loans defy logic. There was no cogent evidence to suggest that the borrowers, mortgagors and guarantors purportedly involved in these transactions had any need for short-term finance or would have had difficulty obtaining finance from mainstream lenders. 

41The Vaxavanis loan documents provided for a loan amount of $120,000 over a term of three months, security in the form of a second registered Mortgage over the family home, but in the interim a Caveat to be registered on title, an interest rate of 72% per annum accruing at 6% per month ($7,200 per month), and a margin of 3.5% per month over and above the monthly interest rate in the event that the loan was in default. 

42The Azzam loan documents provided for a loan amount of $400,000 over a term of three months, security in the form of a second registered Mortgage over the family home, but in the interim a Caveat to be registered on title, an interest rate of 108% per annum accruing at 9% per month ($36,000 per month), and a margin of 3.5% per month over and above the monthly interest rate in the event that the loan was in default. 

43The Abouhaidar loan documents provided for a loan amount of $70,000 over a term of three months, security in the form of a second registered Mortgage over the family home, but in the interim a Caveat to be registered on title, an interest rate of 96% per annum accruing at 8% per month ($5,600 per month), and a margin of 3.5% per month over and above the monthly interest rate in the event that the loan was in default. 

44Notably, it was Mr Foy's evidence that in relation to the three loans the subject of the charges, no capital repayments have been made in reduction of the principal sums lent, although he did receive cash payments from the Accused representing the first month's interest payments required to be made by under the respective loan agreements up front. He gave evidence that he did receive a cheque in the sum of $20,000 from the Accused, drawn from the Accused's business account, which was to be for principal, but which was dishonoured. 

45It was Mr Foy's evidence that of the 9% interest payable under the Azzam loan, 3% would be remitted to the Accused as payment by the lender for brokerage fees. It was not entirely clear whether the same proportion of interest was to be remitted to the Accused in respect of the Vaxavanis and Abouhaidar loans. 

46Evidence was given by Ms Stella Kitson, the daughter and carer of, and donee under a Power of Attorney from, Mrs Frida Vaxavanis. Ms Kitson described her mother as being a 77-year-old lady who could not speak English very well, could not read or write English, suffers from diabetes and a heart condition, and is in a fragile state. As her mother's carer, her evidence was that her mother was significantly dependent upon her, with Ms Kitson attending to her banking needs, paying her bills, renewing insurance policies and looking after real estate owned by her mother. Ms Kitson gave evidence that her mother would not have been able to execute any of the Vaxavanis loan documents without her assistance and, having seen her mother sign documents many times over the years, the signatures and initials said to be her mother's on the Vaxavanis loan documents did not resemble her mother's true signature and initials. 

47More relevantly, however, Ms Kitson gave evidence that her father, Mr Hercules Vaxavanis, passed away in 2006. The only rational inference to be drawn from the signatures and initials on the loan documents said to have been signed by Mr Vaxavanis in May 2009 is, plainly, that they are a forgery. It became apparent to Ms Kitson that a fraud had been perpetrated and ""money had been obtained in my father's name"". The Vaxavanis documents tendered into evidence as part of Exhibit 7 include a letter of demand dated 10 November 2009, forwarded by the lender's solicitor, Mr George Gourlas, to Mr and Mrs Vaxavanis, seeking repayment of the principal and interest, by that stage having reached $175,800, failing which the lender would exercise its power of sale. 

48Another salient feature of the signatures of Mr and Mrs Vaxavanis on the Vaxavanis loan documents is that they purport to be witnessed by Mr Nick Manolios. Whilst there is evidence from Mr Abouhaidar that Mr Manolios was Mr and Mrs Abouhaidar's family accountant, there is no evidence that Mr Manolios was the accountant for Mr and Mrs Vaxavanis or that he was in any way associated with them. The irresistible, and indeed compelling, inference that flows therefrom is that the signatures of the witness, said to be Mr Manolios, are also forgeries. 

49The evidence of Mr George Abouhaidar was that he met the Accused through a friend in 2008/2009. He and his wife were considering refinancing their home loan of $720,000 from their then lender to St George Bank, using the services of the Accused as mortgage broker. At about the same time, he was also seeking to borrow the sum of $70,000. It was not entirely clear from the evidence whether that was incorporated in the $720,000 refinance amount he was considering or in addition to it. I understood, from his evidence, that in addition to the first registered mortgage secured over his home in favour of his then mortgagee, he also had a loan secured by way of a Caveat registered on title in favour of Circuit Finance Australia Limited (""Circuit Finance""), in respect of which an amount of $20,000 remained outstanding and had he and his wife proceeded with the $720,000 loan from St George Bank, the refinance would have covered the $20,000 owing to Circuit Finance and would have left him with surplus funds with which to extinguish some other debts. 

50At the time of these events, Mr Abouhaidar and his wife received from the Accused loan documents with Speedy Gantry Hire Pty Limited (""Speedy Gantry"") listed as lender/mortgagee for a loan of $70,000. His evidence was that he did not want to obtain a loan through Speedy Gantry and, ultimately, after conferring with, and obtaining advice from, his accountant, Mr Nick Manolios, in relation to the Abouhaidar loan documents, he and his wife did not proceed with the refinance to St George Bank or the loan from Speedy Gantry. He emphatically denied signing the Abouhaidar loan documents and stated that none of the signatures appearing on those documents were his or his wife's. I accept his evidence on this point and conclude that the signatures purporting to be his and his wife's and the signatures purporting to be his accountant's, as witness, were forgeries. It became clear to him that something untoward had taken place when he discovered that a Caveat in favour of Speedy Gantry had been registered on the title to his family home. 

51A remarkable feature of his evidence was that he readily conceded playing the part of interpreter in the Azzam documents said to have executed by Mr and Mrs Azzam as mortgagors and guarantors. There was no evidence to suggest that he was an accredited Arabic speaking interpreter. He accepted that he executed, as interpreter, a document entitled Interpreter's Certificate (part of Exhibit 5), which contained an acknowledgment that he translated, from the English language to the Arabic language, and explained to Mr and Mrs Azzam in Arabic, the Loan Agreement, Mortgage and Guarantee and Indemnity, and that they executed the documents in his presence and appeared to understand the nature and effect of the documents and their obligations thereunder. He frankly admitted that Mr and Mrs Azzam were not present when he translated the documents, despite the acknowledgment. 

52The inference to be drawn, when reconciled with the evidence of Mr and Mrs Azzam, is that the documents bearing the signatures purporting to be Mr and Mrs Azzam's were forgeries and were not witnessed by Mr Abouhaidar in their presence. I do not believe that Mr Abouhaidar forged Mr and Mrs Azzam's signatures, nor was this suggested. I do, however, believe that the signatures appearing as witness on the Azzam loan documents are indeed Mr Abouhaidar's and that he did not witness Mr and Mrs Azzam execute any of the documents. 

53Despite Mr Abouhaidar's admissions, his oral testimony was completed by asserting that he did not know, but had since become aware, what he was asked by the Accused to sign in relation to the Azzam loan, believing that he was simply executing a document to assist Mr Mark Anthony in obtaining a loan. I do not accept this part of his evidence. 

54An inference that flows from Mr Abouhaidar's admission of impropriety, in the adoption of the clearly inconsistent acknowledgments in the Interpreter's Certificate and the execution of documents as witness without the signatories being present, is the likelihood that he may have acted in collaboration with the Accused in at least one of the offences with which the Accused has been charged, namely that surrounding the Azzam loan. There is, however, an exiguousness of evidence to definitively ground such a conclusion and, accordingly, I do not propose to pursue this further in these reasons. 

55Evidence was also given by Mrs Monica Abouhaidar that generally corroborated the evidence given by her husband to the extent that she too emphatically denied executing the Abouhaidar loan documents and stated that none of the signatures appearing on those documents were hers. I accept her evidence on this point and conclude that the signatures purporting to be hers and her husband's and the signatures purporting to be that of her accountant, Mr Nick Manolios, as witness, were forgeries. It became apparent to her that there was an irregularity when she attended her solicitors' office with a bank cheque for $20,000 in order to discharge the loan secured by Circuit Finance over her home and discovered that the loan had already been repaid by the Accused, without her knowledge or direction, and without her having provided the Accused any funds within which to discharge the loan or to obtain a Withdrawal of Caveat arising therefrom. The only rational inference, in my view, to be drawn from this evidence is that the Accused attended to the discharge of the loan secured by Circuit Finance in order to pave the way for the registration of the Caveat in favour of Speedy Gantry over the family home of Mr and Mrs Abouhaidar and the effectual drawdown of the loan the subject of these proceedings, which was deposited into the Accused's account. 

56Both Mr and Mrs Azzam gave evidence with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter. Their statements to police, both dated 19 January 2010, were tendered into evidence and were fairly consistent with the evidence thus far. They denied applying for a loan or executing any loan, mortgage or guarantee documents. In fact, their home had been unencumbered since 1997. They denied executing the mortgage and guarantee documents creating an interest in favour of Speedy Gantry, nor did they know who did. They emphatically denied executing the Azzam loan documents and stated that none of the signatures appearing on those documents were theirs. I accept their evidence on this point and conclude that the signatures purporting to be theirs were forgeries. It became abundantly clear to them that something untoward had taken place and that they had been the victims of fraud when they received a letter of demand from the lender/mortgagee seeking repayment of the principal loan and interest which, by that stage, had reached about $544,000. 

57Whilst they both denied their son, Mr Mark Anthony, having any involvement in obtaining the loan secured over their family home, in the statement made to police by Mrs Azzam (Exhibit 11), she stated that her son left the house at around the time of these events and never returned. I accept that whilst this admission might be indicative of some indiscretion on the part of Mr Anthony in relation to the predicament in which his parents were now placed, there is an exiguousness of evidence to definitively ground such a conclusion and, accordingly, I do not propose to pursue this further in these reasons. 

58Much like the Vaxavanis loan, there is another salient feature in relation to the signatures of Mr and Mrs Azzam on one of the documents comprised as part of the Azzam loan document, namely the Declaration by Third Party Mortgagor, Guarantor, Surety Mortgagor or Indemnifier for the Borrower. That document purports to be witnessed by Mr Nick Manolios. Whilst there is evidence from Mr Abouhaidar that Mr Manolios was Mr and Mrs Abouhaidar's family accountant, there is no evidence that Mr Manolios was the accountant for Mr and Mrs Azzam or that he was in any way associated with them. The irresistible and, again, compelling, inference that flows therefrom is that the signature of the witness, said to be Mr Manolios, is also a forgery. 

59Evidence was also given by Mr Mark Anthony who stated that he had known Mr Abouhaidar since his school years. He was at, the time of these events, trying to obtain a loan. Mr Abouhaidar introduced him to the Accused and a meeting took place whereby the Accused requested $3,000 from him, to be deposited into the Accused's TAB account. As he did not have the funds, he told the Accused to disregard his request for assistance to secure a loan. He recalled that some days later, Mr Abouhaidar, of his own volition and without any instructions from Mr Anthony, had arranged for someone to pay the $3,000 to the Accused on Mr Anthony's behalf. As the money was ""put up for [him]"", the Accused and Mr Abouhaidar took Mr Anthony to a Mr Peter Antoniou, solicitor, and, under threats to his life in the foyer, Mr Abouhaidar and the Accused forced Mr Anthony to execute the loan documents in the solicitor's presence. The execution clauses on the documents where his parents, Mr and Mrs Azzam, were to sign were still blank at that stage, although he too, when shown the documents in evidence agreed that the signatures which subsequently appeared did not resemble the signatures of his mother and father. 

60Some days later, Mr Anthony recalled Mr Abouhaidar telling him ""not to worry"" and that he had ""some money coming his way"" which ""he did not want his wife to know about"" and asked if he could deposit the money into his (Mr Anthony's) account. In what appeared to me to be somewhat unusual, Mr Anthony agreed and was ""happy to help"". In the days that followed, they took him accompanied to various branches and withdrew money from an account in Mr Anthony's name and Mr Abouhaidar purchased a ticket and travelled to Argentina. He denied receiving any of the funds from the Azzam loan drawdown, including any of the funds that were deposited into an account with BankWest apparently opened in his name. 

61I gathered from Mr Anthony's evidence that he was vulnerable and it seems that vulnerability was not lost on those with whom he came into contact. I believe he was threatened by the Accused and that he was used as a means to achieve an end. 

62Following the close of the prosecution case, I found a prima facie case and the Accused went into evidence. 

63The Accused was, for ""five, six or seven years"", a finance and mortgage broker, trading as WC Financial Services. It was his evidence that he was ""not qualified"", although the I accept that the Australian mortgage broking industry has yet to be regulated in any significant way, as was the case with the financial services industry over the last decade, with the amendment of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to insert Chapter 7, dealing with financial services and markets, and the introduction of stringent rules and the necessity for those engaging in that industry to obtain financial services licences. Needless to say, the Accused had, over the years, obtained experience in the workings of loan transactions arising from deals which he had brokered on behalf of lenders and borrowers and, on his own evidence, ""getting finance for properties"" and ""short term loans"". 

64A pertinent feature of his evidence was that, having opened an account with BankWest in November 2008, he used that account to ""facilitate loans"". He conceded that the three transactions of which the present charges form part, and one transaction immediately preceding the three in question, were the first occasion on which he had control of the funds. 

65According to the Accused, the agreement reached with the lenders' director, Mr Michael Foy, was that the Accused would receive the funds from each loan drawdown and would disburse the funds at the borrowers' request. Mr Foy gave evidence that the there was a verbal agreement reached that the funds would be disbursed to the respective borrowers after drawdown. One cannot overlook the volatility of this procedure which effectively put the Accused in control of large sums of money in circumstances where a mortgage broker's role, if one accepts this was the role the Accused played in these transactions, is to facilitate, as an intermediary, negotiations and secure the appropriate property finance loan between a mortgagor and mortgagee, not to receive the loan proceeds from the drawdown into his business account and to disburse them therefrom. 

66There is nothing, in my opinion, which forbids the practice in which the Accused engaged, but what became clear from the evidence was that the process was readily susceptible to abuse and the lender unwittingly facilitated a state of affairs that ultimately culminated in the charges laid against the Accused. That, however, in no way suggests that the lender was complicit in the fraud perpetrated upon the unsuspecting borrowers, mortgagors and guarantors. The inescapable conclusion is that the Accused was emboldened by the ease with which he was able to take control of the funds and, by virtue of the immediately preceding transaction, gained Mr Foy's trust and confidence in continuing to do business with him. The Accused's level of participation in the respective transactions transcended the boundaries of professional expediency and entered a state of frenzied interest and enthusiasm in securing and procuring the drawdown of the loan proceeds by electronic funds transfer directly into his account. 

67The Accused denied all impropriety. There were a number of acts on the part of the Accused that, on their own, seem innocuous, but when taken together, should have raised warning bells. The Accused personally collected loan documents from the lendersâ€™ solicitors; personally returned documents said to have been executed by the various borrowers, mortgagors and guarantors to the lendersâ€™ solicitors; escorted the purported borrower, Mr Mark Anthony, to a solicitorâ€™s office for the execution of one set of loan documents; prevailed upon the purported borrower, Mr Mark Anthony, to utilise the services of the Accusedâ€™s chosen solicitor to execute loan documents; personally attended to the drawing of a bank cheque from his own account for the payout of an existing loan with an unrelated lender, secured by Caveat over the title to the property owned by the purported borrowers, Mr and Mrs Abouhaidar, and paid out that loan, and procured and obtained from that lender a Withdrawal of Caveat in registrable form, paving the way for the registration of the Caveat in favour of Speedy Gantry over the family home of Mr and Mrs Abouhaidar to regularise the drawdown of the loan the subject of these proceedings; and personally attended to some repayments to the lender of interest and legal costs and disbursements out of the loan proceeds deposited into his account.
 
68One of the documents most notably absent, and which casts a dark shadow upon the Accused's evidence, was a direction to pay, a document commonly executed by borrowers and mortgagors prior to loan drawdown informing lenders and mortgagees of the persons or entities in whose favour the loan proceeds are to be drawn. Indeed, nor was there a direction to pay from any of the borrowers and mortgagors to the Accused to inform him of what their intentions were, if one accepts the Accused's evidence, with the loan proceeds once they were deposited into his account. 

69The apex of the Accused's exculpatory revelation was his uncorroborated oral testimony that the respective borrowers and mortgagors verbally authorised him to receive the loan proceeds from the various transactions into his business account, retain large sums of money for his brokerage fees, in one case on his own evidence $30,000, in what could only be described as exorbitant and indicative of his avarice, and to deal with the proceeds on their behalf. What that precisely meant was a mystery. In one case, the Accused gave evidence that Mr Peter Vaxavanis, the son of the purported borrowers, Mr and Mrs Vaxavanis, gave the Accused instructions to have a large sum of cash from the loan proceeds ready for collection by the girlfriend of a Mr Peter Megaloudis, as Mr and Mrs Vaxavanis senior were supposedly putting their property up to help their son's friend, Mr Megaloudis. In fact, the Accused alluded to all of the borrowers being introduced to him by Mr Peter Megaloudis and deflected a lot of the blame attributed to him in cross-examination to the sons of the mortgagors, namely Mr Mark Anthony and Mr Peter Vaxavanis, who were instrumental in the motivation behind obtaining these loans. On the Accused's evidence, it was these persons who instructed him as to where the loan proceeds were to be applied, despite, if it were true in Mr Peter Vaxavanis' case, that he was not the borrower on any of the loan documents and in no position to direct anyone as to how the loan proceeds were to be applied. I gathered from the evidence that these transactions were part of a much larger ring of deception. 

70Interestingly, the Accused had no involvement, nor indeed was there any evidence to suggest that he even met the purported borrowers, Mr and Mrs Azzam and Mr and Mrs Vaxavanis. He gave evidence that he had had discussions with the respective sons of Mr and Mrs Azzam and Mr and Mrs Vaxavanis and that he had had discussions with the purported borrowers Mr and Mrs Abouhaidar. As far as I could gather, none of the purported borrowers and mortgagors received any of the loan proceeds, but for the possibility that Mr Mark Anthony received some money into an account opened in his name at the same BankWest branch at which the Accused banked in order to facilitate a transfer of some money into his account. As stated earlier, Mr Anthony denies receiving any money. 

71By far the most alarming part of the evidence was that the given by Ms Stella Kitson, the daughter and carer of, and donee under a Power of Attorney from, Mrs Frida Vaxavanis, a 77-year-old lady who could not read, write or speak English, suffers from diabetes and a heart condition and is in a fragile state. It transpired that not only did her mother not take out a loan secured over the family home, based on loan documents purportedly executed by her mother and father as co-borrowers and co-mortgagors, but that, whilst her father's name was still on title as a registered proprietor of the family home, her father had actually passed away in 2006, some three years before the forged loan documents purported to convey their acceptance of a loan for $120,000. 

72The fact that the Accused might not have met some of the persons said to be have been the borrowers, mortgagors and guarantors under the loan documents does not necessarily mean that there is no causal connection. On a proper analysis of the evidence, the requisite causal connection is established because the acts in which the Accused engaged and which I find constitute deception are inextricably linked to the money obtained. 

73He attempted to explain away many of the inconsistencies in his evidence. He gave evidence as to each of the deposits and withdrawals appearing in his bank statement (Exhibit 2) and, relying wholly upon his memory, sought to explain the source of each deposit and the persons to whom each of the withdrawals were delivered. Most of the withdrawals, he said, were cash withdrawals in payment of legal fees and disbursements to solicitors and accountants, and to the lenders for interest repayments arising from the loan transactions. Some of the larger sums were withdrawn, supposedly at the request of the various borrowers and their sons as I have referred to earlier, and given to Mr Abouhaidar, Mr Anthony, and a substantial sum to the liquidators of the Watersedge Resort, an entity which the Accused said was related to Mr Peter Megaloudis and, according to his evidence, from which some of the documents adduced, such as Interpreter's Certificate, were faxed, noting the ""fax header"". I noted from the bank statement of the Accused's account adduced into evidence that many of the smaller withdrawals were made from automatic teller machines within TAB betting venues. 

74Much of his evidence was circuitous. His responses to the questions asked of him in the transcript of his record of interview were obfuscatory. He stated, in response to Q98 of the record of interview, that he ""had no reason to believe that all the people I've described at the signing of the documents weren't there"" and that they ""were the people signing the documents"" as required. I do not accept this to be the case. 

75He was asked in Q110 of the transcript of his record of interview why he did not give the $400,000 to Mark Anthony, seeing as he was the borrower, to which he responded, ""[b]ecause that wasn't his instructions. His instructions were um, half through his account and the other half as cash and interest and to pay [various people] ...They were all by Mark's directions [sic] told me to go and fix them all up."" I do not accept this evidence nor that these were the directions given to him by Mr Anthony. 

76When asked in Q116 of the transcript of his record of interview whether he had any written directions from any of the borrowers or mortgagors, he responded, ""I have some written directions."" He was asked in Q118 whether he had a direction, written document or formal document from Mr Anthony, to which he responded, ""No, I don't. But I'm, I'm fifty, fifty per cent sure that I might have something in a text."" I understood this to mean a phone text message. He did say in his oral evidence that he kept a record of the Azzam loan transaction but that he was unable to find it because it was in storage. He had access to it but did not have it with him in Court. 

77The Defence case was generally in accordance with the Accused's response to Q195 of the transcript of his record of interview wherein he stated, ""I was very loose with what I was doing but I still maintain that I did the right thing and what I was told. And um, at all times I had the lenders lenders um, ah, what's the word, oh, the lender's actions. I was, I was, you know, as far as I was concerned I was doing the right thing by the lender."" 

78In assessing the Accused's evidence, I concluded that he was an unreliable witness. He was goal oriented, equivocal, and self-serving. His evidence lacked credibility and plausibility. It was markedly inconsistent with the tenor of the surrounding evidence. Whilst there were some parts of his evidence that were conceivable, I did not generally find him to be a witness of truth and reject most of his explanations. 

79The evidence of Mr George Gourlas, solicitor, did not add all that much to the proceedings other than to give an account of the documents which he prepared as the lenders' solicitor. 

Conclusion 

80It must be appreciated that a person, such as a mortgage broker, can fail to act honestly in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of his duties without his conduct involving deception. I accept the submission made by the Accused's solicitor that carelessness and negligence is not sufficient to ground criminal liability, although this is not, in my opinion, one of those cases. 

81The fact that other persons might be implicated in the conduct that is alleged as against the Accused is relevant in inculpating them but does not bear as much weight when determining whether such fact exculpates the Accused. 

82However, when considering all of the evidence, having identified above the knowledge, belief or intent which is said to render the Accused's actions dishonest, I find that the Accused was possessed of the requisite intent, as an ingredient of the offences with which he has been charged, and that such intent was dishonest according to the standards of ordinary, decent people. 

83Having arrived to the conclusion referred to above as to the Accused's credibility, it follows, in my view, that there was, on the part of the Accused, an intent to deceive. Even if I am incorrect in my assessment above, the Accused's conduct, based on his knowledge and expertise concerning mortgage and lending practices, in bringing about a state of affairs which caused the lenders to lend, and deposit into the Accused's account, moneys which they would otherwise not have lent had they known the true position, constitutes dishonesty. Moreover, I do not accept that the Accused had a genuine belief in a legal entitlement to the loan proceeds sourced from the lenders. In my opinion, the Accused's dishonest intent was pervasive and there is nothing that seems to stand in the way of this conclusion. 

84The tenor of the submissions made by the Accused's legal representative was that there were a number of inferences available on the evidence. Noting that this case was founded partly on direct evidence and partly on circumstantial evidence, I was cognisant of the fact that competing inferences arose. As the trier of fact, however, I am satisfied that the inference of guilt which I have attributed to the Accused completely overcomes all other inferences so as to leave no reasonable doubt in my mind. It is the combination of direct and circumstantial evidence that formed the basis of these conclusions. 

85When assessing the totality of the actions of the Accused, I am persuaded to the view that the cause of the giving of the loan moneys by the lenders to the Accused was the deception used by him. Put another way, the deception was the means or effective cause, by which the loan moneys were obtained and, therefore, I find, beyond reasonable doubt, that there was a causal connection between the deception and the financial advantage obtained. 

Decision 

86When reconciling all of the evidence, tempered by the cautionary criminal trial directions to which I have referred, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the facts and evidence adduced in support of the ingredients of the offences with which the Accused has been charged. 

87In the circumstances, and for the reasons given, I find the offences proven and the Accused guilty on all three sequences. 

88The matter is adjourned to this Court at 9.30 am on 28 October 2011 for sentence. 

89Bail is to continue. 

90I order a full Pre-Sentence Report. 

91The Accused is to report to the Hurstville office of the Probation and Parole Service by 4.00 pm on 22 September 2011, unless contacted sooner, so that arrangements may be made for a Pre-Sentence Report to be prepared.

		21 September 2011",2011-09-18 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2757881,"FERNANDO, Cecil George v R [2011] NSWDC 167","Judgment 


1. In this case I have to decide whether to reduce a non-parole period even further than the generous reduction which the magistrate allowed for an offender who has a long criminal history. 

2. The offender is Cecil George Fernando. He came before the Moree Local Court on 26 July this year. He had been charged with four offences. One was assault occasioning actual bodily harm against his brother, which he committed on 8 January this year. That is a crime against s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900. The other three offences were all committed on 18 April this year. The first was having a disguised face with intent to commit larceny. That is a crime against s 114 of the Crimes Act . The second is an offence constituted by committing that offence with a previous conviction for the same offence. That is made into a crime under s 115 of the Crimes Act . Lastly he was charged with resisting the police which is an offence against s 38 of the Crimes Act . 

3. He pleaded guilty to all of these offences. 

4. His Honour Magistrate Holmes, for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, sentenced Mr Fernando to twelve months imprisonment. It was to commence on the day he was arrested, 13 April 2011 and therefore expires on 12 April next year. For the three other crimes, all committed on 13 April, his Honour imposed one sentence of eighteen months imprisonment. He specified a nonparole period of twelve months commencing on the same day. Therefore, his Honour gave Mr Fernando the benefit of allowing the sentences to run at the same time despite the offences being some three months apart. Not only this, for an eighteen month prison sentence the nonparole period would normally be expected to be about 75 per cent, namely thirteen and a half months. His Honour exercised his discretion again in favour of Mr Fernando and reduced it to twelve months. He obviously regarded there being some special circumstances for further reducing it. 

5. As I said, Mr Fernando has a long criminal history which Mr Davies, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, draws my attention to. This is very relevant to one of the aims of punishing an offender, namely protection of the community. 

6. Mr Fernando is now thirty and started offending when he was a child and came before the Children's Court regularly for crimes mostly involving stealing and cars. When he was an adult he came before Local Courts in a number of areas in this State. Again he was convicted of stealing cars but also he has a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm - like the current offence that I am dealing with - and stalking or intimidating someone. Not only that, in 2007 he was convicted in the Taree District Court of robbery in company and assault with intent to rob. He received a prison sentence of six years and three months with a nonparole period of three years and three months. He was released on parole after those three years and three months and was therefore still on parole when he committed all of the offences that I am dealing with. 

7. It is understandable why Mr Davies draws my attention to Mr Fernando's criminal history and the need to protect the community. As Mr Davies pointed out, it seems that the only times that Mr Fernando is not committing offences is when he is in custody. 

8. Mr Schmidt, who appears for Mr Fernando, called his client to give evidence. He grew up on the Moree mission and his background was affected by the alcohol abuse within the family. He had what he described himself as a bad upbringing. He has himself five children, two of them to his current partner. He left school in Year 8 and has had jobs only occasionally. The longest time that he has stayed in a job has been for about three months. He has undertaken rehabilitation courses in custody, including the SMART program and he is currently doing a program about managing his emotions and then he is going to undertake the SMART program again. He has never done a rehabilitation program in the community. 

9. He said that he wants to change his life because of his children and because of the role model which he provides. His oldest child is eleven and amongst his children he has two boys aged six and eight. The six year old lives with him. When he was crossexamined by Mr Davies, he said that he started drinking alcohol at the age of fifteen and clearly acknowledged the link between his drinking and his criminal behaviour. His youngest child is Azaria, whom his partner Lisa had two months ago. 

10. I should say something about the crimes which he committed. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which was committed back in January, occurred when he had an argument with his brother. His brother, Bradley Fernando, who is seven years older than Mr Fernando, came to stay with Mr Fernando. His brother was concerned about whether there was any violence going on between Mr Fernando and his partner in their bedroom and he intervened. At some stage afterwards Mr Fernando swung punches towards his brother's face with both of his fists. He hit his brother in the left eye and the nose. He hit him again on the forehead. That cut the top of his forehead. 

11. The other crimes were committed on 13 April 2011. When Mr Fernando and some others turned up at 4.30 in the morning at the Moree Spa Motor Inn and tried to open the doors of some cars, they were detected by the owners who called the police. He was seen wearing dark clothing with his jacket pulled up over the lower half of his face in an attempt to disguise his identity. Police could not identify him. That constitutes the offence of disguising his face. They were asked their names but Mr Fernando ran away and had to be pursued by the police who tackled him to the ground and handcuffed him. Hence, he was charged with resisting the police and because he had a previous conviction for the face disguise charge, was found to have committed the offence against s 115 of the Crimes Act . 

12. Mr Schmidt argues that I should reduce the nonparole period from twelve months to nine months. That would provide an opportunity for his client to undertake some rehabilitation in the community at a rehabilitation centre which will be organised over the next few months. 

13. Against this course, namely reducing the nonparole period to nine months, are these factors. One is that Mr Fernando has a bad criminal record. He has tried to rehabilitate himself in prison but has broken the law again. That does not bode well for him being able to succeed. In addition, secondly, the bad criminal record indicates that I have to place more emphasis when sentencing him on deterring him. Indeed, as Mr Davies pointed out, he seems not to commit crimes only when he is in custody. Thirdly, I need to bear in mind the protection of the community. The people who are the victims of Mr Fernando's crimes are innocent members of the community and releasing him exposes them to some risk. Fourthly, he was on parole at the time he committed these offences. Once again that does not bode well for his rehabilitation. It is also a significantly aggravating feature for me to take into account under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In addition--

HIS HONOUR: I'll just go back a step and I will continue. 

14. In addition, these offences were committed when Mr Fernando was on parole. This does not bode well for his rehabilitation and is also a significantly aggravating feature which I need to take into account under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Not only that, but the assault occasioning actual bodily harm was committed in the presence of a child. 

15. On the other hand I need to take into account the obvious background which Mr Fernando has had where he was exposed to alcohol abuse at a very early age. His eduction ceased at a very early age and his skills and employability are limited. The alcohol has obviously marred his life so far - he is now thirty - and accounts for his criminal behaviour. He has said to me in the witness box that he is wanting to provide a positive role model for his children. 

16. Most significantly he has not yet undertaken a residential rehabilitation program in the community. He told me this morning that his present program, which he is undertaking in prison, goes for about another four weeks and then he is going to undertake the SMART program again which will take about eight weeks. That, by my calculations, will take him into December. Reducing the nonparole period to nine months will bring the nonparole period into January. I have decided that I am prepared to reduce the nonparole period provided there is a place for him at a residential rehabilitation centre, which is yet to be confirmed. I would be prepared, if he could go into a centre, to reduce the nonparole period to nine months so that it would expire on 12 January 2012. 

17. The special circumstances which I take into account are the fact that he has not done a residential rehabilitation program in the community and his own background and lack of opportunity to deal with a problem that he was exposed to as a child and has not yet been able to overcome. I put on record by way of acknowledgement, that there is some risk to the community in me making that decision. Indeed there is some risk perhaps to Mr Fernando's own family. He has prior convictions for offending against his own family - sorry does he have domestic violence? I know he hit his brother - no? Right. 

18. He has this conviction for offending against his own brother and he has convictions for stalking and intimidating, robbery and assault. However, I have decided to give him this opportunity to see whether he can turn his life around, now that he is thirty. If he does not, then he is unlikely to get any further leniency from me or other courts. 

19. I will not finalise the case today but, at Mr Schmidt's suggestion, I will stand it over for about a month to receive information about the rehabilitation centres. I will need to fix the conditions of parole. The parole period will obviously be nine months and I would expect a condition would be that he attend the rehabilitation centre immediately upon his release and accept all their reasonable recommendations and directions. It would be, I think, a condition of the parole, and I will hear both representatives on this, that he complete the rehabilitation program. A departure from the course or the program would, I think, constitute a breach of the parole. 

20. They are my reasons, I will now direct that a transcript be taken of those reasons so that we all have them for the next time.

2757890,R v Adam John THOMPSON [2011] NSWSC 1130,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1Adam John Thompson (also known as Adam John Ellenor) has pleaded guilty to the murder of Jay Riley. The murder occurred in the course of a robbery, the circumstances of which it is necessary to describe. 

The Offence 

2Mr Riley supplied Mr Thompson with illegal drugs (amphetamines) on a regular basis and Mr Thompson consumed amphetamines and sold amphetamines at least to the extent necessary to support his addiction. 

3Some time prior to 14 December 2009, Mr Thompson planned to rob Mr Riley. On 14 December 2009, Mr Riley left work early because he had tonsillitis. He attended a medical practice and was diagnosed. The medical practice was in Charlestown. He returned home, contacted his mother and then his girlfriend. After these two mobile phone calls he attended a pharmacy at Cardiff. He attended the pharmacy at or about 5.38pm on 14 December 2009. Mr Riley then returned some DVDs that he had borrowed and returned home. He was never seen alive again. 

4Mr Thompson lived with Ms Fennell in premises at Greta. Another co-accused, Mr Hamilton, lived in a shed in the backyard of the property. 

5On 14 December 2009, there were a number of telephone conversations between Mr Thompson and Mr Riley. At 6.23pm on 14 December 2009, there was a text message sent to Mr Riley's phone. His phone was then switched off at or about 6.30pm that day. Mr Thompson's mobile phone records disclose that Mr Riley was his only phone contact during 14 December 2009. The next use of Mr Thompson's phone was a text message sent by him to Mr Hamilton at 12.10am on 15 December 2009. Thereafter, Mr Thompson made a mobile phone call to Ms Fennell. That mobile phone call was at 4.23am on 15 December 2009. 

6Mr Riley's mobile phone was reactivated at 11.30am on 15 December 2009 using Mr Hamilton's SIM card. The mobile phone was later recovered from Mr Hamilton. 

7On the morning of 18 May 2010, police officers spoke with Ms Fennell, who had, since the date of the offence, separated from Mr Thompson. During the course of the electronically recorded interview, Ms Fennell told the police that she had not been home on the day in which the murder occurred, but on returning home Mr Thompson had indicated to her that he wished to speak to her. Ms Fennell told police that Mr Thompson said that he had arranged to meet Mr Riley to purchase two ounces of speed. Mr Thompson, according to Ms Fennell, said he had met with Mr Riley in order to rob him of the drugs. For that purpose he produced a rifle. Ms Fennell told police that Mr Thompson had said that the deceased lunged at the gun and he, Mr Thompson, panicked and the gun discharged. 

8Apparently, Mr Thompson inherited the gun from his father. He also possessed ammunition for it. The gun used was a .410 shotgun. 

9Mr Thompson, as earlier noted, planned the robbery. He knew Mr Riley was not armed. The shotgun used to kill Mr Riley had been unlawfully shortened and Mr Thompson took two rounds of ammunition with him. Further, before the shooting, Mr Thompson had armed the shotgun by pulling the trigger guard back off the shotgun, cracking the rifle and loading it. He then pulled the hammer back in order to allow the trigger to be pulled all the way back and this enabled him to discharge the shotgun. All of the steps had been taken, other than the pulling of the trigger, prior to meeting with Mr Riley (see Transcript, p 12-13). 

10Mr Thompson's intention was to rob Mr Riley. He did so, according to his evidence, because of his desperate financial and family situation. But Mr Thompson would not have known that Mr Riley had any significant amounts of money in his possession. If, as is stated, Mr Thompson was intending to rob Mr Riley in order to resolve his financial problems, Mr Thompson's intention must have been to rob Mr Riley of drugs and thereafter to sell those drugs. 

11After shooting Mr Riley, Mr Thompson took the drugs that he had arranged for Mr Riley to bring to the location. He searched Mr Riley's wallet and removed $2,300 in cash that Mr Riley had in his possession. He also took Mr Riley's mobile phone. Mr Thompson placed Mr Riley in the rear of Mr Riley's vehicle and drove that vehicle into nearby bushland. 

12Mr Thompson returned home in his own vehicle and, on the way, removed the SIM card from Mr Riley's mobile phone and threw it away. He told Ms Fennell and Mr Hamilton what he had done. After seeking and obtaining advice from Ms Fennell and Mr Hamilton, Mr Thompson broke the shotgun into three pieces and arranged for the disposal of each piece in a different location. Mr Thompson burnt the clothing he was wearing at the time of the murder. 

13Later on 15 December 2009, together with Ms Fennell and Mr Hamilton, Mr Thompson drove in Mr Thompson's car to where he had left Mr Riley and Mr Riley's vehicle. There, Mr Thompson entered Mr Riley's car, drove it to Mount Sugarloaf, with Mr Riley still in the boot. Mr Thompson pulled into a small car park, removed Mr Riley from the boot of the car and dragged him to the swamp in Minmi Creek, where Mr Thompson dumped him. 

14Mr Thompson then set fire to Mr Riley's vehicle, using petrol he had brought with him from home. Ms Fennell who, with Mr Hamilton, had followed Mr Thompson in the other car then drove Mr Thompson home. 

15Initially Mr Thompson gave police an account, which was wholly exculpatory. It was only after Mr Thompson learnt that Ms Fennell had assisted police with their enquiries that Mr Thompson confessed to the murder. The foregoing is predominantly derived from a Statement of Agreed Facts and the transcript of the electronically recorded interviews that are in evidence. Oral evidence was also adduced, in particular, from Mr Thompson. 

16Mr Thompson alleges that Mr Riley lunged at him, causing panic as a consequence of which the gun discharged. I am not satisfied that Mr Riley was killed in that way. At the time that the shotgun discharged, Mr Riley was holding two bags of amphetamines, one in each hand. It is most unlikely, given the presence of a firearm and the fact that Mr Riley had his hands full of illegal drugs, that Mr Riley lunged at Mr Thompson and caused, albeit in a state of panic, Mr Thompson to discharge the firearm. 

17Nevertheless, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the discharge of the firearm was deliberate. As a consequence, I cannot take into account any notion that Mr Thompson deliberately discharged the shotgun or deliberately killed Mr Riley. 

18The Crown does not allege an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The charge of murder is based upon a killing that has occurred in the course of the commission of a felony. 

19Yet, the killing occurred in the course of a planned armed robbery in which the weapon was deliberately armed and dealt with so as to facilitate the shooting. The planning included the organising of a fake drug deal, the luring of the deceased to a secluded area, being even further into the bush than where the two had previously dealt in drugs, and Mr Thompson's consideration that, once robbed, Mr Riley would have no knowledge of Mr Thompson's home or work address and, because of the illegality of the underlying conduct of both Mr Riley and Mr Thompson, Mr Riley would not inform, or would be unlikely to inform, the police. 

20Further, as already stated, the robbery was motivated by greed and was to be used to facilitate a further supply of drugs. The Crown submits that I should take into account aggravating features described in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (hereinafter ""the Act""), and in particular ss 21A(2)(b), (c) and (n). However, notwithstanding that defence counsel does not cavil with that approach, the aggravating factors described in ss 21A(2)(b) and (c) are elements of the offence. It is difficult to imagine a murder that did not involve the actual or threatened use of violence, although one could have a murder that did not involve the actual or threatened use of a weapon. 

21The aggravating feature described in s 21A(2)(n) is in a different category. I have already remarked as to the planning involved in the totality of the offence. Although, I do have regard to the fact that the killing was not an intended or planned result. 

22Overall, the provisions of s 21A(2) of the Act do not aggravate the offence beyond that which is involved in determining its objective seriousness. I accept the Crown submission that the offence falls in the mid-range of objective seriousness for the crime of murder. While the Crown submits that the objective seriousness is in the upper end of that mid-range, there is no need to be more precise than that the offence is clearly within the mid-range. 

23Traditionally the crime of murder has always been regarded as the most serious of crimes because it involves the felonious taking of human life. The legislature has set a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the worst case of murder and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. These are the guideposts by which the sentence that I must now impose must be measured. 

24As is clear from the difference between the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, even within a crime perceived as the most serious because of our society's view of the sanctity of human life, there is a range of culpability associated with the crime. I have determined the objective features, which measure the culpability of Mr Thompson and I must now deal with his subjective circumstances. Before doing so I should briefly set out the purposes of sentencing in a case such as this. 

Sentencing Principles 

25As is specified by s 3A of the Act, the purposes of sentencing any offender, even those charged with murder, seek to reflect what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals. In serious crimes such as murder the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform. 

26Each of those factors, particularly the protection of the community, personal and public deterrence, and punishment, must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances viewed objectively, within the range of crimes that may fall within the offence charged. The objective seriousness of an offence points most obviously to the factors that require protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution and denunciation. 

27Reform or rehabilitation may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offences, but is a factor affected most obviously by the subjective circumstances and the capacity for rehabilitation. That capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of, rehabilitation in turn impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed that ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. There is usually no single correct sentence and the often-complicated interplay of considerations or guideposts points in different directions: Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. 

Subjective Factors 

28The Court has the benefit of a pre-sentence report and a psychological report from Mr Tim Watson-Munro, Consultant Forensic Psychologist. These describe a somewhat unstable and at times violent upbringing. Mr Thompson is the only child of his biological parents' union. His biological parents separated prior to his birth. Mr Thompson first met his biological father when he was approximately 16 years of age. Until shortly before that time he had believed that his stepfather was his natural father. His stepfather tragically died from cancers deriving from melanoma in August 2009 at the age of 50 years. 

29Mr Thompson described a truncated educational history partly because of the unstable residential environment. This, it is said, impacted upon Mr Thompson's capacity to establish meaningful peer group relationships. He completed year 10 at the age of 15 years and Mr Watson-Munro opines, with which I agree, that he could have progressed further with his education, but for these issues of instability. 

30Mr Thompson has worked in a range of occupations, although his employment was affected by the death of his stepfather and his abuse of amphetamines. 

31Mr Thompson was married to Ms Fennell in February 2010 after having been in a relationship with her for a previous four and one-half years. They have two sons together, Ned aged four years and Jet aged nine months. Those boys are in the company of their mother in prison. Ms Fennell, their mother, also has another child from a previous relationship who is under the care of his father. 

32As previously stated, Mr Thompson uses illegal drugs, which, according to Mr Thompson, commenced when he located his natural father, who, he alleged, was a substance abuser. Mr Thompson claims that his usage of amphetamines was under control until the death of his stepfather, but thereafter increased to peek at using up to two grams per day. Mr Watson-Munro describes Mr Thompson as being, at that time, highly paranoid and suffering protracted sleep disturbance. This, in turn, affected his relationship with Ms Fennell and led to an escalation of drug use. Mr Watson-Munro diagnoses Mr Thompson as having suffered long-standing psychological difficulties best encapsulated by the description Anxiety Disorder associated with a Substance Abuse Disorder, according to the DSM-IV criteria. Mr Watson-Munro describes Mr Thompson's addiction as now in partial remission. 

33The psychological report describes Mr Thompson ""as a clearly depressed and anxious man who is currently before the Court in relation to one count of Felony Murder ... [and who] ... was suffering from a range of psychological symptoms dating back to his childhood, which had been augmented by a rapacious addiction to amphetamines."" 

34The psychological report notes his current detoxification, apparently due to his incarceration, and describes it as being in a state of partial remission. Mr Watson-Munro reports, however, that Mr Thompson ""remains psychologically vulnerable as reflected in the fact that he requires anti-depressant medication"". Mr Thompson is currently undertaking further studies to enhance his prospects of a successful re-integration into the community upon his release. 

35Lastly, Mr Watson-Munro opines: 

""It is clear however given my assessment and as reflected through test results, that he requires more intensive and regular work from a Psychologist. This should focus on Cognitive Behaviour Therapy addressing issues such as relapse prevention and social skills training. He would also benefit from therapy to address his lifelong symptoms of depression, anxiety and low self-esteem arising from his truncated developmental history. I note that Mr Thompson is now estranged from his father, reflecting a strong sense of resentment against his claim that it was his father and his half siblings who introduced him to amphetamines. Bolstering his resolve has been an ultimatum from his wife that the marriage will end if he relapses. Given his attitude to the offence coupled to his remorse, I believe with continuing and regular psychotherapy his prognosis will remain on a positive trajectory."" 

36There is much in this report that favours Mr Thompson. With some of it I do not agree. The evidence before the Court suggests that his natural father was not, in any significant or known way, a substance abuser. I also have some doubt as to the genuineness of his remorse, given his inability to explain or acknowledge responsibility for the preparation of the gun. However, Mr Thompson pleaded guilty, gave evidence and expressed remorse on oath. I do not doubt that Mr Thompson feels sorry for the family of his victim, who, on the material before the Court, continues to suffer greatly not only from the death of Mr Riley, but from the time during which they were unaware of what had happened to Mr Riley. 

37His inability to acknowledge and take responsibility for the loading of the weapon and the results of it and the blaming of his natural father for his substance abuse tends to suggest that Mr Thompson may continue to fail to acknowledge and accept responsibility for his own conduct. Notwithstanding that view, I accept the genuine remorse as to the affects of his conduct on the family of Mr Riley and I accept the opinion of Mr Watson-Munro that he requires significant work with a psychologist focusing on Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and a significant post-incarceration period during which there would be a framework to continue both the therapy and a drug-free environment. 

38As earlier stated, Mr Thompson warrants a discount at the highest level for a plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity and his sentence will reflect the time that he has already served in prison. There has been some assistance given to the police by way of statements that confirm the accessorial guilt of Mr Hamilton to which Ms Fennell is prepared to testify. Even though that confirmation is not particularly significant, some value will be given for it. 

39Given the foregoing, I find that there are special circumstances and, although there will be a significant period of parole even if the statutory formula is applied, a slightly longer period of potential parole will be granted. I also take into account that this is Mr Thompson's first time in custody and he has no relevant prior criminal record. He does have a conviction for common assault in a domestic violence context, but that was an extremely minor offence for which Mr Thompson was subject to an order under s 10A of the Act. There is also a larceny conviction, which, again, I do not take into account as a relevant prior offence. On that basis, Mr Thompson is entitled to a degree of leniency applicable to a person with a minimal criminal record. 

Conclusion 

40Murder is the most serious of offences, with the maximum sentence being life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period being 20 years' imprisonment. A full-time custodial sentence is warranted. Allowance must be made for the early plea of guilty, the minor assistance granted to law enforcement agencies and special circumstances. Given all of those circumstances, it seems to me that a head sentence of 20 years' imprisonment commencing on 18 May 2010 is an appropriate sentence, taking into account all of the matters, to which I have referred, including the objective seriousness and the subjective factors. I will allow a slightly longer period that may potentially be available for parole and I fix the non-parole period at 14 years' imprisonment. 

Conviction and Sentence 

41Adam John Thompson, also known as Adam John Ellenor, you are convicted of murder in that on or about 14 December 2009 at Seahampton in the State of New South Wales you did murder Jay Riley. 

I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 14 years commencing 18 May 2010 and concluding 17 May 2024, the balance of the term being a further 6 years' imprisonment expiring on 17 May 2030. 

You are first eligible for release on parole on 17 May 2024.

2757896,Tiknius v R [2011] NSWCCA 215,"Judgment 

1TOBIAS AJA : I agree with Johnson J. 

2JOHNSON J : This is an application for leave to appeal by Atas Tiknius with respect to sentences imposed in the Sydney District Court on 6 November 2009 for serious drug importation offences contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth). 

3Following pleas of guilty, the Applicant was sentenced as follows: 
 





Offence

Maximum Penalty

Sentence



Count 1 - Between about 10 January 2008 and 23 January 2008 at Sydney, aiding and abetting the importation of a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, amphetamine, contrary to ss.11.2(1) and 307.1(1) Criminal Code (Cth)

Life imprisonment

Imprisonment for 10 years commencing 23 January 2009 and expiring 22 January 2019

Grounds of Appeal 

5The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

(a) Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge failed to give adequate weight to the mitigating fact that the Applicant committed the offences under duress. 

(b) Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge failed to give adequate weight to the Applicant's demonstrated contrition. 

(c) Ground 3 - the sentences for Counts 1 and 2 are manifestly excessive. 

Facts of Offences 

6The sentencing hearing in the District Court commenced on 29 October 2009 and continued on 6 November 2009, with her Honour passing sentence on that day. 

7The evidence in the District Court on sentence comprised an agreed statement of facts, together with extensive oral evidence from the Applicant (occupying 48 transcript pages) and a number of documents tendered in the defence case, including a report of Ms Michelle Player, psychologist. 

8Given the grounds of appeal in this Court, it is appropriate to refer to the findings of the sentencing Judge concerning the offences. When introducing this part of the remarks, her Honour stated (ROS1-2): 

""The circumstances of the offences can be discerned from the statement of facts, evidence given by Mr Tiknius, which I accepted, and documentary evidence presented on his behalf which supported some aspects of his evidence. I did not find Mr Tiknius' account of how he came to be involved in the offences inherently implausible, nor do I consider it to be a partial or total fabrication."" 

9The sentencing Judge then moved to the facts of the second count (the possess MDMA offence), which occurred first in time (ROS2-3): 

""The facts of the 2007 possession charge are as follows. Mr Tiknius arrived in Australia on 12 February 2007. On 18 February 2007 a sculpture weighing 695 kilograms was imported by air from Lithuania into Australia consigned to Davidus Brathus. Mr Tiknius, using the false name Brathus, leased a storage unit at Storage King Hillsdale, arranged with a freight forwarding company for the delivery of the consignment to the storage unit, hired drilling equipment and, as instructed, drilled into the pillar and retrieved some of the pills. In his second trip in 2007, he delivered them in three lots to a man he had been instructed to contact. He left Australia on 12 March 2007, the date specified in his air ticket. He returned to Australia on 11 April as instructed and left on 9 May, during which time he delivered some of the pills as directed, as I noted above. His airfare and expenses, including storage and hire charges, were paid by the man who had recruited him to come to Australia and perform these tasks, about whom I will say more later. He kept in touch with that man by email to receive instructions while he was in Australia. 

In January 2008 the Australian Federal Police examined this pillar and found 182.2 grams of powder, which was analysed to be 55.1 grams of pure 3-4 MDMA. The marketable quantity for that drug is 0.5 grams. Mr Tiknius acknowledged that the pillar had contained a higher amount of the drug, an unknown marketable quantity, though less than the commercial quantity specified for that drug. The quantity of drug in each offence is not dispositive of sentence, but is a relevant factor to take into account. The wholesale value of 182.2 grams of MDMA at 30% purity was estimated at $11,000. If pressed into pills it was estimated to have a street value of between $20,640 and $34,400."" 

10The sentencing Judge then made findings concerning the first count (the aid and abet importation of amphetamine offence) (ROS3): 

""In respect of the 2008 offence, Mr Tiknius arrived in Australia on 10 January 2008. As on the 2007 trips, he stayed with a friend of a friend which he had arranged through that friend. Again, his airfare and expenses were paid for by the man who was giving him directions. On 14 January a sculpture weighing 497 kilograms was imported by air into Australia from Lithuania. The Australian Federal Police examined it and found it to contain 27.183 kilograms of amphetamine powder. Using the false name Brathus, Mr Tiknius contacted the freight forwarder a number of times inquiring about the consignment and arranging for its delivery. Using the same name he leased another storage unit at Storage King Hillsdale. When the consignment was delivered there under AFP control he organised with a truck hire firm to transport the column to its premises in Hillsdale and for a stone mason in adjoining premises to cut off the top of the sculpture in order that he could gain access to the drugs contained therein. Police attended the next day, 23 January, when the stone mason commenced cutting into the pillar, seized the consignment and arrested Mr Tiknius near where he was staying a short time later. The 27.183 kilograms of power was found to have a purity of 7.5%, giving an amount of 2.0338 kilograms of pure amphetamine. The commercial quantity prescribed for amphetamine is 750 grams. The wholesale value of the 27.183 kilograms of amphetamine at 7.5% purity was estimated at $408,000 and if sold in single gram weights at that purity its value was estimated at $1,902,000."" 

Findings Concerning Reasons for Applicant's Involvement in Offences 

11Her Honour then moved to summarise the evidence of the Applicant concerning the circumstances which drew him into the commission of the offences, before making findings concerning the duress issue and the role of the Applicant in the offences (ROS3-6): 

""Mr Tiknius said he came to Australia at the behest of a Lithuanian man he met in a night club on New Years Eve 2005. The man offered Mr Tiknius some cocaine, which he had not previously used, and which they consumed together. Over the next year Mr Tiknius met this man once or twice each week in night clubs, bars or at the beach and consumed increasing amounts of cocaine given to him free by this man, whom he considered a friend. He became dependent on the cocaine, which he had never used before he was introduced to it by this man. In December 2006 the Lithuanian man, accompanied by a Russian man, demanded payment of $ [sic] 84,000 litas, approximately $42,000 Australian, for the cocaine he had been provided during the year. When Mr Tiknius said he did not have that amount of money they said they would find a job for him to do. The Russian man put a pistol to Mr Tiknius' head and said they would rape and shoot his girlfriend if he did not comply with their demand. The threat was repeated and remained constant during his subsequent dealings with the Lithuanian man and his trips to Australia. A few days after this initial demand the Lithuanian man told Mr Tiknius the debt would be expunged if he went to Australia, collected some freight, stored it and passed it to some people. Mr Tiknius was not told and did not ask the details of the freight, but thought it was something illegal. The threat to harm his girlfriend was repeated if he told the police or anyone else. 

From an occasion when Mr Tiknius had been in the company of the Lithuanian man, he formed the view the Lithuanian man had connections with corrupt police. For that reason and because he feared for the safety of his girlfriend, he did not tell the police, including two police officers who were business clients of his telecommunications business because he did not think it appropriate to tell them what he described as his personal problems. He booked his airfare with money given to him by the Lithuanian man and gave the man a photocopy of his passport, which was used to produce a copy of a false passport in the name Brathus, which Mr Tiknius used as identification with the freight forwarder and drill hire company on his 2007 trip. The Lithuanian man organised Mr Tiknius' visa to Australia and for him to attend an English language school in Australia as a pretext for his trip. He undertook the two trips to Australia in 2007. While drilling into the first sculpture he damaged some of the pills with water. He was therefore required to undertake the 2008 trip. 

After the demand was made of him in December 2006, Mr Tiknius felt stressed, nervous and had trouble sleeping. He went to a doctor and was prescribed some medication. Records from his local hospital in Klaipedia, Lithuania (Exhibit 2), showed Mr Tiknius consulted a doctor there on 9 January 2007, was diagnosed with sleep disorder and possible anxiety disorder and was prescribed medication including sleeping tablets. The medical record confirms he visited the doctor three more times in 2007, in March, May and September, and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and on the last occasion possible depression. I am satisfied Mr Tiknius' anxiety and depressive symptoms contributed to his decision to accede to the demands of the Lithuanian man and commit the offences. 

I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Tiknius came to Australia and carried out the tasks I have noted above at the direction of the Lithuanian man and as a result of the pressure he felt from that man and his Russian companion, including threats to harm his girlfriend, his awareness that the Russian man was armed and his belief that he could not approach the police because the Lithuanian man had a corrupt relationship with a police chief. Nor did he consider he could confide in the police officers to whom he was providing telecommunication services in the course of his employment. His reward for undertaking the trips and tasks was to be to have his drug debt forgiven. 

His role in each case of taking delivery of the object containing the drugs, storing it, retrieving and distributing part of the drugs in 2007 and attempting to gain access to the drugs in 2008 before the police intervened are at the lower end of tasks to be performed, though because of the combination of tasks he performed his role was not at the lowest level. But clearly he was subordinate to the Lithuanian man and that man's unknown associates who organised the importations. Mr Tiknius was directed by daily emails from the Lithuanian man. His role was integral to securing the imported substances in Australia and delivering some of the drugs from the first consignment to the Australian contact. He did not achieve that in relation to the second consignment before he was arrested, though he was in the course of arranging access to the drugs. 

Mr Tiknius acknowledged the importance of his role, albeit at his subordinate level, to the success of the importations. He said he was angry at himself for having naively become involved in drug use and having made the decision to come to Australia, though under duress, and guilty for having potentially exposed people to the drugs he warehoused."" 

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances 

12The sentencing Judge summarised the Applicant's subjective circumstances in the following way (ROS6-7): 

""Mr Tiknius is 28 years old. He has no prior convictions. He was born and raised in Lithuania, the only child of his parents' marriage. When Mr Tiknius was a child, his father was violent to his mother when he drank alcohol, as a result of which Mr Tiknius developed anxiety symptoms as a child. He successfully completed school then a degree in journalism. He then worked consistently for one employer, Omnitel, a telecommunications business, and progressed to being a business relationships manager. His employer provided a positive reference. His girlfriend, who was the subject of the threats from the Lithuanian man and his companion, was his long time girlfriend since high school. Their relationship has ended since Mr Tiknius was arrested here. 

In custody Mr Tiknius has been working in the laundry, studying English and computer use and attending church and bible studies. His mother has visited him once since he has been in custody. He plans to live with his parents on his return to Lithuania. His father has moderated his behaviour and their relationship has improved. Mr Tiknius is experiencing the isolation of being in custody here far from his family and friends. He suffers problems sleeping and takes medication which has not entirely resolved the problem. A psychologist, Michelle Player, assessed Mr Tiknius' symptoms in 2007 as consistent with a major depression and said his symptoms persist because of his difficulty coping with being in custody and separated from his family. Mr Tiknius' demeanour when he gave evidence was consistent with such symptoms. 

Mr Tiknius stopped using cocaine in December 2006 when the demand was made of him by the Lithuanian man, so he has no current drug issues. Given his stable life before he met the Lithuanian man and the salutary experience for him of being in custody, I am of the view Mr Tiknius is unlikely to re-offend."" 

Other Statements and Findings in Remarks on Sentence 

13The remarks on sentence occupied seven-and-a-half transcript pages. The extracts included so far in this judgment constitute the great bulk of the remarks on sentence. 

14Given submissions advanced in support of the first and second grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to refer to the balance of the remarks on sentence. 

15After a recital of the charges and applicable maximum penalties at the commencement of the remarks, her Honour observed (ROS1): 

""In sentencing Mr Tiknius for these offences I am required to take into account the relevant matters in s 16A of the Crimes Act and general deterrence, and impose sentences of severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offences. Mr Tiknius acknowledges that sentences of imprisonment, which should only be imposed if no other sentence is appropriate, are appropriate for these offences."" 

16Following the findings made concerning the offences and the manner in which the Applicant came to be criminally involved in these matters, and after assessing the Applicant's role (the extract set out at [11] above), her Honour concluded the remarks on sentence in the following way (ROS7-8): 

""Mr Tiknius pleaded guilty to these two offences in the Local Court which indicated his willingness to facilitate the course of justice. I will afford him a discount of 25% of each sentence as is permissible for Commonwealth offences. I have decided that partially cumulative sentences are appropriate to reflect the total criminality in the two offences occurring at different times. As required by s 19AB of the Crimes Act, I have fixed a single non-parole period for the two sentences, proportioned in accordance with the usual range for Commonwealth offences. The sentences will commence on 23 January 2008, the date of Mr Tiknius' arrest, since when he has been in custody. 

Taking all those matters into account I sentence you as follows. For the possession charge a sentence of six years imprisonment to date from 23 January 2008. For the aiding and abetting the importation charge a sentence of 10 years imprisonment to date from 23 January 2009. That is a total sentence of 11 years imprisonment. I set a single non-parole period of six years, six months imprisonment to date from 23 January 2008 and to expire on 22 July 2014."" 

Ground 1 - The Duress Issue 

17Mr Game SC, for the Applicant, submitted that the sentencing Judge had made a finding on the balance of probabilities in favour of the Applicant to the effect that he committed the offences under duress. He submitted that a finding of duress, falling short of the legal defence of duress, is capable of being a significant mitigating factor: R v Liu [2005] NSWCCA 378 at [20]-[21], [34]; El-Charr v R [2007] NSWCCA 16 at [27]. 

18Mr Game SC submitted that current authorities on duress are somewhat opaque as to the weight which ought be given to that factor on sentence. He acknowledged that the factor will vary significantly depending upon the facts of the case, and that general deterrence will still be a relevant consideration, even in cases involving duress: R v Liu at [34]; R v Riddell [2009] NSWCCA 96; 194 A Crim R 524 at 537-538 [59]-[62]. 

19Mr Game SC submitted that it is apparent from the remarks on sentence that her Honour had some regard to duress in determining the moral culpability of the Applicant. He submitted, however, that having found that duress was established, her Honour went on to make two significant errors. Firstly, she failed to take duress into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. Secondly, her Honour failed to give duress adequate weight, and thus failed to allow for an appropriate reduction in the sentence imposed. 

20Senior counsel for the Applicant submitted that the only comments made by her Honour about the extent of the Applicant's role in the offences did not take into account duress in assessing the objective seriousness of those offences. Accordingly, he submitted that the failure to consider, or properly consider, duress as relevant to objective seriousness was a clear error in this case. It was submitted that this was not a case where the evidence of duress was vague. The Applicant had given evidence (accepted in full by the sentencing Judge) and documentary evidence corroborated aspects of the Applicant's testimony. 

21Mr Game SC submitted that the gravity of the duress was high in this case. The Applicant detailed the fact that a gun had been held to his head and that threats had been made to shoot and rape his girlfriend in Lithuania. Further, the Applicant had become aware that those threatening him had links to corrupt police and could use them to further their own ends. It was submitted that the Applicant was vulnerable, having developed a drug dependency by the time the threats were made. 

22He submitted that the actual findings in relation to duress were very favourable to the Applicant and should have resulted in a significant discount of the sentence that would otherwise have been appropriate. 

23Mr Game SC pointed to the defence of duress contained in s.10.2 Criminal Code (Cth) which contains both subjective and objective elements. It was submitted that her Honour had apparently come to the conclusion that the subjective aspects of the defence of duress were made out, so that the Applicant may well have been entitled to a complete defence, but for the objective measures incorporated in the test. So viewed, it was submitted that the Applicant's level of culpability was very low (and much lower than someone who engages in these activities for gain). He submitted that it was in this context that the objective seriousness of his offending should be assessed. 

24Mr Game SC submitted that her Honour fell into error in part by failing to explain the extent to which the duress influencing the Applicant was relevant to her considerations of both the objective seriousness of the offences and the circumstances in which the offences occurred. The lack of explanation as to how, and to what extent, duress was to be taken into account led to her Honour's further error in failing to give adequate weight to duress when it came to an assessment of the circumstances in which the offences occurred. 

25Senior counsel for the Applicant submitted that error is exposed by reviewing the sentences ultimately imposed on the Applicant. It was contended that neither sentence was commensurate with her Honour's findings that the Applicant operated under significant duress. It was submitted that a starting head sentence of eight years for Count 2, and of 13 years and four months for Count 1, did not properly reflect the element of duress involved in the offences. He submitted that this Court should intervene and reduce the sentences to adequately reflect her Honour's findings on this issue. 

26The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had undertaken a lengthy analysis of the duress issue, concluding with acceptance of the Applicant's account, and that these findings were taken into account on sentence. Specific reference was made to her Honour's opening words in the final paragraph of the remarks - ""Taking all those matters into account I sentence you as follows ..."" (see [16] above). 

27Although acknowledging that her Honour made no further finding as to the impact of the duress finding on the Applicant's moral culpability, the Crown contended that the favourable findings made by the sentencing Judge had been brought into account in his favour in the imposition of the sentences passed for these offences. 

28The Crown submitted that the significance of duress as a factor on sentence must vary according to the circumstances. It was necessary to have regard to the role and activities of an offender and the duration of time over which that person acted criminally. In this case, the Crown emphasised that the Applicant had made three separate journeys from Lithuania to Australia over an extended period of time and that his activities were critical to the operation in Australia. 

29The Crown submitted that it was not necessary for the sentencing Judge to, in some way, quantify the discount on sentence arising from the duress finding. It was submitted that the sentencing Judge had given weight to the duress finding and that the Applicant had not made good the first ground of appeal. 

Non-Exculpatory Duress as a Factor on Sentence 

30Before moving to resolution of the first ground of appeal, it is useful to make some general observations concerning the relevance of non-exculpatory duress to the sentencing process. 

31The concept of duress is well known to the common law. In R v Z [2005] UKHL 22; (2005) 2 AC 467 at 489 [17], Lord Bingham of Cornhill said: 

""The commonsense starting point of the common law is that adults of sound mind are ordinarily to be held responsible for the crimes which they commit. To this general principle there has, since the fourteenth century, been a recognised but limited exception in favour of those who commit crimes because they are forced or compelled to do so against their will by the threats of another. Such persons are said, in the language of the criminal law, to act as they do because they are subject to duress."" 
 
32Where an offender commits a crime whilst acting under duress which falls short of a complete defence to the charge, that duress is capable of being a mitigating factor on penalty. The onus lies upon the offender to establish the facts which are said to operate to mitigate penalty: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [26]-[27]. 

33In the context of offences against New South Wales law, a nominated mitigating factor arises where ""the offender was acting under duress"" : s.21A(3)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ; R v Razzak [2006] NSWSC 1366; 166 A Crim R 132 at 147 [63]-[64]; Le v R [2007] NSWCCA 330 at [6]. With respect to State offences, the concept of duress is governed by common law principles and both subjective and objective elements are involved: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531; R v Razzak at 140-141 [25]-[30]; R v Nguyen [2008] NSWCCA 22; 181 A Crim R 72 at 79-81 [33]-[40]. 

34With respect to Commonwealth offences, the test for duress is now contained in s.10.2 Criminal Code (Cth) , which contains both subjective and objective features. Section 10.2 provides: 

""10.2 Duress 

(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence under duress. 

(2) A person carries out conduct under duress if and only if he or she reasonably believes that: 

(a) a threat has been made that will be carried out unless an offence is committed; and 

(b) there is no reasonable way that the threat can be rendered ineffective; and 

(c) the conduct is a reasonable response to the threat. 

(3) This section does not apply if the threat is made by or on behalf of a person with whom the person under duress is voluntarily associating for the purpose of carrying out conduct of the kind actually carried out."" 

35The construction of s.10.2 was considered by this Court in R v Oblach [2005] NSWCCA 440; 65 NSWLR 75, where it was observed (at 86 [70]) that threats to an offender falling short of duress could be a relevant factor on sentence. 

36There is no reference in s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to duress as a factor to be taken into account on sentence for a Commonwealth offence. However, a Court must impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence: s.16A(1). The Court must take into account the nature and circumstances of the offence (s.16A(2)(a)) and the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence (s.16A(k)). 

37The relevance of non-exculpatory duress in mitigation of sentence may arise after trial and conviction, where duress has been a trial issue. In that case, it will be necessary for the sentencing Judge to make factual findings as part of an assessment whether this factor assists the offender on sentence and, if so, to what extent. Of course, the fact that the jury has rejected the defence of duress does not mean that threats or other conduct falling short of the defence, cannot be taken into account on sentence: R v Oblach at 86 [69]-[70]. 

38Where the trial has proceeded before a Judge sitting alone, the findings made leading to the rejection of the defence of duress may assist a determination of the relevance of non-exculpatory duress on sentence: R v Lorenz (1998) 146 FLR 369 at 377. 

39Where an offender pleads guilty to an offence, there is, of course, an admission of all the elements of the offence and an acceptance that a complete defence of duress is not available: R v Razzak at 140 [27]. 

40Whether an offender is able to discharge the onus on the civil standard of establishing mitigating facts involving non-exculpatory duress will, of course, depend upon the particular case. In some cases, the prosecution case may contain evidence which is relevant to this question in a record of interview or otherwise. Evidence may be given by the offender on sentence which asserts the existence of threats. If this is done, that evidence may be tested by the prosecution in cross-examination. 

41The role on sentence of non-exculpatory duress was described generally in R v Day [2009] SASC 84, where Sulan J (Doyle CJ and White J agreeing) stated at [35]: 

""There may be instances in which a person acts under fear or from threats as a result of which he may be considered to be less culpable than an offender who is not under pressure to offend. The rationale for regarding such circumstances as a mitigating factor were discussed by King CJ in Trocko [(1988) 142 LSJS 412] . He said: 

'I think that as a matter of principle threats made to an offender which fall short of supporting a defence of duress may nevertheless be taken into account by way of mitigation of penalty. I think that that must be so for two reasons. The fact that a person acts out of fear in consequence of intimidation may well in certain circumstances affect the degree of his subjective or moral culpability with respect to the conduct for which he is before the court. Moreover, the same consideration may affect his prospects of rehabilitation. The fact that the offence has not been committed out of motives of greed or malice but rather out of fear may carry with it the consequence that if the cause of the fear is removed, the offender will be unlikely to offend again. But whether in a particular case the fact that fear of intimidation has played a part in the commission of offences, should result in a reduction in penalty must depend on the circumstances of the particular case'."" 


42In assessing the objective seriousness or gravity of an offence, matters of motivation, such as duress, are causally related to the commission of the offence and may be classified as circumstances of the offence: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 186-187 [86]. These statements in R v Way may be taken to have general application, extending beyond consideration of standard non-parole period offences (not relevant to the Applicant's offences). 

43With respect to drug importation offences, the Courts have observed that, as a matter of commonsense, it should be inferred, unless there is evidence to the contrary, that a person who is importing drugs is doing so for profit: R v Kaldor [2004] NSWCCA 425; 150 A Crim R 271 at 297 [104]; R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at 127 [72](f). Motive is relevant to an assessment of objective gravity of an offence. It is relevant if the offence is committed because of threats and fear of harm to self or others rather than financial profit or greed. These matters bear upon the moral or true culpability of an offender: R v Z at 492 [22]. 

44There have been a number of cases where an offender claims on sentence that his or her involvement in a drug importation or supply offence was the product of threats to self and family, with the threats sometimes coupled with the demand by those making the threats that involvement in the drug supply or importation is required to discharge an existing debt. Whether an offender's claim of this type is accepted depends, of course, on the facts of the particular case. 

45Speaking generally, sentencing courts are entitled to approach claims of this sort with a significant degree of circumspection. Claims may be easily made concerning the alleged conduct of persons in another country which is said to have applied pressure upon an offender: Anna Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136 at [32]. It has been said that verification of a spurious claim of duress may prove difficult: R v Z at 492 [22]. 

46A careful and close assessment of evidence adduced to support such a claim should be made, with the onus of proof upon the offender kept firmly in mind. 

47That such events can occur, of course, has been recognised by sentencing courts. In R v Taonis (1974) 59 Cr App R 160, in the context of a drug importation case where it was common ground that the offender had become involved in the crime as a result of threats, Scarman LJ (for the Court of Appeal also comprising Edmund Davies LJ and Boreham J) observed at 160-161: 

""... I fear that such is the financial attraction of this evil trade, that those who organise it and derive major profits do descend to threats of violence to persuade people like this appellant to do the dirty work of picking up the drugs and bringing them through the customs barriers of this country."" 

48Australian drug supply or importation cases, where a claim of non-exculpatory duress has been made on sentence (with differing outcomes), include R v Tapasa (NSWCCA, 31 October 1997, unreported); R v N [1999] NSWCCA 187; 106 A Crim R 493; R v Oblach at 86 [69]-[70]; R v Liu [2005] NSWCCA 378; R v Stankovic [2006] NSWCCA 229; R v Huynh [2008] NSWCCA 16; R v Nguyen and R v Riddell . 

49Where the offender discharges the onus and satisfies the sentencing Court that a factual finding should be made that the offender's involvement in the offence was affected by duress, it will remain for the Court to determine what weight should be given to that factor on sentence. This will involve, amongst other things, consideration of the form and duration of the offender's criminal conduct, the nature of the threats made and consideration of opportunities which were available to the offender to report the matter to relevant authorities. 

50In addition, it is necessary to keep in mind, even at the sentencing stage, some of the policy considerations underlying the law of duress. In Taiapa v The Queen [2009] HCA 53; 240 CLR 95 at 106 [31], French CJ, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ, accepted as a starting point when considering the reasonableness of a person's actions (concerning the defence of duress), the proposition stated by King CJ in R v Brown (1986) 43 SASR 33 at 40: 

""The ordinary way in which a citizen renders ineffective criminal intimidation is to report the intimidators and to seek the protection of the police. That must be assumed, under ordinary circumstances, to be an effective means of neutralising intimidation. If it were not so, society would be at the mercy of criminals who could force pawns to do their criminal work by means of intimidation."" 

51General deterrence has a very substantial role on sentence in cases where non-exculpatory duress is relied upon by the offender: R v Riddell at 536-539 [54]-[63]. The grooming and pressuring of persons to become involved in drug importation offences have been said to be ""unremarkable features of many importation offences"" : Anna Le v R at [32]; R v Huynh at [11]. At times, the persons targeted by those recruiting them are said to have submissive or compliant personalities ( R v Liu at [34]) or to be naive ( Anna Le v R at [32]). 

52In R v Roach [2005] VSCA 162, Callaway JA (Ormiston and Charles JJA agreeing) observed at [15]: 

""General deterrence is not excluded by threats. On the contrary, general deterrence may provide a counter-threat."" 

53In R v Z , Baroness Hale of Richmond adverted to considerations of this type at 509-510 [70]: 

""As Professor Andrew Ashworth, Principles of Criminal Law , 4th ed, (2003), p 228 points out, there are other policy problems with relying on duress as a mitigating factor: 

'Mitigation may be right if 'desert' is the basis for sentence, but supporters of deterrent sentencing have a particular problem. Their general approach is to maintain that the stronger the temptation or pressure to commit a crime, the stronger the law's threat should be in order to counterbalance it. The law and its penalties should be used to strengthen the resolve of those under pressure.' 

That is, indeed, a common approach to sentencing: in drug smuggling cases, for example, the 'mule' may well have been subjected to intense pressure to carry the goods into the United Kingdom, but heavy sentences are imposed, not only to deter others from succumbing to such pressures, but also to deter the barons from using them. Mr Perry, for the Crown, argued that it was doing the vulnerable no favours to expand the scope of duress for their benefit, as this would merely encourage their duressors to exploit them."" 


54An assessment of these various considerations, some of which pull in different directions, is required in a case where non-exculpatory duress is established by an offender. 

Resolution of First Ground 

55I return to this case. 

56In Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118, Simpson J (Davies J and Grove AJ agreeing) observed at [71]: 

""Assessment of the objective gravity of any offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. It should not be doubted that any sentencing decision calls for attention to be paid to the objective gravity of the offence: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357."" 

57This proposition applies as much to sentencing for a Commonwealth offence, where the terms of s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) need to be considered. There is force in the Applicant's submission that the remarks on sentence in this case do not assess the objective gravity of the Applicant's crimes. 

58This Court is generally reluctant to entertain favourably grounds of appeal which contend that there was a failure to give ""adequate weight"" to a factor on sentence: Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 at [33]. Matters of weight are for the sentencing Judge. Unless it be demonstrated that the sentencing Judge placed so little weight on the duress finding that the sentence fell outside the appropriate exercise of sentencing discretion, there is no basis for appellate intervention: El-Charr v R at [28]. 

59A significant feature of the submission in support of the first ground of appeal is that her Honour moved from strongly favourable findings on the duress issue to the imposition of sentence, without any assessment of the impact of the duress finding on the objective gravity of the Applicant's offences. In my view, this complaint is made out in this case. 

60Her Honour's acceptance of the Applicant's evidence was a practical starting point in an assessment of the objective gravity of the Applicant's offences. What was then necessary, to comply with relevant principles, was an articulated assessment by her Honour of the impact of the finding of duress upon the objective gravity and moral culpability of the Applicant's offences. This did not require an elaborate and detailed analysis. However, some analysis, and an expression of conclusions, was required. It did not happen in this case. 

61The very fact that an unusual and favourable finding was being made, which would operate in the interests of the Applicant, required analysis and conclusions with respect to moral culpability and objective seriousness of the offences. In light of her Honour's findings, this was a most important feature in this case, bearing upon the motivation of the Applicant to become involved in serious criminal activity. 

62To determine whether the first ground of appeal is made good, it is appropriate for this Court to take her Honour's factual findings and to make further findings concerning the objective seriousness of these offences and the Applicant's moral culpability. 

63Considerations of the type raised at [49] above require attention. What was the form and duration of the Applicant's criminal conduct? What opportunities did he have to report the matter to the authorities? What was the nature of the threats made? 

64Her Honour characterised the Applicant's role in each offence as not being at the lowest level, but as being clearly subordinate to the Lithuanian man and his associates who had organised the importations. The Applicant's role was integral to the criminal conduct. 

65The Applicant travelled three times to Australia in the process of committing these offences. It was not a single trip committed in a short period of time. 

66The relatively elaborate nature of the Applicant's activities in the criminal enterprise should also be kept in mind. With respect to the second count, the possession offence committed in 2007-2008, the Applicant: 

(a) booked return air travel from Lithuania to Australia twice; 

(b) travelled from Lithuania to Australia twice; 

(c) arranged accommodation in Australia for the two stays; 

(d) leased a storage facility for the storage of the granite pillar; 

(e) liaised with a freight-forwarding agency for the delivery of the granite pillar to the storage facility; 

(f) leased a drill to access the drugs within the granite pillar; 

(g) drilled into the pillar to retrieve the drugs; and 

(h) contacted the intended recipient in Australia for the delivery of the drugs. 

67With respect to the aiding and abetting offence in 2008, the Applicant: 

(a) booked return air travel from Lithuania to Australia; 

(b) arranged accommodation within Australia; 

(c) renewed the leasing of a storage facility; 

(d) liaised with a freight-forwarding agency for the delivery of the shipment to the storage facility; 

(e) arranged for a stone cutter to access the drugs from within the granite sculpture; and 

(f) arranged delivery of the pillar to the stone cutter for the drugs to be accessed. 

68Clearly, the criminal activities of the Applicant extended far beyond those of the usual type of drug importer who has been conscripted by threats, namely a ""mule"" or carrier of drugs into Australia. The Applicant used his intelligence and life skills in a number of respects in Australia in aid of the criminal enterprise. 

69Where (as in the Applicant's case) the offending occurs over an extended period and there were opportunities available to report the threats to police and authorities in Australia, well removed from the place where the threats were made, then the mitigating value to be given to duress may be reduced. 

70This is especially so as the Applicant's concerns about Lithuanian police appear to have been somewhat oblique. Using the words in Taiapa v The Queen at 109-110 [40], it may be said that the Applicant's ""unparticularised concern that police protection may not be a guarantee of safety"" to himself and others in Lithuania, means that his fear ought operate less in his favour on sentence. To do otherwise would operate against public policy considerations concerning duress, even on sentence. 

71A further factor here is that the Applicant made three separate return trips between Lithuania and Australia in 2007 and 2008 to further his involvement in these crimes. Not only were there opportunities over an extended period to report those threatening him, but once he was involved criminally, the Applicant was exercising a degree of autonomy and was fulfilling a trusted role, even though he was influenced by fear: R v Riddell at 532-536 [33]-[52]. The Applicant was not supervised in his criminal activities in Australia: R v Stankovic at [44]. 

72It is also relevant that the situation in which the Applicant found himself was, in a sense, one of his own making in that he chose to associate himself, over a protracted period, with the person who provided him with the drugs and who came to threaten him: R v Trocko (SASC, 18 April 1988, BC8800351, pages 5-6). The Applicant's offences involved not a single offence of short duration, but a course of conduct over an extended period: R v Trocko at pages 6-7. Nor did the Applicant, when apprehended, reveal the identity of those who had threatened him. These considerations operate to reduce the mitigating effects of the threats which influenced his offending: R v Trocko at pages 6-7. 

73Nevertheless, the sentencing Judge found that the Applicant was acting under significant pressure, falling short of a defence of duress, involving ongoing threats directed to his girlfriend and himself and including the production of a firearm. Her Honour's findings accepted that the Applicant believed that serious harm would be done to his girlfriend, and perhaps others in Lithuania, if he did not co-operate with those making the threats, and that the Applicant believed that law enforcement authorities in Lithuania could not safely be relied upon to protect his girlfriend and family in Lithuania. 

74All of this, according to the findings of the sentencing Judge, followed a course of conduct whereby the Applicant was sucked in by those threatening him through provision of cocaine and then demands for payment, all of which were directed towards manipulation of the Applicant to undertake travel to Australia to advance the criminal ends of these persons. 

75The Applicant had employment in Lithuania with no criminal history there or elsewhere. The primary factual findings of the sentencing Judge, in my view, ought to have translated into a finding of significant reduction in the Applicant's moral culpability and a corresponding reduction, in the unusual circumstances of this case, in the objective seriousness in the Applicant's offences. 

76I accept the submission of Mr Game SC that the sentences imposed for these offences do not indicate that adequate weight was given to the strong primary findings made by the sentencing Judge on the issue of duress. Completion of the necessary process of analysis, and an assessment of the objective gravity of these offences, required more in the most unusual circumstances of this case. 

77The Applicant has demonstrated that the sentences imposed fell outside the appropriate exercise of sentencing discretion. 

78I am satisfied that the first ground of appeal has been established. 

Ground 2 - The Remorse Issue 

Submissions 

79Mr Game SC submitted that s.16A(2)(f) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) required the sentencing court to take into account the degree to which the Applicant had shown contrition for his offences. It was submitted that the Applicant had given evidence of his remorse and that further evidence of his contrition was contained in the report dated 17 April 2009 of Ms Player. 

80Mr Game SC submitted that express allowance had not been made for the Applicant's contrition. A mere summary of the evidence of contrition given by the Applicant did not demonstrate that any, or any sufficient, weight had been given to it. 

81The Crown submitted that the absence of express reference to contrition, against the background of reference being made to the Applicant's evidence in this respect, did not demonstrate that the second ground had been made out. 

Decision 

82The sentencing Judge allowed a 25% discount for the Applicant's pleas of guilty entered in the Local Court which had indicated his willingness to facilitate the course of justice. This discount was allowed in accordance with the principles in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 [160], which may be applied to Commonwealth offences: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [34]; Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339 at 343 [14]. That discount reflects the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and the associated willingness to facilitate the course of justice. It did not include a discount for contrition, which should be separately reflected. 

83Her Honour's remarks on sentence had made general reference to s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (at [15] above). The written submissions provided to the District Court accepted that there was evidence of contrition in this case (AB67). 

84There was no controversy in this case that the Applicant was entitled to have evidence of his contrition taken into account in his favour on sentence. The appropriate course was for her Honour to advert expressly to this by reference to s.16A(2)(f) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) . The absence of any reference to this factor leaves the sentencing process vulnerable to the challenge contained in the second ground of appeal. 

85I keep in mind, however, that the ground contends that the sentencing Judge failed to give ""adequate weight"" to this factor. There is an acceptance in the ground of appeal that some weight was given to it on sentence. 

86In the end, I am not persuaded that this ground of appeal has been made good. Even if it had merit, the impact of success on this ground would be modest. The position may be contrasted with the conclusion reached on the first ground of appeal. 

87I would not uphold the second ground of appeal. 

Ground 3 - The Sentences Are Manifestly Excessive 

Submissions 

88Mr Game SC submitted that success by the Applicant on Ground 1 (in particular) and Ground 2 ought lead to the conclusion that the sentence on each count is manifestly excessive. It was submitted that, once proper weight was given to the duress finding, a Court would be satisfied that the sentences are such that intervention and resentencing is required. 

89The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed were not manifestly excessive. In support of this submission, the Crown pointed to sentences imposed in other cases, although recognising that the relatively unusual circumstances of the duress component in this case made comparison with other cases more difficult than it would otherwise be. 

Decision 

90I approach the determination of this ground upon the basis that the Applicant has established error in accordance with the first ground of appeal, but not the second. 

91The Applicant has committed serious offences, punishable by maximum penalties of life imprisonment and imprisonment for 25 years respectively. 

92The amphetamine offence involved a pure quantity of amphetamine of 2.0338 kilograms (about 2.7 times the commercial quantity for that drug (750 grams)). 

93The pure quantity of MDMA (ecstasy) involved in the other offence, and the total quantity of the substance imported, are not known. The pure quantity of MDMA within the substance actually seized was 55.1 grams. 

94The analysis undertaken at [63] to [75] above should be kept in mind in assessing this ground as well. 

95This was a case where the requirements for individualised justice, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, called for a finding that the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offences was significantly reduced, requiring the imposition of lesser sentences than those imposed by the sentencing Judge. 

96In view of the findings concerning the first ground, I am satisfied that the Applicant has made good the third ground of appeal as well. 

Resentencing the Applicant 

97I am satisfied that the imposition of lesser sentences is warranted in law in this case: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

98It is necessary to give full effect to the findings of the sentencing Judge concerning duress. This will bring to account the duress finding in assessing the nature and circumstances of each offence for the purpose of s.16A(2)(a), and in determining sentences which are of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances (s.16A(1)) and which ensure that the Applicant is adequately punished for his offences (s.16A(2)(k)). Significant weight must be given to general deterrence, a powerful factor on sentence in a case such as this. 

99After taking into account the objective and subjective features of the case and relevant factors under s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) , and the important element of general deterrence, and allowing for the 25% discount for the Applicant's pleas, I am satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment for eight years commencing 23 January 2009 and expiring on 22 January 2017 is appropriate for the first count, and that a sentence of imprisonment for five years commencing 23 January 2008 and expiring on 22 January 2013 is appropriate for the second count. 

100I am satisfied that a period of accumulation for one year remains appropriate as between the sentences for the first and second counts. 

101These sentences will produce an overall aggregate sentence of imprisonment for nine years commencing on 23 January 2008 and expiring on 22 January 2017. A single non-parole period ought be fixed for the purposes of s.19AB(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) . In my view, a non-parole period of five years commencing on 23 January 2008 and expiring on 22 January 2013 ought be fixed. In my view, a non-parole period of this length constitutes the minimum period for which the Applicant should remain in prison having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences, the Applicant's subjective circumstances and all the purposes of punishment, particularly general deterrence, which remains a significant factor on sentence. 

102Before concluding this judgment, I should emphasise that this is a particularly unusual case. Although the statements of principle contained in the judgment may have general application, the decision, on its facts, has no precedential value. The decision should not be taken to provide a benchmark for reduction of a sentence on the grounds of non-exculpatory duress. 

 
103I propose the following orders: 

(a) leave to appeal against sentence granted; 

(b) sentences imposed at the Sydney District Court on 6 November 2009 are quashed; 

(c) on the second count, the Applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for five years commencing on 23 January 2008 and expiring on 22 January 2013; 

(d) on the first count, the Applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for eight years commencing on 23 January 2009 and expiring on 22 January 2017; 

(e) pursuant to s.19AB Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) , a single non-parole period of five years is fixed, commencing on 23 January 2008 and expiring on 22 January 2013; 

(f) the Applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 23 January 2013. 

104HALL J : I agree with the reasons and orders as proposed by Johnson J.

2757924,R v AHMED [2011] NSWDC 210,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Maria Ahmed appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to offences involving substantial criminality as a drug supplier. She was an apparently enthusiastic and resourceful supplier of methylamphetamine. She now stands to be sentenced for three offences, one of ongoing supply of the drug methylamphetamine, one of supplying cannabis and a further charge of supplying methylamphetamine, not on an ongoing basis but relating to the interpretation by police of telephone calls that Ms Ahmed had with her customers. 

2Police obtained telephone intercept warrants. They were granted on 23 April 2010. That very day police recorded Ms Ahmed making arrangements concerning the supply of half a gram of methylamphetamine. Police continued to listen and watch over the next few weeks until Ms Ahmed was arrested. The first count, that of ongoing supply, relates to supplies on 8 May, 14 May and 17 May. On 8 May police overheard the offender agreeing to supply Jason Isling with methylamphetamine. Police watched as he went to Ms Ahmed's premises and arrested him as he drove away. He was found to be in possession of 0.09 grams of methylamphetamine. 

3On 14 May 2010, again police overheard arrangements made by the offender to supply a person, this time Brad Wilmot, with drugs. Police watched as the offender delivered those drugs to him and when they arrested him, he had a bag containing half a gram of methylamphetamine. The bag itself apparently was in the possession of another person but there is no doubt it was a product of the offender's supply. 

4On 17 May, once more police intercepted a telephone conversation between ""Andy"" and the offender and once more police watched as the offender supplied him with drugs. Upon his arrest he was found to be in possession of 0.2 of a gram of methylamphetamine. 

5The total amount of drugs covered by the s 25A offence is 0.79 grams over those three transactions I have described. Of course, this is a relatively low figure reflecting the nature of the offender's operation - street level supplies. 

6The second count relates to the supply of cannabis to a person named Sarah. Police overheard a conversation between Sarah and the offender relating to the purchase of drugs and, when they met, police watched the transaction and arrested Sarah soon afterwards. She was found to be in possession of 30.7 grams of cannabis leaf which had just been supplied to her by the offender. 

7The last count concerns a large number of transactions which police have been able to identify by listening to the intercepted telephone calls. Between 23 April 2010 and 12 June 2010, there were approximately forty-nine such transactions recorded involving a total of 21 grams of methylamphetamine. 

8The evidence put before me today concerning those transactions reveals the enthusiasm with which the offender went about supplying drugs. There were as I said, about forty-nine transactions and there were a large number of purchasers involved. Just by looking at exhibit 2, which is an extract of the telephone intercepts, it can be identified that the offender supplied to Bec, Gordon, AK, Amber, Rob, Brett, Jay, SF, Andy, Jules, Frecks, Kane, Jace, Tracey, Lisa, Brad, Aaron, Adam, Sarah, JA, Andrew, Tony, Sheree and others whose voices are not identified. There were SMS messages relating to the supply of drugs intercepted as well. It is apparent therefore that the offender was deeply involved in her drug supplying activities. 

9Police eventually wound up the operation by arresting the offender on 17 June. When they searched her premises they discovered other matters of importance, a glass ice pipe, some cannabis leaf, some crystal methylamphetamine and four cannabis seeds. The offender asks me to take into account possession of those items on a Form 1 when I sentence her for the ongoing supply matter. 

10It was also apparent that throughout this period that the offender's fifteen year old daughter lived with her at the home. Drug paraphernalia was located throughout the house and it was obvious I gather from the police facts that the offender was conducting her drug supply operations whilst her daughter was at home. That circumstance relates to an offence of conducting drug premises while exposing a child to prohibited drugs, another matter that the offender wishes me to take into account on the Form 1. 

11The offender is not a person who has been addicted to drugs for most of her life as are many people who come before the courts. Her drug addiction is of more recent times. She was brought up in Australia by her parents who separated when she was about nine due to domestic violence within the household. The offender's father returned to Greece, his country of origin, and she had no contact with him until she was about sixteen. She was married for some time and the daughter to whom I have earlier made reference was born as a result of that relationship. That relationship ended in divorce in 1999. The following year Ms Ahmed's ex-husband was murdered. His murder remains unsolved. 

12She has had other relationships since then, although that has been complicated by the relationship between her partners and her daughter. In particular she was in a de facto relationship with a man who was a drug user. Her use of drugs developed at that stage and increased after that relationship ended. Her former de facto acted violently and dangerously and at one stage she and he were shot at. It is probably understating matters to say that this caused a level of anxiety in the offender. Those matters were the genesis of these offences. 

13The offender said that she desired to have friends and one way that she could get friends is by supplying them with drugs. She said that it was a case of the friends pooling their money and the flavour of her evidence was that she was suggesting that it was almost an accident that it was she who was doing the supplying. 

14Unfortunately the telephone intercepts reveal a more traditional relationship between supplier and purchaser. It is apparent from those intercepts that the offender obtained drugs in bulk and then sold them to purchasers who would ring up, make arrangements to buy drugs from her and on many occasions the offender would then go and deliver them to the purchasers. This was clearly trafficking to a substantial degree. The number of individual transactions, particularly those the subject of the third count on the indictment, demonstrate that conclusion immediately. True it is that the quantities involved were relatively small but that is precisely the sort of thing that occurs with street level dealing. Street level dealing such as this is seriously criminal, even though the quantities involved are relatively small. There are no exceptional circumstances such as would justify a sentence other than a full time imprisonment. Certainly, and I will get to them, there are subjective matters in the offender's favour but they do not, in truth, amount to exceptional circumstances. Many of them are relatively commonplace. 

15Since her arrest it appears that the offender has achieved a significant measure of rehabilitation. There is no suggestion that she has used drugs. She has expressed her remorse both to others and in court today and I am indeed satisfied that she has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. She is employed as a spray tan operator and references from her employer, her doctor and her friends speak highly of her. It is something of a puzzle as to why someone in the offender's position would become involved in such serious criminality but that cannot be allowed to cause me to impose a sentence on the offender which fails to reflect the objective gravity of what she has done. 

16She has a criminal history but it can effectively be ignored. The matters on it are minor indeed and they pale into insignificance when compared to what the offender did in the middle of 2010. 

17The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage and so I will reduce the sentences I would otherwise impose by twenty-five per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea. 

18The offender will do her time in custody harder than would otherwise have been the case for two particular reasons. One is that she still bears the physical consequences of a motor vehicle collision where she was significantly injured and the second is that she will know that she has deprived her daughter of a mother's care and attention. It was not suggested to me that the offender's daughter would not be cared for and so there was no suggestion of exceptional hardship to third parties, but it will be harder for the offender knowing that she has left her daughter behind than would otherwise have been the case and so I will take that into account. 

19One important thing to consider when looking at the sentence to be imposed upon the offender is the ongoing nature of the offender's criminal acts. This was not a single offence immediately regretted. This was ongoing criminal behaviour which only came to an end when the offender was arrested. Had she not been arrested, there was no suggestion she would have not continued on precisely as she had been, supplying a large number of people with their drugs simply so that she could get drugs for nothing. 

20There is no suggestion that the offender was making a large amount of money out of this operation and indeed the evidence would suggest that she was spending money that her father was sending to her from Greece on drugs. The material reward she got from her activities was free drugs for herself. 

21Mr Barham who appeared for the offender today made a submission regarding the possibility of an Intensive Correction Order. I need say no more about that because the length of the sentences that I will shortly announce is such that no alternatives to full time imprisonment arise. I need not consider the matter further. 

22There are clearly special circumstances in this case. This will be the first time that the offender has gone to gaol. She did spend some time in custody after breaching bail which is perhaps the one qualification to suggestions that she has been fully rehabilitated but, given her explanation, I do not propose to find other than that she has good prospects of rehabilitation. She spent a number of days in custody and so it is appropriate therefore that I commence the sentences of imprisonment on 5 August this year. 

23For count 1 on the indictment, I take into account the matters on the form 1. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 5 August 2011 and the head sentence for that count is three years. 

24For count 2 on the indictment I set a fixed term of one year to date from 5 August 2011 and that is a fixed term because of the sentences I am imposing for the other matters. 

25For count 3 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one and one-half years to date from 5 August 2012. I set a head sentence for that matter of three years. The non-parole period on the third count will thus expire on 4 February 2014 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 

26The overall sentence I have just imposed consists of a non-parole period of two and one-half years and a head sentence of four years. 

27If the drugs have not yet been destroyed, I order that they are to be destroyed.

		31 January 2012",2011-09-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757940,Russell v Lozanes [2011] NSWDC 149,"Judgment 

Introduction 

1These proceedings have a long history. The motor accident in which the plaintiff was injured occurred on Sunday 8 July 2001 at about 1.30am. The plaintiff's Statement of Claim and Particulars were not filed until 16 February 2004. In unrelated events, the plaintiff was taken into custody on 18 March 2005 and, on 21 July 2006, convicted of manslaughter, for which she was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years concluding on 17 March 2008. 

2While the plaintiff was in prison, a MAS report was prepared on 20 May 2007, almost 6 years after the accident. Further medical reports and evidence prepared since that time are of little assistance, not least because the particulars filed on 16 February 2004 have never been amended. The case before me proceeded on the basis of those 2004 particulars. 

3The plaintiff's injuries meant that she has no recollection of the accident. Her companion on the night of the accident cannot now be located, according to the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff, and the principal witness to the accident, other than the defendant, suffers a serious illness which prevents him from being cross-examined. The evidentiary and other problems flowing from these difficulties and delays are set out in more detail below. 

The issues in these proceedings 

4This claim is governed by the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW). The issues for determination may broadly be stated as liability, contributory negligence and quantum. The negligence the plaintiff must prove is the pleaded negligence as particularised in her 2004 Statement of Claim, as well as any breach of duty resulting in the cause of the accident. 

The evidence of the plaintiff 

5The plaintiff, who is now 55 years old, has no recollection of the accident, but retains a general recollection of the events of the night in question. Her evidence was that she and Patricia Russell, her son Rodney's girlfriend or ex-girlfriend (it is unclear precisely what her status was) went to a hotel at about 6.00pm where they stayed ""for a while"". The plaintiff had loaned for car to her daughter Julie, who was supposed to pick the plaintiff up at 10.00pm. She said she and Patricia Russell had ""a couple of drinks"" and at 10.00pm telephoned Julie to be picked up. They were not able to get hold of her by telephone so the plaintiff rung a taxi on her mobile. She then said to Patricia Russell ""I am going home"" and the two of them left the hotel. The hotel was described as being ""a fair walk, a couple of hundred metres"" away. It was not close to the accident site. 

6After leaving the hotel, the plaintiff continued to try to ring both a taxi and her daughter Julie. Her next memory is that she saw lights. After that her next recollection was of waking up in the hospital. 

7In cross-examination, it was put to the plaintiff that she had had more than a couple of drinks and that she had in fact been drinking heavily, with no evidence of food having been consumed throughout since 6.00pm. Reports prepared by Professor Starmer (17 July 2005 and 13 October 2008 - Exhibit 1) put the plaintiff's blood alcohol concentration at the time of accident in the range of 0.188 to 0.229 (see paragraph 4 of the report of 13 October 2008). It was put to the plaintiff that she had been a regular drinker for many years and had drunk alcohol to the extent of becoming inebriated over a lengthy period of time including her 17 year relationship with her husband from the age of about 23 or 24. Although her history of drinking and domestic violence is extensively recorded in police and medical reports, the plaintiff said that there was ""not a real lot of violence during her relationship"" and that she had ""just arguments like other married couples"". Problems between the plaintiff and her husband requiring police intervention appear to have commenced in about December 1991 (Exhibit 2, document 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40; Exhibit C (document v)) and to continue throughout the 1990s. On 28 February 2000, police attended the plaintiff's home following an argument between herself and her ex husband, both of whom were note by police to be intoxicated, and the plaintiff later sought an AVO against her former husband (Exhibit 2, document 45). The medical evidence points to the plaintiff having increasing problems with alcohol over this period of time. 

8Then, in August 2000, the plaintiff suffered an injury to her back while working at Unistrut Pty Ltd. She suffered back pain and was either on light duties or not working at all up to the accident. The impact upon the plaintiff of loss of full time employment had more than financial consequences for her. Police were called to the plaintiff's house on several occasions in early 2001 where the plaintiff appeared to have been the victim in a series of family arguments, in one of which she was struck by her former husband so severely that her breast implant collapsed (Exhibit 2, document 6). 

9The evidence before me does not explain, other than in a very general way, what the plaintiff was doing after 10.00pm, when she commenced to contact her daughter to picked up from the hotel, and 1.30am, the time of the accident. I have been cautious not to draw any assumptions about this time, as it has not been addressed by counsel on either side. However, the uncontroverted evidence is that the plaintiff cannot have been drinking for the period of time that it took her and her companion to travel the distance between the hotel and the site of the accident, during which time she was continuing to try to ring her daughter and a taxi. 

10Although the plaintiff is unable to describe her injuries, there is some contemporaneous documentation in the form of information provided by the defendant in a short record of interview and by Mr Lamplough, the driver of another motor vehicle who saw the accident, as well as notes in the COPS report of some comments by the plaintiff's companion to the police. 

11I shall deal with each of these in turn. 

The COPS report 

12The COPS report described the crash as follows: 

""About 1.30am on Sunday the 8 th July 2001, vehicle 2 (the defendant) was travelling in lane 3 of 3 west bound lanes upon Richmond Road, Blacktown. Vehicle 2 has come to the intersection of Richmond Road and Lyton Street, where the driver has seen pedestrian 1 (the plaintiff) run across the road from the south bound kerb of Richmond Road to the north bound kerb. As a result, the driver of vehicle 2 has swerved to the right in an effort to avoid colliding with pedestrian 1, however has been unsuccessful, and has collided into pedestrian 1."" 

13The police officer compiling the COPS report notes that police spoke to both the defendant and the other motorist at the scene, Mr Lamplough. The COPS entry then records: 

""Police then obtained a signed statement from driver 2 where she stated that the pedestrian has ran [sic] across the road, and she didn't see her until she was 2 to 3 metres away from her. Driver 2 further states that she was only going 45-50km/h. Witness 2, who was travelling behind driver 2, confirmed this version of events."" 

14The police officer also noted a conversation which ""witness 1"" later identified as Patricia Russell, who was with the plaintiff at the time of the collision, although on the opposite side of the road at the time. 

15The police who attended the accident consulted with Duty Officer Doherty at Blacktown Police Station, and the Duty Operation Inspector, Leanne Douglass. The Duty Operation Inspector subsequently contacted the referral officer at the crash investigation unit, but the crash investigation unit declined to attend or investigate the incident. Police did so because of their conclusion concerning the facts as identified by them. They were, however, investigating potential criminal proceedings, not an issue of civil liability, and police findings in this regard must be treated with caution. 

16The final entry is a note that the plaintiff's blood alcohol level was 0.16 at the time of the accident. 

The evidence of Mr Lamplough 

17Mr Ronald Lamplough, a man of 43 years who has been driving since 17, and is an experience and careful driver, was driving his Toyota Corolla sedan, registered number TNG-320 along Richmond Road. On the night of the accident, he is described in the COPS report as having ""confirmed"" the defendant's version of events, which was that the pedestrian had run across the road and the defendant did not see her until she was 2-3 metres away from her, in circumstances where the defendant was going 45-50 km/h at the time. 

18Mr Lamplough's statement about the events of the accident was taken on 4 December 2001, by an investigator. He said as follows: 

""6. On Sunday the 8 July, 2001 around 1.30am I was driving my Toyota Corolla sedan, registered number TNG-320 in a general westerly direction along Richmond Road. I had my headlights on low beam and had a good view of the road ahead. The weather was fine and the roadway was dry. I recall the traffic was quite light. However, I do recall I was following a Jeep. That vehicle was within the lane closest to the centre of the road. I was in the middle of the three lanes. I was driving about 60 kilometres per hour. The Jeep was about 50 metres ahead of me. I was not gaining or losing distance with that vehicle and formed the view the Jeep was also doing 60 kilometres per hour. 7. I saw the Jeep had its tail lights on. The Jeep was being driven normally. I recall the Jeep was approaching the intersection of Lyton Street. That intersection is controlled by traffic control lights. The traffic lights remained green in our favour the entire time I had the intersection under my observation. 

8. As the Jeep approached the intersection I noticed a person running from the left-hand side of Richmond Road. I immediately formed the view that this person was running directly into the path of the Jeep. I would describe the running action of this person as quite quickly. The person was looking directly ahead and I did not see that person look to the right at any time prior to the accident. 

9. I realised that the person was going to run directly into the path of the oncoming Jeep. I knew it was about to happen, so I looked away. I heard a thud and looked ahead. I saw the Jeep at a 30-degree angle to the right. The Jeep was stationary with the west bound lane. I was about 30 metres from the pedestrian when I saw that person commence to run from the southern kerb. I believe the person was very close to the intersection of Lyton Street at that time. 

10. Because I had looked away from the impending accident I did not see the Jeep take any evasive action prior to the impact. However, as the Jeep had come to a stop at that angle, I believe the driver must have veered to the right. 

11. I stopped my car in the middle lane about 5 metres from the person that had been hit. That person was laying between the number two and three west bound lanes. I stopped my car in the middle of the road to protect the pedestrian from any oncoming vehicles. I turned my hazard lights on and got out of the vehicle. I walked over to the pedestrian and saw that person was a female. I believe that person was wearing dark clothing. I cannot recall the type of clothing she was wearing apart from dark blue jeans. 

12. I saw the female appeared to be unconscious. I could not see any blood on her or sign of obvious injury. I returned to my car and got a jumper which I placed over the pedestrian. When I was placing the jumper over her, I could smell what appeared to be alcohol coming from her. I am not a drinker. However, I have visited licenced premises and seen people affected by alcohol. 

13. I also saw another female standing on the left-hand side of the road. They seemed to be near the point the pedestrian had crossed the road from. Those people were a male and a female. They both seemed distressed. I heard those people say, 'She's been drinking. She doesn't know what she was doing'. I did not have any further conversation with them. 

14. I also went over to the Jeep to check on the occupants. I could see the driver was a young Asian girl. She appeared extremely upset. I did not have any conversation with her. I saw another young man, I believe was her brother, comforting her. 

15. I did not notice any damage to the Jeep. I waited at the accident until police and ambulance arrived. The ambulance treated the pedestrian and took her away. I spoke with the police and gave the officer my details. I have not heard from the police since. 

16. I had a clear view of the roadway ahead prior to this accident. The driver of the Jeep and I were driving at 60 kilometres per hour. The street lighting was on and the road appeared well lit. The pedestrian just ran from the left-hand kerb across the road. 

17. At no time did I see that pedestrian check for oncoming west bound traffic prior to the impact."" (Exhibit A, tab 2) 

19In the course of the hearing, the plaintiff sought leave to rely upon what is asserted to be an unsigned statement by Mr Lamplough of more recent origin. The tender of this statement was opposed. An affidavit was prepared by the solicitor who had a telephone conversation with Mr Lamplough, for the purpose of attaching his diary note of this conversation. I was shown a copy of this unsigned statement, which contained a significantly different account of the accident, such as a claim that the defendant's car and Mr Lamplough's car were much closer together in term of distance. These were matters that have not been put to the defendant or to the defendant's expert witness. A further report prepared by the plaintiff's expert witness had considered this material, but that report, although marked for identification, had not been tendered. Nor was it the subject of submissions by either party. I accordingly have not taken this into account when considering the factual background relating to the plaintiff's accident. 

The evidence of the defendant 

20In a signed record of interview taken at the scene of the accident, the defendant told police: 

""I was approaching the intersection of Richmond Road and Lyton Street, in lane 2 of 2 [sic] westbound lanes, when I noticed a woman run across the road from Lyton Street across to the northern kerb of Richmond Road. I swerved to the right in an effort to miss colliding with this woman but was unsuccessful and the woman hit the front left hand side of the car."" 

21The speed at which the defendant said she was travelling is hard for me to read in the police notebook. I note, however, in the typed version in the COPS report this is stated to be 45-50km/h. The defendant also said that the lights at the intersection were green and that she was about 2-3 metres away when she first noticed the woman. 

22In the course of submissions, Mr Barry QC submitted that this statement was not taken at the scene of the accident but at a later stage when the defendant came to the police station, by which time she had had an opportunity to reconstruct the facts. 

23This must be incorrect, as the time at which the police officer has described taking this statement is 1.30am when he came to the scene of the accident. The reference to 5.02am in the COPS entry is the time that these matters where all entered onto the computer for the purpose of recording what occurred after police had made the further enquiries referred to in the COPS entries, which included attending Westmead Hospital to speak to the treating doctor. The defendant was not cross-examined about attending the police station and all the evidence point to the contrary. The defendant's evidence was that she drove home after the incident. 

24As well as signing the record of interview on the night of the accident in question within an hour of the accident, the defendant was called and gave evidence. 

25The defendant gave clear and concise evidence of the events, of which she still had a good recollection, although she agreed in cross-examination that her recollection of events would have been stronger in 2001, when she made statements to the police. 

26The defendant was born on 30 May 1983 which means she was only 18 years old at the time of the accident. Although this is a very young age for a driver, her evidence was that she obtained her licence as soon as she was old enough to do so, and from that time commenced driving the vehicle which she was driving at the time of the accident. This was the vehicle that she drove to school and to work, and learned to drive on (additional lessons being given by her brother, as well as lessons from a driving school) and use. She said it had an automatic transmission. 

27In addition to being familiar with the motor vehicle she was driving, the defendant said she was familiar with the area. It was the area she had lived all her life. She had driven along this road many times. She knew of the Adam's Tavern, which she said was some distance back on Richmond Road. She was not able to say how far this tavern was from the intersection, but the unchallenged evidence is that it was a couple of hundred metres. It is not submitted that the tavern was sufficiently close to the scene of the accident for drivers to be alert to the possibility of drunken patrons exiting the hotel late at night. 

28On the night in question, the defendant was the designated driver and was driving home her brother and two neighbours who were friends, all of whom were asleep in the car, it being 1.30 a.m. It had been her brother's birthday the day before, and they had spent the afternoon go-karting, following which they had dinner. The defendant did not drink any alcohol (although the others with her had), as she was the designated driver. 

29The defendant said that despite the late hour, she was alert and awake and was watching the road. She had the radio on because it was ""nice to have background music when you are driving"". 

30In both examination in chief and cross-examination, the defendant said that the first time she saw the plaintiff, she was already on the road, and running. She said she must have ""slammed on the brakes"", that she pulled over to the right and that the vehicle came to a stop across the intersection facing oncoming traffic. The median strip had prevented her from going over further, as the defendant's vehicle was in the furthest lane of traffic, than the line of traffic closest to the median strip, which was a raised concrete barrier. The impact occurred on the front left hand side of the vehicle rather than being a frontal collision. 

31The defendant's evidence was that she was travelling between 50-60 km/h when she saw the plaintiff. She stated frankly, in relation to speed estimates, that she was unable to remember, as it was so long ago, but agreed that any estimate she had given at the time would have been more accurate than her recollection today. 

32In cross-examination, the defendant denied that she was tired even though it was 1.30am. She said she had been driving for an hour from the city, since approximately 12.30am. 

33The defendant agreed that the area was very well lit. 

34The question of how far away the plaintiff was at the time she was first seen by the defendant was a significant issue in relation to questions of liability. The plaintiff told police that when she first saw the defendant she was two to three metres away which would mean, if taken literally, that she did not see the plaintiff until the plaintiff was struck by the car and was therefore not paying attention to what was on the roadway. This evidence is examined in more detail in the analysis of the evidence of the experts. 

Patricia Anne Russell 

35The other person present at the scene of the accident was Patricia Anne Russell, who was the plaintiff's son's girlfriend or ex-girlfriend. She is recorded in the police investigation as a witness. According to the material in the COPS report, the information she provided to the police was as follows: 

""Police then spoke with witness 1, who was with pedestrian 1 at the time of the collision. Witness 1 stated that she had been drinking with pedestrian 1, for some time at ""Adam's Tavern"", which is also located on Richmond Road. Witness 1 states that pedestrian 1 had consumed a large amount of scotch in the evening which may have been a contributing factor to the collision. In witness 1's view, pedestrian 1 was extremely intoxicated. 

Witness 1 further states that her and pedestrian 1 had been standing on Richmond Road, for some time in an effort to flag down a taxi, however had been unsuccessful. Witness 1 states that she was standing on the northern curb, and pedestrian 1, was running across the road to meet her."" (Exhibit A, tab 1) 

36Ms Russell also appears to be the person referred to by Mr Lamplough in his statement as set out above. 

37The plaintiff relies upon an affidavit of Judith Gabbay sworn 23 August 2011 to prove attempts to locate that witness who would otherwise had been called in the plaintiff's case. 

38That affidavit sets out an attempt made on 5 November 2009. What attempts were made prior to that date or subsequent to that date, if any, are not the subject of any evidence before me. 

39The inquiries set out by Ms Gabbay are limited. For example, no attempt was made to retain a private investigator, or to make other enquiries of, for example, former solicitors or family members. Nor have any attempts been made, it would appear, since that time. 

40In the submissions, Mr Barry QC states there is no evidence that Patricia Russell actually saw the accident. I do not agree. She describes the plaintiff as running across the road to meet her, according to the information she provided to the police. On the balance of evidence, the likelihood that she was not looking in the general direction of the plaintiff when this occurred is implausible. 

41Accordingly, I draw a Jones v Dunkel inference ( Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298) against the plaintiff namely that this eyewitness, if called, would not have assisted the plaintiff's case. 

42By reason of the long period of time since the accident, the limited evidence from Mr Lamplough, and the lack of contemporaneous records concerning the circumstances of the accident (for example, notes of the accident scene such as the presence or absence of skid marks) there are gaps in the evidence in the facts of these proceedings. 

Evidentiary problems 

43The plaintiff's Statement of Claim and Particulars were filed on 16 February 2004. The Particulars were never amended during the intervening seven years, which means that the medical evidence (tendered on the understanding that it should not exceed the claim as particularized) needs to be read with caution. 

44The plaintiff, because of her injuries, has no recollection of the circumstances of the accident. This makes it all the more unfortunate that a lengthy period has elapsed between the date of the accident and the date of the hearing. 

45The proceedings were listed for hearing three times (on 5 April 2005, 22 October 2009 and 6 July 2010), but vacated on each occasion shortly before the hearing date. Mr Barry QC has asked me to defer dealing with the lengthy procedural history of this action until costs are determined. However, in any hearing which takes place more than ten years after the events in question, reconstruction of what occurred is likely to be difficult. 

46The defendant was interviewed by police at the scene of the accident and there is a short record of interview; the COPS report also notes information from two persons at the scene of the accident. It is not in dispute that the three occupants of the defendant's car, who were asleep, saw anything of how the accident occurred. Mr Lamplough did, but he was too ill to be cross-examined and his 2001 statement was tendered. 

47I note that the police officer at the scene, the ambulance officer and an unidentified male referred to in Mr Lamplough's statement were not called, although whether their evidence would have been of assistance is unlikely, particularly given the long passage of time since these events. 

The onus of proof and the drawing of inferences where the weight of factual evidence is an issue 

48The main factual evidence in this case consists of the defendant's evidence at the time of the accident and in these proceedings, the police notebook and COPS entry and the statement of Mr Lamplough to the NRMA. 

Inferences to draw from absence of witnesses and documents 

49The plaintiff submits that I should draw an inference, from the defendant's failure to produce a signed statements made by the defendant to an investigator ""as a time much closer to the circumstances of the accident"" that there was nothing in the defendant's version at the time which would have assisted the defendant's case. It is further submitted that the failure to show her the statement, or to adduce it in evidence, ""also leads to the probable inference that the defendant's evidence in which she claims to have seen the plaintiff at a time before she was two to three metres away is a reconstruction"" (Plaintiff's submissions, paragraph 5). 

50The defendant had a good recollection of events of the accident and gave her answers clearly and concisely. She told the court, as she had told the police officer on the night of the accident, that her first sight of the plaintiff was when she was running across the road. 

51Although witness statements are common in other civil proceedings, they are not used in personal injury litigation. While the need to give full disclosure in personal injury litigation may cause courts to order pre-trial production of surveillance video (see the cases discussed at Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure NSW , Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), Pt 31 r 31.10) , the drawing of an inference from failure to provide a document which would otherwise be the subject of a claim for privilege is not a step that should be taken other than in exceptional circumstances. In the present case, none of the significant delay since the plaintiff's accident has arisen by reason of delay by the defendant or her legal representatives. 

52I do not propose to draw any inference from the failure of the defendant to produce and tender any statement prepared by her or her legal representatives. 

Inferences to draw concerning skid marks 

53The accident scene was not investigated, for the reasons set out in the COPS report. The police officer at the scene made no observations or notes as to how the accident happened beyond the very crude diagram in the notebook which, as Mr Barry QC points out, omits the third traffic lane for turning vehicles. While this document contains an inaccuracy, it is so crudely drawn as to be of little assistance even if it were accurate. 

54Mr Barry QC submits that the case would have been ""entirely different"" if there had been evidence of braking or skid marks on the roadway, and submits that as there is no evidence in the police records of any braking or skid marks, this is consistent with the plaintiff failing to keep a proper lookout. 

55The evidence is silent as to whether or not there were skid marks. The defendant's evidence that she braked is the subject of expert evidence. I do not propose to assume that, in the absence of evidence that there were skid marks, there were no skid marks. 

Failure to cross-examine concerning obligations to sound the horn or swerve to the left 

56Although not the subject of any expert evidence, Mr Barry QC submitted that the defendant could have averted the accident entirely by sounding the horn, or swerving right instead of left. This was not the subject of cross-examination, nor was it dealt with by the expert evidence and I propose to disregard it. 

57If I have erred in this finding, I note that steps of this kind would not necessarily have avoided the accident, or made any difference, given the proximity of the plaintiff to the defendant's vehicle. The plaintiff's evidence was that she suffered severe deafness and her response to the horn being sounded, if it had been put to her in evidence in chief, is unknown. 

58Further, in Dennis v Keep [2002] NSWCA 227 at [20], Foster AJA rejected a similar submission as that the driver could have avoided the accident by taking some additional steps such as sounding his horn or flashing his headlights. His Honour added: 

"" As a matter of causation I would not be satisfied that had those precautions been taken, they would reasonably have had any effect, having regard to the condition in which the claimant was. However I do not consider, having regard to the reasonable ambit of the duty of care in this situation, that those precautions were called for."" 

The submissions of the parties concerning the facts 

59Mr Barry QC submitted that the extremely drunken state of the plaintiff, and the impact of her injuries, mean that she would have moved very slowly across the road, and that there was plenty of time for the defendant both to observe the plaintiff and to slow down in order to avoid her. It is submitted that the plaintiff was going much faster than the speed she told police at the time (45 km/h) and that she was in fact travelling 60 km/h, as was Mr Lamplough, but that the good lighting and clear view of the plaintiff meant that the defendant would have seen her the moment she stepped off the road (as Mr Lamplough did), and that the failure of the defendant to do so meant that she was failing to keep a proper lookout to observe the plaintiff proceeding across the roadway. 

60Mr Ronzani put two alternatives before me. First, he submitted that the plaintiff, well accustomed to alcohol by long usage, and not enfeebled by her back injury, was determined to get across the road quickly by running across the road, which she did so quickly that the defendant's vehicle, a considerable distance in front of Mr Lamplough's vehicle, had insufficient time to avoid hitting her even though the defendant was keeping a lookout and saw the defendant as soon as she left the kerb. Alternatively, if the defendant did breach her duty of care by not observing the plaintiff until she was some short distance across the roadway, the result was an inevitable accident through no fault of the defendant since the plaintiff would have been struck in any event. By reason of the many gaps of knowledge concerning the events of the night in question there is no basis for preferring one scenario over another and accordingly, on the evidence (see Luxton v Vines (1952) 85 CLR 352 at 358 - 360), the party seeking to establish negligence has failed to discharge the onus of proof of negligence. 

61The defendant further relies upon Mr Schnerring's table (Report of 18 June 2010, p. 12) to demonstrate that if the defendant was travelling at between 50 - 60 km/h, and the plaintiff was running at 2.0 metres a second (a speed conceded to be ""possible"" by Mr Schnerring), an accident was unavoidable, given the need to factor in reaction time of up to two seconds. 

62This brings me to the evidence of the expert witnesses. Before considering their report in some detail, I should note that, as both experts agreed, there are many facts in this case which are not known, and this creates a problem in relation to the finding of factual issues. In particular, the point of impact, the place the plaintiff came to rest after impact and whether she ran across the road in a straight line are not known. 

The expert evidence 

63Both parties submitted that this was a case where by reason of the uncertainty of many of the facts surrounding the accident, the Court should be more than usually careful in placing weight upon the reports of traffic engineering investigation experts. 

64At my request, the parties agreed that the experts should have a conclave prior to giving evidence but Mr Barry QC requested that each of them be cross-examined separately in the ""traditional way"". It is therefore necessary for me to analysis their reports separately. 

Report of Mr Fred Schnerring 

65Mr Schnerring inspected the road site on 14 June 2010, nine years after the accident. While the topography remains similar, this is not a report which has been prepared by someone with the advantage of attending the scene shortly after the accident, as some times occurs with these reports. 

66Mr Schnerring notes that the lane width was 2.9 metres, which would leave 0.6 metres between the lane edge and the left side of the vehicle. He concluded that this would suggest that Ms Russell, if she crossed from the kerb to the point of impact, would have travelled a total of 6.6 metres. 

67Mr Schnerring calculated the speed of the plaintiff as between 1.8 to 2.4m/s for the reasons set out by him at paragraph 9.2 of his report, based on his involvement in ""little athletics"" for the past eight years. He took into account that the plaintiff had a previous back injury for which she was receiving physiotherapy and also that she was not dressed for the occasion in which she was not wearing a jogging suit, something he considered was a significant factor having regard to a study by Eubanks on jogging speed. As it would appear the plaintiff was attempting to get across the road to see her friend on the other side and could have been in a hurry, he considered the speed would therefore be between ""hurried walking"" at 1.8m/s and a 15 th percentile jogging pace of 2.4m/s. He considers the fact that she was not wearing jogging gear would cancel the ""30% increase in speed"" factored in by Mr Stuart-Smith. 

68A considerable amount of cross-examination of Mr Schnerring related to the assumptions from ""little athletics"" and that she was walking at a pace between hurried walking and jogging. 

69While the plaintiff suffered a back injury of some significance, none of the medical evidence point to the plaintiff as limping while she walks or otherwise having difficulties in walking. The evidence of Mr Lamplough and the defendant was that the plaintiff ran quickly and suddenly across the road. Assumptions that she was walking at a pace between hurried walking and jogging had been made without any regard to this evidence. 

70The report of Mr Stuart-Smith estimated a speed of 50-60 km/h but Mr Schnerring considered that there was evidence indicating the speed could have been as low as 40 km/h. While the defendant was of the view that she was travelling at 45 km/h, the likelihood was that, on a large roadway with little traffic where the speed limit was 70 km/h, she was more likely than not to have been travelling at the speed of 60 km/h or slightly below, taking into account that she was approaching an intersection. Both Mr Stuart-Smith and Mr Schnerring considered the likelihood of her speed at impact to be around 45 km/h. This is however a difficult issue for determination given the lack of other information. 

71Both Mr Schnerring and Mr Stuart-Smith agreed on a perception and reaction time of 2 seconds (Jamieson Foley report at page 18). 

72Mr Schnerring's conclusions, and my findings in relation to them, are as follows: 

The speed of the Jeep could not be determined from the available physical evidence. The Police material indicated the speed of the Jeep to be between about 40km/h and 50km/h. 

Comment : I note that Mr Lamplough's evidence puts her speed at 60 km/h. The estimate of 45 km/h at the time of collision was the defendant's. 

The pedestrian probably was on the roadway for between about 3.0 and 3.8 seconds based on the distance from the side of the road to the point of impact and her likely speed. 

Comment : I have rejected this contention, as the plaintiff was described as running, not walking fast or jogging, by both Mr Lamplough and the defendant. She was wearing running shoes and comfortable clothing and I do not accept that her clothing had any impact on her speed. 

At a speed of between 40km/hy and 50km/h, the Jeep probably was between about 33 metres and 53 metres from the pedestrian when the pedestrian started to cross the roadway. 

Comment : The likely speed of this vehicle, in a 70 km/h zone, was the speed estimated by Mr Lamplough, namely 60 km/h, and I consider the vehicle was likely to be closer to 33 than 53 metres away from the plaintiff, given Mr Lamplough's evidence. 

The pedestrian was reportedly wearing a white jumper and commenced her crossing close to a street light. The road was well lit. My inspection of the site showed that the pedestrian would be visible to the driver at the above distances. 

Comment : It is not in dispute that the road was well lit. As to whether the plaintiff was wearing a white jumper, the best evidence is that of Mr Lamplough, who describes the plaintiff as wearing dark clothing, and dark blue jeans. 

The driver stated that she did not see the pedestrian until the pedestrian was 2 to 3 metres away, suggesting some form of distraction or inattention. 

Comment : Both experts agree that although the defendant gave this estimate, it must be incorrect. The most likely explanation for this measurement is that the plaintiff was only seen by the defendant when she was running across the road, in the same way that Mr Lamplough first saw her doing this, and that she saw her just before the collision. It is a measurement which should not be taken too literally. 

At an approach speed of 40km/h to 50km/h, the driver probably was in a position to stop, or to slow to a speed of about 22km/h at impact. 

Comment : If the defendant was not able to stop, then the accident was inevitable. However, if the defendant was travelling at 60 km/h prior to seeing the plaintiff, as is Mr Lamplough's estimate, then any assumption that the defendant could stop must be incorrect. In addition, if I accept Mr Stuart-Smith's faster estimate for the plaintiff's running speed, that would make the accident unavoidable at any speed over 45 km/h, the speed given by the defendant at the time of the accident. 

Impact speeds of 20km/h to 25km/h are broadly considered to result in minor injuries, a lower injury outcome than that evidently sustained by Ms Russell. 

Comment : This is not the subject of any medical evidence, but I am prepared to accept this contention. 

73Mr Stuart-Smith's report challenged the findings of Mr Schnerring concerning the speed at which the plaintiff was crossing the road. As all the evidence pointed to the plaintiff running and not jogging, he considered that the jogging speed set out in Eubanks (J. Eubanks, Pedestrian Accident Reconstruction , Lawyers & Judges Publishing Co., 1994) to be irrelevant, noting that Vaughan & Bain (R. Vaughan & J. Bain, Acceleration and Speeds of Young Pedestrians : Phase II, SAE 2000-01-0845) explained that running speeds for young women were generally around 35% faster than their jogging speeds and that this percentage increase did not appear to be related to age. 

74If the plaintiff was indeed running, as described by the defendant and Mr Lamplough, Mr Stuart-Smith considered that a range of 3 to 4m/s, with a likely running speed of 3.5m/s is the most likely running speed of the plaintiff. This would mean that she had reached the approximate point of impact, 6.6 metres into the roadway, in the 2 second interval for response time agreed to by both experts, which would make the accident inevitable. It would mean that the time at which the plaintiff left the kerb was actually within this 2 second period, or so close to the edge of it as to make collision inevitable. 

75In oral evidence, Mr Stuart-Smith explained that what prevented the defendant from driving further to the right was the median strip, a raised concrete construction which continued up to the intersection. She was not able to drive to the wrong side of the road until reaching the intersection, which the car came to rest facing the oncoming traffic. 

76It is not without significance that Mr Lamplough, from his position considerably further back when he first saw the plaintiff run across the road, was still only able to bring his car to a halt 5 metres from where the plaintiff laid on the roadway. His impression that an accident was inevitable is also not without significance. 

77Mr Stuart-Smith says as much at paragraph 7.2 of his report where he states: 

""Since the defendant reacted within a typical perception response time, a collision was unavoidable. 

In order for the defendant to have been able to avoid a collision, her perception response time would need to have been faster than was the case. The difference in time would need to have been sufficient for the defendant to have commenced braking at an earlier point equivalent to the distance between the front of the vehicle at rest and the POI. 

Since the vehicle's precise rest position was not measured, the precise required decrease in the defendant's perception response time cannot be determined. Nonetheless, based on estimates from the Police sketch, the defendant would have been required to have reacted approximately one second faster to have stopped before reaching the POI. 

Even if the defendant had reacted 0.4 seconds earlier (the difference in time between the upper end of her possible perception response time of 1.6 to 2.4 seconds and a typical time of 2.0 seconds), the plaintiff would still have collided with the side of the car (although at a point slightly closer to its front)."" 

78Mr Stuart-Smith's conclusions were as follows: 

1. Based on conservative assumptions in relation to pedestrian running speeds, a typical driver with a typical night time perception response time would not have had sufficient time to be able to avoid a collision from any reasonable speed. 

Comment : As 2 seconds is an agreed figure by both experts, this is an opinion I accept. 

2. The defendant's reaction in braking and attempting to swerve was a reasonable response from a road safety perspective. 

Comment : Mr Barry QC submitted that the absence of evidence about skid marks is evidence that the defendant did not brake. I have indicated elsewhere that I reject his submission concerning whether or not there were skid marks. The defendant's evidence was that she braked and attempted to swerve. Both experts agreed that this was an appropriate course of conduct. Submissions by Mr Barry QC that she should have swerved to the left, or sounded the horn, are not matters about which I have received any expert evidence and I have rejected these submissions in any event. 

3. The plaintiff attempted to cross the road on the opposite side of the intersection from a pedestrian crossing and with her destination blocked by a barrier, which would normally prevent crossing at the location she chose. 

Comment : These facts do not appear to be in dispute. 

4. Base on the information available, the defendant would not have had sufficient time to have avoided a collision. 

Conclusions concerning expert reports 

79While I propose to treat the expert reports with caution, given the uncertainty about where the plaintiff was struck and fell, the lack of information about skidmarks and the other uncertainties concerning the evidence, the experts ultimately agreed that with a reaction time of 2 seconds, some form of accident was inevitable. Even if the defendant had seen the plaintiff standing on the street and divined that it was possible the plaintiff was likely to want to cross the road, despite the barrier on the opposite side (and there is no evidence she was standing on the road, or otherwise making clear any intention to cross the road), it would not have been possible to avoid striking the plaintiff when she suddenly and without warning ran in front of the defendant's vehicle. 

80Having made these findings of fact I now turn to a consideration of the legal issues for determination. 

The relevant standard of care 

81The duty of care owed by motorists to pedestrians is a very high one: Daly v Liverpool Corp [1939] 2 All E R 142 at 144 per Stable J. The relevant standard of care is that which a reasonable person would observe in driving a motor vehicle, which is an operation with the capacity, if carelessly executed, to cause great harm to others. The standard is an objective one and the personal characteristics of the driver are irrelevant. 

Issues relevant to breach of the driver's duty of care 

82The requirement for establishing a breach of the driver's duty of care requires consideration of what a reasonable driver would have done in all the circumstances of the case, and whether that person would have foreseen the risk of injury. If the reasonable driver would have foreseen the risk of injury, the question is what a reasonable driver would have done by way of prevention or response to the risk: Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47 - 48 per Mason J. This calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk, the degree of probability of its occurrence and any other responsibilities which the driver may have. 

83It is not sufficient for a driver to be driving in accordance with the road traffic regulations or with the conditions at the time of the collision, because a reasonable driver is expected to take into account the possibility of inadvertence or negligence by other road users, and particularly pedestrians. Drivers must maintain a proper lookout at all times, not only to see immediate danger, but potential danger, so as to avoid a collision with the physically vulnerable plaintiff who comes into the vehicle's path. 

84The question of what constitutes a proper lookout where the pedestrian is intoxicated, and/or runs across the road suddenly, has been the subject of analysis in a series of decisions in the High Court and in the NSW Court of Appeal. 

85The High Court in Derrick v Cheung (2001) 181 ALR 301 held that the driver of a car had kept a proper lookout despite her focus of looking straight ahead, which affected her ability to see the pedestrian emerging through the row of parked cars adjoining her driving lane. 

86The principles discussed in Derrick v Cheung were referred to in the NSW Court of Appeal in Dennis v Keep , a pedestrian with a high blood alcohol reading suddenly ran across the road in front of the defendant's vehicle. The defendant had seen the pedestrian beforehand, but had been unable to stop. Foster AJA observed at [18]: 

""Indeed in the recent decision of the High Court in Derrick v Cheung (2001), High Court Appeal 48, it is indicated, in my view, that, in cases of this kind, a common sense overall appraisal of the situation confronting a motorist, travelling within the appropriate speed limits, when a pedestrian enters his or her line of travel, is required, rather than an over-meticulous evaluation of what might have occurred if he or she had been driving at a lesser speed."" 

87The principles discussed in Derrick v Cheung were also applied in Knight v MacLean [2002] NSWCA 314, where an inebriated pedestrian stepped in front of the defendant's car without prior warning. Heydon JA, with whom Meagher JA and Young CJ in Eq agreed, said at [68] - [69]: 

""[68] It is not the law that a driver complying with the minimum requirements of the law of negligence must drive in such a way as to anticipate everything that a pedestrian might do at all stages of every journey, or to be in a position to reduce speed to levels which will avoid any risk of a collision at all stages of any journey. Yet in the circumstances of the present case the trial judge's test would entail that duty. 

[69] The plaintiff bore the burden of proving negligence on the part of the defendant. This meant that in substance the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that the defendant failed to keep a proper lookout and of proving that if he had kept a proper lookout, he would have seen the plaintiff in sufficient time to avoid the collision. These burdens could not be discharged by the mere fact of the collision. To the extent that the nature of the locality at the time of the accident called on the defendant for an explanation as a practical matter, an acceptable explanation consistent with keeping a proper lookout, for the defendant seeing the plaintiff only at the last moment may be inferred from the circumstances."" 

88Mr Barry QC referred to Manley v Alexander [2005] HCA 79 and to Vale v Eggins (2006) 46 MVR 514; (2006) Aust Torts Reports 81-869; [2006] NSWCA 348. In both these cases, the pedestrian was seen on the road some distance away, behaving erratically. Where a pedestrian is noticeable to oncoming traffic by stumbling or behaving erratically on the road, the foreseeability of injury is both very different and very much higher. Courts have tended to find a breach of duty where the conduct of the pedestrian alerts the driver to the possibility that the pedestrian may behave erratically, especially where, if properly attentive to the presence of this pedestrian, the motorist could have avoided the collision by taking appropriate precautions; see also Griffin v Lee-Brown [2000] QSC 299 (pedestrian crouched on the road). 

89The plaintiff's submissions assert (paragraph 25) that there was ""no evidence that the defendant had braked"" and that ""the only evasive action that she did take and could have taken in the circumstances was to swerve to the right"". I do not accept this submission. The defendant said that she braked, and the manner in which she was able to bring her vehicle to a stop is indicative that she did in fact brake and swerved to the right in an attempt to avoid the plaintiff. As is already indicated, I decline to draw any inference that the defendant did not brake because there was no evidence of skid marks on the roadway. The police records consisted of a crudely and inaccurately drawn diagram. The fact that there is no notation of any braking does not mean that no braking took place. I do not accept that the defendant could have stopped in time to avoid a collision. Mr Lamplough was able to do so, but he was at a considerably longer distance back. In any event, he was only able to stop 5 metres away from where the plaintiff lay. 

90Senior counsel for the plaintiff places great weight on the fact that Mr Lamplough saw the plaintiff a great deal further away from where the defendant saw her. However, both Mr Lamplough and the defendant saw the plaintiff at the same time. Mr Lamplough had the advantage of seeing the plaintiff from a further distance, which meant he was able to stop in time. The defendant was unable to do so. 

Conclusions concerning liability 

91Accordingly, I do not accept that the defendant's awareness of the plaintiff was late, or in breach of her obligation to keep a proper lookout. The speed at which the plaintiff chose to cross the road, in the path of oncoming traffic, would have taken any motorist by surprise. If I have erred in this regard, then the inevitability of this accident, and the issue of causation, would mean that if by reason of the failure to keep a proper lookout the defendant failed to see the plaintiff either standing on the footpath or about to commence or commencing a run across the road, an accident was inevitable. 

92I note that the inevitability of this accident is the primary submission of the defendant. I am satisfied, however, that the defendant, who was approaching an intersection with which she was familiar, where there was a barrier on one side of the road which would prevent pedestrian crossing, was watching the road ahead of her, and that this constituted in the circumstances keeping a proper lookout. 

93In the event that these findings concerning liability are in error, I set out my findings concerning contributory negligence. 

Contributory negligence 

94It is not in dispute that the principles explained in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALR 529; (1985) 59 ALJR 492; (1985) Aust Torts Reports 80-321; [1985] HCA 34 would, if applied to the facts of this case, result in a significant reduction of damages for contributory negligence. The issue is the percentage. 

95The plaintiff's submissions ask me to take a number of factors into account, in submitting that an appropriate percentage for reduction would be 40 - 60%. 

96The first is that the defendant was driving a 4-wheel drive motor vehicle capable of inflicting catastrophic injuries. I was not taken to any authority on this point, or to any expert evidence as to what different features, if any, arose from the circumstances of the defendant driving a 4-wheel drive. 

97In Imbree v McNeilly & Anor (208) 248 ALR 647 the High Court extensively reviewed the law of contributory negligence in an appeal where the appellant had permitted a 16 year old to drive a 4-wheel drive motor vehicle. The issue of the danger caused by a 4-wheel drive being a relevant matter to determine such an issue was neither raised nor discussed. 

98In the absence of evidence to support this claim, I am of the view that it is not a factor which should mitigate any claim for reduction of the contributory negligence percentage. 

99The second is that the plaintiff had misjudged the speed of approach of the defendant's vehicle and failed thereby to exercise reasonable care for her own safety because she was intoxicated. However, she had not set out on a night of drinking without making proper arrangements for a safe return home, in that she had made arrangements with her daughter to pick her up. She had been let down by her daughter, and had been unsuccessful in telephoning a taxi from the hotel, which was why she ""found herself on the kerb trying to find transport home"" (written submissions, paragraph 51). It is submitted that there is a distinction to be drawn between an intoxicated pedestrian who goes to a hotel intending to drink a substantial amount of alcohol but makes no arrangements to get home safely and a person who finds themselves ""marooned"". 

100There is no evidence that the plaintiff misjudged the speed of the defendant's vehicle. Mr Lamplough's statement clearly shows that the plaintiff was not looking at the defendant's vehicle at all. She ran across the road without looking. The defendant points out that the plaintiff did not call either Ms Russell or her daughter in support of the claim that the plaintiff made proper arrangements to be collected and found herself marooned when her daughter failed to collect her. Nor is there any explanation as to why, if the plaintiff's daughter was to collect her at 10.00pm, she was still in the street at 1.30am. 

101The plaintiff's written submissions propose that a proper apportionment of contributory negligence should be between 40 - 60% on the basis that this was the same percentage as was adopted by the trial judge in Turkmani v Visvalingam [2009] NSWCA 211. 

102However, the trial judge's finding of 60% was set aside on appeal, by majority, and a finding of 80% made by the Court of Appeal (Hodgson JA at [56], McColl JA at [60]). 

103Furthermore, the pedestrian in Turkmani emerged at a jogging pace (3.4 m/s) to cross the road against a ""Don't Walk"" sign at an intersection, at the peak hour time of 5.25 p.m. 

104The factual situation here is very different. Not only was there no ""Don't Walk"" sign, but there was a barrier on the opposite side of the road. The reduction for contributory negligence should start at a level higher than Turkmani in order to take into account the higher level of contributory negligence. 

105The inevitability of the accident is such that the degree of contributory negligence is exceptionally high. 

106Sections 138(3) and 138(4) Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) provide: 

""(3) The damages recoverable in respect of the motor accident are to be reduced by such percentage as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances of the case. 

(4) The court must state its reasons for determining the particular percentage."" 

107The question what is ""just and equitable"" is explained by Giles JA in MacKenzie v Nominal Defendant (2005) 43 MVR 315; [2005] NSWCA 180 at [63]. Giles JA stated: 

""[63] What is just and equitable must be determined in a principled way, and as Priestley JA observed (in a judgment dissenting in the result) in Bradshaw v Wallis (1996) 23 MVR 472 at 481, ""... to comply with s 74(3) requires the court to arrive at a percentage which inevitably involves as part of the process some kind of comparison between the balance to be attached (in this case) to the driver and the plaintiff"". In the comparison, the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man and the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage will call for attention. In the present case, neither the appellant nor the respondent suggested that the approach described in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd was inappropriate."" 

108The appropriate exercise to determine what is ""just and equitable"" is to balance the blame to be attached to the driver and to the plaintiff. The degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person, and the acts of the parties in causing the damage, are each of importance. 

109In MacKenzie v Nominal Defendant at [93], Giles JA warned: 

""[93] When arriving at his assessment of 100% contributory negligence, the judge proceeded upon his findings as to the appellant's conduct and his actual knowledge. He did not exclude from his consideration that the appellant was intoxicated, or the circumstances in which he came to be intoxicated. His attention was drawn to those matters in the appellant's submission recorded in his [165], and he did not reject them as irrelevant. Rather, given his findings as to the appellant's conduct and knowledge, he did not think they took the case out of a worst situation of contributory negligence. The appellant's complaint should not have been that the judge applied an objective test in determining a just and equitable percentage reduction, but that his subjective basis in the appellant's conduct and knowledge was flawed because not tempered by regard to whether in acting as he did, and with the knowledge found, the appellant's intoxication caused him to act impulsively and without full consideration of what might occur."" 

110In the present case, the plaintiff's evidence was that she was using her mobile telephone to attempt to get transport home. She was sufficiently aware of her actions to be able to make such arrangements. While the plaintiff's blood alcohol level of 0.16 was high, her prior history (set out in more detail in the section of this judgment on quantum) is that of a person with a long history of consumption of alcohol. Unlike the plaintiff in Vale v Eggins , who was a teenager and unused to alcohol, the plaintiff is a middle-aged woman with a long history of alcohol use. She was well aware of what she was doing. 

111This accident occurred entirely as a result of the inattention of the plaintiff, who ran into the path not only of the defendant, but also Mr Lamplough, in circumstances of the utmost danger. Some form of impact was inevitable and accordingly contributory negligence should be assessed at 100%. 

Conclusion concerning liability 

112Accordingly, in the event that I have erred in regard to liability, my finding as to contributory negligence would be a finding of 100%. 

Quantum issues 

113In the event that any findings I make concerning quantum are of assistance if my findings concerning liability and contributory negligence are erroneous, I set out findings in relation to quantum. It is necessary to deal with each of the plaintiff's injury separately, as many are exacerbations of medical problems which the plaintiff had suffered prior to the accident. 

Causation issues 

114The plaintiff clearly sustained a traumatic brain injury in the accident and there is a MAS assessment from Dr Cameron grounding an entitlement to non-economic loss. It is submitted on behalf of the defendant that this finding is not binding on the issue for consideration concerning quantum, namely whether the problems identified are caused by the accident. 

115The plaintiff was assessed by a series of clinical psychologists and neuro-psychiatrists following the accident (Ms Walker, 15 November 2001; Mr Taylor, 14 May 2002 (not tendered); Dr Langeluddecke, 15 October 2004, 22 March 2011; Ms Batchelor, 22 September 2010). 

116Ms Batchelor's report states, as the defendant points out at paragraph 70 of the written submissions that ""there is no definitive evidence of an injury related impairment of memory"". Ms Batchelor considered it was possible that the plaintiff's prior history of alcohol abuse, domestic violence and depression may explain the plaintiff's decreased functioning. There are similar comments in the report of Dr Langeluddecke of 22 March 2011. 

117A significant problem in relation to causation is the lengthy gap in relation to some of the reports; for example, Dr McCarthy's report of 26 November 2001 has not been updated. In addition, as have been noted elsewhere, the Particulars were never amended after 2004. 

118A particular difficulty is Dr Jungfer's comments that she had difficulty assessing the plaintiff because the plaintiff came to the interview under the influence of alcohol. The plaintiff when asked about this in cross-examination denied that she was affected and also denied that this had been raised with her by Dr Jungfer. 

119The report tendered by the plaintiff of Dr Steven Buckley, a consultant physician in rehabilitation (17 September 2010), does not refer to what are clearly chronic and longstanding alcohol problems or domestic violence history. 

120In addition, there is a report of Dr Sydney Smith, a renowned neuro-psychiatrist. He states that the accident has caused no significant change to the plaintiff's intellect, memory or personality. 

121The failure to update particulars after 2004, gaps in reports and failure to provide a full history to treating doctors such as Dr Steven Buckley create real problems for assessment of the degree to which the plaintiff suffered injury. 

122As can be seen by an analysis of each of the injuries claimed, of which the head injury is the most significant, this is a problem in relation to all aspects of the plaintiff's quantum claim. 

123I shall now deal with the plaintiff's history of back problems. 

The plaintiff's history of back problems 

124The plaintiff was on light duties or off work up until the time of the accident by reason of an injury she sustained in the course of her duties at Unistrut Pty Ltd (see the report of Dr Wallace, 22 November 2000; Exhibit 2, document 4). She commenced a course of physiotherapy (which she only continued for one week, contrary to the information provided to the plaintiff's motor vehicle reconstruction expert) as well as allergy medication. She remained off work for some time, according to the report of Dr Raymond Wallace of 22 November 2000, from approximately the beginning of November. During this time she was involved in a series of domestic incidents in which she was a victim; police were called to the house on 7 and 31 January and again on 11 April, and on 12 March, Susan Arnold noted that following an altercation between the plaintiff and her then husband, she had been struck with such force that her breast implant had leaked (Exhibit 2, document 6). By 18 May 2001, the plaintiff was complaining to Dr Mastroianni that she was only able to work three hours a day (the plaintiff being on light duties from some time towards the end of 2000) and was unable to do any house work, which was being done by her daughter. 

125In a report dated 20 June 2001 Dr Peter E Giblin states: 

""DIAGNOSIS 

Soft tissue injury to her back, with referred symptoms to the legs, consistent with the disc bulge at L4/5 noted on the CT scan and MRI scan, and consistent with her symptoms and history of injury. 

PROGNOSIS 

Her condition has stablised. Surgery is unlikely to be required. Her symptoms will persist on an episodic and indefinite basis, permanently restricting her from heavy repetitive bending lifting and twisting. In addition, these restrictions will apply in parallel to her domestic and recreational activities. 

There will be a gradual deterioration, as she gets older. Her back will be more susceptible to repeat soft tissue injury as well as the effects of post-traumatic degenerative change. 

TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT 
On going therapy will be largely medial and directed by her family doctor. The costs will be similar to that over the last six months on a pro-rate basis and will be required indefinitely. 

At the same time, she will require at least seven hours per week physical assistance, indefinitely, for her heavy domestic responsibilities. 

I would anticipate that she will be permanently unfit for her pre-injury job, and the most optimistic scenario, would be a light sedentary work environment, preceded by the appropriate vocational rehabilitation. 

Meanwhile in the short-term, she remains fit for her restricted part-time duties. OPINION It would be my view that, notwithstanding a certain amount of presumed, pre-existing asymptomatic age-related changes, this lady has, directly as a result of her subject injury of August 2000, 25% permanent impairment of her back, with 7.5% permanent loss of efficient use of each leg at or above the knee, taking into account all symptoms in each leg as a whole."" 

126In a report dates 7 November 2001, Dr John Roth states: 

""Although she was involved in a road traffic accident on the 08/07/01 which aggravated her back condition, she has in fact stopped working in approximately April or June 2001 because of back pain and her incapacity at this time is still substantially related to the injury which she sustained at work in August 2000."" 

127On 15 November 2001, Dr Walker provided a report stating that the plaintiff was capable of returning to her previous work prior to the motor vehicle accident (Exhibit C, document (d)). I note, however, that Dr McCarthy in an assessment of 15 November considered that she was not fit to work due to her brain injury. I have dealt with this history in the next section. 

128The plaintiff undoubtedly suffered an exacerbation of her prior back injury in the motor vehicle accident. The degree to which the motor vehicle accident was a contributing factor appears to have been minor. 

The plaintiff's history of head injury 

129The plaintiff had a series of violent relationships with men. She told Dr Bruce Westmore on 17 August 2005 that 26 years beforehand, when married to her first husband, she had a ""nervous breakdown"" (these words are put in inverted commas by Dr Westmore in his 19 August 2005 report, at page 5). He went on to describe her as informing him that she was thrown out of a moving vehicle by her first husband, following which she ""probably"" became depressed as she didn't want to live and feared her husband may kill her. 

130The plaintiff's daughter Tanya describes the violent home in which she grew up and two occasions when the plaintiff had to be taken to hospital after she had slashed her wrists. The plaintiff was not cross-examined about this, and I shall disregard it. 

131Dr McCarthy's report of 15 November considered the plaintiff was not fit to work by reason of her brain injury (Exhibit C, document (e)). There is, however, a gap between the report of Dr Sydney Smith of 5 September 2002 and October 2004, when the plaintiff was reviewed by Dr Langeluddecke on behalf of the defendant. The plaintiff had bilateral breast implants removed on 28 November 2002 but it is not in dispute that this is unrelated to the accident. Apart from a vocational assessment of Ross Girdler dated 17 February 2005, no further material is served on behalf of the plaintiff, who the following month, on 18 March 2005, killed her de facto partner and was taken into custody, subsequently pleading guilty to manslaughter. A report prepared by Dr Bruce Westmore of 19 August 2005 relates essentially to the criminal charges and the next report served on behalf of the plaintiff was the report of Dr Steven Buckley of 17 September 2010, which as I have indicated, is unfortunately deficient in a number of respects by reason of his not being provided with the relevant information. Other reports served by the plaintiff in September 2010 include reports of Dr Batchelor (a neuropsychologist), Janice Williams (an occupational therapist), and Dr Nigel Curtis (an oral and maxillofacial surgeon). 

132To these were added the report of Dr Jungfer in October and a report of a Dr Scoppa in December concerning the plaintiff's hearing loss, which had been a problem of the plaintiff for a considerable period of time. 

133These are enormous gaps in the plaintiff's medical history. During the periods of time covered by this gap, significant other forces and issues, such as the plaintiff's domestic violence problems and alcohol problems, clearly played a significant part in her decreasing intellectual ability and health problems. 

134Part of the problems in relation to the plaintiff's mental health problems is the plaintiff's denial about alcohol problems. For example, she denied having alcohol related blackouts (Dr Westmore, 17 August 2005, page 5). Her alcohol consumption is of long standing; she told Dr Westmore that her alcohol consumption ""increased"" after she met her late partner Jeff because he ""pressured her"" to drink although she did not drink daily. However, the information contained in Dr Jungfer's report about the plaintiff attending her premises affected by alcohol is one of a series of matters which indicated the plaintiff has a long standing problem in relation to alcohol, with which she clearly has not come to terms. 

Neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric reports 

135Dr Pauline Langluddeke, in her report of 22 March 2011, has helpfully summarized the contents of the reports she appraised in her report of 15 October 2004 and in particular the neuropsychological reports of Dr A Walker (assessment date 15 November 2001), Mr W J Taylor (14 May 2002) and Dr J Batchelor (22 September 2010), and I have been guided in my interpretation of these reports by her helpful comments. All noted the well below average intellectual and cognitive function; Mr Taylor was uncertain whether the impaired results represented acquired or longstanding functions. Dr Batchelor's report, prepared eight years after the other two, notes the plaintiff's functioning had decreased since earlier testing in 2002. Dr Batchelor's report considered possible reasons were alcohol abuse, domestic violence, emotional factors and not trying hard enough in the test. However, as Dr Langluddeke notes (page 4), Dr Batchelor does not comment on the plaintiff's longstanding history of alcohol abuse as documented in police records that were available to her. Although Dr Batchelor refers to alcohol as a possible factor, it would have been helpful if this issue had been addressed in the light of that material. 

Psychiatric evidence 

136The plaintiff has some real difficulties with psychiatric evidence to support her claim. The report of Dr Sydney Smith of 5 September 2002 refers to brain damage exacerbated by alcohol and narcotic abuse, and his report of 15 November 2004 suggests, as Dr Langluddeke notes (at page 6 of her 22 March 2011 report) that there was no evidence of cognitive decline after the accident. 

137The report of Dr Bruce Westmore, prepared on 19 August 2005, is a careful and helpful report on which I have placed a great deal of weight, but it is a report prepared for the purposes of the charges relating to the death of the plaintiff's partner and deals with her claimed loss of memory of this event, rather than specifically addressing the injuries in the motor vehicle accident, although this is referred to as a factor. 

138Dr Akkerman assessed the plaintiff in June 2007 on referral from the Motor Accidents Authority Medical Assessment Service and diagnosed an Adjustment Disorder with Anxious and Depressed Mood (Mild) as a result of the accident, which a Whole Person Impairment (Psychiatric) at 5%. 

Other factors relevant to the plaintiff's intellectual difficulties 

139Dr Westmore considers that the plaintiff's problems arise from a combination of difficulties, namely: 

(a)Constitutional or genetic factors; 

(b)The head injury following the motor vehicle accident; 

(c)""Possible acute episodes of alcohol consumption""( page 9 of his report); 

(d)An extended history of extreme violence from her partner Mr Cook. I note the plaintiff told Dr Westmore that her first husband was also violent, and threw her from a car, and that her daughter Tanya refers to the plaintiff's leg being broken, as well as numerous other serious episoded of domestic violence; 

(e)These problems are complicated by her borderline intelligence and hearing problems. 

Conclusions concerning the plaintiff's head injury 

140I accept the submissions of the defendant that there are significant causation issues in relation to the plaintiff's head injury. The plaintiff has, however, suffered a significant head injury in the accident. 

The plaintiff's history of breast implant problems 

141The plaintiff had two breast silicone implants in 1980. 

142A report dated 12 March 2001 by Susan Arnold, an occupational therapist, records that the plaintiff discussed her breast implant leak with her general practitioner, Dr Bong, on 21 st February 2001, and that: 

""It was clearly understood by myself that both Dr Bong and Ms Russell did not feel that the leak was due to any injury sustained at work. Rather, it was attributed to an altercation Ms Russell had experienced when with her then husband."" 

143In his report of 15 May 2002, Dr Lyons notes the ultrasound ordered by Dr Bong on 7 February 2002 showing silastic extravasion ""reasonably rules out the pedestrian accident as a cause."" 

144There is no doubt the plaintiff suffered a haematoma to the breast during the accident as this is recorded in the hospital notes. However, the breast implant problem was pre-existing. 

145The removal of implants was recommended by Dr Thomas Lam in his report of 12 July 2002. He notes she fell on her chest in the August 2000 work accident and ""subsequently"" developed discolouration. He does not suggest that this was as a result of the accident. 

146In her evidence, the plaintiff referred to pain in her breasts as a significant problem for her. The plaintiff told Dr Bruce Westmore on 17 August 2005 that her partner Jeff, with whom she had commenced living after the motor vehicle accident, used to kick her frequently in the breasts and that she ""now gets chronic bleeding, particularly in the right breast."" 

147The plaintiff's breast implant problems are unrelated to the motor vehicle accident. 

The plaintiff's history of deafness problems 

148The plaintiff was first diagnosed with 35% deafness in 1970. Professor Jones, in his report dated 30 June 2004, notes she said this was due to German measles (at p. 8) but Dr Sydney Smith notes the possibility of accident-related trauma. 

149The plaintiff's longstanding history of deafness problems pre-dates the accident. I note the opinion of Dr Sydney Smith but, on the balance of the evidence, I am not satisfied that any problems with deafness increased by reason of the accident. 

The plaintiff's dental and weight loss problems 

150The plaintiff told Dr Giblin in June 2001, before the motor vehicle accident, that she had lost a lot of weight following her work injury, dropping from a weight of 65 to 52 kilos. Her weight is noted as 6 stone in November 2001 by Dr Roth, suggesting her weight before and after the accident remained relatively stable. 

151The plaintiff's dental problems were not the subject of submissions. She told the Court she lost all but two of her teeth. She now has dentures. Dr Curtis says she lost ""several teeth"" in the accident, as well as suffering an undisplaced fracture of the right orbit. This is a significant injury and I have taken it into account in assessment of damages. 

152The plaintiff's weight loss problems pre-dated the accident and I accordingly had not taken it into account. 

Conclusions concerning non-economic loss 

153The plaintiff claims $345,600, a sum which was expressed to be ""80% of the most extreme case"" (see the plaintiff's outline of damages). As Mr Barry QC agreed in the course of his oral submissions, that is not the basis upon which to approach awards of non-economic loss in motor vehicle accidents. Noting however, the issues of causation raised by the defendant, I accept the defendant's submissions that since there is evidence of traumatic brain injury and some aggravation of pre-existing psychological problems, as well as back problems, a figure of $240,000 is appropriate. 

Past and future out of pockets 

154Past medical expenses are hospital expenses ($6,815.65) and a HIC current charge of $891.10, making a total of $7,706.75. This amount should be awarded. There is no claim for future medical expenses and the plaintiff said she takes no medication. The plaintiff's partner, who gave evidence, gave evidence concerning the plaintiff taking medication but this evidence was both vague and unsatisfactory and in circumstances where the plaintiff was quite definite that she was not taking medication, and no claim is made for it, I would not be prepared to make any award. 

Past and future loss of earning capacity 

155The plaintiff was already on light duties at the time of accident. I note the opinion of Dr Giblin set out in more detail in the section concerning the plaintiff's back injuries. The plaintiff had already suffered significant diminution in her earning capacity prior to the accident. There is a strong argument that the plaintiff's earning capacity may not have been further compensable by reason of her pre-existing condition ( Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340; [1962] ALR 331; (1961) 35 ALJR 174). 

156The defendant in written submissions (paragraph 88) points to her severe asthma, noting that she presented to Blacktown Hospital Emergency Department in April 2000. I do not regard this as being of significance. Persons who suffer from asthma still have a significant work capacity and I do not regard her asthma problem as relevant to her capacity to work. 

157However, the plaintiff does have a significant criminal record for dishonesty, as well as a conviction for manslaughter. There are real problems for any employer confronted by a perspective employee with a criminal record such as the plaintiff's. In addition, the plaintiff's significant alcohol problems remain untreated. 

158Section 126 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) provides as follows: 

""(1) A court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant's most likely future circumstances but for the injury. 

(2) When a court determines the amount of any such award of damages it is required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events concerned might have occurred but for the injury. 

(3) If the court makes an award for future economic loss, it is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted."" 

159The strong likelihood is that the plaintiff would never have returned to any gainful employment. The list of factors given by Dr Westmore in his report of 17 August 2005, which is set out earlier in this judgment, indicates that the head injury following the motor vehicle accident is a part, and only a small part, of significant problems the plaintiff has faced in relation to her intellectual capacity for some time, problems which were about to engulf her whether she suffered this motor vehicle injury or not. 

160The plaintiff has not satisfied me that she is entitled to any assumptions about future earning capacity. The plaintiff's ""most likely future circumstances but for the injury"" would have been a departure from the workforce due to her increasing alcohol related problems and the domestic violence cycle in which she had become entrapped. 

161The plaintiff claims past economic loss of $94,793.97, plus superannuation loss of $10,245.94 and long service leave loss of $2,501.97. This has been framed, as I understand it, to take into account that the plaintiff was in jail and therefore unable to earn for the period of her custodial sentence, but assumes that she would have been able to obtain employment whilst on probation. 

162Doing the best I can, I am satisfied that there is a small economic loss for the period from the time of the accident in 2001 upon until earlier 2005, when her alcohol and other related problems, in my view, took over her life, and played an important part in the circumstances in which she killed her then de facto partner. 

163Accordingly, I would award past economic loss in the form of a cushion , to include some entitlement for superannuation and past long service leave, of the kind the reflects the plaintiff's part time light duty employment prior to the accident. Doing the best I can with the very limited information I have, I would assess this past economic loss as a cushion of $30,000. 

164In the future, however, the plaintiff is unemployable by reason of her ongoing alcohol problems, her criminal history and her increasing deafness. I would assess her future loss of earning capacity as nil. 

Past and future home care assistance 

165The plaintiff's evidence was that she lived alone, although her boyfriend came to stay with her occasionally. She has clearly been able to look after herself and has lived alone since going to prison for killing her de facto partner. She was able to look after herself in prison and since that time she told the court she has lived alone. 

166Mr Barry QC put to me that the plaintiff's presentation was that of a person who plainly needs support of a physical and organisational nature. The plaintiff's evidence was that she got lost and relied upon her boyfriend to take her to medical appointments, as otherwise she would get lost. I am not satisfied that any problems the plaintiff has add up to a sufficient amount so as to overcome the threshold imposed by s 128 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW). I note there is a report of Ms Barela to the effect that five hours per week of organisational support is appropriate; this is below the threshold. 

167Dr Buckley's opinions suffer from a defect that he had insufficient evidence about the plaintiff's alcohol and other related problems. 

168In relation to care provided by the plaintiff's boyfriend, Mr Ackley, there is no evidence that the cost of any such assistance would be incurred, and any claim for commercial care should be rejected: Miller v Galderisi [2009] NSWCA 353. Mr Ackley was, if anything, even vaguer than the plaintiff, being unable to tell the court whether he lived with the plaintiff or not, the name of his employer, whether he worked full or part time and what he did for a living. 

169Accordingly, I would not make any allowance for past or future home care. 

Costs 

170The parties asked me to reserve costs with liberty to apply and I have done so. 

Orders 

(1)Judgment for the defendant. 
(2)Liberty to apply on three days notice for any argument concerning costs. 
(3)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

2757942,BASSOS v R [2011] NSWCCA 218,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the judgment of Hoeben J. 

2JAMES J: I agree with Hoeben J. 

3HOEBEN J: 
Offences and sentence 
The applicant was committed for sentence in the District Court for the supply of a prohibited drug namely gamma-butyrolactone, in an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug, being 2,118 grams, contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum prescribed penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

4Two additional offences were dealt with on a Form 1. 

(i) Possess a prohibited drug (2.71 methylamphetamine) contrary to s10(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

(ii) Supply prohibited drug (3.99g of1-benzylpiperazine) contrary to s25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 

5Having entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court on 7 July 2010, the applicant came before Flannery DCJ for sentence on 4 March 2011. Her Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, commencing 4 February 2010 and expiring 3 May 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months, expiring 3 February 2014. 

6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence on the following grounds: 
Ground 1 - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to consider whether the applicant had been substantially involved in the supply of drugs. 

Ground 2 - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have regard to s5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

Factual background 

7On 3 February 2010 Detectives attended the applicant's unit at Mascot. A search warrant was executed with the assistance of a drug dog. Police found numerous drug paraphernalia including a glass water pipe, a diary page depicting names of people and next to the names, sums of money. 

8In the kitchen police located two small resealable bags containing a crystal substance and one medium sized resealable bag containing a crystal substance. In the vicinity of the bags was a plastic container housing numerous plastic fish shaped soy-sauce containers. Also in the container were the screw tops for those containers. To the right of these items was a clear plastic water bottle containing clear liquid. Within reach of these items was a set of digital scales. 

9When the applicant was asked about these items he made full admissions about being the owner of the crystal substance. He told the police that this was crystal amphetamine for personal use to assist with his addiction. He told the police that the clear liquid observed in the plastic water bottle was the substance GHL. This is the street name used to describe the prohibited drug named on the indictment. 

10The applicant directed the police to another bottle of the same substance in the refrigerator. The applicant was then arrested. Subsequent analysis of the substance confirmed that it was 2,118 grams of gama-butyrolactone. This substance had an estimated street value of $5,000. 

11The applicant was interviewed and he admitted that the drugs belonged to him. He admitted being the user of a mobile telephone service. When the police made inquiries concerning this service, it was discovered that there were 1,840 calls in and out, including SMSs, between 27 January and the morning of 3 February 2010. When asked about the number of calls, the applicant did not provide any reasonable response. 

12In relation to the second matter on the Form 1, on 8 June 2009 in the early hours of the morning, the applicant was seen by police throwing something away as he was walking along George Street. Police later found that what he threw away was a bag containing purple tablets which were analysed and found to be 3.99 grams of 1-benzylpiperazine. 

13The applicant has been in custody since 3 February 2010. 

Remarks on sentence 

14It was accepted by the Crown that the plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity and consequently her Honour reduced the sentence which she would otherwise have imposed by 25 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. 

15Her Honour noted that the standard non-parole period of 10 years was intended to apply to an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness where the offender was convicted after a trial. Even though the applicant had pleaded guilty, her Honour noted that the standard non-parole period remained relevant as a reference point. 

16Because the standard non-parole period remained relevant, it was necessary for her Honour to consider where the offence lay on the range of objective seriousness. Her Honour concluded that the offence was ""appreciably below the mid-range for offences of this kind"". 

17Her Honour reached this conclusion for the following reasons: 

(i) In the absence of telephone records, she was not prepared to find that the 1,840 calls were evidence of drug supply. 

(ii) Although the notebook with the written notes listing names and amounts looked like a list of names of people who owed money for drugs, her Honour was not prepared to find beyond a reasonable doubt that such was the case. 

(iii) The applicant was to be sentenced on the basis that he had a large quantity of the substance in his possession, that he had or would give some to friends, that he was a big user of the substance himself and that at most, the substance was worth $5000. 

18In relation to the applicant's subjective case, her Honour noted that he did have something of a criminal record in that there were two dishonesty offences committed in the 1990's, an assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2005 and the possession of a prohibited drug and goods in custody offence in late 2009. Her Honour considered that this was the sort of record which would still enable the applicant to some leniency. 

19The applicant was born in March 1977 and was almost 34 at the time of sentence. Testimonials and a presentence report showed that the applicant had a close family and friends who continued to support him. 

20The applicant tested positive to HIV in 2000 and had been receiving HIV treatment since 2001. Since then he had had episodes of incomplete adherence to treatment, complicated by his drug abuse. He was referred to a psychiatrist in 2005 and in January 2008, he had a drug overdose. 

21In relation to his drug use, Dr Quan said: 

""The offender has a long history of drug abuse. He has also been depressed. He has treatment adherence issues and had been inconsistent with treatment for HIV, depression and drug abuse. Complicating the matter are side effects associated with HIV treatment, symptoms of depression and CMA withdrawal which are often similar. He has given a history of using CMA to fight lethargy of his HIV treatment but this could also be caused by CMA withdrawal too. A diagnosis of depression and drug use disorder was made in 2005 and he continues to battle both these mental health issues."" 

22The presentence report pointed out that by being placed in custody, the applicant had been forced to detoxify and had gained insight, with the assistance of alcohol and other drug counsellors. He had been given the opportunity to address his use of illicit substances. The author of the report, a psychologist, was impressed that the applicant understood that upon release he would require further drug rehabilitation to protect him from relapse and to ensure his successful transition back into the community. 

23Her Honour was satisfied, on the basis of that material, that the applicant was usefully spending his time in prison and that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation upon his release. 

24Her Honour went on to say (ROS 7.8) 

""It is obvious that a sentence of imprisonment must be imposed. 

As I have found that the offence is appreciably below the midrange for offences of this kind, as there was a plea of guilty and as I have made positive findings about the offender's future, I do not propose to impose the standard non-parole period, however, it does remain as a guidepost. 

... 

I propose to find special circumstances as this is the first time the offender has been to gaol and as I consider it necessary that upon his release he have an extended period of supervision from the Probation Service to assist him to continue the rehabilitation that I find is well and truly taking place. 

I indicate that I have had regard to the relevant statutory framework that relates to the sentencing of offenders and to the principles established in the authorities which bear upon the issue and I have had regard to the purposes of sentencing, which are set out in s3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act."" 

25It should be noted that the submissions made to her Honour on behalf of the applicant conceded that a custodial sentence was appropriate. A sentence suggested to her Honour was one of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. 

Appeal 

26It is convenient to deal with both grounds of appeal together since the submissions in support were interrelated. Section 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , prohibits the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment unless the Court, having considered all possible alternatives, is satisfied that no other penalty is appropriate. 

27The applicant submitted that the conclusion reached by the sentencing judge was that the applicant was not substantially involved in the supply of drugs. The applicant submitted that, having made that finding, her Honour failed to give proper consideration to that fact before concluding that a custodial sentence had to be imposed. The applicant relied upon the decision in this Court of Scott v R [2010] NSWCCA 103 (Hislop J with whom Allsop P and Grove J agreed). The applicant submitted that the effect of that case was that the failure of the sentencing judge to make the necessary anterior finding of ""trafficking in drugs to a substantial degree"" vitiated the sentence. The applicant submitted that since there was no finding of trafficking in drugs ""to a substantial degree"" here, the same result should occur. 

28The applicant submitted that in drug supply cases the offender's role and the level of criminality involved is more important in determining the sentence than the quantity of drugs involved. In this case he submitted that her Honour never turned her mind to that question and never turned her mind to the question of whether there was ""substantial trafficking"". If she had, he submitted, she would have concluded that there was no such ""substantial trafficking"" and that it was therefore necessary for her to consider, in accordance with s5, whether a non-custodial sentence was appropriate. 

29The applicant submitted that this was a significant error and had it not occurred, a different sentence ought to have been passed and that a different sentence is warranted at law (s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). The Court was invited to re-sentence the applicant. 

Consideration 

30With due respect to the applicant, his statement of principle in relation to sentencing for drug trafficking, is not entirely correct. The correct approach was set out by Simpson J (with whom RA Hulme J and I agreed) in Zahrooni v R ; Director of Public of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Zahrooni [2010] NSWCCA 252 at [29]: 

""29 The cases to which I have referred focus largely upon the meaning of the word ""trafficking"". Whether consideration is given to that word, or to the words ""to a substantial degree"", the issue is the extent of involvement in supply. Where the supply is on a single, isolated occasion, the circumstances might (or might not) permit a non-custodial sentence. But the authorities are clear that where the dealing involves ""trafficking to a substantial degree"" it is only in exceptional circumstances that a non-custodial sentence will be imposed. The converse of that proposition, on Mr Zahrooni's argument, is that, if the trafficking is not ""to a substantial degree"", a custodial sentence is not necessarily inevitable. It would be more accurate to say that the cases cited do not, in those circumstances, require a custodial penalty."" 

31That last observation by her Honour is important. In such circumstances, it is open to a court to impose a custodial penalty but in accordance with the authorities, it is not obliged to do so. 

32In Zahrooni her Honour went on to say: 

""30 Here, as in Scott , the judge did not make an express finding as to whether Mr Zahrooni's offence involved ""trafficking to a substantial degree"". But he did, with justification, find that Mr Zahrooni was ""a user/dealer"". 

31 It is incorrect to suggest that the judge failed to take account of the extent of Mr Zahrooni's involvement. On two occasions he referred to the quantity of the drug (69 grams - more than double the traffickable quantity); the individual packaging (48 sachets); the relatively large sum of money in his possession (having regard to his financial circumstances); and the text message; to this may be added the possession of two mobile telephones."" 

33Similarly, it is not correct to say that in this case her Honour failed to take account of the extent of the applicant's involvement in drug dealing. Her Honour specifically found that ""the offender had a large quantity of the substance in his possession, that he had or would give some to friends, that he was a big user of the substance himself and that at most, the substance was worth $5,000"". Those findings refer to the quantity of drug involved and that there was some (albeit modest supply on her Honour's findings) to friends. 

34Accordingly, it was open to her Honour to impose a custodial penalty but she was not obliged to do so. When, however, one takes into account the standard non-parole period of 10 years, which continued to operate as a guidepost, the maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years, which also operated as a guidepost, and the effect of the Form 1 offences, it is difficult to see how a lesser sentence could have been imposed. 

35It is true that her Honour in terms did not consider or refer to s5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. She did, however, in the course of her reasons (ROS 7.8) say: ""It is obvious that a sentence of imprisonment must be imposed."" From this I infer that her Honour considered the alternative to a custodial sentence but rejected it. That her Honour was justified in so doing is clear from the above analysis and because the applicant's legal advisors accepted that a custodial sentence was appropriate and made submissions accordingly. 

36It is also not without significance that s5(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides: 

""5(4) A sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section."" 

37It follows that I am not satisfied that her Honour fell into the kind of error identified by the applicant. Even if her Honour had, I would not as a matter of discretion interfere in that I am not persuaded that any lesser sentence than that passed by her Honour would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 

38The orders which I propose are as follows: 

(1) Leave to appeal be granted. 

(2) The appeal be dismissed.

		30 September 2011",2011-09-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757949,HAMED v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 219,"Judgment  1JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hall J.  2HALL J:  The appellant by notice of appeal dated 31 January 2011 appeals in respect of a conviction by a jury on one count of robbery in company contrary to the provisions of s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  3The trial commenced in the Parramatta District Court on 30 November 2009 and continued until 11 December 2009.  4The Crown case alleged that the appellant was a participant in a robbery which occurred at the St Mary's Post Office, St Mary's, Sydney on 13 February 2009 as a result of which an amount of money was stolen.  5The single charge in the indictment was in the following terms:-  ""On 13 February 2009 at South St Mary's in the State of New South Wales, being in the company of a person whose identity is unknown, did rob Daxa Dilal of property belonging to Australia Post, namely, a sum of cash.""  6The Crown case was a circumstantial one.  7Section 97(1) of the Crimes Act is in the following terms:-  "" 97    Robbery etc or stopping a mail, being armed or in company  (1)  Whosoever, being armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument, or being in company with another person,  robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person, or  stops any mail, or vehicle, railway train, or person conveying a mail, with intent to rob, or search the same,  shall be liable to imprisonment for twenty years. ""  8In addition to the appeal against his conviction, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  On 10 June 2010, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 11 May 2009 and expiring on 10 May 2014 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 10 May 2017.  Facts  9On 13 February 2009, the Post Office at St Mary's was robbed by two people.  Both concealed their identity.  The Crown case was that one of the robbers entered the store through the front of the premises carrying a firearm.  The other robber entered the premises through a side door carrying a knife.  Both weapons were used in the course of the robbery to menace customers and staff of the post office in order to obtain money.  10The Crown case was that the second person was the appellant and it is clear that the jury so found.  11Immediately following the robbery, the first robber entered a vehicle which was parked close by to the post office.  It was a stolen Holden Apollo and was driven by a third person.  The vehicle was driven a short distance to Collins Street, St Mary's where another vehicle, a Holden Commodore, was parked.  Number plates stolen earlier that day were attached to the Holden Commodore.  12The identity of the first and third offenders, to which reference has been made, has never been directly ascertained.  13Personal property belonging to the owner of the Holden Apollo had been removed and left near the Holden Commodore prior to the robbery.  Inside the Holden Commodore was a bag containing property belonging to the appellant, being a change of clothes, shoes, a set of keys, a mobile phone and a Health Care concession card in his name.  There was a second bag in the car with a pair of shoes and a change of clothes.  14Three males were seen by a witness, a Mr Wilson, in the vicinity of the Holden Commodore.  One of the men was noted to be trying to break into the car.  When the vehicle was later found by police, the Commodore's front passenger window had been smashed.  There was a Samurai sword lying beside the car and a knife.  The knife was similar in size and shape to the knife shown as being held by the second robber, which, as stated above, the Crown alleged to be the appellant.  The knife could be seen on the CCTV footage (Exhibit E).  Keys fitting the Holden Commodore were later found by police in a drain behind the car.  15The Holden Apollo was recovered more than a kilometre away in Smith Street, St Marys.  The Crown case was that the appellant had left a pink glove and a black balaclava that had been worn during the robbery inside the Holden Apollo.  16A further segment of CCTV footage was shown at the trial.  This depicted the appellant being present in a Quix Service Station on the day of the offence not far from the scene of the robbery.  17At no stage during the robbery or immediately after it was the appellant identified as being involved in the robbery.  Accordingly, the Crown case at trial was an entirely circumstantial one.  Grounds of appeal  18The present appeal was filed on 21 January 2011 by way of Notice of Appeal. The grounds of appeal are as follows:-  "" As to Conviction  1. The verdict was unreasonable, unsafe unjust or dangerous in that the matter should have been taken away from the jury at the close of the Crown case, because the Crown did not prove the goods were the property of Australia Post as per the indictment;  2. That the verdict was otherwise unreasonable, unsafe unjust or dangerous.  As to Sentence  3. That the sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances.""  (1) Ground 1: The verdict was unreasonable, unsafe unjust or dangerous in that the matter should have been taken away from the jury at the close of the Crown case, because the Crown did not prove the goods were the property of Australia Post as per the indictment  19The first ground of appeal raises an issue concerning the ownership of the stolen property (money).  It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the Crown did not prove that the money that was stolen was the property of Australia Post in the terms charged in the indictment.  The point was raised at the end of the Crown case.  20An application was then made by counsel for the appellant that the matter should be taken away from the jury on the basis that the Crown had failed to prove ""the property belonged to Australia Post"" (transcript, 9 December 2009, at p.302.35).  21The submission was made, despite the fact that there was evidence from the licensee of the post office, Ms Daxa Dilal, that the money stolen did not belong to her, but belonged to Australia Post.  22In response, the Crown Prosecutor observed that a robbery must amount to a larceny and a larceny is an offence against possession, not an offence against ownership.  It was submitted, however, that the evidence of Ms Dilal was very clear, namely, that the stolen money did not belong to her but that it belonged to Australia Post.  This was explained upon the basis that a licensee such as Ms Dilal received money on behalf of Australia Post and, at the end of each day, the money went into an Australia Post account and not into her own account.  23Accordingly, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the element of the offence had been proved, namely, a forcible taking of property from the possession of a person effected by fear or threats by persons in company.  24On 9 December 2009, the trial judge gave judgment in which her Honour stated that there was evidence that the money belonged to Australia Post, rather than belonging to Ms Dilal and, on that basis, the application on behalf of the appellant was refused.  25Ms Dilal's evidence was that she operated the post office under licence from Australia Post as a business for profit.  She had conducted the business since 2005.  It was operated upon the basis that she purchased stock from Australia Post and from other external dealers.  26Stock received from Australia Post was paid for at the end of the month, following each month's accounting, by direct debit from the abovementioned account operated on behalf of Australia Post.  Stock purchased from outside dealers was paid for by cheque.  27Ms Dilal's evidence was that the takings during the course of a trading day were first placed in a drawer with any ""surplus"" being placed into a time delay safe.  Australia Post provided Armaguard as the security company for collection of the money on a daily basis, the amount taken being recorded on Ms Dilal's computer after receipting.  The money was then recorded as going into an Australia Post account.  28Additional cash money, when needed, could be obtained from the monies held for the purpose of effecting daily transactions.  29The submissions for the appellant were that, notwithstanding the evidence given by Ms Dilal, it was reasonably clear that the money in the drawer and the safe ""... must have belonged to the business"" : Appellant's Further Amended Submissions at p.5, paragraph (f).  30It was further contended that the money was collected by Armaguard for ""security purposes"" and that, prior to the accounting function undertaken at the end of the month, it could not be suggested that money received and held in the drawer or the safe belonged to Australia Post.  This submission was made upon the basis that the money could be easily accessed, should the post office need extra cash for operating purposes, such as giving change.  31Accordingly, the submission for the appellant was that the money taken during the course of trading neither belonged to Australia Post nor was held upon any trust for Australia Post.  The arrangement was said to be ""a normal business arrangement whereupon payments due to Australia Post were made on a monthly basis out of an account into which money had been transferred on a daily basis"" : Appellant's Further Amended Written Submissions , at p.6(g).  32The Crown submitted that it was clear that the money taken was in the possession of Ms Dilal and it is also clear that it was money that belonged to Australia Post, but ""... as a matter of law, the Crown did not have to prove that ownership beyond reasonable doubt in order to prove the larceny charge"" : Crown's Written Submissions at [11].  33The Crown submitted that Ground 1 should be dismissed.  34On consideration, I do not consider that there was an error in the trial judge's ruling and, accordingly, there is no basis for this Court intervening on the basis of Ground 1.  The basis for that conclusion is discussed below.  35Ground 1 is a somewhat ambiguous ground of appeal.  On the one hand, it asserts that the matter should have been taken away from the jury at the close of the Crown case.  There was an application that the matter be taken away from the jury on the basis of the ownership issue, an application rejected by the trial judge on 9 December 2009 (AB14-15).  If this ground of appeal seeks to challenge the ruling that there was a case to answer on this element, the ground raises a question of law alone: R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377;  (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at 130 [127]; Flack v R [2011] NSWCCA 167 at [33]-[34].  36However, the ground also contends that the verdict was unreasonable with respect to this issue.  This aspect of the ground asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 , that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  This aspect of the ground does not involve a question of law alone, so that leave to appeal against conviction is required under s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act : Rasic & Ors v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12].  37The test to be applied by the Court in determining an unreasonable verdict ground was summarised recently in the following way in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126 at [31]-[34]:-  ""31 In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606.  The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality.  This involves a question of fact.  The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty.  The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count:  Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22].  32 In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal:  The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128].  This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury.  This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events:  Rasic v R at [29].  33 In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground.  In M v The Queen, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson Toohey JJ said at 494-495:-  'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.'  34 The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases:  The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13].""  38The tenor of the written submissions in this Court, and the oral submissions of counsel for the appellant, was that the verdict was unreasonable having regard to the evidence adduced concerning this element.  On this approach, Ground 1 should be taken as an unreasonable verdict ground, and not a ground raising a question of law alone by reference to the refusal of the judge to direct a verdict of acquittal at the end of the Crown case.  Of course, if the appellant made good his unreasonable verdict submission, the greater would include the lesser and this Court would make appropriate orders.  39Given the issues raised under this ground, leave ought be granted to the appellant to rely upon it: Rasic (supra) at [2], [12].  40There was evidence adduced at trial as to ownership.  That evidence was given by Ms Dilal in cross-examination and no application was made for any of that evidence to be struck out.  Additionally, there was no evidence contradicting Ms Dilal's evidence that the money belonged to Australia Post.  41The evidence also made clear that Ms Dilal was operating under licence to Australia Post and the system, including the accounting system that operated, in itself, supported an inference that the relevant ""person"" who had a claim to an interest in the money was Australia Post, consistently with the evidence given by Ms Dilal.  42In Ilich v The Queen (1986-1987) 162 CLR 110, it was stated (by Wilson and Dawson JJ) that at common law, larceny involves ""...  the taking of something without the consent of the owner who may, for this purpose, include the person in possession of the thing ..."" .  43In the present case, the evidence was that two men entered the premises of Australia Post and took a sum of money from the drawer or till of the premises, there being no suggestion of any assertion of a claim of right or any other entitlement in either of them.  44In determining Ground 1, this Court is to undertake its own independent assessment of the evidence as to whether there was a sufficiency of evidence on the question of the ownership of the stolen property so as to sustain the conviction: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13;  (2011) 85 ALJR 571 at 577 per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ at [20].  In other words, the question raised by Ground 1 requires an independent assessment by this Court of the whole of the evidence so that a determination may be made as to whether the verdict of guilty can be supported: SKA (supra) at [22].  In doing so, the Court is to evaluate and weigh any competing evidence on the question as to the ownership of the stolen money in order to determine whether the verdict of guilty was, as was contended, unreasonable or could not be supported.  45The relevant evidence has been identified above.  In circumstances in which there was no evidence that qualified or contradicted the affirmative evidence as to Australia Post's ownership of the stolen money, there is no basis to support the unreasonable verdict ground in Ground 1.  46Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, I am of the opinion that this ground should be dismissed.  (2) Ground 2:  That the verdict was otherwise unreasonable, unsafe unjust or dangerous  47The central issue at trial was whether the appellant was one of the robbers.  That was a question of fact.  In those circumstances, the Crown contended that the appellant would require leave to argue this ground: Rasic (supra).  48The Crown opposed leave being granted.  49Initially, the Crown sought leave to file in Court relevant material in relation to a statement made by the appellant to police on 18 March 2010 with respect to matters on which he was convicted at trial.  However, the Crown ultimately did not press its application to rely upon this material.  Accordingly, it is not necessary for this Court to consider the matter further.  50I return to the question of leave.  51In the submissions for the appellant it was observed that the men who entered the Australia Post premises were never positively identified during or immediately after the robbery as having participated in it or as being occupants of the getaway car.  The two persons who entered the post office were wearing facial covering as a disguise.  52It was also noted that the only positive identification evidence concerning the appellant being in the vicinity of the post office came from the Quix Service Station attendant, Mr Nagarzai, who was called by the Crown.  He identified a man said to resemble the appellant as being present within a short time after the robbery.  53The appellant was clearly identified on CCTV footage taken at the service station to which I have referred above.  It depicted him walking outside the premises and purchasing a phone card inside the premises.  It was accepted on behalf of the appellant that the service station was within walking distance of the post office and that the appellant was the person identified in the CCTV footage.  54The aspects of the evidence said to support the appellant's position in relation to this ground were set out in the Further Amended Written Submissions made on his behalf.  55The trial judge, in her summing up to the jury, identified that circumstantial evidence including:-  Â· The appellant's DNA on the pink glove and the balaclava and the comparison with those items being shown on the CCTV footage.  Â· The appellant's personal belongings, which were found in the Holden Commodore, being phone, keys, ID and change of clothes.  56The robbery, as earlier noted, was captured on CCTV (Exhibit E).  The person who was alleged to be the appellant was depicted as wearing a blue hooded jacket, pink gloves and was carrying a knife.  57At trial, a series of seven photographs taken from the CCTV footage were tendered and admitted into evidence (Exhibit P).  Photograph 4 taken from ""Cam 3"" showed a blue hooded person wearing pink gloves and carrying a knife.  Photographs 6 and 7 showed a man wearing what appeared to be ""a balaclava"" or some darkened covering over his face.  58Mr McDonald was called by the Crown as a witness after the robbery.  His evidence was to the effect that he was able to see the two robbers leave the post office from his position at the adjacent chemist shop.  He saw them get into a vehicle which he described as ""Holden Apollo, similar to a Toyota Camry"" , which was parked in front of his truck.  In evidence, he said that what stood out most was ""... the pink washing-up gloves"" .  His evidence was that the person with the gloves was ""hooded up"" with a ""bluey spray jacket, kind of thing"" .  He said that that person got into the ""... back passenger side of the car"" .  He identified a pink glove in evidence (MFI 3).  He said that he had been watching for ""close to 1 minute"" .  59The pink glove (MFI 3), which became Exhibit AK in the proceedings, was found in the rear of the getaway car, the Holden Apollo.  Also found in the rear of the Holden Apollo was a black-coloured nylon fashioned balaclava (Exhibit AL).  60The Crown relied upon expert opinion evidence based on DNA analysis.  It also relied upon the evidence of the appellant being seen at about 3.50 pm walking around in the Quix Service Station on Mamre Road and the evidence of Ms Hopkinson to the effect that a person fitting the description of the appellant was in her backyard in Mitchell Street, St Mary's about 3.20 pm on Friday 13 February 2009.  He was seen to be carrying a bundle under his arm.  Ms Hopkinson said that someone was chasing him.  She told him to leave and he ran out of her driveway.  She later found a plastic resealable money bag in her backyard which she gave to police (Exhibit R).  61The summing up by the trial judge referred to the evidence to which reference has been made above.  No complaint is made in this appeal about the trial judge's directions.  62The appellant gave evidence in relation to certain of the items found.  In relation to the ""David and Goliath"" jacket (Exhibit X), the appellant's evidence was that four or five days before the robbery, a person by the name of ""Sam"" asked him to go for a drive, which he did and he then returned to Sam's house about two hours later.  He said that ""Sam"" dropped him off at St Mary's, but he forgot his bag which contained the ""David and Goliath"" jacket and other items.  These are the items that were found in the stolen Holden Commodore on the day of the robbery.  63In relation to the pink glove (Exhibit AK) and the black-coloured nylon fashion balaclava (Exhibit AL), which were found at the rear of the getaway vehicle, the Holden Apollo, DNA material on analysis matched the appellant's profile.  The appellant's gave evidence as to circumstances he claimed would explain how the DNA material had been deposited on those items.  He said that, on the same day as he went for a drive with ""Sam"" , he went to ""Sam's"" house and tried on the pink glove and the black balaclava.  64As observed in the Crown's submissions, the real issue for the jury to decide was whether the man seen on the CCTV film with the pink glove, balaclava and the knife and wearing the blue hooded coat was the appellant.  65The appellant always denied that he was one of the robbers.  66He was arrested on 11 May 2009 and interviewed by police which interview was recorded on video.  When asked what he had been doing on Friday 13 February 2009, the appellant replied that he had been at a friend's house with his girlfriend when a man called Sam rang and asked him to help him.  The appellant's account was that he went to meet Sam near the Quix Service Station on Mamre Road, as Sam had told him that he needed help.  He said that he had driven Sam away and Sam gave him $300.  Later in the interview, the police told the appellant that he was a suspect in the armed robbery.  The appellant then told police that he knew about the robbery but was not prepared to speak on camera, that is, to have any discussion recorded on video.  67The video was turned off and the appellant told police he had been at a friend's place, that he got the call from Sam, but did not pick Sam up.  He did get a bag of cash from Sam.  His account was that he took the bag of money to Sam's girlfriend's place and met Sam there again there.  Sam gave him some money and asked him to go back to the area to look for his gun, and the appellant did go to look for the gun but he could not find it.  68The appellant also told police that Sam had a ""hottie"" , a stolen car, a white car.  The appellant said that he had never been in that car.  He did have things in Sam's car, but that they had been left there on another occasion.  The appellant also denied that he had been in the Quix Service Station that day, saying he had been in a fight.  It was after the interview that the police took a sample for analysis of the appellant's DNA that was used to match the jacket from the Holden Commodore and the balaclava and the glove from the Holden Apollo vehicle.  69There was some dispute at the trial as to what had been said by the appellant after the recorded interview.  The two police officers who spoke to the appellant after that interview were Bowers and Mirabito.  In evidence, the accused denied that he made statements which the police attributed to him and suggested that their evidence was not consistent with what he actually said to them.  Both police officers were cross-examined about how they made their statements in relation to what the appellant said to them.  They had made contemporaneous notes of the conversation after the electronic interview had been stopped.  70Detective Senior Constable Bower, in evidence, said that, at the conclusion of the electronically recorded interview, the appellant said ""I'll tell you what happened.  I just won't do it on record.  I won't be a dog"" .  Detective Bower then said that Detective Senior Constable Mirabito said to the appellant, ""Are you going to tell me the truth about what happened, as everything you have said so far doesn't add up"" .  The appellant replied, ""I was at Andy Havich's house.  I got a call from Sam"" .  He then proceeded to recite in detail the appellant's account.  71At the end of it, Detective Senior Constable Mirabito, according to Constable Bower, said ""Ghaz, stop lying to me.  What you're telling me is not making sense"" .  The appellant replied, ""I wouldn't lie to you.  Stan had a hottie.  It was a white car.  He dropped the gun when he was jumping fences and I went to find it.  Someone must have picked it up and not reported it to the police"" .  72Detective Senior Constable Mirabito, at the conclusion of the discussion, completed a statement of facts.  73In cross-examination, Detective Senior Constable Bower said that he was taking notes during the ""off the record"" discussion.  He said that immediately after completing his notes, he commenced to prepare his statement of facts including the conversation that took place after the interview.  He completed the statement which he signed the following day.  74In her summing up, the trial judge adverted to the fact that the appellant had denied that he had made the statements attributed to him by Detective Senior Constables Bowers and Mirabito and that their evidence was not consistent with what he had actually said to them.  The trial judge gave an appropriate direction to the effect that the jury had to be satisfied the police were telling the truth about the interview and what they had recorded.  Their evidence clearly, if accepted, was relevant to the appellant's credibility.  An inference may be drawn from the verdict returned that the jury accepted the evidence of the police officers.  75The Crown contended that the circumstantial evidence adduced connected the appellant to the robbery.  It relied upon the CCTV footage (Exhibit E), the evidence of the lay witnesses who gave evidence as to the events following the robbery including that referred to above, the finding of the pink glove (Exhibit AK) and the balaclava as well as the items belonging to the appellant found in the Holden Commodore.  The Crown, in particular, relied upon the results of DNA analysis concerning the jacket, the pink glove, the balaclava and the CCTV image of the appellant at the Quix Service Station.  76It was, the Crown contended, the cumulative effect of the evidence that had to be assessed and, when assessed, the jury's verdict was a reasonable one and available to it on the evidence.  77The trial judge, it was noted, gave the jury an appropriate caution as to the approach to be taken to the abovementioned evidence given by police officers.  Appellant's submissions  78On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted:-  (1) That the Crown case was ""simplistic"" and relied on what was referred to as a superficial application of DNA tests.  In this respect it was contended, ""It is clear the expert was unable to confirm when the DNA was deposited.  It is clear that there are a number of potential participants in the robbery, apart from the appellant, including Sam and Individual A"" .  (2) That the appellant gave a version ""... which could be quite true"" .  That version, it was argued, would have explained how the DNA material came to be deposited and, furthermore, it was a version that the Crown could not disprove. ""Sam"" did not give evidence, nor did the person whose DNA matched the Individual A profile.  (3) At no time did the appellant admit his involvement and denied his involvement.  (4) That there are a number of potential participants in the robbery apart from the appellant, ""Sam"" and ""Individual A"" referred to in the ""Individual A profile"" .  (5) The DNA testing revealed that another person had (at some time) worn the gloves.  (6) That at least two (or more) person's DNA had been present on the balaclava.  (7) ""Individual A"" was described in the expert report of Ms Friedman as a contributor in relation to the balaclava and that person's DNA was also said to have been found on the ski gloves found in the unidentified vehicle (not being the pink glove) and on a black anorak.  (8) It must have been possible for ""Sam"" to have been wearing the pink glove (if that glove had, in fact been worn at the robbery).  (9) It was unclear that the pink glove found in the ""unidentified"" vehicle was actually used in the robbery.  (10) The Crown case relied upon the evidence of Mr McDonald as confirming that the pink glove was worn in the robbery.  That evidence was asserted to have been weak on the point and the CCTV evidence is unclear as to what glove was worn.  79It was submitted that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt and returned a verdict of not guilty.  80Mr G I Foster of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, in addressing Ground 2, analysed the evidence in support of the Crown case relied upon to prove that it was the appellant who was a participant in the robbery.  Insofar as the Crown case was a circumstantial evidence case, the submissions focussed attention upon what Mr Foster referred to as the ""linking process"" .  This included the following:-  (1) The CCTV footage recording of the robbery (Exhibit E).  Of the two robbers shown, the Crown case was that the second of them was the appellant.  The CCTV footage displayed the two men undertaking the robbery, one wearing particular items (including an item intended to disguise identity) and the other with a darker jacket and what appeared to be a rifle and some ski gloves.  (2) The second link was said to be the police locating the Holden Apollo in which various items were located including the pink glove, other gloves and the black balaclava and stocking.  (3) A third link was the evidence based upon DNA analysis given by Ms Friedman (Exhibit AU).  In that respect, submissions focussed attention on the items being the ski gloves, a black anorak and a ""David and Goliath"" jumper and a white baseball cap.  81Mr Foster submitted that there was no proof that the balaclava was, in fact, used in the robbery, as the CCTV footage was unclear.  It was said that there were a number of witnesses who identified the first robber as wearing the balaclava but whether it was the balaclava in question was in doubt and, assuming that it was, there were other people who had also contributed to the DNA on the balaclava including the individual referred to as ""Mr A"" who had been identified as having worn a black anorak at some time.  82Mr Foster continued:-  ""So what our submission is so far ... is... (that) the only linking DNA from my client is found in the balaclava and in the pink gloves found in the Apollo, both of which were worn by other people, unidentified other people, one of whom emerges wearing the gloves and the anorak as well as the black balaclava.""  83Mr Foster acknowledged that the Crown case at trial was that it was the appellant who wore the balaclava and that the DNA material found on it was evidence of that fact.  Similarly, the Crown case was built upon the proposition that it was the appellant who was wearing the gloves as depicted in the CCTV footage again by reason of the matching DNA material.  84Mr Foster added (transcript 11 May 2011, p.11):-  ""We say the problem with that sort of analysis is this, it really ignores the possibility, well not the possibility, and what is evident from the finding by the expert that there was somebody else, if not more than one person who wore both items, in particular, individual A who has been shown as having deposited DNA on the balaclava which the Crown asserted was worn by my client during the robbery.  The black anorak was also worn which we say can be observed from the CCTV footage, and also the gloves ...""  85Mr Foster then observed that the CCTV footage revealed that there was a person, an unidentified male, who was one of the robbers (unidentified male ""A"").  It was said that he was shown to have deposited DNA on the black balaclava and it may well have been that it was individual male ""A"" who wore the black balaclava.  86Mr Foster further submitted (transcript, 11 May 2011, p.11):-  ""Now, that is either accepted as being the case, or if it is accepted as being a real possibility, then the Crown case which was put to the jury on the basis that it was Mr Hamed who wore the black balaclava and the gloves, robber number 2, we say is significantly weakened.""  87Mr Foster contended that an examination of the CCTV footage indicated that there was a person who was not the appellant who had something dark on his face and the contention for the appellant was that that, by reason of ""eyeholes"" , indicated that that person was wearing a balaclava.  The second robber, it was contended, was not wearing any sort of balaclava on his face but perhaps a stocking.  88In the course of oral submissions, Mr Foster acknowledged that there was, however, evidence at trial that the second man seen in the CCTV footage was wearing a balaclava (transcript, 11 May 2011, p.12).  Mr Foster also accepted that there was evidence before the jury that the second robber was said to have been wearing a black balaclava as well as pink gloves (transcript, p.12).  89Mr Foster also properly accepted that the rational alternative explanation relied upon by the appellant at trial in answer to the Crown's circumstantial evidence case depended upon the jury accepting him as a witness of truth.  On the basis of the verdict returned, the jury clearly did not accept his account.  Crown submissions  90On behalf of the Crown it was submitted that, on an assessment of the whole of the evidence, the jury's verdict was a reasonable one and available to it on the evidence.  91The jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses.  In particular, it had the benefit of assessing the evidence given by the appellant.  The directions by the trial judge, it was submitted, emphasised the need for the jury to adopt a proper approach in relation to ""reliability issues"" in the trial and that no criticism had been made in relation to the trial directions.  92The Crown's written submissions set out in some detail the relevant evidence which supported the Crown case.  It is not necessary here to reproduce to any extent the evidence as summarised in those submissions as the central factual matters have been identified above.  93The Crown submissions also set out the relevant principles to be applied in relation to an appeal on the ground that a verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported.  Those principles, as the Crown observed, were set out in the judgment of Whealy JA in CW v R [2011] NSWCCA 45 at [96] to [98].  In accordance with them, the Crown submitted that, on an assessment of the whole of the evidence, the jury's verdict was a verdict that was both available on the evidence and was a reasonable verdict.  94The Crown, accordingly, submitted (on the assumption that leave were granted) that the appeal against conviction must fail and that the appeal should be dismissed.  Consideration  95The central issue is the contention in Ground 2 that the verdict was unreasonable, unsafe, unjust or dangerous was whether the appellant was one of the robbers.  96I have earlier referred in paragraphs [37] and [44] to the principles by which this Court is to assess and determine an unreasonable verdict ground.  Accordingly, in relation to Ground 2, this Court is to undertake an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence in order to determine whether the verdict of guilty was supported by the evidence.  97It was contended that the only DNA evidence that linked the appellant was the DNA material on the balaclava and the pink glove found in the Holden Apollo, both of which were said to have been worn by other (unidentified) people.  98The trial judge in her summing up gave directions in relation to circumstantial evidence and, in particular, directions in relation to the DNA evidence including:-  Â· The evidence that the DNA material on the pink glove and on the balaclava matched the appellant's DNA profile.  The evidence, it was noted, was to be considered in conjunction with the items that were shown on the CCTV footage.  Â·  The fact that the appellant's personal belongings were found in the Holden Commodore being a phone, keys, ID and a change of clothes.  99The evidence of the presence of DNA material (in particular, the pink glove and the balaclava) which matched the profile of the appellant clearly had significant probative value unless the evidence given by the appellant which was directed to explaining how the DNA material became deposited on the particular items was accepted.  His evidence, as earlier observed, in that respect depended upon his credibility.  There was an amount of evidence that was adverse to his truthfulness and reliability as a witness.  100In determining Ground 2, the issue as to whether the verdict of a jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported on the evidence requires a consideration of both the evidence and the application of the well-established principles to which reference has been made above.  101The issue raised by the appellant as to the circumstances in which the DNA material found its way onto the pink glove and the balaclava depended upon the jury's acceptance of his evidence.  In that respect, it is apparent that the jury rejected his evidence and there was in evidence, in my opinion, a sound basis upon which it was open to them to do so.  102The jury had the advantage of hearing and seeing the appellant and police officers in evidence and being cross-examined.  The account given by the appellant as to his off the record discussions with Detective Senior Constables Bowers and Mirabito after the recorded interview finished was, in my view, a highly implausible one.  103As the Crown observed in its written submissions, specific directions were given by the trial judge to the jury that they were required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the police officers were telling the truth about the interview and what they recorded.  The jury were told that they were to examine the evidence closely.  104I am of the opinion that, upon an assessment of the whole of the evidence, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty.  That assessment has been made upon a consideration of the evidence in the Crown case and the appellant's evidence, including his evidence as to the circumstances said to have explained how his DNA material became deposited on the balaclava and pink glove.  The jury's rejection of his evidence can only have been upon the basis that the jury disbelieved him.  There was ample evidence for such disbelief.  105The circumstantial evidence case brought against the appellant was, in my assessment, a very strong one.  This was not a case, in my opinion, which depended upon alleged discrepancies, inadequacies or tainted evidence.  Unless the jury had been prepared to accept the appellant's explanation as to how his DNA material had been deposited on the balaclava and gloves, the evidence derived from the DNA analysis was very cogent evidence that incriminated the appellant.  When so considered along with the other evidence in the Crown case, the guilty verdict returned by the jury could hardly have been a surprising outcome.  106I return to the issue as to whether the appellant requires leave to argue Ground 2, insofar as it involves a question of fact.  107In Rasic (supra), the appellants were each charged with an offence of robbery in company under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act and two of the appellants were also charged on three counts of obtaining a valuable thing by deception under s.178BA(1) of the Crimes Act .  108In the course of its judgment, the Court observed that the ground of appeal relied upon did not involve ""a question of law alone"" .  As a result, the appellants were to be treated as applicants for leave to appeal against conviction:  s.5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act .  Johnson J, with whom Basten JA and Hulme J agreed, observed that a ground which involves a mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law alone and that the statutory requirement of leave to appeal should not be treated as a mere formality.  109I have determined that leave to appeal should be granted in respect of Ground 2, but that, on the bases discussed above, the appeal should be dismissed.  (3) Application for leave to appeal against sentence  110The application for leave to appeal against sentence was argued upon the basis that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  111As earlier noted, the applicant was sentenced to a total term of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 11 May 2009 and expiring on 10 May 2014.  112In the written submissions on behalf of the applicant, it was noted that the amount of cash alleged to have been taken in the robbery was in the region of $9,000 which, it was contended, was not an excessively large amount.  113In her remarks on sentence, the trial judge observed that the maximum penalty of 20 years for an offence under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act reflected the seriousness of the offence.  114In evaluating the objective seriousness of the offence, the trial judge, in particular, took into account:-  Â· That the offence involved a fair amount of planning.  Â· It was committed in company.  Â· It was committed whilst the applicant was on parole for robbery.  115In evaluating objective seriousness, the trial judge observed:-  ""... I take into account the fact that this offender had a knife.  There was a potential harm to the public, being in a public place and it seems to me there is a substantial criminality which would take this matter above the mid-range of objective seriousness, but not within the high range, in my view.""  116Mr Foster initially argued that the sentencing judge ought not to have taken into account the fact of a knife being held thus occasioning a potential harm to the public, as to do so would contravene the principle in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389.  It was said that this was by reason of the fact that the use of a knife could have supported a charge under s.97(2) or an alternative charge under s.97(1) of robbery being armed with an offensive weapon.  117The submission was:-  ""4. Therefore, although a knife would be aggravating, it should have been disregarded for the purposes of sentence.""  118In the course of oral submissions, Mr Foster ultimately accepted that it is difficult to see how the sentencing judge could be said to have increased the sentence imposed by virtue of the fact that the applicant held a knife (t.22).  Mr Foster also appeared to accept that her Honour was entitled in determining the gravity of the offence to have regard to his possession of the knife (t.23).  119In reply, the Crown submitted that a sentencing judge is entitled to take into account circumstances of aggravation proved by the evidence.  For that proposition, the Court relied upon the judgment of this Court in R v Li (CCA unreported, 9 July 1997).  The Crown further submitted that any circumstance of aggravation must be proved beyond reasonable doubt and that there was no issue in this case that the second robber, alleged to have been the applicant, was carrying a knife.  120In Li (supra), the applicant had been charged with one count of break and enter in circumstances of special aggravation in breach of s.112(3) of the Crimes Act .  It had been argued that the sentencing judge, (then) Howie DCJ, erred in taking into account circumstances of aggravation, beyond those raised in the indictment.  Abadee J, with whom Studdert J agreed, held that the sentencing judge was correct to take into account as aggravating features that the applicant was in the company of another person, deprived the victim of his liberty and knew that the victim was in his home immediately before the offence was committed.  121It was held that the taking of these circumstances into account did not breach the principle in De Simoni (supra), it being observed that the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account those circumstances of aggravation which applied to the case as they would not have ""warranted a conviction for a more serious offence"" .  122The Crown submitted that, in assessing the objective gravity of the offence, the trial judge was entitled to take into account the fact that the applicant had a knife and that there was potential harm to the public in a public place.  123Mr Foster properly accepted during the course of oral submissions that, whilst the trial judge referred to the fact of the presence of the knife, there was no reference to it in a way that suggested that it became or was used as a factor that operated on the sentence as opposed to it being part of a recitation of the facts.  Consideration  124An offence under s.97(1) carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  There is no prescribed standard non-parole period.  However, the sentencing judge was required to identify the relevant factors bearing upon the objective gravity of the offence.  As indicated above, her Honour did identify them.  125I do not accept that the sentencing judge took into account the fact that the applicant held a knife as an aggravating factor contravened the De Simoni (supra) principle.  Whilst it is accepted that a sentencing judge, in imposing sentence, may not have regard to a circumstance of aggravation which should have been charged in the indictment if it was intended that reliance should be placed upon it, read in their entirety, I consider that the sentencing judge took the use of a knife into account only as one aspect of the assessment of objective seriousness, but not in a way that contravened the abovementioned principle.  126One aggravating matter was the fact that, at the time of committing the subject offence, the applicant was on parole for a robbery offence for which he was sentenced on 22 November 2007.  127The sentencing judge also had regard to relevant subjective factors including the applicant's age, his experience in Lebanon and the report from Dr Yolande Lucire together with a pre-sentence report.  128The applicant had been convicted of armed robbery, robbery in company and kidnapping in 2005 and an offence of assault and robbery in 2007.  The sentencing judge referred to the principle that the history of prior offences permitted little leniency in relation to sentencing for the subject offence.  129The sentencing judge found special circumstances by reason of the applicant's continuing rehabilitation directed to addressing his drug problems and as well his psychological need for treatment and the fact that he would be required to be in protective custody or, at least, in circumstances of non-association whilst in custody.  130The applicant has not, in my opinion, established any latent or patent error in relation to the sentence imposed.  Further, the appellant has not, in my opinion, established that the sentence was either unreasonable or plainly unjust: R v Dinsdale (2002) 202 CLR 321 at 325.  131I am of the opinion that no lesser sentence is warranted in law:  s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act .  132I propose the following orders:-  (1) Appeal against conviction dismissed.  (2) Leave to appeal against sentence granted.  (3) The appeal against sentence dismissed.  133PRICE J:   I agree with Hall J.

		30 September 2011",2011-09-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2757950,FB v Regina; Regina v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217,"Judgment 

FB v Regina 

1WHEALY JA : There are two appeals before the court. The first is an appeal by FB (""the appellant"") against his conviction on 23 July 2010, in relation to one count of aggravated sexual assault pursuant to section 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 . The trial proceeded as a judge alone trial before his Honour Judge Lakatos DCJ. The second appeal is brought by the Crown in relation to the sentence imposed by his Honour on 11 November 2010, following upon the appellant's conviction. In this appeal, the Crown asserts that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly inadequate. 

2Before considering the appeals, I should point out and reinforce that there are, as will be apparent, suppression orders in force in relation to the names of certain persons involved in each of the appeals. 

Appeal against conviction 

3As I have said, the appellant was convicted upon an indictment that alleged one count of aggravated sexual assault. The circumstances of aggravation relied upon were first the fact that, at the time of the offence in August 2006, the complainant, SE, was under the age of 16 (she being fourteen years of age at the time), and secondly that she was under the authority of the appellant by reason of him being the headmaster of the school she was attending. 

An overview of the trial 

4Shortly stated, the evidence was that, at the time of the offence in August 2006, SE was a pupil in Year 8 at a private school in Grafton. The appellant was the school principal for that educational institution. In August 2006, SE had been having difficulties in her relationship with her family. As a result, her parents consulted with the appellant, having regard to his position as her headmaster. The appellant suggested that SE should come and stay with him and his family for some ""time out"" from the family situation. Arrangements were then made for SE to spend two weeks with the appellant and his family, and she did so between 16 th and 31 August 2006. 

5After returning home from school one afternoon during this fortnightly stay, the appellant gave SE two tablets. He told her they were Panadol. She took one of the tablets because she had a headache. As a consequence of the ingestion of this tablet, she fell asleep very shortly after, while still dressed in her school uniform. The next thing she remembered was waking up in her nightdress, lying on the bed with the appellant on top of her. He was engaging in penile vaginal sex with her. The appellant told the complainant to ""just be quiet and lie there"". She screamed for him to stop, but he continued, holding her down by the arms. At the time of the incident, SE was a virgin. 

6In June 2009, the complainant wrote a document which was later termed by the trial judge, ""the letter of complaint"". This was handed to a police officer around that time. In the letter, she referred to instances of inappropriate touching at school by the appellant, and then went on to say (in relation to her stay at his house):- 

On the first week I had my period, but on the second week he raped me. 

7On 16 September 2009, the complainant was interviewed by police in the presence of a DoCS officer. The interview was recorded and played as her evidence-in-chief at the trial. At page 30 of the interview, she had provided more detail of the principal incident:- 

I think it was this week, a week, I'm not actually sure but he packed my lunch one day and he gave me a bottle of water that was really, really salty. And I didn't drink that day, but when I came home I had a headache, but I didn't tell him. And he came up to me and said, ""Do you want some Panadol?"" And I said, yes, because it was hurting. And he gave me two tablets and they weren't Panadol. I had one of them, and I can't swallow tablets, so I chewed Panadol. And I know it wasn't that, so I only took one of them. And then, in about probably 10, 5, 10 minutes, I was actually asleep. When I woke up he was raping me. 

8The appellant was spoken to by Detective Senior Constable Farrell on 12 October 2009. He effectively declined to be interviewed, but did say:- 

But I just want to tell you I did nothing to her. Nothing at all. 

9Consistently with this statement, the appellant's case throughout trial was that, whilst SE had stayed with the appellant and his family, no such incident as she described had occurred. Indeed, his case was that he would have been incapable of engaging in sexual intercourse at the time by reason of certain injuries to his stomach as a result of an infected post-operative wound. 

10The trial judge's findings and the ultimate conviction imposed necessarily proceeded on the basis that the appellant's version of the incident had been rejected. 

Grounds of appeal 

11There were a number of grounds of appeal originally filed, although two were abandoned prior to the appeal hearing. The grounds ultimately relied on were as follows:- 

Ground 1: The trial judge erred in admitting the tendency evidence of a witness, MD, pursuant to section 97 of the Evidence Act . 

Ground 3: The trial judge failed to take into account matters adverse to the credibility of the complainant in accepting her evidence. 

Ground 4: Excessive judicial questioning created a real danger that the trial was unfair. 

Ground 5A: There was a miscarriage of justice due to the failure by the legal representatives of the appellant to adduce evidence of the specific contents of media reports relating to the witness, MD. 

Ground 6: The verdict was unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence. 

12Grounds 1 and 5A are related. I shall deal with them together. I shall deal with each of the remaining grounds separately. 

The tendency evidence 

13On 26 May 2010, the appellant was arraigned before the trial judge. The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge I have identified earlier. Thereupon, the trial judge embarked upon a pre-trial hearing of an application by the Crown to admit the evidence of a young woman ""MD"" as tendency evidence. Before his Honour for the purpose of the application was a statement of SE dated 17 September 2009, and the Record of Interview. The statement of MD dated 14 December 2009 was admitted without objection on the voir dire as Exhibit 2. It was common ground that the appellant had pleaded guilty before North DCJ in November 2009 to 5 counts of sexual intercourse with MD contrary to section 73 of the Crimes Act 1900. The argument proceeded before the trial judge on the next day, 27 May 2010. On 28 May 2010, his Honour made a determination in favour of the Crown in relation to the proposed tendency evidence. His Honour stated (at page 19 of his Honour's reasons):- 

[The evidence] discloses that he has a tendency for having a sexual desire for underaged girls who are his pupils or were his pupils and were under his care and he acted upon such sexual desire by providing them with drugs and thereafter taking advantage of them. 

14The trial judge held that the evidence was relevant and that it did disclose a tendency and that it had ""significant probative value"". In that regard, his Honour said (at page 20):- 

I have gone through in some detail the comparison between MD's evidence and that of the complainant's. In my view the vast majority of what is disclosed is, to use the old formula, a striking similarity between both accounts and accordingly in my opinion by reason of that similarity, there is a significant probative value to MD's evidence. 

15His Honour also determined that the probative value of the tendency evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect which it might have on the accused. In those circumstances, the ruling was that the Crown would be permitted to tender the statement of MD in the trial. 

16Following this ruling, the trial proper commenced. The Crown made a brief opening. The evidence of the complainant, SE, was taken by way of closed-circuit television from a remote location. The DoCS interview, to which I have made earlier reference, was played as her evidence-in-chief at the trial. Her evidence, including cross-examination, continued up to and including 1 June 2010. The complainant's mother gave evidence on 2 and 3 June 2010. On 8 June 2010, MD's mother gave evidence, and then later in the day, MD herself was called and gave both evidence-in-chief and was cross-examined. MD's evidence-in-chief generally accorded with the contents of the statement that had been before the trial judge on the earlier voir dire application. The nature of her evidence was summarised in the Crown submission in this appeal, and no objection has been taken to its accuracy. In general terms, the evidence was as follows:- 

MD went to the same school as SE in Grafton when the appellant was the school principal. MD was two years older. In December 2007 when she was 16 years old, she was staying with the appellant and his family at his home for a week. MD woke one morning with a headache. The appellant gave her a glass of water and two round tablets and told her to take them because they would make her feel better. MD believed that the tablets were Panadol. After taking the tablets, the appellant told her to lie down. MD then lay down and fell asleep shortly afterwards. The next thing she remembered was waking up with her pyjama shorts pulled down and the appellant licking her vagina. MD was shocked. The appellant then took her pants off and got on top of her and had sexual intercourse with her by putting his penis in her vagina. Later that day the appellant told MD it was her fault and that she had caused him to do it and if she told anybody that would hurt his family and they would probably kill him. MD said that the appellant had sex with her several times in different parts of the house over the next week whilst she was staying there. 

17The appellant's case at trial (in relation to the MD incident) was that he agreed that he had performed oral sex on MD and also had sexual intercourse on the first occasion. He denied, however, that she was initially asleep and that he had given her pills. The appellant admitted further acts of sexual intercourse with MD during the following week, but claimed that all sexual acts were consensual. He agreed he had pleaded guilty to the charges relating to his activities with MD. 

18Following the close of the Crown case, Mr Webb (trial counsel for the appellant) re-agitated the possible rejection of the tendency evidence. These submissions essentially revisited the issues of concoction, contamination and the extent of probative value raised during the pre-trial argument. The trial judge was not persuaded by these submissions and, on 8 June 2010, he reaffirmed that the views he had expressed in his earlier judgment remained substantially as they had been. He once again rejected the submission that the evidence demonstrated ""any realistic prospect of concoction raised between MD and SE"". 

19Thereafter, the accused gave evidence and witnesses were called on his behalf. Submissions were made on 28 June 2010 and the accused was, as I have earlier indicated, convicted on 23 July 2010. 

Submissions of the appellant - tendency evidence 

20The submissions of the appellant do not suggest that the trial judge made any error in relation to his understanding and application of the correct legal principles applicable to sections 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 . Rather, the submission was made by Mr Newton (who appeared for the appellant on the appeal) that the ultimate findings made by his Honour were not open to him. First, Mr Newton submited that the two sets of allegations (those made by the complainant and those made by MD) were not sufficiently similar to allow the admission of MD's evidence. Alternatively, counsel submitted that, if his first submission were not accepted, the evidence of MD should not have been admitted having regard to the operation of section 101 of the Evidence Act because, on the material before the trial judge, there was a real possibility of concoction or contamination of the complainant's evidence ( Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 296). 

21The admission of tendency evidence is governed by the Evidence Act , sections 97 and 101. Those section provide, relevantly: 

97 The tendency rule 
(1)Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 

(a)the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and 


(b)the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 

... 

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 
(1)This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 

(2)Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 

22The appellant's first argument under this heading is that it was not open the trial judge to find that the evidence possessed ""significant probative value"". 

Probative value of evidence is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 as ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"". 

23It is clear law that evidence that a person has or had a particular tendency is adduced in order to render more probable the proposition that, on a particular occasion relevant to the proceedings, the person acted in a particular way or had a particular state of mind. The section proceeds on the basis of inferential reasoning that people behave consistently in similar situations. The evidence is used to provide a foundation for an inference to that effect. As Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) in R v Chittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; 189 A Crim R 492 stated:- 

Tendency evidence is tendered to prove (by inference), that because, on a particular occasion, a person acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind), that person, on an occasion relevant to the proceedings, acted in a particular way (or had a particular state of mind). 

24More often than not, in a criminal trial, tendency evidence is placed before the jury as evidence tending to prove the guilt of the accused. However, evidence may be offered simply to show a tendency to act in a particular way, not necessarily in a criminal manner. Indeed, it is not necessary that the tendency to commit a particular crime or, for that matter, to commit a crime at all. Section 97 applies to both civil and criminal proceedings. It represents a fresh start in relation to the issues involved in the categories of evidence known historically as propensity evidence and similar fact evidence. To assess whether evidence is capable of being admitted as tendency evidence, it is first necessary to consider the issues at trial, and the likely probative force of the evidence, having regard to those issues ( Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461). 

25In the present matter, the trial judge correctly recognised that, in order for MD's evidence to have significant probative value as required by section 97, the Crown had to establish that the evidence possessed a degree of relevance to the events charged, such that it could be said that it was ""important or of consequence"" ( R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702). The trial judge identified the relevant fact in issue in the trial. This was whether or not SE had been subjected to the appellant's sexual activity in the way she had asserted. 

26In R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306, Campbell JA (with whom Howie and Rothman JJ agreed) said at [125]:- 

In my view there is no need for there to be a ""striking pattern of similarity between the incidents"". All that is necessary is that the disputed evidence should make more likely, to a significant standard, the facts that make up the elements of the offence charged. In my view it meets that test. 

27In a more recent decision of BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303, Hodgson JA (with whom Price and Fullerton JJ agreed) at [108] stated:- 

It is not necessary in criminal cases that the incidents relied on as evidence of the tendency be closely similar to the circumstances of the alleged offence, or that the tendency be a tendency to act in a way (or to have the state of mind) that is closely similar to the act or state of mind alleged against the accused; or that there be a striking pattern of similarity between the incidents relied on and what is alleged against the accused: Ford at [38], [125], PWD at [64] - [65]. However, generally the closer and more particular the similarities, the more likely it is that the evidence will have significant probative value. 

28In the present trial, his Honour recognised that the matter was not to be determined by applying the ""old formula"", namely whether there was a ""striking similarity"", but nevertheless found it useful to identify the similarities and differences. The similarities, he thought, were marked. They were:- 


The age of the girls: MD was 16 years old; SE was fourteen; 
The timing of the offence in each case: MD in December 2007; SE in August 2006; 
The appellant was the principal at the school of both young girls; 
All the alleged offences occurred at the residence of the appellant; 
The appellant had in each case attempted some close contact with each girl on an earlier separate occasion before the occurrence of the offence; 
In both instances, the appellant gave the girls two tablets which looked like Panadol; 
Both MD and SE described falling asleep after consuming the tablets; 
Both MD and SE said that, when they woke up, the appellant was carrying out a sexual act upon them; 
While the wording used was different in each case, the appellant prevailed upon each girl not to tell other people what had happened. 

29At the same time, the trial judge noted that there were differences. There was a difference, for example, in age between the two girls; MD had said that the appellant had not used a condom while SE said he had; the different type of sexual act the appellant was carrying out when each girl initially woke up. His Honour was alert to these differences, although in the case of the last one he noted that there was no need for identical sexual acts to be carried out in order for the evidence to be admissible as tendency evidence (see R v Smith (2008) 190 A Crim R 8 at [17]; R v Fletcher (2005) 156 A Crim R 308 at [67]). 

30In my view, it was clearly open to his Honour to find, as he did, that the evidence of MD made it significantly more likely that the appellant had carried out the acts alleged by SE, as the Crown case asserted. Plainly, there will be cases (as his Honour recognised here) where the similarities are so overwhelming as to amount to what, in pre- Evidence Act days, was called ""similar fact evidence"", that is evidence showing a ""striking similarity"" between the acts alleged. It was open to his Honour in the present matter to conclude that the conduct described by MD was sufficiently similar to the allegation made by SE to have significant probative value in showing the relevant tendency. The tendency itself had a high level of probative force, in the sense that it could, to a significant extent, bear on the issue as to whether the alleged sexual assault, with all its particular features, had been carried out by the appellant upon the complainant. In my opinion, the first argument must fail. 

31The second argument advanced by Mr Newton related to section 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 . Where evidence has been properly classified as tendency evidence, and has passed the hurdle in section 97, it is next necessary in a criminal trial to assess whether the evidence should be excluded, having regard to the provisions of section 101 of the Evidence Act . The test is whether the admission of the evidence involves a risk of an unfair trial ( R v RM [2005] NSWCCA 413; R v Ford at [58]). As McHugh J stated in Pfenning at [40]:- 

The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial. 

32In HML v R; SB v R; OAE v R (2008) 235 CLR 334, (a case of relationship evidence), Gleeson CJ remarked that the reason for exclusion of propensity evidence was not related principally to its relevance or irrelevance, but rather because of its prejudicial effect, that is the danger of improper use of the evidence. As Gleeson CJ remarked:- 

It is the risk that evidence of propensity will be taken by a jury to prove too much that the law seeks to guard against. 

33As I have stated above, the statutory test is that the evidence must be excluded unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. Mr Newton argued that the evidence ought to have been rejected because his Honour should have found that there was ""a real possibility of concoction and contamination"". 

34In Hoch v R , Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ stated at 297:- 

Thus, in our view, the admissibility of similar fact evidence in cases such as the present depends on that evidence having the quality that it is not reasonably explicable on the basis of concoction. That is a matter to be determined, as in all cases of circumstantial evidence, in the light of common sense and experience. It is not a matter that necessarily involves an examination on a voir dire . If the depositions of witnesses in committal proceedings or the statements of witnesses indicate that the witnesses had no relationship with each other prior to the making of the various complaints, and that is unchallenged, then assuming the requisite degree of similarity, common sense and experience will indicate that the evidence bares that probative force which renders it admissible. On the other hand, if the depositions of the statements indicate that the complainants have a sufficient relationship to each other and had opportunity and motive for concoction, then, as a matter of common sense and experience, the evidence will lack the degree of probative value necessary to render it admissible. Of course there may be cases where an examination on the voir dire is necessary, but that will be for the purpose of ascertaining the facts relevant to the circumstances of the witnesses to permit an assessment of the probative value of the evidence by reference to the consideration whether, in the light of common sense and experience, it is capable of reasonable explanation on the basis of concoction. It will not be for the purpose of the trial judge making a preliminary finding whether there was or was not concoction. 

35It necessary to bear in mind that Hoch was concerned with the admission of similar fact evidence under the common law, and propounded the ""no other rational view"" test that had been adopted in Pfenning at 482-483 by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ. This, of course, is not the test for the admission of tendency or coincidence evidence under the Evidence Act : R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700. Nonetheless, it could not have been said to have been an error for the trial judge in the present matter to approach the matter on the basis he did, namely to explore whether there was material that indicated there was a real chance of concoction having occurred. Mr Newton did not suggest otherwise. His Honour correctly identified, however, that there must be a real chance, rather than a merely a speculative chance, of concoction ( BP v R; R v BP at [110]; R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [111]). 

36In his initial interlocutory judgment, the trial judge gave considerable attention to the statements of SE and MD that were before him. In the later ruling, he had regard to the actual evidence he had heard in the trial. His Honour noted, in both decisions, that mere contact or the possibility of contact does not, in itself, necessarily lead to an indication of a real chance of concoction. Overall, his Honour was satisfied that, on the whole of the material before him, at the time of the initial determination (and from the evidence before him in the second determination), that there was no real chance of concoction. In substance, the trial judge found that there was simply no evidence to support a finding that each girl realistically would have known about the specifics of the other's allegation. General knowledge that someone else claimed to have been ""abused"" did not, of itself, raise the real possibility of concoction. 

37There were essentially two separate strands to the appellant's argument before this court. There was a degree of overlap, of course, but the basic dichotomy was between concoction on the one hand and contamination on the other. The ""concoction"" argument arose out of two specific matters. The first was the evidence that there had been a contact by telephone between SE and ME in late 2009. The second was the general inter-relationship between some of the young people at the school. For example, the complainant was friends with AD, and he, in turn, was the boyfriend of TB. AD was MD's brother. It was MC, the mother of AD and MD, who reported the appellant to DoCS, citing inappropriate behaviour towards the complainant. 

38The trial judge gave careful consideration to these matters and to the possibilities they raised. He concluded, however, that none of the material as to SE's friendship with either AD or TB, nor the contents of the brief telephone conversation between the two young women, raised even ""a hint of suspicion"" that there had been concoction or collusion between them. 

39MD's evidence was that she ""did not know SE very well at all"". She described her as ""an acquaintance at school"". She said she did not know her outside school and had not seen her ""in a couple of years since she left school"". She was specifically asked in her statement whether she had any contact with SE since she left school in 2007. Her answer was:- 

I have not had any contact with her at all during this time except for a couple of weeks ago. I told TB, AD's girlfriend, who was friends with SE that if she had any questions about what happens in court she could give me a ring because I know what she'd be going through. 

40During her evidence at trial, MD was asked whether, at the time she had spoken to the police, she had discussed with anyone else what she had told the police. She specifically denied ever having spoken to her brother about the allegations. Similarly, she had not discussed them with her brother's girlfriend. She repeated that she had no discussion with SE about the allegations. In fact, she had not discussed it with anyone except her sexual assault counsellor and a detective (Trial Transcript, 322). There had been the one conversation with SE, but it was confined to providing her with reassurance regarding the process of giving evidence in court. This brief conversation occurred, in fact, after MD's court case. It was in December 2009, months after the interview between SE and the police. 

41Another matter relied on by the appellant on the issue of concoction was the list of alleged inconsistencies in statements made by the complainant to various people, including AD and TB. These statements were said to be inconsistent in that they fell well short of the allegations the complainant would later make to the police. 

42The trial judge was very aware of these inconsistencies, and said (at page 15 of his reasons):- 

It may be as the complainant says that she was reticent in revealing the entirety of what she alleges occurred to her because of its traumatic effect on her and partly what the accused had told her to do. Such a situation is not outside the bounds of reasonable possibility, given that she was between 14 and 15 years of age at the relevant times. In my view, the power imbalance, if one accepts her version, between her and the accused, and the fact that she may have bowed to that imbalance is certainly not an unreasonable proposition. Accordingly I do not accept Mr Webb's submission that merely because there are prior inconsistent statements that this is evidence of a real chance of collusion or concoction. 

43In the light of the evidence before the trial judge and his careful analysis of it, it was, in my opinion, clearly open to him to make the findings he did, namely that there was no real chance of concoction. Insofar as the complainant had made inconsistent statements, in the sense that her earlier statements fell short of the complaint she ultimately made to the police and about which she gave evidence in court, this did not, in my opinion suggest concoction. Rather, if anything, it pointed in the opposite direction. Mr Newton, I consider, recognised that the argument based on ""inconsistent statements"" was really one that had greater relevance to a consideration of the overall credibility and reliability of the complainant. He was later to repeat these submissions under the heading of Ground 3. I will return to them in more detail when I consider that ground. 

44The second strand relied on by Mr Newton for his tendency argument was the suggestion that the complainant may have been ""contaminated"". By this, I understood counsel to be arguing that SE may have been exposed to articles and publicity in newspapers or magazines circulating at the time that referred to either the appellant's conduct generally, or the proceedings against him involving MD. She may, in addition, have been exposed to ""gossip"" concerning the appellant and his behaviour. The trial judge noted that he had not had the opportunity of seeing the media coverage himself, since it had not been exhibited in the course of the interlocutory proceedings. In the trial, however, there was evidence of the complainant that she had not seen or read any of this material, whatever its content. This evidence confirmed the view that the trial judge had taken in the earlier decision that there was no real prospect of contamination from that source. His Honour took a similar view on the ""gossip"" issue. 

45It is not necessary for me to traverse every single matter sought to be relied on by Mr Newton under the headings of either contamination or concoction. His Honour carefully examined all the matters which were argued before him, they generally being those matters presently raised before this court. He rejected the submission that, individually or collectively, the matters relied upon pointed to a real chance of concoction or contamination. In my opinion, it was clearly open to his Honour to make the findings that he did in this regard, and the appellant has failed to demonstrate error. There was no suggestion, particularly given that it was a judge alone trial, that the tendency evidence would be used by his Honour illogically, or in a manner unfairly connected with the issues in the trial. The evidence was cogent, as Mr Newton conceded. However, it is clear that its probative value was not outweighed by the risk that the appellant would receive an unfair trial. While the evidence was prejudicial to the appellant in the sense that it was capable of reflecting upon his guilt, that is not the prejudice of which the section speaks. Ground 1 must be rejected. 

Ground 5A - miscarriage of justice - failure of legal representatives to adduce evidence of media reports 

46In relation to this ground, the appellant tendered a media monitors print-out showing publications between 1 January 2008 and 30 November 2010, which referred to proceedings involving FB. Secondly, and more importantly, there was tendered an article under the name of Les Kennedy in the Sydney Morning Herald published on 19 April 2009. It is entitled, ""Brave Girls Pay High Price for Exposing Evil"", and relates to two young girls from Year 12 at the school who had voiced concern to other students about FB's behaviour in public towards a teenager at the school. The article also referred to the consequences for a science teacher, who, in late 2006, had complained to the Deputy Principal about FB's behaviour towards certain students. 

47The particular matter relied on by Mr Newton arose out of the fact that one of the two girls mentioned in the article was an acquaintance of the complainant. The article said that this girl, SJ, had been given detention for telling ""other girls"" she didn't like the way FB cuddled students, or the fact that he had walked around Grafton with his arm around one. The article said SJ had been expelled three days later for ""harassing and denigrating students and teachers"", according to a letter written by the then-Deputy Principal. The article also mentioned that SJ and the second girl ""blew the whistle"" on FB, who, the article said, was ""awaiting sentence after pleading guilty to sex charges"". The article continued:- 

Their warning went unchecked by the Education Department, the Department of Community Services and police from the Child Protection Unit, culminating a month later in the drugging and multiple rape of another teenage girl . In March, FB, pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual intercourse with a person in his care (my emphasis). 

The matters I have emphasised were presumably a reference to FB's conduct towards MD. 

48The ""connection"" relied on by Mr Newton in relation to this article, as I have said, was that SE ""knew"" SJ, and, in fact, had referred to her in her evidence. It is true that trial counsel for the appellant had asked some questions about SJ and they are recorded (Trial Transcript, 52) as follows:- 

Question: Was it the situation too at that time... that you knew there were investigations going on or rumours about (FB) in terms of sexual misconduct? 

Answer: All I heard was that SJ made a complaint, I didn't actually know why we were there. 

Question: Did you know what type of complaint that was? 

Answer: No, but I know she got expelled over it. 

Question: Well, she got into trouble for calling (FB) an old paedophile or something, didn't she? 

Answer: I don't know. 

Question: You didn't hear anything about that? 

Answer: Only after we were interviewed. 

Question: So you've heard about that after you were interviewed, and was that still in 2007 in the same year? 

Answer: Yep. 

Question: And so it was after the interview that you became aware that (FB) was - there was some investigations going on concerning sexual misconduct on his part with students? 

Answer: Yes. 

49There are further relevant questions and answers recorded in the transcript at page 53:- 

Question: And this question is asking you well how long after the interview and in 2007 did you become aware of these investigations and issues going on around (FB)? 

Answer: I found out what (SJ) said a few weeks after or days, rather, after the interview and then a few weeks later we found out that he'd left, he was... 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: Can I just ask you... a few weeks after the interview you found out that SJ had said something about (FB), is that so? 

Answer: Yep. 

Question: What do you understand it was that she said about (FB)? 

Answer: I was talking to my older sister because she's friends with her, and she was upset and telling Mum that her best friend got expelled for calling (FB) a paedophile and sticking her tongue out at his daughter. 


(The ""interview"" referred to in these extracts was an in-house enquiry conducted at the school in 2007 by Mr Cudmore, a solicitor. I shall refer to it in more detail later in this decision). 

Mr Newton conceded for the purposes of his argument that the evidence of the media reports would have been available at the time of the trial, and so could not constitute ""fresh evidence"". Nevertheless, counsel submitted that a miscarriage of justice arose as a result first of the failure of the legal representatives for the appellant to adduce the media material, and secondly their consequent failure to suggest to SE in cross-examination, that in the light of the Herald article, there was, as at 19 April 2009, a source from which she could have discovered that another person (ie. MD) had made allegations that she was ""drugged and raped by the appellant"". 

50(In his affidavit annexing the material, Mr Heffernan had stated that his inquiries confirmed the Sydney Morning Herald was ""available to be purchased"" in the Grafton area in April 2009). 

51Mr Newton put his argument in two ways. First, he submitted that, had the evidence of the specific article been adduced, this would have strengthened the appellant's argument in seeking to exclude the evidence of MD as tendency evidence. Because it was not so adduced, he argued, the appellant had lost a significant opportunity of an acquittal, and there was accordingly a miscarriage of justice. Alternatively, counsel submitted that, even if the contents of the article had been raised, and the evidence of MD properly permitted as tendency evidence, the evidence of the contents of the article would have assumed great importance. This was because it would have been ""cumulative upon other evidence"" that the incident involving MD was circulating around the local community. Together with the other evidence of the association between SE, MD and other persons, it would have enabled the appellant to point to a possible source from which evidence of the complainant, if concocted, may have emanated. It would have provided an innocent explanation for the otherwise ""damning evidence"" from the complainant and MD, indeed that they had both been drugged. 

52The appellant's submissions do not suggest that the ""new evidence"" that could raise a reasonable doubt as to guilt. The two limited ways in which the appellant argued that the evidence had significance were first, its capacity to bear on the tendency argument, and secondly, its general ability to enlarge the environment in which there was discussion in the Grafton area concerning the accused's aberrant sexual behaviour with at least one other person. Mr Newton frankly conceded that, unless he succeeded on his submission based on the legal incompetence of the trial lawyers, he could not carry the day on this point. That concession was properly made. In my view, it could not be said that the new evidence, taken with the other evidence at trial could raise a doubt in the court's mind that the verdict of guilty could not be allowed to stand ( Ratten v R (1974) 131 CLR 510; Mickelberg v R (1989) 167 CLR 259; R v Bikic [2002] NSWCCA 227; R v Abou-Chakake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417; R v Poole [2006] NSWCCA 93). 

53The appellant argued the point on the basis that the relevant media material had been ""passed over"" as a result of incompetence by counsel at trial. In the light of that submission, it is necessary for the appellant to establish that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, precisely because that incompetence had deprived the accused of a fair trial ( R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; 48 A Crim R 385; R v Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333; MB v R [2009] NSWCCA 200; TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124; Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; 214 ALR 1; Robert Clee v R [2009] NSWCCA 18 ). 

54In my opinion, this argument falls at the first hurdle. There is no evidence from which it could be said that the failure to obtain the newspaper article (if that is what happened) demonstrates ""flagrant incompetence"" on the part of trial counsel. Before commenting on that proposition, however, I draw attention to certain features of the article itself. First, it should be noted that MD is not named in the article. Secondly, and significantly, there is no reference in the article to the fact the girl in question reported that she had been given two white tablets (believed to be Panadol), and that these were supplied by the appellant. Thirdly, there is no mention of the fact that the girl fell asleep and when she woke up the appellant was carrying out a sexual act on her person. This level of detail - critical to the complainant's evidence - is not disclosed in the newspaper articles about the other girl's evidence at trial, and cannot be inferred from the simple use of the word ""drugging"". In any event, the complainant was clear in her evidence at trial that she had not seen articles in any newspaper or magazine concerning MD before she complained to police (Trial Transcript, 92 line 36). She had no knowledge that the allegations made by MD involved ""drugging"" (Trial Transcript, 60 line 45). 

55Quite apart from the non-specifics of the article, if its existence were in fact known to trial counsel, (and there is no evidence one way or the other that it was) it may well have been considered a tactical mistake to confront the complainant with its contents. A denial by the complainant that she had seen this specific article may well have been regarded as putting the appellant at a tactical disadvantage in the trial. As it was, there was evidence at trial that ""rumours"" were circulating, and that there was some talk of the appellant's sexual activities with a student. It may well have been thought that it was better to leave the evidence in that vague state, rather than to put something precisely to the complainant and thereby run the possible risk of an outright denial. A firm denial that she had seen this particular article may have, from a tactical perspective, put paid to the suggestion that she may have seen or heard other material, not specifically itemised. On the other hand, if, contrary to these possibilities, the existence of the article had simply been overlooked by mistake or through lack of endeavour, such a mistake, in my opinion, would not have cleared the bar so as to permit appellate intervention. In either situation, I am not satisfied that flagrant incompetence, or indeed any level of incompetence, has been demonstrated. 

56Further, I do not consider that the contents of the article would have, in any event, led the trial judge to exclude MD's evidence as tendency evidence. In my opinion, it is unlikely that the article would have altered the trial judge's carefully considered finding that there was no real possibility of either concoction or contamination. Nor would it have been likely to disturb his ultimate finding that SE was an honest and reliable witness. 

57In short, for all these reasons, I would hold that the suggested failure to adduce evidence of the article did not deprive the appellant of a chance of acquittal that was reasonably open to him. Nor, in my opinion, is there any real possibility that a material irregularity occurred at the trial, resulting in an unfair trial. There was simply no miscarriage of justice within section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 justifying this court's intervention. 

58I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Ground 3 - Failure to take into account matters adverse to the credibility of the complainant 

59Mr Newton acknowledged that this ground, if accepted, involved mixed questions of fact and law. However, counsel submitted that there was an error by the trial judge in his approach to the assessment of the complainant's credibility of such significance that it could be said to have resulted in an unfair trial. Mr Newton, in addition, submitted this ground had an additional role to play in relation to ground six, namely the assertion that the verdict itself was unreasonable. For that reason, I will give separate or further consideration to this ground when examining ground six. 

60At the moment, however, the simple submission is that, having regard to the inconsistent complaints, it was simply not open to the trial judge to conclude that he should accept the evidence given by SE. The inconsistencies relied upon may be briefly stated as follows: 

(a) The Cudmore interview. This was an interview held at the school between a solicitor for the school, the Deputy Headmaster and the complainant. There were ""rumours"" about the appellant and, as a consequence, the school arranged for an interview with a number of girls, including the complaint. In this instance, the complainant did not report that anything untoward had happened to her when she had stayed at the appellant's house in 2006. 

(b) The complainant's mother, JE, gave evidence that, after the Cudmore interview, she had asked the complainant if she had ever been ""uncomfortable"" when staying at the appellant's house. The complainant described an incident there, but it was not the act which was the subject of the ultimate charge against the appellant. The complainant herself said that she told her mother that ""nothing had happened"". 

(c) The complainant's differing ""versions"" of the incident at the appellant's house, as described by her to her friends, TB and AD. 

(d) The allegation against the appellant reported by MC (the mother of AD and MD) to DoCS, and her conversation with Constable Talei Fenn. (This allegation effectively repeated the ""version"" given by the complainant to TB and AD). 

(e) Constable Fenn's evidence as to the fact that, during her interview with the complainant in July 2008, the complainant had not told her that she had been sexually assaulted or raped by the appellant. (In her evidence at trial, the complainant insisted that she had told Constable Fenn ""essentially"" that the appellant had ""raped her""). 

(f) The complainant was interviewed by her family doctor, Dr Van der Merwe, and asked about her sexual experience. She said she was a virgin, and not sexually active. She did not, during the interview, make any reference to being sexually assaulted at any time in the past. 

61It may be convenient at the outset to examine the approach taken by the trial judge to this particular issue. First, the trial judge identified the essential ingredients of the charge brought against the appellant. He identified each of the elements which the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt in order for a determination to be made that the appellant was guilty of the offence. These included that the appellant had sexual intercourse at the specified time at the appellant's home with the complainant, and that such intercourse occurred without her consent. Secondly, the trial judge noted the defence case that the appellant contested the proposition that sexual intercourse as alleged by the complainant took place at all. 

62Thirdly, he gave himself appropriate directions in relation to the absence of complaint by SE. In this regard, he noted that the complainant had not made any precise complaint about what she claimed the accused did to her, until at the earliest she spoke to Detective Fen, or, more likely, later when she spoke to Detective Farrell at the time of the record of interview. The trial judge noted that the absence of complaint was a matter that he was entitled to take into account in assessing the credibility of the complainant's evidence as to what she said the accused did to her. 

63Fourthly, his Honour directed himself that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault might refrain from making a complaint about such as assault. In this regard, he said (at pages 7 to 8 of his reasons):- 

I have heard evidence that the complainant did not complain, particularly because she did not want her parents and in particular her mother to know of the allegations. In this context, in my view, these are the factors I ought to take into account in assessing whether she acted normally or reasonably in this regard. I have to ask myself, how would a reasonable 14-year-old girl in these circumstances react and these are the factors, in my view, that need to be taken into account in this consideration. 

64His Honour then listed a number of matters which it is not necessary to recite in detail. They included the fact that SE was in a fraught relationship with her parents, and her mother in particular; that SE had been sent by her family to stay with the appellant, to provide ""time out"" for both parties; that the appellant played the role of an honest broker or counsellor towards her; that the appellant was in a position of authority, being SE's teacher and a respected headmaster at a school in Grafton; and that there was a clear age and power disparity between the appellant and the complainant. Finally, he noted that the situation of the complainant being a ""problem child"" might well make her ""reticent about complaining"" and might lead her to have reservations about being believed, if she did complain. Against the background of those matters, his Honour said (at page 8):- 

In my view, the lack of complaint against that background is easier to understand. In my view, it is therefore unremarkable that she did not complain to the accused's family, that she did not complain to her own family or even to her friends who also attended the same school, at least until there was cause to question the accused's respected status when other allegations against him surfaced. 

65There was a further direction given by the trial judge. It was an important one. This was a direction acknowledging that determination of the issues in the trial involved ""close consideration of the one witness"", namely the complainant. His Honour noted that the guilt of the appellant was to be determined, on the Crown case, largely on the evidence of the complainant herself. His Honour said that this required that caution be exercised in relation to the acceptance of her evidence. He noted specifically that he needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was ""both honest and an accurate witness"". It was necessary for him ""to examine her evidence very carefully in order to be satisfied that it can be safely acted upon to the high standard required in a criminal trial"". 

66The trial judge then examined in considerable detail numerous statements made by the complainant to other people between August 2007 and 16 September 2009, when the complainant had engaged in a full police interview. The first of these had involved the complainant's interview in October 2007 with Mr Cudmore in the presence of the Deputy Headmaster. As I have indicated, this interview was one of a series of interviews conducted ""in-house"" at the school relating to general allegations that the appellant had been behaving inappropriately towards students at the school. A draft unsigned statement was prepared after this interview with SE. It did not refer to anything untoward happening when the complainant stayed at the appellant's house in 2006. The complainant said she did not raise the incident in the Cudmore interview because she was intimidated by the circumstances, and for other reasons. 

67The trial judge examined carefully the circumstances of the Cudmore interview and Exhibit H, which was the unsigned statement to which I have referred. His Honour said (at pages 22 - 23):- 

It should be noted in considering this exhibit that the statement was not signed by the complainant at any time. Furthermore, it was her evidence that parts of her statement were incorrect. In order to assess the significance that such a draft statement should be accorded, one needs to have regard to the circumstances in which the material was elicited from the complainant... Prior to speaking to Mr Johnson and Mr Cudmore, the complainant had been approached by the accused and spoken to about how she should conduct herself at the interview... His statement to her, according to her evidence, that nothing happened, if one is to accept her version, must have placed pressure upon her to indicate that that was the position when she was asked in the course of that interview. The power imbalance between the Principal of a school and a young girl in these circumstances is also relevant in that consideration. Next it should be remembered that the complainant had no support person in that interview. 

68His Honour also reflected upon the fact that the complainant understood that Mr Cudmore was an investigator, investigating ""unspecified complaints against the accused"". It must have been obvious to her, he said, that the complaints being investigated were not those involving the assault by the appellant upon her. His Honour observed that she said she had been ""intimidated"", and was ""locked in a room with two men"". She had indicated to the trial judge that she was far from comfortable in the situation in which she found herself. He said (pages 23 - 24):- 

She was not with people with whom she was comfortable, and in those circumstances it is highly unlikely, whatever the truth was, that she would disclose matters which were highly embarrassing and potentially highly traumatic for her. 

69The next matter dealt with by his Honour in this context was a letter written by the complainant's mother, JE, on 19 October 2007. This was, in effect, a formal complaint to the school about the manner in which JE perceived her daughter had been dealt with in the course of the interview with Mr Cudmore and the Deputy Principal. The letter contained a hand-written notation, which referred to a conversation the mother had with the appellant when he rang her on 19 October 2007. The note, in her handwriting, read (at page 24):- 

(FB) rang me. He rang and said that was bad judgement and was following lawyer's instructions. He also informed that the allegation came from an ex-teacher. 

70This conversation was elaborated upon when JE gave her evidence at trial. The particular conversation confirmed to JE that the appellant had spoken to SE before the Cudmore interview. According to the complainant, ""he said to me to tell them nothing happened"". 

71His Honour, in his examination of JE's evidence, stated (at page 45):- 

At the end of her examination, I asked (JE) to describe her relationship with her daughter. It was a matter which I then thought was relevant and still do in determining whether or not any absence of complaint was something which should reflect adversely upon (SE). ...[(JE) said that] the relationship between her and her daughter... was the least close, and that she was closer to the youngest and the oldest daughter. SE was the middle daughter. She said that before August 2006, her relationship was such that the complainant would never tell her mother anything. She was always reserved and quiet in any matter, did not matter what it was. The complainant divulged very limited information to her parents... (JE) stated in the period 2006 to 2008, the nature of the relationship between mother and daughter was that if there was something troubling the complainant, she would not come and ask for the advice of her mother. 

72The trial judge then recounted in detail JE's evidence, which included her attempts, after the Cudmore interview, to coax the complainant into telling her whether anything untoward had happened at the appellant's house. SE had told her mother (at page 44):- 

When (FB) came down to my bedroom and he sat on the edge of the bed and put his arm around me. 

SE was also asked by her mother whether there was ""anything else"" she would like to tell her, and the complainant had said ""no"". 

73In his submissions, Mr Newton argued that there was a particular significance in the fact that, when she was cross-examined by trial counsel, the complainant had denied at first that she told her mother there was ""no sexual activity involved"". However, as the transcript makes clear, at (Trial Transcript, 91 - 101), the complainant had insisted that the actual words she had used to her mother were that ""nothing happened"". In other words, she was denying she had used the expression, ""no sexual activity"". She was not denying that she told her mother ""nothing happened"". Her evidence was that she had told her mother ""nothing happened"" at FB's house, because she did not want her mother to know that she'd been raped by the appellant. 

74His Honour concluded that SE's mother's evidence confirmed that, although she had queried her daughter about her experience with the appellant, she was told that ""nothing happened"". The trial judge then recounted the competing submissions made to him at trial by the Crown Prosecutor and trial counsel for the appellant on the issue of inconsistent complaints. His Honour, in this context, gave particular emphasis to the defence submissions made concerning the range of prior inconsistent statements made by SE on the topic as to whether sexual intercourse had occurred. These included the matters stated by SE to her mother, Mr Cudmore, Dr Van der Merwer and especially to TB and AD. His Honour's analysis continued (at pages 75 to 77):- 

As I say that aspect of the case has caused me to think very hard and carefully about whether or not that ultimately destroys the credibility of the complainant. 

Ultimately, it was put that these were prior statements made in different contexts. Each was exculpatory, none can be explained by embarrassment. It is certainly true that there were prior statements made in different contexts. The theme, however, which counsel did not raise but which the complainant did, was that she did not wish to tell anybody for fear that her parents, or particularly her mother, would find out. The fact that her mother was present when the examination with Dr Van der Merwer took place was not mentioned. 

Again, the fact that she did not tell her mother seems to me is self-evident. In my view, that was a common and explicable theme. As I have said earlier, it found resonance in the explanation given by MD in the events which occurred to that particular young person... 

In terms of the lack of complaint, I have reviewed the evidence of the complainant and the way in which she spoke to different people. As I have said earlier, her lack of complaint in my view has a reasonable explanation having regard to the following matters: her fraught relationship with her mother and her parents, the position of power of the accused and his position of respect as the headmaster and mentor, not only to her, but to other families and/or troubled families under his control, making it less easy for a fourteen-year-old to have confidence that any serious complaint she made would be accepted. It was only when the accused's reputation was publicly called into question by the surfacing of other complaints that the complainant divulged what had occurred. 

Next, her version about her periods have prevented the assault was in its limited (way) not inaccurate. It ultimately gave an inaccurate impression if it was designed to suggest that that was all that occurred. As I have indicated, it is consistent with what she alleged that occurred in the first week that she was there. And as I say, in the context of her reticence to complain and an embarrassment about the subject matter, in my view it is understandable that a fourteen-year-old might raise enough to, as it were, to wave the red flag but not go into the gruesome detail with both her family, friends and others. 

As I have also indicated in reviewing the evidence, although the complainant ultimately agreed with the proposition that she affirmatively told people that no sexual activity took place, when her precise words are examined, no such affirmative proposition in her own words to the various people to whom she complained is made out. The issue was ""and nothing happened"". It was put at that level of generality and it seems to me even thought that was not a completely accurate statement by her, it is not an affirmative position that she said ""no I was not sexually assaulted"". She simply did not go to that point. 

I have no doubt that any reasonable listener, including TB and AD or any other person listening to what she did say, would assume that the lesser version was the high point of her complaint, namely that her periods had saved her from anything worse, and that is a reasonable assumption, but in my view, given the constraints as I have indicated the complainant was under at that point in time, I am dissuaded that this makes her a dishonest witness about that matter. 

75The trial judge then examined with care the evidence of the appellant himself. (Earlier his Honour had indicated that he accepted the evidence of MD as to the nature of the sexual incidents perpetrated upon her by the appellant). His Honour, after considering all the evidence, came to the conclusion that the appellant had an unhealthy sexual interest in both MD and SE. He was unimpressed with the evidence of the appellant. He found that, in 2006 and 2007, he had a sexual interest in young girls in his care. He also held that the appellant had given evidence ""in a calculated manner"". The trial judge gave detailed reasons for his conclusions in that regard. Indeed, he found the evidence to be, on a number of occasions, ""exaggerated, self-serving and in some cases given reluctantly"". He was unimpressed by the defence assertion that the appellant would not have been able to commit an act of sexual intercourse upon SE because of the pain and the difficulties associated with the infection following his stomach surgery. His Honour pointed out, with some force, that the appellant had been able to climb in and out of a boat, and also to manage the flying and landing of light aircraft at Coffs Harbour on 19 August 2006 without any difficulty. There is no need for me to recount each and every matter that his Honour pointed to in coming to his conclusion that he did not accept a number of the aspects of the evidence given by the appellant. 

76In a final section of his lengthy decision, the trial judge once again considered the issue of the evidence of the complainant. His Honour said (at pages 85 to 87):- 

Cases of this kind where there are only two witnesses to an alleged offence, and no objective corroboration of either, present juries and judges with perhaps the most difficult task in determining the proper disposition at trial. The cases have been colloquially but inaccurately referred to as 'oath against oath'; but in fact the real question is whether the evidence of the complainant should be accepted beyond a reasonable doubt. In that equation, it is valid to consider the versions of the complainant and that of the accused and to examine them in a common sense way, in order to decide whether her evidence should be accepted to that standard. In terms of demeanour, I found the complainant an honest young person who, from time to time, made concessions against her interest... her evidence was characterised, in my view, by honesty and candour. It was not always logical or consistent, but those deficiencies can in part be attributed to her age, the sometimes vague and unclear use of language and the questions asked of her and the lapse of time since the events occurred. The latter considerations of course require a careful consideration of the reliability of her evidence. In the event, there are sufficient matters which corroborate parts of the picture she painted in her contact with the accused and they are: the accused's reputation for being ""touchy and feely"" observed by other students and Mr Seymour, and conceded by the accused; the fact that the accused did have the opportunity at the Wakakirri Dance Festival to do what he did; the fraught relationship between the complainant and her mother, as compared with MD's situation and her mother; the two telephone calls made by the complainant to her mother, one of which said, ""when can I go home?""; The fact that the complainant became upset when she was examined by her doctor; the fact that the accused had a sexual interest in female students as demonstrated by MD and indeed, the fact that there were common elements to what MD said happened to her, including the provision of drugs and an assault approximate to waking up, which recurred in both versions. Also, in my view, the fact that the complainant gave evidence that the accused was wearing a shirt wherein any scar that he had was obscured. It was either, as I say, a lucky coincidence which came in aid of a false historian or it was the truth. I prefer to believe the latter. In my view the fact that the accused arranged Mr Johnson as a support person who spoke to the complainant. It is not fully explained in any meaningful way. And finally I accept (the complainant's mother's version) of the conversations she had with the accused on 19 October (and it) seems to me the statement ""that I just wanted to love the girls"" is also indicative of support for what was known in the old cases as a guilty passion. 

On the other hand I formed the view, as I said, that the accused was an academically accomplished individual and an intelligent person who, in the instances I have outlined, gave his evidence in an exaggerated and calculated fashion. In my view, having watched him being examined and cross-examined, he was not being honest and candid about these matters... 

For all of those reasons I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant is an honest and reliable witness. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual intercourse did occur between SE and the accused in August 2006 and I am satisfied that the Crown has established its case beyond a reasonable doubt. 

It will be seen from this analysis that that the trial judge gave very careful consideration to each of the inconsistencies urged upon him. In the end, notwithstanding the submissions to the contrary, he concluded that he should accept the complainant as both honest and reliable. 

77I turn now to consider Mr Newton's submissions in relation to this ground. In relation to the matters relied upon as inconsistent statements, Mr Newton made three points. First, he argued that they were in fact inconsistent. That much may be accepted as his Honour the trial judge did. However, as his Honour found, there were a number of factors that made it clear why it was the complainant was reluctant to tell the full story of what had happened to her, both when she spoke to her friends, her mother, and to the authorities. Secondly, Mr Newton pointed to the fact that the complainant had told each of her school friends that her ""periods had saved her"". Mr Newton argued that an earlier version of the complainant's account of what had occurred in the first week at the appellant's house, when she had her period, was not consistent with what she told AD. In that instance, she later told AD the appellant had given her some tablets, told her to lay down, and then walked in behind her to the room. He started touching her ""and the only thing that stopped him"" was that she had her period. 

78In my opinion, the trial judge was alert to this additional inconsistency, and took it into account, as I have indicated above. Indeed, in his oral submissions, Mr Newton appeared to accept that the view taken by the trial judge concerning this aspect of the matter was one that was open to him. 

79Mr Newton's third point, however, was that the complainant in the witness box had denied giving a version to her friends of the kind identified. In addition, he argued, she had told her mother that no sexual activity took place. Mr Newton's point was that, while it was reasonable to suppose that the complainant might be reluctant to tell her friends and family exactly what had happened to her, and that this might excuse her for giving them a version which was short of the truth, the complainant in the witness box denied altogether having given a limited version to family and friends. However, I do not think this is a fair reading of the evidence of the complainant at trial. 

80In relation to her friends, FB and AD, the complainant at first did deny the precise terms of the conversations as they were put to her by trial counsel. Later in her evidence, however, when this matter was addressed a second time in cross-examination (Trial Transcript, 90 - 91), the following response was given:- 

Question: You have indicated that you never spoke to (AD) or (TB) concerning what had happened to you and (FB)? 

Answer: No, I said that I never spoke to them about the actual incident. 

Question: You know that it's been suggested that you did? 

Answer: Mm. 

Question: And you reject that? 

Answer: Yep. 

81In relation to her mother, the response given by the complainant appears most clearly at Trial Transcript, 91 - 92:- 

Question: You see, you told your mother that when you stayed at the (accused's) house that you didn't have sex with (FB)? 

Answer: I don't remember telling mum that, I remember telling her that nothing happened... 

Question: So putting it in your words, you're saying you told your mother that when you stayed at (FB)'s house, nothing happened? 

Answer: Yeah. 

Question: Is that the fact? 

Answer: No. 

Question: But that's what you told your mother? 

Answer: Yeah. 

Question: Can I suggest that when you told your mother that nothing happened, that was the truth? 

Answer: No. 

And later (Trial Transcript, 92):- 

Question: Right so when she found out about the interview your mother asked you about it? 

Answer: Yeah. 

Question: One of the things she asked you, let's be frank about, is did anything [happen] of a sexual nature at the (accused's) house? 

Answer: Yeah. 

Question: And you said nothing happened? 

Answer: Yeah. 

Question: Why did you say that? 

Answer: Because I didn't want her to know. 

Question: Can I suggest to you that you're not being truthful in relation to what you're not saying to his Honour? 

Answer: No. 

82Finally, there is a reference at Trial Transcript, 101 to the same subject matter. In these answers, the complainant once against insisted that her mother had asked her about FB and she had told her mother that ""nothing happened at (FB)'s house"". She said that she had told her mother this because she did not want her mother to know that she had been ""raped by (FB)"". A fair reading of these extracts (and others appearing in the transcript) show that Mr Newton's submission cannot be sustained. 

83There were two further instances relied on by Mr Newton in his written submissions. The first was the interview with Dr Van der Merwer. As I have said above, the complainant told the doctor she was a virgin and she had not been sexually active. It needs to be recalled, as his Honour pointed out, that the interview was conducted while SE's mother was present, and that at the end of the interview, the complainant became ""very distressed"". The second related to the statements made to Detective Fenn. It is clear that his Honour accepted the evidence of Detective Fenn on this point. The issue, however, was whether the complainant had told Detective Fenn anything at all about the sexual assault by the appellant. The fact that the complainant was wrong in her recollection about that does not seem, in my view, to have any significant bearing upon the credibility of the complainant, and that was the view taken by the trial judge. 

Ground 4 - excessive judicial questioning created a real danger that the trial was unfair 

84Mr Newton properly conceded that more latitude should be granted to a judge sitting alone in terms of the extent and nature of the permissible questioning of a witness ( R v Thompson [2002] NSWCCA 149 at [34]; 130 A Crim R 24). The rationale for such latitude was confirmed in R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442 at 470 (quoting Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263 at 281 - 282 per Kirby ACJ) as follows:- 

This is because it is conventionally inferred that a trained judicial officer, who has to find the facts himself or herself, will be more readily able to correct and allow for preliminary opinions formed before the final decision is reached. 

85Mr Newton submitted that, notwithstanding such latitude, the trial judge's questioning of the appellant and his witnesses was excessive in the present trial. Further, he argued it was of a character that created ""a real danger"" that the trial was unfair. There was also an instance where the trial judge had asked questions of the informant, Anthony Farrell. A submission was made that these questions were inappropriate, because they were designed to elicit evidence ""to bolster the prosecution case in a very significant respect"". 

The judge asked questions of defence witnesses 

86The appellant himself was asked a number of questions by the trial judge. First, at the end of his evidence-in-chief, the trial judge asked several brief questions, endeavouring to clarify the nature of the sexual activity the appellant was admitting in relation to the witness, MD. Secondly, during cross-examination by the Crown, the trial judge asked a number of questions briefly about the appellant's reasons for speaking with SE prior to her being interviewed by Mr Cudmore and the Deputy Principal. Thirdly, at the end of cross-examination, his Honour indicated he wished to ask some questions of the appellant ""to clarify a few things in my mind"". Those questions spanned about five and half pages of the transcript. The questions related to the following matters:- 


Questions in relation to the capacity to record dates on the digital photographs of the appellant's injuries and the reasons for their being taken. (This issue had been raised in cross-examination by the Crown); 
Questions clarifying the evidence that the appellant had flown ""twice"" in the period that SE was staying with him, and asking him about the safety belt he had worn on each occasion; 
Questions which, on their face, appeared to be an endeavour to clarify whether the appellant agreed or denied certain matters about which MD had given evidence; 
Questions on an incident that had arisen in the evidence of the complainant. (This incident fell into the category of an ""uncharged event"" concerning the complainant). His Honour predicated his questions about it (the Dance Festival incident) because he said it had not been dealt with thus far in the trial by either counsel or the Crown. His Honour asked the appellant whether he agreed with SE's claim or not). 
87The next witness who was asked a number of questions was the appellant's wife, VB. These questions were asked at the conclusion of her cross-examination by the Crown, and covered the following topics:- 


Background information in relation to her professional qualifications as a school administrator and the academic qualifications of the appellant; 
Questions designed to elicit how it was she had arrived at the date she had given in relation to the various medical procedures undergone by the appellant; the date of the photographs that were tendered of the appellant's wounds, and how long she had to dress them while he was recovering; 
Questions about the nature of restraint devices used when she had gone flying with the appellant; 
The details of her flying to see her parents in Sydney during the period that SE was staying at the house with the appellant; and 
Questions concerning her absence of knowledge of the appellant's sexual contact with MD at the time it was occurring. 
88The third defence witness was DR. He was a pastor at the regional Baptist church. His evidence had been that he had stayed with the appellant and his family between 15 and 18 July 2006. He had been asked in evidence-in-chief whether the appellant had appeared in any way affected or compromised by reason of the wound resulting from the infection. He had given evidence that the appellant was ""very cautious as he was moving around"". DK was cross-examined by the Crown as to the nature of activities which he had undertaken with the appellant during his visit. DK volunteered that the two men had taken a trip down the river in the appellant's boat. The Crown asked questions about the necessary process of manoeuvring the boat into the water and the method of climbing into it. At the conclusion of the cross-examination, his Honour asked further questions of DK as to what had been involved in the fishing trip, and further questions about the physical manoeuvres necessary to get the trailer into the water, and to clamber into the boat. 

89The final defence witness questioned by his Honour was the appellant's daughter, SB. There were only four questions asked of this witness, and they were questions designed, as I read the transcript, to elicit whether she, being a very young girl at the time, had any reliable method of aligning her evidence to actual dates. The questions related, for example, to whether she kept a diary at the relevant time of the visit by SE in 2006, and when it was she had first been asked to remember back to what had happened in August 2006. 

Principles applicable to judicial questioning in a criminal trial without a jury 

90Most of the authorities which underline the caution to be properly exercised by the trial judge during a criminal trial relate to trials where there is a jury. On the other hand, as might be expected, there are cases that recognise the greater latitude to be afforded to the questions asked by a trial judge in the context of a civil trial. That was the situation in Galea v Galea itself. In view of the statutory framework now surrounding criminal trials in New South Wales, it may be appropriate to restate the accepted principles, but with particular emphasis on the fact that it may be expected that henceforth more criminal trials will be conducted without the benefit of a jury. This may underline the proposition that, in appropriate circumstances, a judge sitting on a criminal trial without a jury will be entitled, within reasonable limits, to explore issues of fact with both Crown and defence witnesses. 

91The relevant principles were enunciated by Kirby ACJ in Galea v Galea . In summary, his Honour stated:- 

(1)The test to be applied is whether the excessive judicial questioning ... [has] created a real danger that the trial was unfair. If so, the judgment must be set aside ... 
(2)[G]reater latitude in questioning and comment will be accepted where a judge is sitting alone ... 
(3)... the appellate court must consider whether ... the judge has ... moved into counsel's shoes and 'into the perils of self-persuasion' ... 
(4)The decision on whether the point of unfairness has been reached must be made in the context of the whole trial and in the light of the number, length, terms and circumstances of the interventions ... 
(5)It is also relevant to consider the point at which the judicial interventions complained of occur. ... 
(6)The general rules for conduct of a trial and the general expression of the respective functions of judge and advocate do not change ... The conduct of criminal trials, particularly with a jury, remains subject to different and more stringent requirements ..."" 

92Although now more than fifty years old, there are, in addition, two cases in the English Court of Appeal that have been frequently and usefully cited. These are Yuill v Yuill [1945] 1 All ER 183 and Jones v National Coal Board [1957] 2 QB 55. Judges are reminded that they must take care not to have their ""vision clouded by the dust of conflict"". In an oft-repeated passage in Jones , Denning LJ said (at 64):- 

The judge's part in all this is to hearken to the evidence, only himself asking questions of witnesses when it is necessary to clear up any point that has been overlooked or left obscure; to see that the advocates behave themselves seemly and keep to the rules laid down by law; to exclude irrelevancies and discourage repetition; to make sure by wise intervention that he follows the points that the advocates are making and can assess their worth; and at the end to make up his mind where the truth lies. If he goes beyond this, he drops the mantle of a judge and assumes the robe of an advocate; and the change does not become him well. Lord Chancellor Bacon spoke right when he said that: ""Patience and gravity of hearing is an essential part of justice; and an over-speaking judge is no well-tuned cymbal."" 

93As is clear from the general statement of principles in Galea , the respective functions of judge and advocate in a trial without a jury are well-known and are relatively constant. But this does not mean that there is an unchanging and rigid appreciation of the way in which those functions are carried out. In civil trials, in the last fifty years in New South Wales, it has become much more common for judges to take an active part in the conduct of cases than was at an earlier time the case. The growth of litigation, the increasing complexity of litigation, and the limited resources of courts and legal aid have made it inevitable that judges must, within reasonable limits, intervene wherever it is necessary to ensure that the issues are clarified and that justice is dispensed within reasonable limits of efficiency. As Kirby ACJ said in Galea (at 281 - 282):- 

In part, this change is a response to the growth of litigation and the greater pressure of court lists. In part, it reflects an increase in specialisation of the judiciary and in the legal profession. In part, it arises from a growing appreciation that a silent judge may sometimes occasion an injustice by failing to reveal opinions which the party affected then has no opportunity to correct or modify. In part, it is simply a reflection of the heightened willingness of judges to take greater control of proceedings for the avoidance of the injustices that can sometimes occur from undue delay or unnecessary prolongation of trials deriving in part from new and different arrangements for legal aid. 

94These observations by his Honour were in the context of a civil trial, but they clearly have a resonance for the conduct of a criminal trial where the judge sits without a jury. 

95In R v Esposito at 472, Wood CJ at CL said of a criminal trial involving a jury:- 

The line that a trial judge walks when asking questions of a witness is a narrow one. There is nothing wrong with questions designed to clear up answers that may be equivocal or uncertain, or, within reason, to identify matters that may be of concern to himself. However, once the judge resorts to extensive questioning, particularly of the kind that amounts to cross-examination in a criminal trial before a jury, then he is treading on thin ice. The thinness of that ice will depend upon the identity of the witness being examined (here the person on trial), and on whether the questions appear to be directed towards elucidating an area of evidence that has been overlooked or left in an uncertain or equivocal state, or directed towards establishing a point that is favourable or adverse to the interests of one or other of the parties. 

96This was a passage that attracted itself to Ipp AJA in Thompson at [38]:- 

Notwithstanding the many judicial comments that have been made in regard to the issue, the boundary between permissible judicial intervention in a criminal trial and intervention of a kind that results in an unfair trial is not capable of clear definition. While the line may be narrow and the ice may be thin, the line is not bright and it is not always easy to determine whether the ice will hold. There are, indeed, circumstances in which a trial judge may legitimately intervene in a criminal trial. 

97Here, once again, Ipp AJA was speaking of a situation in a criminal trial with a jury. A fortiori, the circumstances in which a trial judge may legitimately intervene in a criminal trial conducted without a jury will be wider. They will, depending on the circumstances, be many and varied. It is impossible, indeed undesirable, to mark out the outer limits of appropriate questioning. Much will depend on the manner in which it is done, the timing with which it occurs and the opportunities that are given to the parties to deal with answers that may be given by a particular witness. In my opinion, it would be quite inappropriate to restrict the capacity of a trial judge sitting without a jury to clarify matters, within legitimate or proper limits, where that clarification is relevant to the resolution of the issues before the court. 

98A good example in the present trial is one of the matters complained of by Mr Newton. Detective Senior Constable Farrell gave evidence that he had interviewed the complainant on 16 September 2009. The interview was by way of a recording. It was played at the trial as part of the complainant's evidence-in-chief. By the time Detective Farrell gave his evidence on 3 June 2010, both the complainant and her mother had been extensively cross-examined in the trial. It was very clear at that stage that there were issues regarding the complainant's credibility, the making of inconsistent statements, and issues suggesting the possibility of contamination arising from the similar allegations made by MD. During his evidence-in-chief, Detective Farrell confirmed that the interview with SE had been videotaped and gave details as to where that occurred. His Honour interrupted the process of evidence-in-chief when the following questions were asked (Trial Transcript, 184 - 185):- 

Question: Mr Farrell, can I ask you just a couple of matters. The system of interviewing complainants involves, as we saw, an interview by a police officer and a DOCS worker which is video taped and recorded by sound? 

Answer: Correct. 

Question: And of course as you know, in the course of your work in these sorts of cases the mechanism by which the evidence-in-chief of the complainant is brought before a court such as this is by the playing of that interview. What are the protocols so far as the clarity or precision of the record which is made, I ask you this because juries normally, and in this case myself, are, or is required to look at the evidence of a young person or a complainant by looking at a screen and I have to say that on screen you do not get a very clear picture of the face of the individual who's making the complaint. At times the sound is very muffled. The equipment, it seems to me, is perhaps not as good as it should be, is that all that you're supplied with? 

Answer: Your Honour, obviously resources are stretched in all areas. Police obviously, although you'd think we'd have very good equipment, at times, are substandard as are the locations of some of these child interviews, they can occur within school classrooms with the bells ringing and students walking past, etcetera, as indicated with this, that interview was conducted within a actual office allocated to do interviews and again it gets that muffled sort of sound but in relation to where to place the camera to get the best view, it is awkward and again those interviews are substandard. I know they had trialled having clips and the things so you could get better voice clarity of victims but again a lot of victims are not like this matter, they are quite substantially younger, grabbing it and then, you know, tapping [sic] and it goes through the sound systems and it's very hard to have a uniform system to add clarity to an interview. 

Question: In paragraph 7 of your statement you refer to how you assessed the complainant's emotional state through some or all the parts of the interview. You wrote there that she looked very sad and shy and at times upset, wiping tears from her eyes, is that a correct account of your assessment of what you saw? 

Answer: That is correct. I did, I seen little tears forming in her eyes, although she's not to a point I wouldn't say crying as in need tissues, wipe eyes but absolutely, I believe from my first initial meeting she was very low and I feel on that time when she did speak to me an audio/video that she was still quite a sad person. As to what she's like if I went out and spoke to her today. 

Question: I have to say that in my viewing of the video I think that I could probably discern the first two descriptors, sad and shy, clearly enough she wasn't a very strong and assertive person, her voice dropped off many times and she trailed away I suppose. I have to say I did not discern the issue of tears as they occurred, would you be able to identify, do you think, I won't ask you to do so but do you think you'd be capable of identifying the place or places in the interview where such events relating to tears and wiping of eyes may have occurred? 

Answer: No I couldn't your Honour. 

99The questioning ceased at this point. A little later, the Crown Prosecutor asked some further question in chief. I will set out that further examination in chief and the questions which followed (Trial Transcript, 188 - 189):- 

EXAMINATION IN CHIEF BY CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Question: Officer, you were asked by his Honour with respect to the set up of the camera effectively and your observations of SE, in particular you said that you observed tears in her eyes. Did you regard, or advise that during the course of the playing of the tape there was a notation made by the Crown with respect to signs of crying during the course of the interview? 

Answer: That's correct. 

Question: And that was then marked upon your transcript? 

Answer: Transcription out of my brief, that's correct. 

Question: If I can just show you your copy of the transcription. Certainly it's your independent recollection during the course of the interview. I'll go to the question and answer which has been nominated as question 301 and the answer therein. You agree that as part of the lengthy response that was made to your question in relation to what happened in that two week period, towards the end of that answer that (SE) gave you and then in about ""Probably five, ten minutes I was actually asleep and when I woke up he was raping me"". Do you agree that there's a notation that the complainant appeared to be crying at that point in time? 

Answer: That's correct. 

Question: Also if you go to question 456? 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: Ms Crown can I just ask whose notation was that, I'm sorry. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Answer: This is by the Crown during the course of the video tape and I've asked the officer to confirm whether that was his recollection. 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: By the Crown, who in these circumstances, the Crown? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Answer: Myself your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: So you've made notes on the transcript -- 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Answer: Yes -- 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: And you're asking this witness to agree with -- 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Answer: If he can agree that that was his understanding and recollection but if I can get to the next -- 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: Yes by all means -- 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Question: To be transparent. To go to question 456. Do you have that with you? 

Answer: I do. 

Question: Do you agree that there was the question asked of the complainant and then another question asked of yourself at 457 as to ""How are you feeling?"" She says ""All right, you're right"" and would you agree that that would be consistent with concern that you had for the complainant at that time? 

Answer: That's correct. 

Question: And again do you have a recollection of her crying at that particular point of the interview? 

Answer: Yeah as per my statement, I couldn't indicate to your Honour straightaway without replaying the entire video where I felt that she was crying and after reference with you two pertinent points where I visualised that yeah. 

Question: Do you also agree that, yes that's fine your Honour so they can be regarded on the video tape itself? 

Answer: (No verbal reply). 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: I'm sorry, just so that I understand this process before Mr Webb asks the question, is it the effect of the evidence you've just given Mr Farrell that the Crown has drawn your attention to those two areas of the interview and you, on reflection say that those were or would have been the times that she was shedding some tears? 

Answer: Madam Crown did make the observations, I obviously made them whilst I was taking the interview by audio video and that was reflected in my statement. When you particularly ask me that question out of the top of my mind I could not single out a particular question where she was crying at that time your Honour. 

Question: I'm not at the moment I suppose disputing the original statement I'm just wondering what was the mechanism by which you refined your recent evidence to questions 301 to 456. Was it that the Crown has drawn these matters to your attention and you've concluded that their observation was correct or have you looked at the video subsequent to that and checked yourself or how did you go? 

Answer: No I'm going off Madam Crown's observations your Honour. 


100The first observation I would make is that it was perfectly appropriate for his Honour to seek clarification of where it was in the interview the complainant was observed to have tears in her eyes. As his Honour had pointed out, the recording was of poor quality but the statement from the officer indicated that she had at some stage been in tears. The issue required clarification. Initially, the officer said that he could not precisely recall where it had occurred. When the matter resumed later in the day, the officer had the advantage of a further interview with the Crown Prosecutor. It was on that basis that he made his estimate that she had first begun crying as she was describing the incident where she woke up and found the appellant having sexual intercourse with her. 

101The police officer was then cross-examined extensively by trial counsel. As I read the cross-examination, there was not a single question directed to either the fact that the complainant had become teary during the interview, nor to the precise time at which that occurred, nor to any matter arising out of the trial judge's questions. Nor had trial counsel taken any objection to the particular questions. 

102I would reject the submission that his Honour's quite appropriate questioning was designed to elicit evidence that ""bolstered the prosecution case in a significant respect"". It was plainly designed to ascertain precisely when it was, according to the statement of the police officer, that the complainant became teary. In a case where her credibility, reliability, and possible contamination by other witnesses were in issue, it was entirely proper for his Honour to make the enquiry. It was the trial judge's duty to determine the facts. Moreover, he did it in a polite and courteous way. He did not interrupt counsel. He gave defence counsel every opportunity to cross-examine the witness. It was counsel's clear choice not to raise any issue about the matter his Honour had brought to the witness' attention. Indeed, it would have been remiss of his Honour not to raise the issue as he did. As I have said, there was no objection by counsel to his doing so. There was no suggestion that the police officer's description of the complainant's demeanour throughout the interview was anything other than accurate. 

103There is no need for me to go into the same level of detail for each instance of asserted ""inappropriate"" questioning of the appellant and his witnesses. The following points, however, may be safely suggested. First, in every case, the questioning was clearly relevant to an issue that required clarification. Secondly, the questioning was invariably carefully introduced and politely stated. The witness, once asked, was allowed to answer as he or she wished. Thirdly, there was no attempt to traduce or browbeat the witness. The overall impression I gained was that the trial judge was simply endeavouring to clarify issues or obtain information to resolve issues that were troubling him. Fourthly, the questions were generally asked at the end of cross-examination, or at the end of evidence-in-chief. 

104One example was the questioning directed to the appellant at the end of his evidence-in-chief relating to the important question of his plea of guilty in the prosecution for his sexual activities with MD. The appellant had stated in chief that, during each of the occasions he was having sexual intercourse with MD, he believed she was consenting. Immediately prior to the commencement of cross-examination, the following exchange occurred (Trial Transcript, 380 - 381):- 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: Ms Crown before you commence can I just ask one question please, before you commence? 

The question as was put to you was that so far as MD was concerned was there any occasion that you in effect believed she was not consenting and you said ""No there was no such occasion"" is that correct? 

Answer: That's correct. 

Question: What was she not consenting to? 

Answer: Sex, sexual activity. 

Question: Well can you tell me, because I at the moment have nothing from you as to what sexual activity was said to have taken place between you and her. I have a version from her? 

Answer: Your Honour there was sexual intercourse and oral sex. 

Question: You have heard the evidence that she has given? 

Answer: Yes. 

Question: At the moment I don't know what it is that you say did occur and did not occur so far as she's given evidence. So I just wonder if you might tell me what it was? 

Answer: On the first count your Honour, we were in bed... 

105It is clear that this questioning was designed to adduce from the appellant precisely what it was he claimed had happened between MD and himself. The questions arose in circumstances where the appellant had thus far not given in evidence his precise version of those events. The questions were highly relevant and appropriately asked prior to cross-examination by the Crown. Indeed, it might be said the questioning was, if anything, helpful to the appellant's position, because it enabled him, prior to cross-examination by the Crown, to state his position very clearly. His response, if accepted, clearly assisted his case. 

106There was only one occasion when the trial judge interrupted the cross-examination of the appellant. This occurred at the point when the Crown has been asking the appellant about his conversation with SE immediately prior to the Cudmore interview. The transcript records (pages 397 - 398):- 

HIS HONOUR 

Question: ... why did you speak with her at all, if there was nothing to be complained about why did you have to speak to her at all? 

Answer: I just got her from the class and I said that a man had come to - was coming to speak to her, she was concerned about who this man was and what he wanted. 

Question: Well she didn't know before you told him that a man was coming to see her correct? 

Answer: Yeah I told her. 

Question: All right. So my question to you is, what was the occasion for you speaking with her at all, if you considered there was nothing to fear about what she might say? 

Answer: I don't really know, I just simply said this guy had come to talk to her about the time she spent at our place and don't worry about it and just tell the truth. 

Question: Did you not think that is an investigator was coming around to enquire about complaints concerning you that you might get yourself into further trouble if it was discovered that you were talking to the people that they are going to speak to? 

Answer: You Honour that is absolutely - it just he caught me unawares when he rang it just was a stupid thing to do and you know, I shouldn't have done, I should have got a staff member to do it, I remember I was afraid of the gossip and that's why I done it, but yeah look your Honour, I rang [JE] I apologised, I said I had done the wrong thing, I should never have spoken to her, it was just a stupid thing that I did at the time. 

Question: I am just trying to understand your thought processes, it may well have been but as you take yourself back there why was it that you did it? 

Answer: I did it because I was worried about the rumour mill with my staff and I thought if I arranged the interviews then my staff or people who gossip on my staff wouldn't find out what it was all about. 

Question: Can I ask you how do you suppose your staff could not have known that there were interviews going on if they occurred at the school? 

Answer: Well it was in the administration block which was away from the staff. Look my secretary knew there was obviously some staff that were being interviewed, they knew, and yeah, look it was a very silly thing to do I should have asked one of them to organise it, I didn't, it wasn't because I was afraid, it certainly, as I said nothing happened with [SE] at the home, I had nothing to be concerned about, I just simply wanted her to relax and not to worry about anything, and that's why I just said, just tell the truth. 

107In my opinion it was entirely appropriate to put these matters to the appellant. It was also appropriate to raise them with him at this point in his cross-examination, lest they be overlooked. The appellant was thus given an immediate opportunity to respond to a potentially damning piece of evidence. Indeed, had the particular questions not been asked (either by counsel or the trial judge), the appellant may have had a reason to complain about the course and conduct of the trial, if it had later been relied on. 

108Once again, there was no objection raised by trial counsel to the questions. No complaint of any kind was raised. Mr Webb was not prevented from asking any further questions himself, if he had wished to do so on the point. These comments apply generally to the questions by the trial judge of the other defence witnesses. On my reading of the transcript, there was no re-examination in the case of any of those witnesses, nor was there re-examination of the appellant himself. 

109One general complaint that was levelled against the trial judge was that all the questions he asked tended to assist the prosecution rather than the defence. As I have endeavoured to point out, that was not always the situation. But in any event, I see no indication in any of the questioning adopted by the trial judge that it was his intention to assist the prosecution. In each instance, the trial judge, whose task it was to determine the issues of fact in this somewhat difficult trial, intervened simply for the purpose of clarifying the evidence and understanding more precisely the issues at trial. It is obvious that, in the course of clarifying the evidence, and throwing a clearer light on the issues at trial, a judge may, without taking sides one way or the other, involuntarily or inevitably, assist either the prosecution or the defence. For my part, I cannot accept that this unintended consequence, if that is what happened, makes such an intervention inappropriate. I cannot accept that there is any principle that suggests a trial judge (whose task it is to determine the facts) should sit mute, especially in a situation where the lack of clarification and precision will hinder the ultimate fact finding process. In addition, counsel on either side need to know the nature of any matter that may be troubling the judge. 

110It is now some twenty years since the observations in Galea v Galea were written. The imperatives suggested by Kirby ACJ in that case, recognising the right and ability of a trial judge, within reasonable and legitimate boundaries, to question witnesses in a non-jury trial, are singularly apt, in the context of present day litigation. In that case, the trial judge had been, as Meagher JA recognised, driven to a degree of exasperation and irritation which was reflected in the number, type and tone of questioning adopted. Yet, despite this, the questioning, in the view of the Court of Appeal, did not transgress proper boundaries. By comparison, nothing of that kind happened in the present trial. The trial judge's interventions were moderate, balanced, necessary and proper in every respect. In my opinion, there is no substance in this ground of appeal. 

Ground 5 - the verdict was unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence 

111The final ground of appeal was that the verdict was unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence. In that regard, Mr Newton's written submissions may be distilled as follows:- 

(a) the complainant's evidence was uncorroborated; 

(b) the complainant failed to make any complaint consistent with what was asserted by her at the trial until she had spoken to the police in mid-2009; 

(c) the complainant gave inconsistent earlier ""complaints"" that significantly undermined her credibility; 

(d) the appellant was recovering from significant surgery and had wounds which (at the very least) contributed to the improbability of the appellant having committed the offence; 

(e) the complainant gave a ""thank you"" card to the appellant and his family that was inconsistent with her being the victim of a sexual assault; 

(f) the complainant's mother gave evidence that the complainant's behaviour had improved when she returned home from staying at the appellant's house and that the complainant ""spoke in glowing and complimentary terms of [FB]; and 

(g) (in the event that this court took the view that the evidence of MD should not have been admitted), the lack of tendency evidence in the Crown case against the appellant. 

Principles in relation to a claim of unreasonableness where the decision is that of a judge sitting without a jury. 

112Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) states that the Court of Criminal Appeal ""shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence."" 

113The principles governing a conviction appeal from the verdict of a judge sitting without a jury were stated by this court in Keir v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 149 (Hunt AJA, Johnson and Latham JJ). Johnson J referred to statements made in an earlier decision, R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174; 112 A Crim R 201 at [3] - [5]. In that case, Wood CJ at CL (Foster AJA and Adams J agreeing) observed:- 

3 The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error, and does not proceed by way of rehearing in a way that permits it to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury, or of the trial Judge where acting alone: Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R50, and Kurtic CCA (NSW) 26 February 1996 unreported. 

4 Where, as in the present case, the relevant ground is that the verdict, or more accurately the finding on the question of guilt by the trial Judge (s17 Criminal Procedure Act 1986) should be set aside upon the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence (s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ), then it can only intervene if, after making its own independent assessment of the evidence, it concludes that it was not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant... 

114These principles were recently affirmed in Arun v R [2010] NSWCCA 214, in the judgment of Hall J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Davies J concurred). 

115The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal in an ""unreasonableness"" appeal has recently been restated by the High Court of Australia in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571. In the plurality judgment of French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ, it was stated at [11] - [14]:- 


11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v R (1984) 181 CLR 487 at 493 by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ: 

Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 

12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v R ( 2002) 213 CLR 606 at [58], McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'."" 

13 T he starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say (at 494): 

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. 

.... 

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act , by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA , the court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" ( Morris v R (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 473). In M , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated (at 492 - 493): 

In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"". 

116In the present matter, having regard to the ground of appeal relied on by the appellant, it is this court's task to make an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, paying special attention to those matters relied upon by the appellant in its submission, to determine whether the finding of guilt by the trial judge can be supported. 

117In making its own assessment, this court must, however, bear in mind the important qualification referred to in M at 493:- 

But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. 

118In the present context, this means that, in making the independent assessment of the evidence, this court must recognise that the trial judge had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses, and that he was the tribunal entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence. 

119The qualification is further discussed in M at 494:- 

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. 

120These aspects of the court's assessment apply equally to the approach necessary to be taken when the finding in question is that of a judge sitting without a jury. 

The assessment 

121In my opinion, the case against the appellant was a strong one. The ultimate issues at trial were relatively simple and straightforward, even if the factual matrix was, as it often is in cases of this kind, somewhat complex and not without difficulty. If the complainant's evidence were accepted and the appellant's evidence rejected, a finding of guilt was not unreasonable. I have examined the evidence carefully, and, for my part, I have no doubt whatsoever that the complainant's evidence should be accepted. The qualifications expressed in M require this court, when making its assessment, to adequately recognise, if it has a doubt, the advantage a trial judge may have had in reaching his or her conclusions. Here, the trial judge concluded that the complainant, SE , was an honest and reliable witness. For my part, however, while I acknowledge the qualification, I do not need to call it in aid. I have no doubt about the complainant's veracity. My examination of her evidence leads me to the firm conclusion that it has the ring of truth about it. Of course, there were inconsistencies, and there was an absence of complaint for a considerable time. Those matters have to be weighed in the balance. But there were powerful reasons given by the complainant in her evidence to explain those matters, especially the impact upon her of the injunctions to silence imposed upon her by the appellant and, more importantly, her own natural reluctance, in the dynamics of the family situation, to mention any of those matters to her mother. She positively did not wish her mother to find out what had happened. This also explains her reluctance to tell her friends exactly what happened, and her aversion to revealing ""the gruesome details"" to them. 

122A similar comment can be made about the 'thank you' card written to the appellant after the fortnight in question when the complainant had been staying at his home. Of course, the card was written not only to the appellant, but to his family. The complainant, in her evidence, explained that she only did this because she had been trained by her mother to thank those who gave hospitality, and she had decided that she did not want her mother to know what had happened to her. She said in evidence:- 

I actually did not want to write it and mum told me so I did. I actually took a few, well a lot of persuading, to get me to write it. 

The complainant also said that her mother had no knowledge that anything bad had happened, and that she, the complainant, ""wanted it to stay like that"". 

123These explanations strike me as the truth. They explain adequately what might otherwise appear to be a strong inconsistency. The same point may be made about Mr Newton's argument that the complainant ""spoke in glowing and complimentary terms of [FB]."" This isolated statement does not adequately reveal the periods of bad behaviour described by the complainant's mother when she was describing her daughter's behaviour after her return to the family environment (Trial Transcript, 130). 

124There was ample evidence at trial to show that the appellant had an unhealthy sexual interest in the complainant. This evidence came not only from the complainant, but from other witnesses as well. Contrary to Mr Newton's submissions, this was formidable evidence in the prosecution case. 

125In relation to the evidence given by the appellant, even though I did not have the advantage of seeing and hearing it when it was given, my reading of it is that it was, in a number of respects, self-serving and overstated. The fact that the appellant had ""chosen"" the Deputy Headmaster to be the complainant's support person for the purpose of the Cudmore interview, and that he spoke to her about the evidence she was to give, was damning, to say the least. Even more significant, was the evidence relating to the appellant's behaviour with MD, which, in my opinion, was rightly admitted as tendency evidence. The appellant's evidence that he was physically unable to have sexual intercourse because of his wounds following post-surgery infection was, in the circumstances, demonstrated in his cross-examination to be quite unbelievable. He had been able to pilot and fly a plane, able to drive motor vehicles, and able to load and unload a boat from a trailer, climb in an out of a boat, and so on. And of course, it was the Crown case that he had put the complainant to sleep with a tablet before initiating sexual intercourse with her. 

126Having made an independent assessment of the evidence, I have concluded that I have no doubt as to the guilt of the accused. For that reason, in my opinion, it was well open to the trial judge, as a matter of fact, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. I do not consider that there is any danger that an innocent person has been convicted. 

127I would dismiss this ground of appeal. It follows then that I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 


******* 

Regina v FB - Crown Appeal 

128Having dealt with the appeal against conviction, it is now necessary to deal with the Crown appeal. In this part of the decision, I shall refer to FB as the respondent. 

129The appeal is against the sentence imposed by the trial judge on 11 th November 2010. I have earlier set out many of the details of the trial including the charge. It was, it will be recalled, a charge that, between 16 th and 31 August 2006, the respondent had sexual intercourse with SE without her consent, in circumstances of aggravation. Those circumstances were that at the time, SE was under the age of 16, and had been under the authority of the respondent, as he was the headmaster of her school. 

130The offence of aggravated sexual assault is provided for in section 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 . It provides a maximum penalty of 20 years, and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. His Honour's sentence is recorded in the following terms:- 

In relation to the offence with which you have been charged, and I have found you guilty, I convict you of that offence. I impose a non-parole period of 4 years. That is to commence on 4 th February 2010. I pause to note that is partially accumulated by 6 months on the penalty imposed by Judge North. It will first expire on 8 th February 2014. 

I impose a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months which will expire on 8 th August 2016. Effectively, that is a term of 4 years, backdated by 6 months, with a non-parole period of an effective term of 6 years and 6 months. 

131The reference by the sentencing judge to a partial accumulation by 6 months on the penalty imposed by Judge North requires explanation. The respondent had been dealt with by Judge North in the District Court on 20 th November 2009. He had pleaded guilty to an indictment containing five charges. Each stated in identical terms that, between 10 and 14 December 2007, he had sexual intercourse with MD, she then being under his special care as headmaster, and being under the age of 17 years, contrary to section 73(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 . The offence carried a maximum penalty, in each case, of 8 years imprisonment. Judge North's remarks on sentence were tendered during the sentencing proceedings before Judge Lakatos. Judge North noted, when sentencing the respondent, that he had been bail-refused for those offences since 9 May 2008. 

132The overall effect of the sentences imposed by Judge North for the five offences was imprisonment for a total term of 3 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 9 May 2008 and expiring on 8 August 2010. By the time his Honour Judge Lakatos sentenced FB on 11 November 2010, the non-parole period for Judge North's sentences had expired (on 8 August 2010). The respondent had remained in custody, presumably bail refused, after the expiry of the non-parole period. 

Mistake by the sentencing judge 

133It is clear that his Honour Judge Lakatos intended to impose a total effective sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. It is also clear that his Honour intended that these sentences would run partly concurrently (by six months) with the sentences imposed by Judge North. The intended result was that the non-parole period imposed by Judge Lakatos was, but for a period of six months, to be wholly cumulative on the effective non-parole period imposed by Judge North. This was intended to result in a situation where the effective time in prison for the SE offence would be 3 years. 

134However, it appears that, in the present sentencing exercise, Judge Lakatos ""simply misspoke"" when he indicated that the sentence would commence on 4 February 2010. It is agreed between the parties that the correct commencement date was 9 February 2010. All the subsequent documentation indicates that this is so. Consequently, this court may proceed on that basis. 

Crown submissions on appeal 

135The Director relies on two grounds in support of this appeal. Essentially however, he argues that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. Ground one is said to reveal ""a discrete error"" to explain how it was the judge came to impose a manifestly inadequate sentence. The two grounds are:- 

Ground 1: His Honour erred in that the sentence imposed did not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, nor did it reflect his Honour's finding that the offence was ""just below"" the middle of the range of objective seriousness; 

Ground 2: The judge imposed a sentence that was manifestly inadequate. 

Findings by the sentencing judge 

136As this was a sentence following trial, the standard non-parole period of 10 years had direct application. His Honour was required to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, and provide his reasons for that assessment. The finding by his Honour, referred to in Ground 1 mentioned above, was that the current offence was ""just below"" the mid-range of objective seriousness. 

137The factors that his Honour identified as bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence were as follows: 


The complainant was 14 years of age and the respondent was a mature man in his 40s; 
The respondent was the headmaster of the school and the complainant was a student at that school. Thus there was a power imbalance and a position of trust and control. Further, because the complainant had been staying in the respondent's home at the relevant time at the request of her parents, the respondent was, by analogy, ""in loco parentis"" for that period; 
The complainant was vulnerable. This was not only because of her age, but because the respondent had taken advantage of the conflict between SE and her parents, and the offence took place at a time when she was under his control and absent from familial support; 
The respondent had ingratiated himself with the complainant by taking her flying and buying her gifts; 
The respondent took advantage of SE when she was asleep; 
The respondent used moderate force, by holding down SE against her will when she awoke; and 
The intercourse was penile-vaginal in nature. 
138On the other side of the coin, the sentencing judge took into account that no physical injuries had been suffered by SE. The assault was not lengthy, and the respondent had acted in this manner on but one occasion. There had been, however, the application of some pressure by way of ""threats"" by the respondent to SE, in order to hide what had occurred. 

139The Crown did not challenge the discretionary finding of his Honour that the offence was ""just below the mid-range of objective seriousness"". The real complaint was that the non-parole period imposed - 4 years - was ""dramatically"" below the standard non-parole period of 10 years. The Crown argued that there was nothing that warranted a non-parole period so substantially below the standard. Further, the Crown argued that there was nothing revealed in the remarks on sentence that would justify the non-parole period falling so far below the standard period. The Crown submitted that, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, the non-parole period of 4 years was so disproportionate thereby as to indicate error ( R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 at [90] per Simpson J). The Crown argued that there was nothing in the subjective circumstances of the offender that could possibly warrant a departure of this magnitude. 

The judge's findings on subjective circumstances 

140It is appropriate at this point to return to the remarks on sentence. In view of the arguments raised by the Crown in the appeal, it is helpful to examine the subjective circumstances of the respondent. This is particularly important in the present matter as Mr Newton, who appeared for the respondent on the appeal, argued that the sentencing judge had reduced the standard non-parole period to the extent that he did after careful consideration of ""other relevant factors, such as personal circumstances"". 

141The first finding that was made by his Honour, not challenged on appeal, was his conclusion that he should deal with the respondent on the basis that the offence against SE was his first major criminal offence. While it is true that he had been earlier dealt with for the offences against MD, those offences had in fact occurred in the year following the sexual intercourse with SE. Secondly, however, his Honour did not accept that the respondent's longstanding symptoms of a ""severe depressive illness"" (referred to by Dr Watson-Munro) contributed to the commission of the offence against SE. Indeed, his Honour was confirmed in this view because the psychiatrist had been unable to say whether the offender had been suffering from any psychological symptoms back in August 2006. The psychiatrist candidly admitted that it would be speculation on his part to attempt that particular judgement. However, it was accepted that there was a long-standing depressive illness of a severe nature which was still affecting the respondent. 

142In this regard, his Honour noted the following statement by Mr Watson-Munro in the written report (at page 4):- 

It is clear that this man has suffered protracted symptoms of severe depression which commenced earlier on in his life and which were compounded by a number of key events inclusive of his deteriorating relationship with the Grafton community when he took up his position as the Principal [of the school]. 

According to the psychiatrist, the respondent was now ""heavily medicated"" with anti-depressive and anti-psychotic drugs. He said there were no differences in the respondent's presentation between the two occasions when he first saw him in 2009 and the occasion when he saw the offender in 2010. He noted, however, that ""the prisoner's mood was more stable presently speaking"". Mr Watson-Munro, during examine-in-chief (Submissions on Sentence Transcript, 24) expressed the opinion that ""the prisoner is clearly a paedophile"". 

143Mr Watson-Munro thought that the respondent required more intensive treatment than he had received at the time of the sentencing hearing. The sentencing judge noted that there were programmes which were presently available which might be of considerable assistance in the rehabilitation of the respondent. These normally extended over about four years, and involved the taking of medication which reduces libido, as well as involvement in a long term cognitive behaviour programme. 

144It seems that the psychiatrist was wary of expressing a definitive opinion on the risk of recidivism. He said ""candidly"" that this depended upon whether the prisoner had a ""long commitment to treatment"". Based on benevolent assumptions, however, it seemed to be his concluded opinion that the risk of recidivism was ""moderate"". The sentencing judge accepted this proposition, namely that the need for post-release treatment and its prospects of decreasing the risk of recidivism, required a lengthy non-parole period enabling supervision. 

145There were two matters, however, which the sentencing judge thought should particularly be taken into account as mitigating factors. These were the fact of extra curial punishment and, due to the nature of the offence, the harshness of the incidents of imprisonment. As to the first, the sentencing judge took into account that, prior to the commission of the offence, the respondent had been a highly regarded professional teacher and the principal of a country school. He had been a well-educated person apparently living a happy family life. His Honour said (Remarks on Sentence, 20):- 

It is self-evident that his fall from grace, by reason of these serious criminal matters, has been dramatic, and no doubt traumatic for him and also for his family. It has resulted in his estrangement from some of the members of his family and from the loss of any future career in teaching. I interpolate to say it may well have a far broader impact, that it would prohibit him from any career which may well bring him into contact with young children... His counsel has submitted that he practically is unemployable. Whether that description overstates the position or not might be debated. However, it is certainly clear that his professional life, as he knew it, after his release from custody, is not open to him and never will be. 

146As to the second matter, the sentencing judge accepted the evidence of Dr Watson-Munroe that the respondent ""is a vulnerable person in the prison context and is likely to be the subject of adverse attention by other prisoners"". It appears the respondent told his psychiatrist that he had been assaulted in prison, ""leading to broken bones"". Furthermore, he had been subsequently been assaulted by others ""throwing fruit at him"". He had been on full protection since his incarceration ""and that meaning he has been locked in his cell for between 18 and 23 hours a day"". His Honour indicated, however, that there was no direct evidence from the respondent of this fact, although he was prepared to accept the second-hand account of the respondent's position at the time when that information had been passed to his psychiatrist. 

147There were other general matters dealt with by his Honour. He noted, for example, that the respondent had completed a sex offenders' programme over 14 weeks at the Goulbourn Gaol. He noted that the respondent had expressed ""profound remorse notwithstanding that he indicated he was not guilty"". He noted the previous good character of the respondent. (In this regard, his Honour indicated that he proposed to treat this offence as the first serious offending of the respondent in point-of-time). On the issue of character, his Honour observed that good character or lack of previous conviction was not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor, if the court were satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to an offender in the commission of an offence. (This was clearly a reference to the provisions of section 21A(5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which, it is accepted, applied to the subject offence and the respondent). In this regard, his Honour concluded, however, that the respondent's good character should be treated as ""a neutral factor"". That is to say, the sentencing judge took the view that the issue of good character was one which was to be regarded as neutral in the particular circumstances that related to his position in the school and his ability thereby to pursue his predilection for interfering with young girls. 

The imposition of sentence 

148The sentencing judge recited the various matters that I have earlier listed relative to a determination of the objective seriousness of the offence, and where it stood in the range of seriousness. He said (Remarks on Sentence, 18 - 19):- 

For all of those reasons, I considered that whilst this is a serious offence, the objective gravity of it is just below the mid range of objective seriousness. I also consider that the sentence that should be imposed should be partially accumulated on that imposed by Judge North because this, in point of time, represents the prisoner's first series of serious criminal transgressions against the criminal law, and also, in my view, by reasons of totality. Even though the prisoner has not given evidence in the sentencing proceedings, I am satisfied that due to the nature of the offence, and the status of the offender as a teacher or principal of the school, the incidents of his imprisonment have been, and may well continue to be, harsh. I accept the evidence of Mr Watson-Munro that he is a vulnerable person in the imprisonment context and is likely to be the subject of adverse attention by other prisoners. I have had regard to that matter in determining the appropriate sentence. 

On the issue of extra-curial punishment, his Honour said (Remarks on Sentence, 20):- 

As I say, the authorities are clear that a court is entitled to take into account such extra-curial punishments, with the proviso that the offender could not have committed these offences in the way that they were committed, without being a highly regarded teacher and then a person of good character. 

149Finally, the sentencing judge had regard to the evidence of Mr Watson-Monro concerning the need for the respondent to continue to undergo appropriate therapy and counselling both while in custody and on release. He made recommendations in each of those regards. His Honour then imposed the sentence to which I have earlier made reference, ensuring that there was a degree of partial accumulation upon and within the sentences imposed by Judge North, and structuring the sentence to reflect his finding of special circumstances. The ultimate sentence imposed by his Honour reflected this by varying the statutory ratio to 61.5 per cent. 

Was the sentence manifestly inadequate? 

150It is plainly the position, the respondent having been found guilty after trial, that the standard non-parole period had direct application by force of statute. It was not merely there to serve as a guidepost on sentence in the situation where a plea of guilty has been entered ( R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 184 [68]). The sentencing judge was obliged to have regard to both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period ( R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186 per Garling J at [180]). 

151In the present matter, the sentencing judge concluded that the objective gravity of the offence fell ""just below the mid range of objective seriousness"". Although perhaps somewhat generous to the respondent, there was no challenge by the Crown to this finding. 

152The real question arising on the Crown appeal is whether there was any justification, in the findings his Honour made in relation to subjective circumstances or otherwise, that would permit the imposition of a non-parole period of no more than four years. The standard period for this offence if it were in the mid-range of objective seriousness was 10 years. In my opinion, with all due respect to the sentencing judge, I have been forced to conclude that his Honour's reasoning fails to justify such a substantial departure from the standard non-parole period. 

153First, it may be observed that the non-parole period imposed is only 40 per cent of the standard non-parole period. Secondly, the overall term of the sentence was 6 years, a sentence itself well below the standard non-parole period. Each of these factors in itself is sufficient, in my opinion, to suggest or point strongly to error, unless the apparent discrepancy can be explained by the respondent's subjective circumstances, or by some other matter. 

154However, there is nothing in those subjective circumstances, or elsewhere in the sentencing material, that would warrant such a substantial departure from the standard non-parole period. The respondent was entitled to have the sentencing court take into account his depressive state and the judge did so. However, this circumstance could not, in the present matter, possibly outweigh or undermine the objective seriousness of the offence. As the courts have repeatedly stated in this context, ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor should offenders expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. Of course, it will be the responsibility of the Correctional Service authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for prisoners with illness and disabilities ( R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 at 353 - 354). This factor could not have explained the selection of a four year non-parole period. 

155The two circumstances most beneficial to the offender were hardship in prison and the factor of extra curial punishment. As to the first, the only evidence before the sentencing judge was the abusive behaviour experienced by the respondent in prison and his concern that this would or might continue after he had been sentenced. There was no evidence, for example, to suggest that there would be imposed on the respondent any specific custodial situation that would reveal hardship out of the ordinary ( R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207; 10 Crim LN 61 (1582); R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299; 10 Crim LN 78 (1610); R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97). 

156As to extra curial punishment, it may be accepted that the respondent had lost altogether his career as a teacher by virtue of his commission of the offence. Once again, however, this consideration could not, in the circumstances, have possibly outweighed or effectively undermined the level of objective seriousness involved in the offence. The respondent must have known that his sexual pursuit of pupils in his care would sooner or later bring his professional career to an end. 

157The sentencing judge also took into account such remorse as had been shown by the offender, and his potential for rehabilitation. His previous good character was taken into account, but, for reasons his Honour explained, remained in the end at a neutral level. 

158Having considered all of these matters, and making every allowance for them, I have come to the clear view that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate in the well-recognised sense that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust ( Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370 - 371; Carroll v R [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [8] - [9]). Individually and collectively, the matters referred to by his Honour could not, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, explain or justify the degree to which the non-parole period fell below the standard. 

159Mr Newton relied on three decisions to make the point that there were cases where sexual offences against young girls involving breach of a position of trust, had resulted in sentences similar to the present. These demonstrated that the present sentence was not ""out of the range"". Mr Newton also relied on JIRS statistics which suggested, in his submission, a similar conclusion. I would make two points in response. First, the court has spoken repeatedly about the caution with which it should approach statistical analysis. Indeed, as Simpson J observed, with considerable acuity, in Monteiro v R [2011] NSWCCA 113, the statistics concerning offences against section 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 suggest no more than that Part IV Div 1A is, it would seem, not being applied with the rigor that should be accorded to a regime imposed by parliament. Secondly, none of the cases mentioned by Mr Newton (or for that matter a number of cases referred to by the Crown) are of any great assistance. The facts of one are invariably very different from the other, and from the facts of the present matter. 

Re-sentencing 

160It is necessary to re-sentence the respondent. 

161In doing so, I observe that there is nothing which would lead me to conclude that the Court should decline to intervene in the exercise of its discretion. I have given full weight to tall the salient features of the case which I have identified above. I take into account also the position agreed between the parties that the respondent is currently at the special management area placement. I would maintain the finding of ""special circumstances"" for the reasons identified by Lakatos DCJ. I am also mindful of the consequences that flow from the fact that the sentence which I propose will be accumulated, to some extent, upon the pre-existing sentence which was imposed by Judge North: Kalache v R [2001] NSWCCA 210. 

162I propose the following orders: 

1. Dismiss the appeal against conviction. 

2. Allow the Crown appeal against sentence. 

3. In substitution for the sentence imposed in the District Court, sentence the respondent to a non-parole period of 6 years with a total term of 10 years imprisonment to commence on 9 August 2009. 

4. The total term will expire on 8 August 2019 and the non-parole period will expire on 8 August 2015 on which date the respondent will be eligible for release on parole. 

163BUDDIN J : I agree with Whealy JA. 

164HARRISON J : I agree with Whealy JA.

2757971,R v Bailey [2011] NSWSC 1228,"EX TEMPORE Judgment 

1Sean Hai Bailey is charged with one count of murder, contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in relation to the death of Allan Thomas Hall on 20 August 2010. 

2On 9 June 2011, Mr Bailey was committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of NSW by the Local Court of NSW at Port Macquarie. 

3On 2 September 2011, Justice Latham determined, pursuant to s 8 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 that an inquiry should be conducted as to the question of Mr Bailey's unfitness to be tried for the offence of murder. 

4Accordingly, I have today, consequent upon the arraignment of Mr Bailey without a plea being taken, conducted an inquiry pursuant to the provisions of Part 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, as to whether Mr Bailey is unfit to be tried for the offence. 

5At this inquiry the Crown has been represented, and as well Ms Manuell of Senior Counsel has appeared for Mr Bailey. 

Principles of Law 

6There are a number of principles of law that are relevant to this inquiry. Those principles, which affect the conduct of the inquiry, are these: 

(a)the question of unfitness is to be determined on the balance of probabilities: s 6 of the Act ; 

(b)the inquiry is not to be conducted, and was not conducted, in an adversarial manner: s 12(2) of the Act ; 

(c)there is no onus of proof resting on either the Crown or the accused: s 12(3) of the Act, 

(d)the principles of law which apply, and the findings of fact relied upon must be included in any determination made by a Judge: s 11(2) of the Act . 

7The substantive principles of law as to whether a person is or is not fit to stand trial are of longstanding and can be found in the decision of R v Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48, per Smith J, and in Kesavarajah v R (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 246 per Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. 

8It is appropriate to encapsulate those principles so that the findings of fact in my determination are more readily understood. 

9The consideration of these principles must take place in the context of the length and complexity of the trial proceedings. The criteria for fitness to be tried, which are minimum standards, are that an accused such as Mr Bailey must be able to: 

(a)understand with what he has been charged; 
(b)enter a plea to the charge; 
(c)exercise his right to challenge any juror; 
(d)understand, generally, the nature of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with; 
(e)follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is happening without the necessity to understand all of the various aspects of court formality; 
(f)understand the substantial effect of any evidence which may be given against him, in support of the prosecution; and 
(g)give his counsel instructions, including his version of the facts, which are sufficient to make his defence and answer the charge. 

See Presser at 48, Kesavarajah at 246 and R v Robinson [2008] NSWCCA 64 at [65]-[66]. 

10The material available to me on this inquiry consists of: 

(a)an agreement as to the facts leading up to and surrounding the death of Mr Hall which are to be found in the Crown Case Statement. I note that that statement relates and is agreed to only for purposes of these proceedings; and 

(b)the expert evidence of Professor David Greenberg, an expert forensic psychiatrist. 

Crown Case Statement 

11In the weeks before Mr Hall was killed the accused was staying with his brother in Sydney. During this period his prescribed medication was changed on a number of occasions. 

12On Friday, 13 August 2010, and over the following weekend, the accused's mother and brother observed that he was exhibiting frank signs of mental illness. During the following week, the accused received medication by injection at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney. The accused's mental health did not noticeably improve. 

13On Friday, 20 August 2010, Mr Bailey's mother and sister drove with him from Sydney to Port Macquarie in order to have him assessed at the Mental Health Unit of the Port Macquarie Hospital. However, by the time they arrived in Port Macquarie that unit was closed, but an on-call Crisis Team was apparently available. 

14On the evening of Friday, 20 August 2010, at about 7.20pm, the accused attended the Laurieton Hotel by himself. The deceased, Mr Allan Hall, was socialising with friends at the hotel. The deceased and the accused were known to each other but were not in any way friends. 

15The accused approached the deceased and his friends. The accused yelled at the deceased, making an entirely unfounded allegation against him. The deceased rejected the allegation. It was then repeated. 

16Having made and repeated the allegation, the accused then punched the deceased once or twice in the area of the right temple. The deceased dropped to his knees and slumped to the floor. 

17Upon arrival of the NSW Ambulance officers at the scene a short time later it was determined that Mr Hall was dead. 

18The accused was arrested and taken to the Port Macquarie Police Station. A formal recorded interview took place with the accused in the presence of his father. 

Mental Illness Defence 

19The Crown case statement makes it plain that the accused, who was 37 years of age at the time of the offence, has suffered from chronic mental illness since he was in his mid twenties. 

20From at least August 1998, the accused has had a number of hospital admissions because of this mental illness. At that time in 1998 he was scheduled under the Mental Health Act (1990) because he had no insight into his, then, psychotic condition. 

21He has been the subject of Community Treatment Orders on a number of occasions because of his failure to regularly take anti-psychotic medication. 

22Professor Greenberg has examined Mr Bailey on four occasions: 30 March 2011, 1 August 2011, 12 August 2011 and 6 October 2011. He has had access to extensive documentation about Mr Bailey's psychiatric history. 

23Professor Greenberg, having considered that material, the results of his clinical examinations and the various relevant documents from the Police brief, including the Crown Case Statement and the record of the formal police questioning which occurred on the evening of Mr Bailey's arrest, has expressed his expert opinion that he thinks it likely that Mr Bailey has a mental illness defence to the substantive charge of murder. 

24Professor Greenberg expressed this view: 

""Mr Bailey likely did not understand the nature and quality of his actions and did not understand the wrongfulness of his action both in a legal sense and a moral sense at that time period. I am of the opinion that he had a defect of reason flowing from his mental illness namely Schizoaffective Disorder. At the time he was suffering from paranoid delusional beliefs and likely was hallucinating at that time period."" 

25It is not for me in this Inquiry to form any final conclusion about the guilt of Mr Bailey with respect to the offence with which he is charged and I do not do so. But if there is available to Mr Bailey at a trial a possible defence of mental illness as Professor Greenberg suggests, then Mr Bailey's capacity to understand the availability of that defence and to propound it is a relevant matter to take into account when considering any question of Mr Bailey's fitness to stand trial. 

Expert Opinion of Professor Greenberg 

26Professor Greenberg has expressed his expert opinion as to whether Mr Bailey is fit to stand trial in a lengthy, detailed and thorough report dated 26 August 2011. That report, and Mr Bailey's condition, has recently been reviewed on 6 October 2011, and Professor Greenberg adheres to the views which he expressed in his report of 26 August 2011. 

27The Crown submits that the Court ought accept the expert opinions expressed by Professor Greenberg, who is a most experienced forensic psychiatrist. 

28Professor Greenberg noted the following features when, in August 2011, he conducted a mental state examination: 

Mr Bailey: 

(a) was irritable and verbally hostile in his manner; 
(b) ruminated about psychiatric medication and the mental health services; 
(c) became agitated and potentially volatile in his manner; 
(d) expressed unrealistic thoughts about the future; 
(e) was clearly labile in his mood; 
(f) clearly trivialised his current charge and expressed the view that he would be released in two to three years time; 
(g) displayed grossly impaired insight with regard to his mental state and his need for psychiatric medication. 

29It does not need emphasis that each of these features are signs and symptoms of Mr Bailey's mental illness. I accept that he was displaying these signs and symptoms when seen by Professor Greenberg. 

30Professor Greenberg considered the criteria for fitness to stand trial as described in Presser . He formed these conclusions about Mr Bailey: 

(a) he understands the nature of the charges he is facing and the pleas available to him in the sense of guilty or not guilty; 
(b) he has the capacity to exercise his right to challenge jurors, perhaps with the benefit of assistance and an explanation; 
(c) he generally understands the nature and course of the proceedings which he is facing, although he did not clearly understand the details of the functions of various officers of the Court. 

None of these conclusions would result in a finding that Mr Bailey was unfit to stand trial. 

31However, there were a number of findings of Professor Greenberg which do bear significantly on the question of Mr Bailey's fitness to stand trial. The Professor formed these conclusions about Mr Bailey: 

(a) he would have difficulty appreciating the substantial effect of evidence given in court because of the lability of his current mood and his current grandiose delusions; 
(b) he trivialised and minimised the charges and hence appeared to not understand the full consequences should he be found guilty of the charge which he faces; 
(c) he did not have the capacity to decide on what defence he should make because he was unable to understand and make any reasoned decision about the potential defence of mental illness. That was because of his grossly impaired insight into his own mental state; 
(d) he would have difficulty giving evidence because of his lability of mood and current acute mental illness. He would also have some difficulty in communicating his version of the facts because of his poverty of thought and irritability of mood. 

32Professor Greenberg concluded that Mr Bailey was, on the balance of probabilities, currently unfit to stand trial at the present time. 

33I accept these conclusions as to the factual status of Mr Bailey's mental state. They are facts, which I find for the purpose of making this determination. 

Submissions 

34The Crown submits that the Court would accept the evidence of Professor Greenberg and that it accordingly would be satisfied that Mr Bailey's current state falls substantially below a number of the minimum criteria that the law requires, before a person stands trial. The Crown submits that the Court would find that at present Mr Bailey is not fit to stand trial. 

35The Crown submits that the Court would note Professor Greenberg's view that with, what is inevitably a lengthy and gradual recovery process from his current mental state, and with a review of his current treatment regime, Mr Bailey may become fit to stand trial in the next 12 month period. 

36Ms Manuell, Senior Counsel for Mr Bailey, did not make any submissions to the Court at all. This was in accordance with her instructions. 

Discernment 

37The common law guarantees an accused person a fair trial according to law. That is a fundamental precept. One aspect of that guarantee is that a criminal trial cannot fairly proceed if an accused is not fit to plead and stand trial, see Eastman v R (2000) 203 CLR 1 at [64] per Gaudron J. 

38I do not overlook the serious effects upon an accused of a finding of unfitness to stand trial, which has, as a usual consequence, indefinite incarceration without trial. It is ordinarily in the interests of an accused person to be brought to trial rather than suffer such incarceration, see Eastman at [24] per Gleeson CJ, and Kesavarajah at 249 per Deane and Dawson JJ. 

39In this case, however, the evidence which encompasses the lengthy history of Mr Bailey's mental illness, and a careful review of his current mental status, is abundantly sufficient to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that Mr Bailey is presently unfit to be tried for the offence of murder of Mr Hall on 20 August 2010. 

40In those circumstances I make the following orders. 

1.I find the accused, Sean Hai Bailey, is unfit to be tried. 

2.In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

3.In accordance with s 14(b)(iii) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I remand Mr Bailey in custody until the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, pursuant to s 16 of that Act . 

4.I direct the Registrar of the Supreme Court to provide the following documentation to the Mental Health Review Tribunal within seven days: 

(a)a copy of this finding and my reasons; 

(b)a copy of the orders which I have made; 

(c)a copy of the transcript of these proceedings; 

(d)a copy of the psychiatric reports of Professor Greenburg which are exhibits in these proceedings; and 

(e)a copy of the Crown Case Statement.

		19 October 2011",2011-10-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2757977,R v Hazairin Iskandar; R v Andrew Iskandar & R v Nita Iskandar [2011] NSWSC 1192,"Judgment 

1Hazairin Iskandar and Andrew Iskandar have been jointly indicted for the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin on 21 February 2010 at Leichhardt. Nita Iskandar is charged that, knowing Andrew Iskander committed that murder, between 21 and 24 February 2010 she received, harboured, maintained and assisted him. The 3 accused have pleaded not guilty to the charges. 

2Hazairin Iskandar applied on the first day of the trial that a separate trial from the co-accused Andrew Iskandar (who I shall refer to as ""Andrew"") be granted to him. After hearing argument I ordered that the Applicant be tried separately from Andrew. These are my reasons for so doing. 

3The basis for the application was that evidence to be led against Andrew, which contained admissions by him of an intention to kill the deceased, contained prejudicial material implicating the Applicant. The admissions were contained in a statement of Esau Maiava dated 18 August 2010 and in an ERISP of Victor Lau of 2 March 2010. 

4The Crown case is that there was a joint criminal enterprise involving the Applicant and Andrew to assault and kill the deceased, or at least to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him, because he was supposedly having an affair with Nita Iskandar, the wife of the Applicant and the mother of Andrew. This involved the Applicant and Andrew driving to the victim's residence in Marion Street, Leichhardt some time before midnight on 21 February 2010. When the deceased arrived home and got out of his vehicle the Crown case is that the Applicant drove his vehicle at the deceased's vehicle. He and Andrew then jumped out of the car, with the Applicant being armed with a knife and Andrew with a hammer. They proceeded to attack the deceased with the weapons and, when he managed to run away from them, they chased him and further attacked him. He died at the scene. 

5The case for the Applicant is that he intended only to injure the deceased but that at or immediately before the attack he was provoked by the deceased saying things to him, with the result that he killed the deceased by reason of that provocation. 

6Andrew took no part in the present application, and the basis of his defence to the charge is not known. 

Legal principles 

7In Webb & Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 88-89 Toohey J, with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed, said on the question of whether there should have been separate trials: 

King CJ dealt with this ground by pointing out that there are ""strong reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together. That is particularly so where each seeks to cast the blame on the other"". What King CJ referred to as ""strong reasons of principle and policy"" were discussed by his Honour in Reg. v. Collie . I respectfully agree with that discussion which emphasises that when accused are charged with committing a crime jointly, prima facie there should be a joint trial. There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but, more importantly, consideration by the same jury at the same trial is likely to avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the blame on the other or others. There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused. 

In the end the critical question before an appellate court in these circumstances is whether, by reason of the joint trial, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice or, put another way, whether improper prejudice has been created against an accused. 

8In Regina v Patsalis & Spathis [No 1] [1999] NSWSC 649; (1997) I07 A Crim R 432 at [6] Kirby J said: 

There is a rule, and a proviso to that rule. It is desirable, in the ordinary course, that all persons said to have been concerned with the one crime should be dealt with in the one trial. That rule is subject to the proviso that, if a joint trial would cause positive injustice to an accused, then a separate trial should be ordered ( R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543). 

9In R v Symss [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [68] Sheller JA (with whom James J and Smart AJ agreed) said: 

The decision whether or not to grant separate trials involves a consideration of the interests of justice, including conserving costs, the avoidance of inconvenience to witnesses and the desirability of common enterprises being jointly tried so as to avoid inconsistent verdicts. 

10In R v Middis (unreported - Hunt J - 27 March 1991) Hunt J said: 

Briefly, the relevant principles are that: 

1. where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him, and 

2. where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him, and 

3. where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, 

a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial. 

This statement by Hunt J was approved in R v Baartman (unreported - Court of Criminal Appeal - 6 October 1994), in R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at [416], and in R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 at [48]. 

11In Pham , Adams J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Hulme J agreed) said in commenting on Hunt J's summary of the principles: 

[39] Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, ""immeasurably"" usually connotes something of such an enormous degree that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant ""significant, though incommensurable"". The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to ""positive injustice"". Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that the inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence. 

[40] I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant's case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender's case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case since, if the co-accused's case was weak, or weaker than the applicant's, the prejudicial evidence might well assume even more importance than otherwise. As it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury's consideration of the applicant's case. 

12In Madubuko Henry Ugo v R [2011] NSWCCA 135 Hodgson JA (with whom Hoeben J and Grove AJ agreed), expressly agreed with what Adams J said in Pham in those paragraphs. 

13The Applicant relies on what was said by Hunt J in Middis , and submitted that the evidence against him was weaker than the evidence against Andrew by reason of Andrew's admissions. He submitted further that if a joint trial were held the evidence of Andrew's admissions would be highly prejudicial and would make the Crown case immeasurably stronger against the Applicant. 

The case against the Applicant 

14The case against the Applicant is a circumstantial one. However, the Applicant has said that the cause of death and the acts causing the death will not be in dispute. Nor will it be disputed that the Applicant did some of the acts causing the death of the deceased. Nor will it be disputed that the Applicant did those acts with an intention to kill or at least an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. What will be in dispute as one of the primary issues in the trial is when it was that the Applicant formed the intention either to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. This is because the Applicant will rely on the partial defence of provocation. Indeed, the Applicant indicated that when he is indicted before the jury he will plead guilty to manslaughter by reason of the provocation. It is not expected that the Crown will accept that plea in full discharge of the indictment. 

15The Crown relies upon the following matters as compelling circumstantial evidence pointing to the fact that the Accused pre-planned the attack on the deceased and intended at least to inflict grievous bodily harm. The circumstances are said to be these: 

a. a significant motive (having heard rumours from within the Indonesian community and suffered shame); 

b. prior admitted attempts to dissuade the deceased from continuing his relationship with Nita and the fact that this made him ""very mad"" (ROI page 6); 

c. hiring the car; 

d. performing surveillance (with cap over the face) on more than one occasion; 

e. possessing multiple and dangerous weapons at the time of the confrontation (a hammer, a knife and a spanner are admitted in the record of interview (Q/A 197-203); 

f. being with his son so that the deceased was confronted with two armed men; 

g. ramming the car and ambushing him in darkness; 

h. the admitted immediacy of the attack that followed; and 

i. admissions that he had agreed to bash the deceased and ""hit his car"" before going to Leichhardt and that he did in fact ""bash"" the deceased in his record of interview (Q/A 189). He admits hitting him on the jaw, temple and back of the head with the hammer (Q/A 232, 243) and kicking him in the head with his foot (Q/A 245). 


16Nowhere in his ERISP does the Applicant make any admissions of having formed an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. In fact he expressly denies and intention to kill him. There are no admissions made to any other person by the Applicant including in telephone intercepts where there is discussion concerning attempts to protect Andrew. 

17Two things in particular emerge from the ERISP. The first is an obvious intention to protect Andrew by the fairly obviously false suggestion that a stranger whom the Applicant met earlier that night assisted the Applicant to assault and kill the deceased for the sum of $600. The second is the repeated claim that the Applicant only intended to bash the deceased, and that the Applicant's role involved hitting the deceased with the hammer once, or perhaps twice, and kicking the deceased when he was on the ground. 

18Indeed, the impression one gains from the ERISP (if what it says is true) is that the decision to bash the deceased was only made a few hours before the assault, and it was made at the behest of the stranger after the Applicant told him his troubles. Certainly, the Applicant admits to having been troubled by the rumours he had heard about his wife's infidelity and had approached the deceased to speak to him about it. Explanations were provided for hiring the car that was used in the assault. Further, the Applicant admitted that he had previously followed the deceased to see where he lived. 





The prejudicial evidence 

(a) Statement of Esau Maiava 

19In July 2010 Mr Maiava was transferred to the Multi Special Purpose Centre at Long Bay Gaol for medical reasons. On his first day at Long Bay Mr Maiava met Andrew. Andrew started talking to Mr Maiava about the murder with which he was charged. The Statement contains the following: 

[4] ... I asked him what happened. He told me that he and his father were going to knock this guy. I asked him why, and he told me that his mum was having an affair with this guy. I asked him whereabouts, and he said, ""Outside of where the bloke lived"". He told me he did this in February this year. 

[5] He told me the first plan was to kidnap him, tie him up and take him in the boot to Wooloomooloo. Once they were there, they were going to kill him there. He told me the first thing that happened was his Dad hit him with the car. The man fell, and Andrew got out and chased him around the car. As Andrew got to him, Andrew hit him with the hammer. 

[6] Then the father jumped out of the car and stabbed the man with a knife. He told me that his father stabbed the man twice. They took off in the car they were in. Andrew told me that his father told him to get rid of all the evidence. 

[7] Andrew told me that they went home. Then his father told him to call one of his mates to make an alibi for him, to say that Andrew was with his mate at the time of the murder. Dad told Andrew to get rid of his shoes. Andrew's Dad had first dropped him off at home, and then went somewhere for a short time and then came back. 

[8] When Andrew's Dad got home, he said to Andrew, ""We've done it, go to bed now"". Andrew told me he rang his mate, but the mate didn't want to help him with the alibi. 

[9] Then he told me that his mum organised a flight for him to go overseas because he knew the Police would come looking for him. Andrew felt that he had done nothing wrong in killing the man, he was proud of what he'd done and felt he had defended his family honour. 

[10] Andrew was saying to me that he was texting his dad for weeks before hand, saying, ""When are we gonna kill him, when we gonna kill him"". 

... 

[12] in relation to the plan to kidnap they were going to do, they had tape and all that stuff with them and organised the knife and hammer before the murder. 

... 

[14] Andrew asked one of his mates in the Indonesian community where this man lived. This friend asked his dad, and they told Andrew and his father where the man lived. Then, for a couple of weeks before they murdered him, they were watching him at his house. One of those times they saw Andrew's mum and the man they murdered walking into his place. 

[15] Andrew told me that he kept asking his Dad, ""when we gonna do it"". Andrew's Dad told him that he wanted to confirm what time he got home from work. Then, the day before they did it, Andrew's Dad told him they would do it tomorrow night. 

[16] Andrew was telling me that he and his Dad used to watch a TV program on Foxtel to do with using a knife to stab someone. Andrew's Dad would then further educate him about how to stab someone. 

... 

[22] I have a black 2010 diary which I make notes in whilst I have been in custody. When Andrew was telling me what he had done, I made notes in my diary. I made them each day immediately after being put back into our cells at 3pm. I wrote the notes behind the contacts section in the back of my diary. The notes are under the heading of ""notes"". I will be happy to provide a copy of the notes I made in my diary. 

20The notes annexed to his Statement contain the following written on the page in the diary for 20 December 2010: 

Andrew Iskandar 
Him and his dad has been planning to do job for a while. He'll call his dad and ask his dad when they're going to kill the guy. 



(b) ERISP of Victor Lau 

21Victor Lau was a school friend of Andrew's. He received a telephone call from Andrew at 7:20am or 7:30am on the morning following the assault where Andrew informed him that he and his father had killed the deceased. Andrew asked Mr Lau if he would cover for him and say that he, Andrew, was at Burwood at 9:00pm and Mr Lau bumped into him. Mr Lau refused to do this. 

22In particular, Mr Lau said the following in his ERISP of 2 March 2010: 

Q17 Detective Sergeant MUNRO - Ok. What can you tell us about any information you may have to the murder of Mohd Saemin which took place at Leichhardt on the 21st of February 2010. 
A Yep well Andrew ISKANDAR he gave me a call at 7:20 or 7:30 around that time and he didn't go into details about what he did but he told me briefly in general what he did. He said that um there was this guy messing around with his mother. And that they chased him and then they crashed into his car. And after they got out and he had a hammer in his car. And I'm not sure if his dad had a knife or not but I presumed he had a knife. And then pretty much what they did was that they attacked him, eh (sic) smashed a hammer on his forehead and the he (sic) was nearly dead and his dad finished him off with a couple more stabs, into the back and stuff like that. 

... 

Q53 Detective Sergeant MUNRO - Ok, and what did he say? 
A He pretty much, first off he's like, you know ah he asked me questions like ah you know if something's messing with your mum, like would you, you know would you take him out or stuff like that. You know aww it needs to be or something you know. And then I was like ah ok, so like what's the point. And then he's just like some guy me and my dad killed some guy, and he said like aww he's gone to the grave now he's gone. And I was like aww what the hell like you know what did you do? And he's like we chased him and he got out ah pretty much we crashed his car and then he got out and you know pretty much smacked him you know with a hammer and a knife. ... 

Q54 Detective Sergeant MUNRO - Ok um, you mention a hammer and a knife, can you tell us anymore about what he said in relation to the hammer and the knife. 
A Like he was very brief with it, he didn't tell me any location, and he didn't tell me the names of anyone. He just said he got a hammer or something and then he smacked him in the forehead and that's pretty much all he said and that he was nearly about to die and his dad finished him off with the knife so pretty much that's what he told me. 

... 

Q62 Detective Sergeant FURIA - You indicate specifics that um that Andrew had used a hammer. 
A Yep. 

Q63 Detective Sergeant FURIA - And his father used a knife. Is that correct? 
A He indicated me like his dad finished him off and stabbed him so I'm presuming that pretty much had the knife. 

Should there be a separate trial? 

23The Crown accepted that if the accused are jointly tried there will be prejudice that flows to the Applicant from the admissions made by Andrew to Mr Lau and especially to Mr Maiava. But the Crown submitted that the case, in any event, is a strong one against the Applicant, particularly because the evidence is likely to show that it was the Applicant who was armed with the knife. Even if it was not the Applicant who was armed with the knife (as he asserted in his ERISP) the Crown relies on a joint criminal enterprise which included not only the motive and preparation, but the bringing to the scene of the hammer and the knife by the participants in that enterprise. 

24The Crown submitted further that a cut throat defence from Andrew was likely with the result that ordinarily there would not be separate trials. The Crown submitted that the significant focus in the judgment in Pham was whether the evidence might turn an acquittal into a conviction - is the evidence so highly prejudicial that an accused loses a chance of an acquittal because of it? It referred to what was said in R v Darwiche [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [233] about the inevitable consequence in a joint trial of the admission of evidence against one accused that would not be admitted against the other in a separate trial. 

25The Crown drew attention to the length of the trial and the doubling up which would occur from witnesses having to give similar evidence in 2 trials with the emotional trauma and inconvenience involved in that. 

26If the test remains what was said by Hunt J in Middis , a test which includes a determination that the case against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different from that admissible against the co-accused, it seems to me that that is the position in the present case. That is, the evidence against the Applicant is significantly weaker than the evidence against Andrew. Certainly there is not much doubt about motive or considerable planning on the part of the Applicant. Nor is there any doubt that he seriously assaulted the deceased. That assault together with the assault perpetrated by Andrew (or if the ERISP is to be believed, a stranger by the name of Salman) resulted in the death of the deceased. 

27The important matter is, however, accepting that at the time immediately before the deceased died the Applicant's intention was to inflict grievous bodily harm or death, when that intention was formed. The planning itself and the undoubted intention to bash the deceased in the weeks or days or hours before the assault does not inevitably show an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or to kill the deceased at that time. The jury will be asked to infer the requisite intention at the earlier time. The jury may not do so because they may not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant intended to do more than scare off the deceased by an assault, even a vicious assault. They may accept that part of the Applicant's ERISP where he says his intention was only ever to bash the deceased, even if they reject the lies which go towards protecting Andrew. 

28It is true that the presence of the knife is a matter of some significance because, if it was intended to use it to stab the deceased rather than merely to threaten him with it, there would be a stronger case for the inference that at the time he was stabbed there was an intention to inflict, at least, grievous bodily harm. Overall, however, the evidence admissible against the Applicant might not be sufficient to persuade the jury that the requisite intention was present at any time before the Applicant alighted from his car to assault the deceased. 

29By contrast, however, the case against Andrew is a strong one. It is not easy to see why the evidence of Mr Maiava and Mr Lau should be rejected. The details that Mr Maiava relate about the course of events points strongly to those matters having been told to him by Andrew. 

30If the first principle in Middis has been modified in Pham so that the issue is not, in the first place, a consideration of the relative weakness and strength of the Applicant and the co-accused's case respectively, the enquiry is a similar one - whether there will be a positive injustice to the Applicant by the evidence being likely to turn a potential acquittal into a conviction: Pham at [39]. But as Adams J goes on to point out, if the likelihood is real as distinct from inconsequential then there will be a positive injustice to the Applicant. 

31If the jury found the evidence of Mr Maiava and/or Mr Lau reliable they would be likely to conclude that Andrew told them what they say he told them. In the case of Mr Maiava, what he told them was that he and his father had intended to kill the deceased for some period of time. If they accept the evidence of Mr Lau they are likely to take the view that there was no last minute provocation to explain what might be thought to be a frenzied killing by Andrew and the Applicant who ""finished off"" the deceased by stabbing him further. In those circumstances there would be a much stronger inference available that there was always the intention to act as they had when they met up with the deceased that night. 

32The Crown stressed principles in discussed in Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [8] and [31] concerning the assumption that as a general rule juries understand and follow directions given by trial judges. The Crown submitted that an appropriate direction would be given to the jury regarding the use of the evidence of Mr Maiava and Mr Lau against the Applicant. 

33Two things can be said about that. First, although the assumption is as the High Court set out, there is the sort of exception to that assumption contained in what Hunt J said in Middis and in the various cases that have followed it. The prejudice may be such that directions are unlikely to overcome the prejudice, and hence, the discretion in appropriate cases to order a separate trial. So, for example, in R v Mahmoud Chami [2002] NSWCCA 136 Ipp AJA (with whom Bell J agreed) accepted at [19] - [20] that despite careful and explicit directions it might be difficult for a jury to remain entirely objective. 

34Secondly, and particularly in this case where the Crown relies on joint criminal enterprise, it would be extremely difficult for the jury to understand that admissions made by one participant in the joint criminal enterprise had to be entirely put out of their collective minds when considering the evidence against the other participant in the same enterprise in circumstances where they considered that that evidence about the admissions was reliable. They could readily conclude that Andrew always had the requisite intention. Since the case is put forward as a joint criminal enterprise it would be difficult for the jury not to conclude, on the basis of that evidence, that the Applicant also had the requisite intention at the earlier time. 

35In my opinion, where the jury is called upon in the case against the Applicant to draw inferences about when the requisite intention was formed, it would be very difficult for them to disregard the prejudicial evidence contained in the evidence of Mr Maiava and Mr Lau. There would be a positive injustice to the Applicant if the jury was to hear that evidence at his trial. The likelihood is real and not inconsequential. 

36In my opinion the countervailing factors regarding the time and cost of a second trial and the need for witnesses to give evidence a second time are of less significance; cf Mahmoud Chami at [24] concerning a complainant in sexual assaults committed on her. 

37In those circumstances, the application for a separate trial for the Applicant must be acceded to. 

Conclusion 

38I make the following orders: 

1. I order that the Applicant Hazairin Iskandar be tried separately from the Accused Andrew Iskandar. 

2. I stand over the trial of the Applicant to the Arraignments List on 11 November 2011.

2757986,R v DING [2011] NSWDC 184,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Weiwel Ding appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to one offence of dealing with money reasonably suspected to being the proceeds of crime. This is a comparatively new offence for which the maximum penalty, when the matter is dealt with in this Court, is three years imprisonment. The matter can also be dealt with summarily. If it is, there is a jurisdictional limit of 12 months. I take into account in formulating the appropriate sentence to impose upon Mr Ding that the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court. 

2The offence committed by Mr Ding, in very short form, was to have transferred a significant sum of money, indeed almost $300,000, from accounts of his in Sydney to a bank account of his father in China. It would appear that the offender would receive cash from persons unknown, put that into one of his bank accounts, move it from one bank account to another, and then transfer the money to his father. The sum of more than $300,000 in thirty transactions is significant when compared to the offender's income and financial circumstances generally. For example, ATO records show that his combined income for the financial years ending 2008 and 2009 was just more than $7,000. 

3There are suspicions that the money was the proceeds of card skimming operations. For example, the offender has on his criminal history an offence of making a false instrument and the statement of facts records that AFP officers believed that the offender was linked to premises where card skimming paraphernalia was found. But in reality, there is not sufficient information in the material before me to show precisely what form of offence these monies were the proceeds of, but it does not really matter. It is clear that the money was the proceeds of some crime, probably card skimming, but not necessarily so. 

4The offender told a psychologist that he did not believe that what he was doing was illegal, but that is very difficult to believe indeed, given the huge sums of money involved and the strange explanations offered by the offender as to why he was asked by others to do what he did. I have no hesitation at all in concluding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was well aware that what he was doing was assisting in illegal conduct. 

5Offences of this kind are, of course, serious. It is often the case that law enforcement officers become aware of the proceeds of crime being dealt with in a manner similar to this, without being able to identify the precise crime involved. One way that the authorities seek to minimise crime is through offences such as this which are an attempt to hinder criminals being able to take advantage of their ill gotten gains. The prosecution says that, objectively, the offences require full-time imprisonment, and Mr Steel made no submission to the contrary. 

6The offender is twenty-three years of age. He is the older of two children born and raised in China. His parents and his younger brother live in China. When the offender was seventeen he came to Australia, he said to the psychologist, to pursue further education. Once in Australia he began gambling, at first on poker machines, but after being told, accurately, by others, that it was impossible to make money through gambling on poker machines, he moved to Star City Casino. He gambled money there and, not surprisingly, lost. Now is not the time to express at length any judicial opinion as to efforts being spoken of in federal government circles to reduce the problems created by gambling, beyond saying that the judges of this Court are distressingly aware that problem gamblers are easy targets for criminals who need people to do what the offender did in this case, to transfer money, the proceeds of crime, so that the criminals can have access to it. 

7I mentioned that the offender has a criminal history. Indeed, he was on a bond at the time of these offences. It is difficult to assess his prospects for rehabilitation, or what is likely to happen in the future as regards other criminal behaviour by him. No doubt the sentence that he has received in this matter will act as some personal deterrent to him. It is also important that I consider the principles of general deterrence, and I have taken that matter into account in formulating the appropriate sentence. 

8The offender pleaded guilty and so in order to reflect his willingness to facilitate the course of justice, the sentence that I am about to impose upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

9Mr Ding has now spent a little more than seven months in custody for an offence that, the Crown concedes, is not at the top of the range of conduct covered by the offence. 

10In other cases I have expressed the view that following the High Court's decision in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 , it would not be surprising to find that, for commonwealth matters, unconstrained by the New South Wales Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , non-parole periods of about forty per cent of the head sentence are regularly imposed. If I formulate the appropriate head sentence and then consider a non-parole period of around that ratio, it is quite quickly seen that the offender is entitled to be released from custody immediately. The Crown did not speak in opposition to that result. 

11Although the non-parole period - as I will describe it, perhaps inaccurately - I am about to announce is more than forty per cent, it is only because there is no utility in formulating a precise ratio, given that it is my intention that I formulate an order that has the offender being released immediately. 

12So I impose on Mr Ding a sentence of imprisonment of fourteen months to date from 10 March 2011. He is entitled to be released on a reconnaissance release order self in the sum of $100 today, which is 13 October 2011.

		29 November 2011",2011-10-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2757987,R v David MARTIN [2011] NSWSC 1189,"JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE

1KIRBY J: On 20 June 2011, David Martin was arraigned before a jury upon charges that may be summarised in these terms: 

Count 1: That on 21 October 2007 at Bateau Bay he recklessly wounded Beau Janson. 

Count 2: That on 21 October 2007 at Bateau Bay he murdered Luke Hankey. 

2David Martin pleaded not guilty to each count. 

3Lisa Clare Mackett was arraigned at the same time before the same jury. She faced three charges, namely: 

Count 3: That knowing David Martin had committed the said murder, afterwards, namely between 21 October 2007 and 31 March 2008 at Bateau Bay and elsewhere, she did assist David Martin. 

Count 4: That on 21 October 2007 at Bateau Bay she assaulted Eva Hankey. 

Count 5: That on 21 October 2007 at Bateau Bay she assaulted Kellie Marshall. 

4On 6 September 2011, after a lengthy trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty against David Martin in respect of both counts 1 and 2. At the same time, the jury found Lisa Mackett guilty of the charges in respect of counts 3, 4 and 5. 

5The indictment presented by the Crown included a further count against David Martin, to which he pleaded guilty. That plea reaffirmed an earlier plea, entered on arraignment. The additional count was as follows: 

Count 6: That on 21 October 2007 at Bateau Bay he assaulted David Withers. 

6On 30 September 2011, I heard submissions on sentence in respect of David Martin. On that occasion, counsel for Lisa Mackett was not in a position to put submissions. 

7I will therefore proceed to pass sentence upon David Martin. Before I do so, I must first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion, in a manner consistent with the jury verdict. Where the facts are adverse, they must be found beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Martin, it is enough that they should be established on the balance of probabilities. 

The incident 

8In October 2007, David Martin and Lisa Mackett were living together in a rented house in Bateau Bay. They owned a red Ford Telstar motor vehicle. On Saturday 20 October 2007 at 5.00pm or thereabouts, they drove to the Bateau Bay Hotel, entering a large car park attached to the hotel via the Lumby Street gates. They parked their vehicle close to the hotel. 

9David Martin and Lisa Mackett then spent the evening in the beer garden of the hotel. They met with friends and were described as being in good spirits. During the course of the evening, and especially towards the end of the evening, there were fights inside and outside the hotel. An experienced hotel manager described the hotel as having an ""odd feeling"", which he ascribed to testosterone. There were significantly more males than females. Neither Luke Hankey nor David Martin was involved in the fighting inside the hotel before the hotel closed at midnight. 

10Patrons began leaving the hotel shortly before midnight. As recorded on CCTV footage, a brawl erupted approximately five minutes before midnight. At 12.12am, David Martin and Lisa Mackett passed through the exit doors into the car park. Luke Hankey and his group had gone through the same doors approximately three minutes before them. 

11David Martin said that he and Lisa Mackett had intended to walk home. Their house was only a short distance from the hotel. However, as they entered the car park there was yelling and shouting. There were groups of people. They became concerned that their car might be damaged, were it left over night. They therefore determined that they would drive home. 

12Lisa Mackett occupied the driver's seat, with David Martin as the passenger. The car was driven through the car park towards the Lumby Street gates. People, including Luke Hankey and his group, were walking towards the same gates. The gates provided a shared exit. Members of the group became aware of a car behind them, which they described as being driven erratically. 

13Ultimately, the path of the car was blocked by pedestrians. Luke Hankey was directly in front of the vehicle when it stopped. He apparently turned his back on the vehicle, putting plant material down his trousers and, as described by his sister, ""wiggled his bum"". 

14The horn of the car did not work. The female driver, Lisa Mackett, was heard to yell out, perhaps with expletives: ""Get out of the way; you'll get yourself killed"". The path of the car, however, remained blocked. Members of the crowd yelled at the occupants of the car. 

15In these circumstances, David Martin and Lisa Mackett both got out of the vehicle. David Martin picked up a blunt implement as he did so. The implement had a steel shaft at least 10 centimetres in length. The wounds later inflicted by this implement had a star shaped pattern, suggesting that it was probably a Phillips Head screwdriver. David Martin passed behind the vehicle, moving swiftly. He approached a group at the side of the vehicle, which included Beau Janson. 

16Using the steel implement, he struck Beau Janson twice on the left side of his neck. He inflicted wounds which penetrated the various layers of the skin. Fortunately, however, the wounds were relatively superficial. They did not require suturing. Beau Janson has been left with no residual disability (count 1). 

17The attack was unprovoked. Beau Janson had neither spoken to David Martin nor made any gestures towards him before the attack. After he was struck, he stumbled as he tried to get away. 

18David Martin then moved towards the front of the vehicle and confronted Luke Hankey. With a thrusting motion, requiring moderate to severe force, he struck Luke Hankey twice in the chest. The blunt implement, on one of these occasions, penetrated eight centimetres through to the heart and aorta. The other wound was relatively superficial. Again the attack was unprovoked. Within a short time, Luke Hankey collapsed. Death followed rapidly (count 2). 

19David Martin then confronted a third man, Danny Andrews, a member of the group. Danny Andrews backed away, holding both palms up, saying words to the effect: ""Go away, I don't want anything to do with you"". David Martin then returned to the driver's seat of the vehicle. 

20As this was happening, Lisa Mackett assaulted Luke Hankey's sister, Eva Hankey, and later Kellie Marshall. She then returned to the vehicle, occupying the passenger seat. 

21The whole episode took seconds rather than minutes. The vehicle then left at some speed, driven by David Martin. As it drove away, it was attacked by the crowd. 

22The vehicle, at the time of purchase, had a crack to the windscreen on the driver's side. As it sped off, someone in the crowd threw a blunt metal pole or similar object at the vehicle. It hit the already weakened windscreen, causing a number of additional cracks. The windscreen, however, did not shatter. The damage occasioned to the vehicle was an important aspect of the Crown case, providing a link between the vehicle of David Martin and Lisa Mackett and the incident in the car park. 

23Having left the hotel, David Martin drove the short distance to Rays Road, a connecting road that ultimately led to his home. The assault, the subject of count 6, occurred in Rays Road a minute or so after they had left the car park. David Withers, the victim of the assault, had spent the evening at the Bateau Bay Hotel. He left the hotel at about midnight. He was significantly affected by alcohol. He and a friend were walking home. Their journey took them along Rays Road. Once in Rays Road, they saw a parked vehicle belonging to a friend. As they crossed the road, approaching their friend's vehicle, the red vehicle of David Martin turned the corner. As it did so, David Withers and his friend were standing in the middle of the road. David Martin slammed on the brakes. He managed to stop the vehicle about two metres from them. As David Withers moved to the side of the road, he gave a wave to the driver of the vehicle, as if to say he was sorry. It was apparent to David Martin that they were very much affected by alcohol. 

24David Martin got out of his vehicle. He yelled abuse at David Withers and his companion. He then pushed David Withers in the chest and punched him in the right eye. David Withers was thrown back onto the bonnet of his friend's car. However, he was not seriously injured. 

25Lisa Mackett, meanwhile, slid across to the driver's seat of the vehicle. As she did so, she yelled out: ""We need to get out of here, we need to get the fuck out of here, we've got to go"". David Martin got back into the vehicle, occupying the passenger seat. The vehicle then drove off. 

The objective seriousness of the offences 

26Under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, standard non-parole periods have been fixed in respect of a number of offences (s54A(2)). Relevantly, the Act specifies a 20-year standard non-parole period in the case of murder (count 2), and a 3-year standard non-parole period for reckless wounding (count 1) (Division 1A Table). In each case, the standard represents an ""offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". 

27Submissions on sentence were made on 30 September 2011. Such submissions were made by counsel with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 in mind. On 5 October 2011 the High Court handed down its decision in Muldrock v R [ 2011] HCA 39. It unanimously determined that R v Way had been wrongly decided (at [25]). A sentence, including the non-parole period, must be determined in the manner described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen (at [26]). McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 said this at [51]: 

""[T]he judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case."" (emphasis added) 

28The maximum penalty for the offence serves as an indication of the relative seriousness of that offence. The standard non-parole period is another guide-post. 

29The Crown acknowledged there was no intention to kill. The trial was run upon the basis of an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The Crown suggested that the intention was formed sometime between leaving the car, carrying the blunt instrument, and using that instrument to stab Luke Hankey. There was, it was conceded, an absence of pre-meditation and planning (s21A(3)(b)). On the other hand, the use of a weapon was a circumstance of aggravation, as counsel for Mr Martin acknowledged (submissions p7). Further, the weapon was used with ""moderate to severe force"". 

30Counsel for Mr Martin drew attention to the duration of the offending behaviour, which was extremely short. Having left the car, the episode took seconds rather than minutes. The court was urged to find that the weapon was taken from the vehicle and I accept that it was. There was, counsel said, no gratuitous cruelty. Both counsel, addressing the test as it was in R v Way , said that the offence fell below the mid-range, although the Crown added ""not by a large margin"". 

31Dealing with the objective seriousness of the offence, Mr Martin and Ms Mackett exited the car because their progress was impeded. I infer that they each felt anger and frustration. It was essentially a case of road rage. I accept that the act of Mr Martin, in taking hold of the blunt instrument as he got out of the car, was impulsive. The instrument was probably a screwdriver. Although it is not an excuse, his consumption of alcohol is relevant to his state of mind. But for his impulsive decision to take hold of a weapon, these matters might have been dealt with in the Local Court and Mr Hankey would be alive today. His impulsive act in taking hold of a weapon was a moment of madness that has cost a blameless young man his life, and has had catastrophic consequences for Mr Martin himself. 

32Let me move from the offence of murder to the offence of reckless wounding in respect of Beau Janson (count 1). Mr Janson, it will be remembered, was the first victim, struck twice by the offender with the same blunt instrument. The offender struck, knowing of the possibility that wounds might be inflicted, as indeed they were. Fortunately, the wounds were superficial, presumably because Mr Janson stumbled or moved to defend himself. They were dressed by a doctor, but there was no residual disability or scarring. 

33The Crown acknowledged that the episode was brief and that David Martin then moved swiftly towards Luke Hankey. He also drew attention to the important statement of principle by Howie J in R v McCullough [2009] NSWCCA 94; (2009) 194 A Crim R 439 where the following was said at [37]: 

""Malicious wounding is principally a result offence. Generally speaking the seriousness of the offence will significantly depend upon the seriousness of the wounding. That is not to say that the manner in which the wound was inflicted, the reason for the infliction of the wound and the circumstances surrounding the wounding are irrelevant. The same can be said for an offence involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm: the more serious the harm inflicted the more serious the offence: see R v Mitchell and Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [27]."" 

34The Crown, again with R v Way in mind, acknowledged in these circumstances that the offence was below the mid-range of objective seriousness. The submissions of counsel for Mr Martin were to the same effect. 

35The offence of reckless wounding covers a large range of offending behaviour. Most wounds, although not all, are inflicted by means of a weapon. Nonetheless, the use of a weapon remains an aggravating circumstance (s21A(2)(c)). On the other hand, the fact that no substantial injury was inflicted is a mitigating factor (s21A(3)(a)). 

The subjective case 

36Let me move from the offences to the offender and examine the personal circumstances of David Martin. He was born in New Zealand in November 1979. At the time of the incident in the car park of the Bateau Bay Hotel, he was almost 28 years old. He will shortly turn 32 years. He did not give evidence on sentence. However, he gave evidence during the trial in which he referred to his childhood, his drug taking and the psychological problems that affected him at the time of the offences, principally anxiety. Whilst awaiting trial, he was seen on 14 September 2009 by a psychologist, Dr Katie Seidler. Dr Seidler prepared a report of 17 September 2009, which was tendered on behalf of Mr Martin. That report (exhibit 1) and Mr Martin's antecedents (exhibit A) are the source material from which the following description emerges concerning his subjective case. 

37Mr Martin's parents separated soon after he was born. He has an older sister. His mother later remarried an Australian. The family, including David Martin and his sister, then moved to Australia. His mother discouraged contact with his father in New Zealand. He is largely estranged from his father and has had almost no contact with his New Zealand family. 

38Mr Martin's mother and his step-father later had four children. They are now aged between 19 and 24 years. His mother, at some point, was diagnosed with schizophrenia and agoraphobia. She was said to be occasionally psychotic and often erratic. As a consequence, Mr Martin's childhood was described by the psychologist as ""difficult and likely traumatic"". Although he got on well with his siblings, he felt like an outsider within the family and did not feel loved. 

39From an early age, perhaps 11 or 12 years, he began taking drugs and drinking alcohol. He described himself as an above average student academically. Nonetheless, his erratic parenting, poor attendance at school, and his rebellious attitude, as well as drugs, inevitably led to failure at school. He left school at the age of 15 years without having completed Year 9. 

40At the same time, he ran away from home. He told the psychologist that for a time he slept in abandoned trains before moving to shared rental accommodation. He acknowledged that, at this point in his life, his peers were anti-social in their outlook. 

41It is unsurprising, in these circumstances, that he began to commit crime. In October 1996, Mr Martin was dealt with by the Children's Court for possession of housebreaking implements, entering enclosed lands, and two counts of break, enter and steal. A Control Order was made for a period of five months. In late 1997 and early 1998, Mr Martin was charged with further offences, including the destruction of property, possession of cannabis, common assault and resisting a police officer. In March and April 1998, the charges were dealt with by Wyong Children's Court and Gosford Local Court. Fines were imposed in respect of a number of offences. An order was made that he serve 300 hours community service in respect of the assault, and enter a two-year recognisance for having destroyed or damaged property. The terms of the recognisance included a requirement that he attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and accept drug and alcohol counselling. 

42In April 2001, Mr Martin was arrested under warrant for breaking and entering a building with intention to steal (three counts). The offences were no doubt a manifestation of his continuing drug use. He was also charged with having breached the recognisance. He was placed on a two-year bond. An order was made that he be subject to the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service. He was again ordered to serve 300 hours of community service. 

43On 28 February 2002, Mr Martin was arrested on a number of counts of break, enter and steal. On the 24 June 2002, taking account of matters on a Form 1, the court imposed a four year term of imprisonment commencing on the 28 February 2002 and expiring on the 27 February 2006, with a non-parole period of two years. He became eligible for release on parole on the 27 February 2004. A concurrent term of nine months imprisonment was later imposed for his failure to observe the terms of the community service order. 

44The custodial history of Mr Martin (exhibit 1) shows that he committed a number of offences during his term of imprisonment. His offences are consistent with an ongoing drug problem and/or a defiant attitude. Clearly his criminal history does not entitle him to leniency. He did, however, complete some TAFE courses. 

45Since leaving school, and when not in prison, Mr Martin has only worked very occasionally. Dr Seidler said this (exhibit 1): 

""20. According to his account, Mr. Martin has had difficulty participating in the competitive workforce consistently, which he attributed to a generalised lack of motivation for employment. Notwithstanding, Mr. Martin noted that he has worked briefly as a packer, dishwasher, factory hand and night filler. The longest period over which he has maintained consistent employment is approximately six months and Mr. Martin offered that, although he has never been terminated from employment, he has often left positions under difficult circumstances."" 

46Mr Martin has survived financially on the basis of social security benefits. Since forming his relationship with Ms Mackett, he has also performed domestic duties, including looking after her two daughters whilst she was at work. He told Dr Seidler that, since his release from jail in February 2004, he had a ""small network of stable and prosocial friends"". His record does show that for the three years or so following his release on parole he did not offend before the present offences. 

47Dr Seidler, having interviewed Mr Martin for a number of hours, saw no sign of significant psychopathological symptomatology. Mr Martin was in good physical health. He presented as a strong able-bodied individual. Dr Seidler arranged for him to undergo psychological testing. He was of normal intelligence. A personality test, however, suggested quite a disorganised state, which Dr Seidler thought may be a ""cry for help"" from a disordered individual. He was pervasively prone to negativity and depression. He had a history of self harm, including attempts at suicide. He suffered from anxiety. His consumption of drugs and alcohol was clearly a problem. At the time of her interview he was taking a mood-stabilising drug. 

48Mr Martin was arrested on 9 May 2009. He has been in custody since that time. In contrast to the 2002 to 2004 period of incarceration, there have been no offences since his arrest. I assume that he has been periodically tested for drugs. Counsel for Mr Martin submitted, and I accept, that there are signs that Mr Martin is maturing. Dr Seidler said and I accept, that whilst in jail and upon release, Mr Martin would benefit from psychological treatment in three areas: 
First, treatment for anxiety and depression; 
Secondly, treatment for anger management, since he has a propensity for aggression; 
Thirdly, counselling and treatment in respect of alcohol and drugs. 

49Mr Martin pleaded not guilty at trial to murder and reckless wounding. There has been no acknowledgement, since the jury verdict, of his involvement in the offences, nor any expression of remorse. 

50Inevitably I must impose a significant sentence. Notwithstanding the absence of an acknowledgement of responsibility and remorse, I believe that, with maturity, there are reasonable prospects for rehabilitation (s21A(3)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). 

The appropriate sentences 

51Let me turn to the appropriate sentences in respect of each offence. Beginning with murder, the starting point is that murder involves the felonious taking of a human life. It violates the sanctity of human life, which is the foundation of our community. It is the most serious crime in the criminal calendar. That seriousness is reflected in the maximum penalty that has been fixed by parliament, which is life imprisonment. It is also reflected in the standard non-parole period for a mid-range offence, which has been fixed at 20 years. Absent extraordinary circumstances, a conviction for murder calls for a substantial sentence to serve the interests of punishment. Such interests include denunciation of the conduct of the offender and deterrence of the wider community against similar conduct. 

52Objectively all cases of murder are very serious. Yet, as the legislation introducing standard non-parole periods recognises, the circumstances giving rise to murder may differ widely. At one end of the scale you have cold-blooded murders, committed with pre-meditation for financial gain by adults in full-possession of their faculties. At the other end you may have a domestic dispute where one party, in the course of an argument, overreacts and forever regrets that reaction. As Adams J recently noted in R v Whitmore (2009) NSWSC 520 at [46], any just system of criminal sentencing must reflect such differences. Here, the stabbing of Luke Hankey was a brutal and senseless act. Mr Hankey was a much-loved young man of great promise. His murder not only extinguished his young life but substantially robbed his family of their peace of mind and happiness. His mother and his partner, Ms Kellie Marshall, read victim impact statements (exhibits B and C). Each was a poignant reminder of the heart-ache and endless pain occasioned by Luke Hankey's death. The court extends its condolences to the family and Ms Marshall. I must of course deal with such material in a manner consistent with R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. 

53Having regard to all the circumstances, I accept that the crime falls below the mid-range by a margin greater than ""just below"". The Crown and counsel for Mr Martin have each referred to a number of authorities where persons have been recently sentenced for murder. I have read these cases with interest, although each case to some extent turns on its own facts. I have also been given statistics in relation to sentencing for murder since the introduction of standard non-parole periods. These statistics are maintained by the New South Wales Judicial Commission. 

54Having considered this material, the appropriate sentence for murder, I believe, is a non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment with an additional term of five years, a total term of 20 years. 

55Moving to the offence of reckless wounding, the maximum penalty for that offence is seven years imprisonment (s35(4) Crimes Act 1900). The standard non-parole period fixed for a mid-range offence is three years imprisonment. Taking account of the circumstances relevant to the sentence, the offence should be characterised as well below the mid-range. Counsel for the Crown and Mr Martin each provided a number of cases where persons had been sentenced for this offence. I have considered that material. The appropriate sentence I believe is a non-parole period of 18 months with an additional term of 6 months, a total term of 2 years. 

56Finally, dealing with the assault on David Withers, the maximum penalty is two years imprisonment (s61 Crimes Act 1900). There is no standard non-parole period. The assault upon David Withers was an aggressive burst of anger, which fortunately had no lasting consequences. Alcohol again is probably part of the explanation, although not an excuse, for Mr Martin's gross overreaction. There was a plea of guilty on arraignment, reaffirmed before the jury at the trial. A discount of 15 per cent should be allowed for the plea. The appropriate sentence, taking account of the plea, and with rounding, is a fixed term of imprisonment of six months. 

The total sentence 

57In determining the total sentence to be imposed, issues arise as to accumulation and concurrency. What is the appropriate total sentence? Should the sentences, or some of them, be accumulated or partly accumulated? Should one or more be made concurrent? The principles have recently been helpfully restated by Hall J in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115. It is relevant to enquire whether the crimes were committed in the course of a single criminal enterprise or episode. If they were, that may suggest that the sentences should be concurrent. 

58Here, counts 1 and 2 may be regarded as part of the same episode. They were committed within seconds of each other and in the same general area. The incident concerning David Withers was somewhat later, although not much later. It occurred several streets away. 

59However, even where two crimes may be regarded as part of the same episode, the court must still consider whether the sentence for one offence adequately comprehends and reflects the criminality of the other. Hall J, in the same case, stated one of the principles which should guide that assessment in these terms (at [52]): 

""(8) In cases involving assault with violence where the offences involve two or more attacks of considerable violence and are distinct and separate (eg, see Regina v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 41 at [50]) or in cases where there are separate victims of the attacks as in Wilson (supra), the closeness in time and proximity of the two offences will often not be determinative factors. See also Regina v KM [2004 ] NSWCCA 65."" 

60Here, there were two victims and separate acts of stabbing in relation to each. I do not believe that the sentence for murder adequately reflects the criminality involved in the additional offence of reckless wounding. There should be partial accumulation to the extent of 12 months, to reflect the principle of totality. 

61On the other hand, the Crown submitted that the attack upon David Withers in Rays Road was arguably a continuation of Mr Martin's anger and rage from the car park. Although remote geographically, and separated by a short interval, I believe the sentence in respect of the assault should be concurrent. 

62The total sentence, therefore, should include a non-parole period of 16 years with an additional term of 5 years, a total sentence of 21 years. It should date from the time of Mr Martin's arrest on 9 May 2009, when he was taken into custody. 
63Counsel for Mr Martin urged a finding of special circumstances. It is appropriate that I make such a finding, but only to reflect the small adjustment arising from accumulation. There is no question that Mr Martin has a number of issues that must be addressed whilst he is in gaol and after his release on parole, including drugs and alcohol as well as anger management. He will require an extended period of supervision. However, necessarily, the additional term that I have fixed, during which he will be eligible for parole, is significant. I believe it will be sufficient, without further adjustment, for him to undergo the treatment contemplated by the psychologist. 

64David MARTIN , I sentence you as follows: 

First, in respect of the charge of reckless wounding (count 1), you are sentenced to a non-parole period commencing on 9 May 2009 and ending on 8 November 2010 with an additional term of 6 months ending on 8 May 2011, a total term of 2 years. 

Secondly, in respect of the assault against David Withers (count 6), you are sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months, concurrent with the previous sentence, commencing on 9 May 2009 and ending on 8 November 2009. 

Thirdly, in respect of count 2, the murder of Luke Hankey, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 years commencing 9 May 2010 and ending on the 8 May 2025, with an additional term of 5 years, ending on 8 May 2030. 

65You will therefore be obliged to serve a total non-parole period of 16 years, with an additional term of 5 years. 

66You will be eligible for release on parole on 8 May 2025 and your sentence will expire on 8 May 2030.

2758006,R v STEVENS [2011] NSWDC 174,"Judgment 


1HIS HONOUR: John Andrea Stevens appears for sentence today after having been found by a jury to be guilty of a number of serious offences involving a sexual assault of a young woman who was visiting Australia as a tourist. I remind those present that there are orders prohibiting the publication of any evidence which identifies or tend to identify the name of the complainant. 

2Late on 16 January 2009 LN went out with a friend. LN was backpacking around Australia and was staying with another friend of hers, Dorthe Elkjaer in a backpackers hostel in George Street. 

3When LN went out that evening she was hoping to have a good time. LN had already consumed some red wine in her room at the hostel and was affected by alcohol by the time the two of them got to the Side Bar, which is also on George Street. LN remembers going into the Side Bar and thinking about buying a cocktail but thereafter has a significant gap in her memory. What she next recalls is waking up naked in bed with a complete stranger. This was the offender John Stevens. She had no idea where she was, she had no idea how she got there and she had no idea who she was with. She was dizzy, sick and could not move. In her evidence at trial she described it as if she had just woken up from surgery. 

4What followed was a series of sexual acts which took place, as the jury verdict clearly shows, without LN's consent. The first count on the indictment I will pass over for the moment. Although it was the first sexual act which occurred, LN was not aware of it. As far as she knew the sexual acts began by the offender touching LN's breasts, he then inserted a finger into her genitals before performing cunnilingus on her. LN's evidence was that at the time these things were happening she was not able to talk or do anything. She said that she was so tired she simply could not move. The next thing she remembered was Mr Stevens putting his fingers into her anus and then sticking those same fingers into her mouth. 

5It was at this point that LN managed to regain some strength. With some difficulty she got up out of bed, found her clothes on the end of the bed and dressed herself. She then went into the bathroom attached to the room where she had found herself. Whilst there she described herself as feeling sick, dizzy, confused and very, very exhausted. Whilst on the toilet she noticed some white liquid coming out of her genitals. She understood that this probably meant that someone had had penile vaginal intercourse with her while she was either asleep or if she was awake she could no longer remember it (this is the sexual act I passed over before). When she left the bathroom she tried to find the door out of the room, but in her confused state she simply could not find it. 

6She said in evidence that she was exhausted from the simple effort of going to the bathroom. As there was no where else to sit down in the room, she went and sat back on the bed. Mr Stevens then started to take her clothes off and although LN tried to keep them on she was so tired, exhausted and falling asleep that she could not do anything to prevent him from removing her clothes so that she was naked once more. He then tried to put his penis in her vagina and when that did not succeed he tried to put his penis in her anus, again without success. LN believed that she tried to say no, but it only came out as a whisper because she was very dizzy, confused and exhausted. She tried to push Mr Stevens away but was unsuccessful. He then tried to get her to masturbate him, but LN was so exhausted that even if she had wanted to do what he wanted her to do she could not have. He then finally spread her legs and put his fingers into her genitals once more. 

7By now LN had regained some strength. She sat up in bed and told Mr Stevens she wanted to go home. She managed to dress and she asked Mr Stevens where she was. She found her handbag on the floor and Mr Stevens gave her her mobile phone. It did not work and when later inspected by police it was discovered that the SIM card holder was broken. It had not been broken before when LN went out that evening. 

8LN and Mr Stevens together left the room that they were in, went down to the street where Mr Stevens put LN into a taxi and paid $20 for the taxi to take LN back to her backpackers hostel. 

9By now it was the morning of 17 January 2009. When LN got back to the hostel she immediately complained to Dorthe Elkjaer that she had been raped. She rang her mother overseas and was persuaded to go to a hospital. She did so where, importantly as it turned out, swabs were taken from her vagina. She also agreed that the police should be notified. The police took a statement from her and then attempted to identify who it was that had done these things to LN, but they were not successful. LN cut short her holiday and returned to her family a few days later. 

10Attempts were made to identify the premises where these offences had occurred and to identify the offender, but those attempts were unsuccessful. Eventually however, a DNA analysis was carried out on the swabs taken from LN's vagina. It was discovered that that DNA matched that of the offender. The police had records of Mr Stevens' DNA because of a remarkably similar offence he had committed a few years before. In the course of sexually assaulting another complainant he had left some of his DNA behind and it was this that enabled police to identify Mr Stevens as the man who had sexually assaulted LN. The police in Australia contacted LN who was overseas. They told her of this match and asked her whether she wished to proceed. She indicated that she did so and flew to Australia to give evidence against Mr Stevens at trial. 

11At that trial he faced ten separate allegations. Five offences of sexual intercourse without consent, two offences of attempted sexual intercourse without consent and three offences of indecent assault all relating to the sexual behaviour that I have identified earlier in these remarks on sentence. The most serious of those offences is of course the act of sexual intercourse without consent, particularised as the offender having penile vaginal sexual intercourse with the complainant, Count 1 on the indictment. He was found guilty by the jury on all ten counts. That verdict did not come as any surprise to me. 

12One of the matters that I have to determine concerns whether LN's drink was spiked and if so who did it. In this regard I have considered the circumstances of the offender's sexual assault of a different woman in August 2004, the matter which led to police having records of Mr Stevens' DNA. On that occasion a young woman went out one night and became separated from her boyfriend. She was left in the city with no money and no mobile phone, or at least one that worked. She was approached by the offender while she was crying. He invited her back to a place of work to which he had access, telling her that he would let her use his phone and send her home in a taxi. Once they arrived at the office things took a turn for the worse. The young lady fell asleep. She did not intend to do so but that is what happened. She woke up after the offender had sexually assaulted her. She ran away, complained to some passers-by and the police were contacted. Although the offender did not ejaculate inside the young lady, he ejaculated nearby because some of his DNA was identified upon forensic analysis of the room where the acts occurred. 

13There are some similarities between the experience of LN and the young lady I have just described. In each case after meeting up with the offender they woke up to find that the offender was sexually assaulting them. The relevance of this earlier matter is twofold. It firstly helps me determine the factual basis on which I will sentence the offender and secondly it says a lot about the offender's character and the need to personally deter him from further offending of this kind. 

14Attempts were made to discover whether LN had been drugged. From the way she described feeling when she woke up it was clearly the case that it was quite likely that she had been drugged in some way. A sample of urine was taken from her but not until after many hours had elapsed. When that urine was tested morphine was identified. Evidence in the trial involving LN was that morphine could be found in a person's urine if the person had taken morphine or heroin or codeine. LN denied taking any of those drugs. I can rule out codeine as the source of the morphine because the evidence at trial was such that if the morphine had come from codeine, some of the parent drug, that is codeine, would have been found in her urine and that was not the case. Thus the source of the morphine in LN's urine was either morphine or heroin. 

15I am satisfied and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that LN was drugged at some stage after becoming separated from her friend in the Side Bar, perhaps by morphine or heroin being slipped into a drink she was consuming. I make that finding because of the urinalysis results, the evidence of the expert as to the circumstances in which morphine would be found in a person's urine, the denial, which I accept, of LN that she had voluntarily taken any such drug, the description she gave of the way she felt after she woke up in bed with Mr Stevens and the way in which she described the difference between the way she felt on that occasion and the way she had felt on earlier occasions when she had had too much alcohol to drink. 

16I should mention also that it is entirely possible that another drug or drugs, perhaps GHB, was also used to spike LN's drink. The evidence was that that drug metabolises very quickly and so if it had been given to LN in the early hours of 17 January 2009 there would be no evidence of it in her urine sample taken hours later. It is not necessary for me to decide precisely what drug was used to spike LN's drink. I am satisfied that the drink was spiked with a drug and that, together with the alcohol she had consumed voluntarily, led her to be in a state she described in evidence at the trial. 

17However I am unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that it was this offender who spiked her drink and indeed the Crown does not suggest that I could make that finding. In any case I note the accused faces no charge that he spiked LN's drink and so I will sentence him on the basis that although LN was very vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and the drug upon her when he sexually assaulted her, the offender was not responsible for her being in that state. 

18Another factual matter which I should determine concerns the state that LN was in when the offender had penile vaginal intercourse with her. As I have said that is Count 1 on the indictment. It will be remembered that LN was unable to describe that act. However the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such an act did occur in part at least because sperms cells containing DNA which matched that of the offender were found on a swab taken from LN's vagina. 

19It was the Crown case at trial that LN was actually asleep when that act occurred. However given the state of the evidence from those with expertise in the area that I heard at trial, I consider it is possible that LN was actually awake during that act but that the drugs and alcohol which she had consumed caused her to be unable to remember it. It is possible that what LN describes as waking up, was in fact the ability for her to lay down fresh memories returning. Although I make this finding, that is that I cannot say that LN was necessarily asleep when the act of penile vaginal intercourse occurred, I can say that the objective gravity of that matter is not really affected by the question as to whether LN was asleep or awake. Given her state, even if she was awake she was as defenceless as if she was asleep. 

20Of course the objective gravity of count 1 is particularly serious. The accused had that form of sexual intercourse with LN which is generally regarded as the most serious form of sexual intercourse covered by the definition of that term. The courts have traditionally regarded the risks of both pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease which are associated with unprotected penile vaginal intercourse, as well as the very personal, intimate nature of such acts as demonstrating that offences of this kind are very serious indeed. Of course in this case I note that the presence of sperm cells on the vaginal swab indicates that the offender had unprotected sex with LN. 

21The offender is now fifty-two years of age. As I have indicated he has a criminal history which includes the early sexual assault matter I have referred to. There are other less serious matters on his criminal history as well. He has committed offences in both New South Wales and South Australia where he was born. 

22He had an upbringing which was, and I do not wish to understate this, significantly less than was desirable. He was born to a mother who he believes was a prostitute and a biological father who he says was a Judge in South Australia. He was not brought up by them however. Instead he had foster parents. He told the psychologist (and later gave evidence that what he told the psychologist was true) that his foster mother was violent and uncaring who would physically assault him in harsh ways as well as doing similar things to other foster or adopted children in her care. Those violent acts involved weapons as well - garden hoses or belts or things of that kind which resulted in welts and lacerations to his body. His foster father was no use, he was apparently unengaged with the children and did not act in any way to protect Mr Stevens and other children from his foster mother's violent acts. 

23At the age of ten he was adopted by his foster mother, but it was also at about this time that his birth mother committed suicide. At the age of thirteen or fourteen he moved out of the family home but lived in a shed at the back of the family property and at fifteen left home joining a travelling carnival. He moved to Sydney in 1985. Not surprisingly, given the history that I have described, he does not maintain a relationship with any of his family members from South Australia. 

24He went to school but only completed Year 7 before commencing work. He has had various forms of employment over the years, mostly building working as a plasterer or plasterer's apprentice. He told the psychologist that he prided himself on his strong work ethic and was proud of his ability to provide for his family. He has a number of children. He has been involved in two long term relationships, one of which resulted in Mr Stevens and his partner having seven sons. The relationship was not entirely smooth with Mr Stevens expressing some dissatisfaction as to the level of affection and intimacy between him and what is now his former partner. After their separation there was no contact with his children for some time, but in the twelve months before he went into custody bail refused on these matters in March 2010, he had resumed contact with his children which has been terminated by him as a result of the matters now before me. 

25The offender has a limited history involving the use of drugs and does not appear to have been a terribly heavy user of alcohol. Of course the offender denied at trial and continues to deny his guilt on these charges. His description of the events that took place in his room was very different to that given by the complainant. What the offender described was not only consensual but enthusiastic sexual activity on the part of the complainant. The offender of course is not to be punished for having put forward a completely fanciful version of events. He is not to be punished for having pleaded not guilty, but it does remain the case that not only does the sentence I impose not have any component based on the utilitarian value that a plea of guilty would have had, but of course it is impossible to say that Mr Stevens is remorseful for what he has done. 

26The offences, particularly those involving sexual intercourse without consent, are serious ones indeed. Parliament has indicated the seriousness with which Judges should treat those offences by nominating the maximum penalty for those offences of fourteen years and a standard non-parole period of seven years. I take into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in determining the appropriate sentences for those offences of sexual intercourse without consent. It is clear that there has been an increasing concern with offending of this kind. Indeed when the offence of sexual intercourse without consent was first created in 1981 the maximum penalty was seven years. That has now been doubled and the standard non-parole period which applies to those offences is the same as the maximum penalty when the offence was first introduced. 

27Ms Moen said that these offences were opportunistic. That appears to be the case. As I have said I am not going to sentence the offender on the basis that he spiked LN's drink or that he set out on the evening of 17 January 2009 with any plan to commit any offence. On the other hand it is clear that he took advantage of a woman clearly unable to defend herself or to offer any realistic opposition to his illegal conduct. 

28The Crown Prosecutor appearing at trial described the behaviour as predatory. If we can remove the somewhat emotive aspect of that description, it is nevertheless accurate. We do not know precisely in what circumstances the offender and LN met, but they were clearly circumstances in which LN revealed herself to be in a poor way which the offender must have then decided to take advantage of. 

29Ms Moen submits that no force was used to commit any of these offences. Indeed it appears that none was required. I will take into account in the offender's favour that he did not use force to overcome any resistance on the part of LN because she was incapable of offering any realistic resistance at all. I also recognise that these offences are or have been described as violent in themselves. Forced sexual intercourse with a woman who is not consenting is a violent action. 

30The offender was also intoxicated, although that is of little mitigation in the present case. Even highly intoxicated people know that it is seriously wrong to do what the offender did to LN that morning. 

31The offender gave evidence on sentence. He described events where he had been assaulted whilst in custody. Adopting the peculiar code of conduct that prisoners do, it appears that spiking someone's drink and then sexually assaulting them is something that is looked at with disfavour by some prisoners. I will repeat I cannot sentence the offender on the basis that he did spike LN's drink, but what is more important is the circumstance that a belief that he did has led to him being assaulted whilst in custody, and it is at least possible that the offender is at risk of further assaults whilst in custody, and that on top of that he is going to do his time in custody much harder than otherwise because of a constant fear of further assaults. I will take those matters into account very much in the offender's favour. 

32The offender is now on protection, not one of those forms of protection where association with other prisoners is limited indeed, but nevertheless it is a form of protection. It is no longer the case that that circumstance automatically leads to a reduction in the sentence to be imposed upon an offender, but I do take into account in the offender's favour that there is at least the risk that he will serve the entirety of his sentence on protection and that there is at least the risk that if that occurs the circumstances of his incarceration will be harder than those that would apply to the general prison population. 

33In this case, more than most, there needs to be a significant component of personal deterrence built into the sentence that I will impose upon the offender. The remarks on sentence of the Judge who sentenced Mr Stevens for his earlier offence of this kind were put before me. The Judge said that he was satisfied that the risk of further custody would act as a personal deterrent to the offender. It appears that the length of the term imposed on that occasion was insufficient to act as a personal deterrent, because only a few months after the offender's sentence expired he committed this serious series of offences. As well as personal deterrence, general deterrence and retribution are also very important aspects of the sentence that I must impose. 

34It is difficult to make a finding that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. It is not automatically the case that a person who pleads not guilty does not have good prospects of rehabilitation, but in the present case, given the fact that the offender has sexually assaulted two separate people in the past and has admitted neither offence, there is nothing to suggest that given the same set of circumstances - that is, him coming across a defenceless woman in the future - he would not act precisely as he has acted on those two earlier occasions. 

35Ms Moen made a submission that I would make a finding of special circumstances. Ordinarily this is not the sort of case where I would make such a finding. The commission of these offences so soon after earlier similar offending would be a circumstance pointing strongly against making any finding which would involve leniency towards the offender. But in this case I will make a finding of special circumstances. 

36The offender has little, if any, family support. He will benefit from the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service upon his release from custody, in particular because of that lack of other family support or even friends to support him. Of course not only will that benefit the offender, but if it does reduce the prospect of further offences being committed, the finding of special circumstances will also benefit others in the community who might have otherwise become the victims of further offending by Mr Stevens. 

37The sentences for those offences carrying standard non-parole periods do not involve me imposing the standard non-parole period. The reasons that I have done that are to be found in these remarks on sentence. 

38The final thing I want to say before I impose sentence concerns the question of accumulation. Although Count 1 on the indictment is clearly the most serious count and although all the other sexual activity took place during the one connected series of events, it would be quite wrong for anyone, least of all the offender, to think that having committed a serious act of penile vaginal intercourse he would not be punished for further sexual assaults committed at about the same time. On the other hand of course the principle of totality applies. For those reason I will impose concurrent sentences on some counts and partially accumulate others to reach an overall sentence which I believe properly reflects the overall circumstances of this case. I impose sentence as follows. 

39For Counts 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9 I impose fixed terms of imprisonment of eighteen months, to date from 12 March 2010. 

40On Counts 3, 4, 5 and 10 I impose non-parole periods of three years, to date from 12 March 2011 and head sentences for those matters of four years. 

41On Count 1 I impose a non-parole period of four years, to date from 12 March 2012 and a head sentence of seven years. The non-parole period will thus expire on 11 March 2016 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 

42The overall sentence that I have imposed consists of an overall non-parole period of six years with a period of eligibility for parole of three years, making an overall head sentence of nine years imprisonment.

		15 November 2011",2011-10-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758008,Director of Public Prosecutions v Anthony David MARKOVSKI [2011] NSWLC 31,"JUDGMENT 

1The Offender, Anthony David Markovski, was presented for sentence having pleaded guilty to the following charges - 

""(For that he) on 5th February, 2010, at Wagga Wagga, did negligently drive a motor vehicle upon the Olympic Highway, thereby causing the death of May Edna McDonald."" 

""(For that he) on 5th February, 2010, at Wagga Wagga, did negligently drive a motor vehicle upon the Olympic Highway, thererby causing the death of Ivy Violet Cardwell."" 

""(For that he) on 5th February, 2010, at Wagga Wagga, did negligently drive a motor vehicle upon the Olympic Highway, thereby causing grievous bodily harm to Alana Mercuri."" 

2For the first two counts, the prosecution is brought under section 42(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, which provides, relevantly for present purposes - 

(1)A person must not drive a motor vehicle negligently on a road or road related area. 

Maximum penalty: 

(a) if the driving occasions death-30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence), 

3The third count is brought pursuant to section 42(1)(b) of the Act, which provides, relevantly, 

(1)A person must not drive a motor vehicle negligently on a road or road related area. 

Maximum penalty: 

(b) if the driving occasions grievous bodily harm-20 penalty units or imprisonment for 9 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence), 

4Section 188(2) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 says that if the Offender has not been convicted of any major previous offence as defined within section 3 of the Act within the preceding 5 years (as is the case here), he is automatically disqualified from holding a driver's licence for 3 years and, if the Court thinks fit, it can either impose a longer period of disqualification or a shorter period but to not less than 12 months. 

5The preceding three paragraphs are a worthwhile exercise to rehearse because the maximum penalties thus illustrated are indicative of the way in which Parliament regards the offences and thus they represent the public's view of the seriousness of the crime: R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53. The maximum penalty is fundamental to a determination of the seriousness of the type of offence before the court and hence to the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender: R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174. 

6This is part of the necessary process of assessing the objective gravity of the offence: see, for example, R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 . See also R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594; Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. 

7As is usual in the Local Court, a set of Agreed Facts has been tendered which is not subject to any challenge and I proceed to deal with the case on that factual basis. This document is admitted on Sentence and marked Exhibit 1. The Offender was originally charged with Dangerous Driving cause Death (x 2) and GBH (x 1). A brief was ordered and the matter set down for Special Fixture committal hearing on 14 July 2011. 

8On that day, the Court file records pleas of guilty to the present charges being entered with the more serious charges being withdrawn, I take it, following negotiation with the Director of Public Prosecutions. By letter of 13 July 2011, the Offender's Solicitors sent a letter to the Registrar advising that the matter would not be proceeding as a committal hearing as the case had resolved. Similar correspondence was received from the Officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions 

9The present pleas of guilty were entered before the Court on 14 July 2011 and adjourned until 14 October 2011 for sentence. A full Pre-Sentence Report was also ordered and provided by Corrections Victoria. 

Salient Facts 

10The Agreed Facts are marked Exhibit 1 on Sentence. For the purpose of these Remarks on Sentence I will provide my own brief summary. The Offender and his girlfriend, Ms Alana Mercuri, travelled to Brisbane by air on 4 February 2010, for the purpose of purchasing a motor vehicle. The business was completed and the Offender and Ms Mercuri left Brisbane about 8.20pm in the vehicle to travel to the Offender's home in the Central Victorian town of Bylands. They intended to travel by the inland route. The Agreed Facts set out a reconstruction of the Offender's driving times and stops made for fuel and food along the way. 

11About 11.20am on 5 February 2010, the Offender was driving the vehicle south on the Olympic Highway at a reconstructed speed of about 78 kilometres per hour. A Mazda sedan driven by May Edna McDonald, 56 years old, and her 91 year old front passenger, Ivy Violet Cardwell, was proceeding north at a reconstructed speed of about 109 kilometres per hour. 

12At a point some 500 metres south of the Kapooka Bridge, the Offender's vehicle was seen by the driver of a vehicle following the Mazda to cross unbroken double centre lines onto the incorrect (or northern-travelling) side of the road. This diversion was described by the witness as ""a sharp movement rather than a drifting across action"". The vehicles approached each other at a closing speed of 52 metres per second and the collision occurred wholly within the northbound lane. The Accident Investigators expressed the view that taking into account the camber of the road, including the crest of the hill, it would not have been possible for the Offender or Mrs McDonald to have perceived and reacted to the imminent danger of the oncoming vehicle to avoid a collision. Both May McDonald and Ivy Cardwell were killed on impact. 

13Ms Mercuri was cut from the vehicle and transported to Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. She suffered multiple injuries including broken ribs and teeth, lacerations, bruising and, most significantly, a fractured L1 vertebra. This latter injury required her transport by air to The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. There she received corrective surgery involving the insertion of two rods in her back to stabilise the injury. The Offender alighted from the vehicle without assistance and first aid was rendered at the scene by the witness and other motorists. At this point he briefly lost consciousness. His injuries consisted of a broken nose and some lacerations and bruising. A blood sample returned a negative result for alcohol and drugs. Although not specifically mentioned, I am prepared to take it the Offender's vehicle was also examined and no mechanical defects or failures found which may have contributed to the collision. 

14When the Offender was interviewed about the collision in June 2010, he said that he swerved onto the incorrect side of the road to avoid hitting a small animal, described as a fox or dog, running towards his vehicle from the left. He estimated this placed three quarters of his vehicle on the incorrect side of the road. He said that he saw Mrs McDonald's vehicle approaching and he turned further right to get off the road as that was the direction his vehicle was already travelling. 

15For my part, that is a possible version unable to be tested. The witness following Mrs McDonald's car made no mention of seeing any small animal on the roadway before or after the collision. However, as pointed out by Mr Gibson in his submissions, it was almost the first thing the Offender mentioned at the scene and more likely than not to be correct. Again, for my part, and acknowledging the estimation involved in the change-over of driver and stops along the way, I initially felt there might be some element of sleep deprivation, although certainly not established beyond reasonable doubt. Losing consciousness a number of times following the collision, as he told the author of the Pre-Sentence Report, does not exactly qualify him as an accurate historian. The vehicle seemed to have made pretty good time from Brisbane to just outside Wagga Wagga. 

16It is at once apparent that there are none of the usual aggravating factors so often seen in fatal collisions such as speed, alcohol or drugs. There is no evidence of any sustained aberrant driving behaviour leading up to the point of collision. As I understand the prosecution's case, it relies upon the allegation that the Offender travelled onto the incorrect side of the road having swerved to avoid some small animal and, in so doing, failed to keep a proper lookout in the circumstances. As I further understand it, the plea of guilty is entered on that basis and the Defence submits that I should regard any culpability as momentary inattention or misjudgement. This is an important concept to understand because it would be quite wrong to conclude that due to a collision in which a death occurred it must inevitably follow that a serious criminal charge has been committed. One does not simply look at the consequences, tragic as they are, and work backwards. 

17I refer, for example, to the types of charges provided by section 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, as amended in 1994, and the Guideline Judgments in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 229-230 and re-formulated in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 . Even more serious are the so-called cases of motor vehicle manslaughter requiring proof of gross criminal negligence or an unlawful and dangerous act: see, for example, R v Pullman (1991) 25 NSWLR 89 at 97 applied in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. 

18None of the evidentiary requirements for proof of these categories of offence are present in this case. That is why the charge is brought pursuant to the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, rather than the Crimes Act 1900. That is why I am particularly mindful of the principles in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 . 

The Offender's background 

19The Offender is currently aged 22 years and resides in the family home in Bylands (outside of Kilmore), a town in central Victoria. He is nearing completion of an Electrical Apprenticeship. He has no prior criminal history. 

20There is a Pre-Sentence Report as part of the Court file. It is a comprehensive document and I do not propose to rehearse the content in any detail. It can speak for itself. The report says the Offender is one of four siblings who enjoyed a loving and supportive upbringing which was otherwise unremarkable. He says none of his friends have been involved with the criminal justice system. He has no physical, mental impairments or disabilities nor any prior need for psychological or psychiatric treatment. The Offender attended for some counselling but at the request of his girlfriend. He is fully employed and sees his future within the electrical industry. There is no prior indication of illicit drug use and alcohol is not a problem in his life. The report says he is at moderate risk of re-offending and that ""factors that pertain to his risk level include his age and gender"". 

21The report concludes that based on the information provided by the Offender during the interview, he has been assessed as suitable for a Community Based Disposition, however, he would gain little benefit from being placed on such an order. He has no drug or alcohol abuse, is currently completing an apprenticeship therefore employed full-time and is presenting with no current concerns or issues. The Service Management Branch would accept the Offender for ""informal supervision"" should he receive a Community Based order. 

22It is clear that the Offender appears before the Court as a person of good character. I am left with the impression that he is a hard-working and otherwise decent individual. That is a mitigating factor to be properly taken into account and I will do so. However, the authorities point out that courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in these cases to avoid giving the impression that persons of good character may, by their action, take the lives of others and yet receive lenient treatment: see, for example, R v MacIntyre (1988) 38 A Crim R 135 at 139. See also R v Musumeci (Unreported, NSWCCA, 30/10/1997) . 

23I said earlier on in these Remarks on Sentence that notwithstanding the present charge was brought pursuant to what might be called Traffic Legislation as opposed to provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, the matters cannot be regarded as anything other than serious. One only has to look at the penalties provided by law, that is, the potential amount of a fine, the potential term of imprisonment and automatic period of license disqualification to appreciate that. I conclude that the negligence was at the lower end of the scale of offending. 

24Both guidance and binding authority is provided to the Court in dealing with an offence of ""Negligent Driving cause Death"" in the judgment of Howie J in Bonsu v R [2009] NSWCCA 316. That was a Judge Alone trial with the Accused being acquitted of a charge of Dangerous Driving Cause Death (s 52A, Crimes Act ) but found guilty of a back-up charge of Negligent Driving cause Death (s 42(1)(a), Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999) by virtue of section 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The finding was based on momentary inattention. The Accused was 28 years of age with no criminal history and a very minor traffic history. The primary judge sentenced the Offender to 200 hours Community Service. He was later presented before another Judge for failing to complete that Community Service and sentenced to imprisonment for three months. Howie J was critical of the approach of the re-sentencing judge. Due to what his Honour felt was undue lenience in the original CSO plus the manner in which the re-sentencing Judge came up with a three month gaol sentence (part of which was served), his Honour was constrained to impose a 12 month Bond under section 9 of the sentencing legislation, adding that the Offender got off very lightly. 

25But of particular importance to the circumstances of the present Offender's case (which have surprising commonality with the facts and antecedents of Mr Bonsu) is severe criticism of the way sentencing for the offence of Negligent Driving cause Death has been, and is being, handled in the Local Court and District Court on appeal. It is criticism which cannot be overlooked or ignored. 

26The only real factual difference is the ages of the two Offenders - the Offender being 23 years of age and Mr Bonsu being aged 28 years. Otherwise, they share: 


no prior criminal history; 

nil or minor traffic history; 

momentary inattention or lapse in judgment; 

what caused the momentary inattention is left un-stated or is otherwise undetermined; 

subjectively, they are both worthwhile members of society; 

they are persons who could rightly be regarded as of prior good character; 

each was genuinely remorseful and contrite for their actions. 

27His Honour was referred to a number of statistical tables and said at [18] - [19]: 

... as so often is the case, what they reveal is that the maximum penalty imposed by the statute has little or no impact upon the sentences being imposed. Every time this Court is asked to consider statistics on any offence, other than perhaps murder, the statistics reveal a markedly lenient approach to sentencing, having regard to the maximum penalty imposed. 

However, the statistics reveal that very minor sentences have been imposed upon offenders who have actually caused the death of another human being, albeit by negligent driving. I have difficulty in understanding how s. 10A or s. 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 can be used for such an offence. It seems to me, that these statistics reveal that little regard, or insufficient regard, is being paid in the Local Court or the District Court on appeal to the fact that the offender being sentenced has caused the loss of life. 

28His Honour returned to comment upon the only penalty he was able to impose upon Mr Bonsu and warned that it should in no way be regarded as some form of precedent. At [24] he said: 

Nothing that I say in this matter and the penalty I impose should be taken in any way by either a Magistrate in the Local Court or a Judge in the District Court to indicate that a good behaviour bond is an appropriate penalty for this offence in these circumstances. I have made my view clear, for what it is worth, that the range of penalties being imposed, at least in the Local Court, is inadequate and fails to reflect the fact that offenders charged with this offence have taken a human life. 

29It is abundantly clear that Howie J in Bonsu advocates nothing short of a full-time custodial penalty for an offence of Negligent Driving cause Death. In this case, it resulted in the deaths of two completely innocent persons and the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon a third. This remains so even though the individual culpability of the Offender is of a lower order: see Bonsu at [24] . So much is apparent when he said that he would not have interfered with the three month sentence had it been imposed by the original trial judge instead of the CSO which he regarded as inadequate. 

Plea of Guilty 

30The offences occurred in February 2010. The Court Attendance Notice created on 14 July 2010. Pleas were entered on the day appointed for the committal hearing, that is, 14 July 2011, the pleas having been so notified in writing to the Registry on the previous day. There was no offer by the Defence to plead to lesser charges well beforehand. It follows that the present pleas were not entered at the first available opportunity (within the contemplation of R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] 49 NSWLR 383) but after the forensic advantage afforded by negotiations: see R v Stamboulis [2006] NSWCCA 56. 

31By his pleas of guilty, the Offender admits the necessary elements of the crimes plus the necessary mental state for their commission. While the Offender is entitled to some measure of discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, such discount is necessarily limited: see R v Thomson; R v Houlton. See also R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 and section 22, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In this case, I would allow a discount of 15 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas. 

Defence Submissions 

32I was helpfully provided with a copy of Written Submissions by Mr Gibson who addressed me most carefully on each of the points raised. It is not necessary for me to rehearse those submissions in great detail. In response to my mention of sleep deprivation, Mr Gibson took me to the recorded interview where the Offender said he had had about 5 to 6 hours sleep in the 14 hour journey. I agreed with Mr Gibson that the negligence in this case is at the lower end of the scale. I have earlier expressed my view as to the timing of the pleas and their utilitarian value. It is hard to find fault with Mr Gibson's submission that the Court should regard this tragedy as being brought about by a ""conspiracy of events"" or a ""confluence of facts"". These, he said, were a combination of the animal, the crest of the hill (particularly as depicted in the scale plan) and the approaching (or closing) speed of the vehicles. There was, in effect, no chance for anyone to do anything to avoid the inevitable collision. 

33I accept the Offender is remorseful and has suffered emotionally and physically as a result of his conduct. I accept he made no attempt to avoid responsibility. The report of Doctor Forrester was extremely helpful in this difficult exercise. She noted the Offender's significant difficulty sleeping, flashbacks of the collision, lowered mood and increased anxiety and a sense of guilt particularly in relation to what the families of the Deceased might be going through. She opines his symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. 

34Importantly, Doctor Forrester says the Offender is in the low category of risk and need in relation to future re-offending. For reasons set out, she cautions against the imposition of a full-time custodial disposition. Mr Gibson echoes her prospects of rehabilitation, which he describes as excellent. Mr Gibson says the Offender is a unique individual. For one so young he has taken on the responsibility of two residential properties for which he saved the deposits and services the mortgages. 

35Mr Gibson stressed the good character of the Offender. He tendered testimonial materials from: 


Very Reverend Father Spirkoski; 
Father P.J. Rankin; 
Mr Andrew Pain; 
Mr Battista Mercuri, the father of Alana Mercuri; 
Mr Hugh Tighe. 

36All have been unstinting in their praise of the Offender as a mature young man and hands-on contributor to his community. They are people who have known the Offender and his family well over many years and are in a position to provide a level-headed, unbiased assessment of the Offender and his qualities. Taken together they are impressive. 

Crown Submissions 

37Mr Hanshaw reminded the Court of the penalties provided by the Parliament and stressed the objective seriousness of the offences. The negligent act, he said, was in swerving into the north-bound lane. He did not take issue with Mr Gibson that the negligence was at the lower end of the scale of offending. Each Counsel referred me to Bonsu - Mr Gibson seeking to distinguish the case on its facts and Mr Hanshaw relying on the apparent similarities. He avised the Court that a Community-based Order (or Community Service Order) cannot be transferrred inter-State. Mr Gibson submitted that it would be unfair to deprive the Offender of a non-custodial option through no fault of his own. That is true, but only if a non-custodial penalty was appropriate. 

Matters of General Principle 

38This case calls for a proper consideration of sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I do not propose to rehearse the relevant provisions for present purposes. It is my view that no penalty other than imprisonment is warranted because of the objective seriousness of the charges: see also Bonsu . Having concluded that custodial sentences are the only appropriate sentences, I then turn to consider whether they should be suspended: see R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 per Howie J at [32]; Barlow v R [2008] NSWCCA 96. I am not persuaded that any sentences should be suspended. 

39The issue arises as to whether any sentences imposed in respect of the offences with which I am now dealing should be served cumulatively. In Vaovasa v R [2007] NSWCCA 253 at [15] Howie J said: 

It has been made clear that, simply because a number of offences arise out of the same incident or course of criminal conduct, it does not follow that concurrent sentences will be appropriate to meet the total criminality involved. 

40His Honour referred to the decision in Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41, and continued at [16]: 

This is not a new principle. Similar observations have been frequently made in this Court since Pearce was taken to require that each individual sentence imposed reflect only the criminality of the conduct to which it related and that the totality principle be addressed by an order making the individual sentences concurrent or at least partly cumulative. 

41In response to a submission that this was simply one ongoing episode of criminality, and accordingly, any sentences imposed should be wholly concurrent, I refer to the judgment of Howie J (Gyles JA, Fullterton J agreeing) in R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255 at [36]: 

This Court has been at pains to make it clear that sentences for multiple offences are not made concurrent simply because they arise from a single incident of criminality or because they are of a similar nature and committed in similar circumstances. The statement of Simpson J in R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 concerning the discretion of a sentencing judge in respect of the structuring of offences has to be read subject to what is required in a particular case to reflect the totality of the criminality before the Court. With respect, the Judge has simply failed to approach the structuring of the sentence according to established principle. 

42The issue has arisen repeatedly in driving cases causing death where more than one victim was injured or killed. In R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288; (2005) 44 MVR 328, Hunt AJA at [23] explained the approach of sentencing for a single action aggravated by multiple victims: 

... separate sentences should usually be fixed which are made partly concurrent and partly cumulative, each such sentence being appropriate to the existence of only one victim and the aggregate of the sentences reflecting the fact that there are multiple victims resulting from the same action by the offender. 

43Further driving cases where the issue has been discussed include: R v Skrill [2002] NSWCCA 484 at [75]; R v Plumb [2003] NSWCCA 359 at [ 12 ] and cases listed at [ 19 ]; Richards v R [2006] NSWCCA 262. In the latter case it was said at [ 78 ]: ""... failure to accumulate those sentences, at least partially, appears to have been a failure to acknowledge the harm done to the individual victims"". Many of the cases just cited refer to dangerous driving, however, the principle remains the same for negligent driving causing death. In conformity with authority, I have come to the view that there must be some partial cumulation in sentences to be imposed upon the Offender to address the total criminality involved given the nature and objective seriousness of the offending. 

44I turn now to consider the question of ""special circumstances"". The finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact (see R v El-Hayek (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at [103]) and, even if special circumstances are found, the court is not obliged to vary the statutory ratio. The non-parole period must reflect the criminality involved in the offence, including its objective gravity and the need for general deterrence: see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at 718. 

45Merely because there is present a circumstance which is capable of constituting ""special circumstances"" does not mean that a sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172. The circumstances must be sufficiently special to justify a variation: R v Nimmo [2005] NSWCCA 295. 

46The issue of special circumstances often arises in circumstances where there are cumulative terms of imprisonment and sentencers should always have regard to the outcome of any such accumulation. Indeed, it is well established that accumulation of sentences can itself constitute special circumstances: R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; Close v R (1992) 31 NSWLR 743; R v Clissold [2002] NSWCCA 356 and R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWCCA 43. However, there does not exist, at common law, a proposition to the effect that accumulation of sentences must automatically give rise to a finding that special circumstances exist: Ibrahim. 

47I am prepared to find ""special circumstances"" due to the age of the Offender; this will be his first time in custody; and the impact of the sentence upon a third party, namely, his family and girlfriend - see Roberts v R [2007] NSWCCA 112 per Rothman J at [61] . 

48I also propose that there will, again in conformity with authority, be some cumulation of penalty for the Offender. 

49I turn now, and perhaps not before time, to the sentences and associated penalties I am to impose. 

Victim Impact Statements 

50As part of the Crown submissions, Mr Hanshaw, tendered two Victim Impact Statements pursuant to section 26 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. A Victim Impact Statement is defined as - 

... a statement containing particulars of:- 

(a) in the case of a primary victim, any personal harm suffered by the victim as a direct result of the offence; or 
(b) in the case of a family victim, the impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family. 

51Where the crime involves the death of the victim, a victim impact statement by a member of the family of the deceased which deals only with the effect of the death on the family is not relevant to the quantum of the sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. In R v Bollen , Hunt CJ at CL noted at 529 that victim impact statements recognise the value that the community places on human life. 

52Mrs Jeannie Vonthien, the sister of May Edna McDonald, read her Victim Impact Statement. Ms Tracey Jackson, the granddaughter of Ivy Cardwell, read the Victim Impact Statement on behalf of her family. One could not help but be moved by their dignity 

53By section 28(1) of the Act, a Court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so (and I do in this case), receive and consider a Victim Impact Statement at any time after it convicts, but before it sentences, an Offender. To that end, in respect of Sequences 4, 5 and 6, the Offender is convicted. I will now proceed to sentence. 

Sequence 6 - Negligent Driving cause Grievous Bodily Harm 

54The Offender is convicted and ordered to enter into a Good Behaviour Bond under section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 12 months. The Bond is conditioned that (1) The Offender is to be of good behaviour and appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the currency of the Bond; and (2) the Offender is to notify the Registrar of this Court of any change of residential address during the currency of the Bond. 

55Mr Markovski, I am going to ask you some questions and address you. Do you understand the terms of the Bond? I will record your response in the affirmative. Do you agree to enter the Bond with those conditions? I will record your response in the affirmative. 

56I am required by law to tell you that if you disobey any of the conditions of the Bond or commit any offence during the period of the Bond, particularly an offence of a similar type, you will be brought back before the Court which may, depending upon the offending circumstances, revoke the Bond and impose a penalty with more serious consequences. Those could include a period of imprisonment on a full-time basis or by way of an Intensive Corrections Order or a period of time on a Community Service Order, provided you are assessed as suitable for those two alternatives to full-time custody. Is that further understood? I record your response in the affirmative. You will be taken to the Court Office where the obligations under the Bond and the consequences of a failure to comply with it will be further explained so that you are left in no doubt. You will sign and be given a copy of the Bond you have entered before me. 

57As a separate Order, you are disqualified from holding any motor vehicle driver's or rider's licence for a period of 12 months, to date from 14 October 2011. 

58In imposing the following two sentences, I have considered section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 - see R v MA (2004) 145 A Crim R 434; R v King (2004) 150 A Crim R 409 per McColl JA . I have also considered section 5 of the Act and I am satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. The sentence is not one to be suspended: R v Zamagias at [25]-[26] per Howie J; R v Blundell [2008] NSWCCA 92 per Simpson J . 

Sequence 4 - Negligent Driving cause Death - May Edna McDonald 

59The Offender is convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 months, commencing on 14 October 2011 and expiring on 13 December 2011. The sentence is for a fixed term because it is subsumed in another sentence to be imposed. 

60As a separate Order, the Offender is disqualified from holding any motor vehicle driver's licence or rider's licence for a period of 12 months, to date from 14 October 2011. 

Sequence 5 - Negligent Driving cause Death - Ivy Violet Cardwell 

61The Offender is convicted and sentenced to an original term of sentence of 1 year. After applying a discount of 15% for the Offender's plea of guilty, the term of sentence is now 10 months and 6 days with a non-parole period of 2 months, commencing on 13 November 2011 and expiring on 12 January 2012. There is a balance of 8 months and 6 days commencing on 13 January 2012 and expiring on 18 September 2012. Pursuant to section 50 I direct the release of the Offender to parole at the end of the non-parole period if otherwise eligible. Pursuant to section 51 I direct as a condition of parole that the offender be subject to supervision by the Probation & Parole Service for such period as that Service deems necessary. 

62To avoid doubt, there is a partial cumulation in Sequences 4 and 5. The Offender is to serve a total of 3 months imprisonment, commencing on 14 October 2011 and expiring on 12 January 2012. Thereafter he is released to parole for a period of 8 months and 6 days expiring on 18 September 2012. 

63As a separate Order, the Offender is disqualified from holding any motor vehicle driver's or rider's licence for a period of 12 months, to date from 14 October 2012. 

64The Court extends its sympathy to the families of the Deceased, Mrs Mary McDonald and Mrs Ivy Cardwell, who were quite blameless in all of this. Should any of them read these Remarks on Sentence, I hope it helps to explain the operation of the law to situations such as this and assists in providing some closure.

		19 October 2011",2011-10-13 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2758020,"R v Oke LADOKE, R v Ardi LA LAU and R v Haris LA SAID [2011] NSWDC 183","Judgment 

1Each accused is charged pursuant to the then applicable s 232A(1) Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Each count is framed in identical terms. 

2Critically s 232A(1) requires the Crown to prove that a person who facilitates the bringing or coming of a group of five or more people to Australia to whom s 42(1) applies does so, ""reckless as to whether the people had or have a lawful right to come to Australia"". Section 42(1) notes that subject to subss 2, 2A and 3, which are not presently relevant, ""a non-citizen must not travel to Australia without a visa that is in effect"". 

3The bulk of the Crown case against each accused is set out in an Agreed Facts document tendered pursuant to s 191 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (Exhibit B). It is not in dispute that SIEV 120/ Banyo was intercepted by the Australian Navy off Ashmore Reef on 24 March 2010 and escorted to Christmas Island. It was then crewed by the three accused and carried ninety-four Afghani nationals as passengers. None of the ninety-seven people on board had applied for an Australian visa authorising their travel to, or entry or stay in, Australia prior to 24 March 2010. 

4Every one of the ninety-four passengers has subsequently applied for a protection visa: section 39 Migration Act. As at 13 October 2011 eighty-five of the passengers had been granted protection visas and nine had their protection visa applications pending. 

5Each defence counsel opened their client's case to the jury. The critical factual issue to be determined is whether the Crown have established beyond reasonable doubt that each accused intended to facilitate the bringing of a group of more than five Afghani nationals to Australia. It is the defence case that each accused believed that the passengers were being taken to an island within Indonesia, not Australia. Each accused was a subsistence farmer and not a regular seaman. As crew they had no say in, or knowledge of, the vessel's destination or why they were carrying passengers. 

6It is axiomatic that if each accused's intention did not involve knowledge that the vessel's destination was Australia they had not turned their minds to the question of whether those persons had a lawful right to come to Australia. 

7The Crown must establish all the elements of the offence. This means the Crown must prove each accused either: 

(a)knew or believed that the group of five or more people had no lawful right to come to Australia, or 

(b) 

(i)was aware of a substantial risk that the group of five or more people had no lawful right to come to Australia, and; 

(ii)having regard to the circumstances known to him, it was unjustifiable to take that risk. 

8It is the defence contention in each accused's case that each of the ninety-four passengers had, or have, a lawful right to come to Australia and that consequently each accused was neither reckless with respect to the circumstance of their passengers' status or intended or had knowledge that those people had, or have, no lawful right to come to Australia. If that contention is correct the Crown have not proved an essential element of their case. 

9The accused have not sought to meet any evidential burden placed on them of establishing s 42(1) Migration Act does not apply. As I understand it, it is not said that any of the subsections or regulations in that section apply to the passengers on SIEV 120/ Banyo . Rather, it is submitted that as a matter of law each of the passengers had a lawful right to come to Australia. 

10At the conclusion of the Crown case counsel for each accused made an application for a directed verdict. Mr Brady put the argument on behalf of Mr La Lau; Mr Pickin and Mr Steel adopted it. Mr Brady also adopted the arguments put by the defence in a similar application recently made to Judge Knox SC, although it is accepted that that case concerned the new s 233C Migration Act, s 23A having been repealed: see R v Asse Ambo [2011] NSWDC 156. 

11The question I must ask is:  Did a non-citizen who has not applied for a visa pursuant to s 42(1) Migration Act, and who does not fall within the exceptions in 232A(2), have a lawful right to come to Australia? 

Submissions 

12Mr Brady in oral argument and in his written submissions (MFI 2) said in summary: 

""(a) The term 'lawful right' is not defined nor are the critical terms used in s 42. Different tests must have been intended to apply when s 42 and 232A(1)(b) are interpreted. 

(b) Section 42 only relates to visa requirements required when travelling to Australia. It does not exclude the possibility that a non-citizen may come to Australia lawfully through some other circumstance. 

(c) As statutory provisions should be interpreted so they are in conformity and not in conflict with established rules of international law and as Australia has adopted the Refugee Convention, in particular Article 31, and is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which gives a right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution, refugees with such rights have a lawful right to come to Australia to seek such asylum. 

(d) Nothing in s 36 Migration Act, which clearly recognises Australia's obligations under the Refugee Convention (as amended by the Refugee Protocol) indicates that the person seeking refugee protection does so unlawfully. 

(e) That applying international law in s 36 leads to a conclusion that the purposes of the Migration Act are consistent with the refugee's right to seek asylum in Australia and s 42, in its terms or taking a purposive approach to its interpretation, does not mandate against this conclusion."" 

13From these points he asks that I draw the following conclusions: 

(1) A reading of s 42 does not lead to the conclusion that it unambiguously conflicts with Australia's obligations under international law, particularly when that law is read in conjunction with s 36. 

(2) Bearing in mind these are criminal charges, any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the accused. It is the accused's submission that there are possible interpretations for the expression ""lawful right"" in s 232A other than a valid visa or an exception under s 42. 

(3) The Crown have not excluded that the refugees, that is, the passengers on SIEV 120/Banyo, had no lawful right to come to Australia. 
14For the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Neild, in his written submissions (MFI 3), draws my attention to the provisions of the Migration Act, specifically, its objects provisions in ss 4 and 42 and the terms of the now repealed 232A, particularly 232A(1), which adopts as part of its provision s 42. In addition, he notes the Migration Act links, in ss 13 and 14, the definitions of ""lawful"" and ""lawful non-citizens"" to their possession of visas. He also notes the Act's clear recognition of Australia's rights and obligations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Refugee Convention and Protocol which are set out in various provisions of the Act. 

15The Crown submits that, as to s 232A, its construction, in particular the provision of two distinct fault elements and the incorporation of s 42 into subs (1), provides for and anticipates the critical elements which the Crown must, and in his submission have, proved in this case. 

16The Crown draws my attention to the decisions of the High Court in relation to customary international law and the status of asylum seekers, in particular, the statements of the Court confirming that customary international law deals with the right of asylum as a right of states not of individuals and the consistent opinions of the High Court of Australia and the Courts in the United Kingdom and the United States that no individual, including those seeking asylum, may assert a right to enter the territory of a state of which that individual is not a national: see NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 222 CLR 161 at [14], Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ibrahim (2000) 204 CLR 1, T v Secretary of State for Home Department [1996] AC 742, Sale v Haitian Centers Council Inc (1993) 509 US 155, 188[9], and Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996-1997) 190 CLR 225. 

17The Crown reminds me, in particular, of what was said by Gummow J in Applicant A at p 273: 

""...as the title of the Convention suggests, it is concerned with the status and civil rights to be afforded to refugees within member states"". 

18He concludes by submitting that the appropriate focus when considering the question of whether a person has a right to come to Australia should be domestic law:  here, the Migration Act. That Act, absent exceptions which do not apply here, requires a person coming to Australia either to be a citizen or hold a visa. Applying the Act and relevant principles to the facts here, this means, he submits, that the passengers on SIEV 120/Banyo had no legal right to come to Australia and no right to come to Australia without a visa and no right to come to Australia could be implied from Australia's acceptance of its international obligations to deal with the passengers according to the Convention and the Protocol once they arrived. 

Determination 

19A non-citizen has a right to seek asylum in Australia. A non-citizen has a right to seek a visa to come to Australia or to come to Australia without a visa if they fall within an exception to s 42. A non-citizen within Australia without a valid visa has a right to apply for a protection visa, that is, seek asylum and claim refugee status. As I understand s 39 and the other provisions of the Migration Act a non-citizen who travels to Australia, when s 42 says they may not do so, does so unlawfully. Nevertheless, they commit no criminal offence by doing so. Once in Australia, they have the right to ask for and receive a protection visa but does that right, under international law, accepted and adopted by the Australian Parliament in s 39 of the Migration Act, mean they have a right to come to Australia in order to exercise that right? As I read the Act and the authorities, the answer to this, and thus the question asked in the present application, is ""No"". Neither the existing express right set out in s 39 nor any international customary law or available interpretation of the Migration Act creates, by necessary implication, this suggested implied right. 

20The phrase ""no lawful right to come to Australia"" is not defined in the Migration Act or any other relevant Act. It has not, to date, been subject to determination or discussion by a superior court. I am informed that a Stated Case raising the issue before me is presently listed before the Victorian Court of Appeal. As I understand it, where Australian governments have entered into International Treaties it is accepted they and internationally recognised rights and obligations can apply to assist in the interpretation or application of domestic laws. Those implied rights and obligations can be overborne or contradicted by clearly expressed domestic legislation to the contrary: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 287 and Plaintiff M70/2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2011] HCA 32 at 247 per Kiefel J. 

21I must focus on the words of the section and the Act and its relevant statutory context which form the basis for this indictment. There is no ambiguity in the terms ""non-citizen"", ""valid visa"", ""lawful right to come to Australia"", in s 42 and the now repealed s 232A Migration Act . I interpret the section and its terms having regard to their meaning and purposes of the Act, some of which are empathically set out in s 4. 

22In my opinion there is no basis in the Migration Act or international law or Australia's Treaty obligations to imply into the Act a lawful right to come to Australia in order to seek a protection visa. A person whose travel to Australia is precluded by operation of s 42 has a right, having arrived, to apply for a visa and refugee protection. That Australia is obliged by its Treaty obligations as incorporated in the Act to provide these rights, does not of itself confer a right to travel, that is come to Australia, unless the person falls within the exceptions set out in s 42 or its Regulations. 

23The Migration Act provides for the acceptance of Australia's Treaty and other international obligations towards refugees. It does not, of itself, create any right to come to this country. As the decisions of the High Court of Australia referred to by the Crown make clear, individuals, including those seeking asylum or refugee status, may not assert a right under international customary law and, as I interpret the Act, domestic law, to enter a country of which that person is not a national: see NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 222 CLR 161. 

24Nothing in s 232A or the Act, which might be seen as contemplating or allowing for a future entitlement, imports into the Act a lawful right to come to Australia to claim that entitlement. Section 42 does not penalise a person who comes to Australia without a visa. It states simply, as a matter of fact and law, that a non-citizen must not do so. 

25The Parliament of Australia, in s 42 Migration Act, has clearly stated that a non-citizen who arrives in Australia without a visa, who seeks to come to Australia and who does not fall within the exceptions set out in s 42, does not do so lawfully. Whether or not the person came to Australia with a valid visa does not preclude their applying for a protection visa as a refugee. No international or domestic law confers a right on a non-citizen to come to this country. To the contrary, the Migration Act specifically sets out to regulate in the national interest the coming into, and the presence in, Australia of non-citizens: see s 4(1). 

26That a non-citizen who comes to Australia has rights recognised by domestic and international law to apply for refugee status does not of itself confer, directly or by implication, any right to enter this country and seek such asylum or status and would be contrary to the clear provisions and understood purposes of the Migration Act as applicable in March 2010. 

27I have had the benefit of reading the decision of Judge B J Knox SC in R v Asse Ambo [2011] NSWDC 156 which deals with similar arguments raised in relation to the now applicable s 233C Migration Act. I share with Judge Knox SC the opinion that I am bound to apply the law as it applies at this time. I reject the application for directed verdicts of acquittal.

2758031,Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223,"Judgment 

An overview - a man is killed 

1THE COURT : There are before the court appeals by two men who were found guilty by a jury of the murder of Derrick Reid (""the deceased""). The two men (whom I shall refer to as Carney and Cambey respectively) were later sentenced by her Honour Justice Fullerton as follows: 

Carney - 22 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months. 

Cambey - 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years and 6 months. 

2There was a third man involved in the assault upon the deceased, but his trial was separated from the joint trial of the appellants and he was later found not guilty by Fullerton J following a judge alone trial. 

3The deceased lived in a unit in Cartwright and for some years had sold or supplied cannabis, although it was his custom only to deal with people he knew or who were introduced to him. On the evening of Saturday 28 January 2006 while at the home of Jacob Epenian, Carney, Cambey and the third man, together with a friend, Joel Grant, agreed between themselves to obtain some cannabis by approaching the deceased. They were driven to his unit by Grant, who parked nearby and waited in the car. The other three left the car together, and headed towards the deceased's unit. Grant did not notice them carrying anything in the way of weapons. 

4The Crown case was that they went to the deceased's unit intending to obtain cannabis from him, either on credit or pursuant to a threat of violence. The Crown case was that after entering the unit, the men participated in some type of assault on the deceased, whereby he was repeatedly hit about the head with a piece of metal, probably a bar taken from a socket set, and was kicked or stomped on. Ultimately, the men left the unit without any cannabis, returned to the car and were driven away by Grant. 

5Shortly afterwards, the deceased, with a towel wrapped around his head and holding a can of beer, went to another unit seeking assistance from its occupant, Anthony Bilson. He was bleeding, so Mr Bilson called triple 0 for an ambulance. The deceased told Bilson that three men had ""home invaded me"" and referred to his having been hit over the head. He told ambulance officers they used a ""baton"" and a ""taser gun"" on him. The deceased was treated at the scene for his injuries and taken to Liverpool Hospital. He died later that day as a result of the head injuries. The cause of death was diffuse brain swelling, secondary to a closed head injury, a skull fracture. 

6The police had very little to go on in their investigation. The metal bar used to inflict a number of the injuries was found and collected later by Bilson outside Unit 6. There was no forensic evidence that the police were able to use to identify the deceased's assailants. Some time later, the police posted a reward for information relating to the death of the deceased. Sean Berriman, who knew Carney and Cambey, was motivated to tell the police that he had some information to impart that might be useful to the investigation. He had heard on the radio of the reward being offered for information about the death. He communicated anonymously with the police for some months before identifying himself and ultimately providing a statement. He gave evidence of a conversation he had in February 2006 in the company of Carney, Cambey, the third man, Grant, and another person. In this conversation, Cambey discussed what had happened to the deceased and said:- 

Me, Todd and Nuggy went to go to do him over and we killed him... We went and knocked on his door and when we opened it, we went in to do him over... he must have had something to live for, because every time we hit him he kept getting back up. 

Berriman also nominated Grant, Epenian and Carney's girlfriend, Ms Laing, as persons who might have information that could assist the police. 

7Cambey was arrested on 17 July 2007 and charged with the deceased's murder. Carney and the third man were arrested and charged on 24 and 18 July 2007 respectively. 

The course of the trial 

8The trial of Carney and Cambey commenced in the Supreme Court in Sydney on 3 February 2010. The prosecution relied on the four witnesses I have identified. Each testified in substance that Carney and Cambey had made confessional statements to them, suggesting their respective involvement in the death of the deceased. There was no forensic evidence to identify who it was who had assaulted the deceased. There was detailed medical evidence however, concerning the nature of the injuries sustained by the deceased. 

9The Crown in opening the case had suggested a joint criminal enterprise. However, the case was ultimately left on a much simpler basis. 

10The directions given by the trial judge in relation to each man were (in brief) as follows:- 

To convict for murder, the jury had to find that the particular defendant either inflicted the head injuries with the metal bar, or that he jointly with the other man assaulted the deceased by kicking or stomping on his head. In either case, the assault had to be accompanied by one of the three intentions necessary to found murder: an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, an intention to kill, or reckless indifference. 

Alternatively, if the jury were not satisfied that the particular defendant inflicted any of the injuries from which the deceased died, they might nonetheless find the defendant guilty as an aider and abettor. This required findings that the head injuries were inflicted by one or both of the other two men, that the defendant was present, that he knew that the others were inflicting the injuries with one of the requisite intents for murder, and he knew his presence was assisting the others to commit the offence. 

11As her Honour put it in the written direction:- 

Thus, in order to convict X of murder it is necessary for you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was either the person or one of the people who inflicted the fatal head injuries, or, by his presence, he aided and abetted the others to inflict those injuries ready and willing to give aid to the person or people actually committing the offence if required. 

12The defence case for each of Carney and Cambey was that the allegation of murder could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The thrust of the defence case, in each instance, was that neither Carney nor Cambey was present inside the deceased's home when the injuries were sustained by the deceased. Neither man testified at trial. On 18 February 2010, the jury returned with verdicts of guilty of murder in respect of both men. 

Appeals against conviction and sentence 

13Each man has lodged an appeal against his conviction and has sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him. The sole ground of appeal against conviction in each case is that the trial judge erred in failing to leave an alternative verdict of manslaughter. The trial judge, of course, was not asked to leave manslaughter. This is understandable in the light of the defence case that neither Carney nor Cambey was present at the deceased's unit. In Carney's case, the appeal against sentence is confined to a ground that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account considerations of totality. In Cambey's appeal against sentence, the judge is said to have erred in setting a non-parole period above 75 per cent without giving reasons. 

14It will be convenient to focus at this stage upon the conviction appeal. In the case of each appellant, the starting point must be the proposition that if manslaughter were not left (and there is no doubt it was not) and should have been left, a wrong decision will have been made on a question of law. Both appellants and the Crown do not dissent from this proposition. In such a case, section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 requires this court to set aside the conviction, subject however to the application of Rule 4 where it applies and to the proviso in section 6. The effect of the proviso is that a new trial will not be ordered where the Crown satisfies the court that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred ( R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; 64 NSWLR 527 at [46]; Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at 416-417 per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J, 434 per Callinan J; Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1 at 14-15 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J, 15 per Gummow J, 34-35, 40 per Hayne J; Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [35] - [36], [39] - [45]). 

15Mr Odgers SC, on behalf of Carney, submitted that, even where a trial judge had not been asked to leave an alternative of manslaughter, it must be left if such a verdict was open on the evidence at trial. This, senior counsel said, has long been the law ( Pemble v R (1971) 124 CLR 107 per Barwick CJ at 117 - 118). He submitted that the first question to be determined was whether a verdict of manslaughter was ""open"" on the evidence (that is, as he put it, whether a case of manslaughter was ""viable""). He submitted that, in the trial of his client, manslaughter on the basis of dangerous and unlawful act was ""plainly open on the evidence"". Senior counsel pointed to the physical act of striking Mr Reid over the head with the metal bar as being ""clearly dangerous and unlawful"". 

16Mr Hanley SC appeared on the appeal for Cambey. Senior counsel supported the submissions put by Mr Odgers. He reminded the court that in Kanaan , a number of propositions derived from the High Court decisions of Gilbert and Gillard , had been extracted and formulated. In particular, he referred to the following:- 

(a)Manslaughter cannot be left for the determination of the jury as an alternative verdict in a murder trial unless there is evidence to support such a verdict (or unless the case on manslaughter is ""viable""); 

(b)If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, the judge must leave that issue to the jury - not withstanding that it is not being raised by any party, and even if a party objects (or all parties object) to the issue being left to the jury; 

(c)If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter and if the judge has not left that issue (for whatever reason) there has been an error of law; 

(d)Subject to the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Rules, Rule 4, the appellant is entitled to a new trial unless the Crown establishes that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 

17In the light of these propositions, Mr Hanley submitted that a jury, properly instructed, would not necessarily have returned a verdict of murder rather than manslaughter. The critical issue, he argued, was whether the evidence at trial was capable of supporting a verdict of manslaughter. Manslaughter on the basis of dangerous and unlawful act was, he argued, ""open on the evidence"". The act of striking Mr Reid over the head with the metal bar and/or the act of ""kicking Mr Reid to the head was clearly dangerous and unlawful"". 

18In their written and oral submissions, Mr Odgers and Mr Hanley took the court in considerable detail to the evidence before the jury in support of the submission that, in the case of each appellant, a verdict of manslaughter was open - viable - on the evidence. 

19The Crown argued that the trial judge did not err in failing to leave the alternative verdict of manslaughter. The Crown submitted that, having regard to the evidence in the trial, there was simply ""no viable case of manslaughter reasonably open"" which could have been left to the jury. The Crown argued that a manslaughter verdict was not ""plainly open"" on the evidence and that this was clearly reflected in the manner in which the trial was conducted and having regard to the terms of the summing up. 

20It will be necessary to examine in detail the evidence before the trial judge to assess the strength of these competing submissions. However, it is appropriate at the outset to say something about the test to be applied. There is a difference between the appellants and the Crown as to whether the correct approach is to ask whether a verdict of manslaughter was open on the evidence at the trial, as the appellants submitted, or to ask whether it was reasonably open on the evidence at the trial, as the Crown submitted. Mr Odgers SC argued that, in none of the authorities, does the phrase ""reasonably open"" appear. 

21We consider that the correct approach may best be seen from an examination of the High Court's decision in Gillard . In that case, the appellant stood trial with another man (Preston) for the murder of two other men. The Crown case was that Gillard was a party to a plan by which Preston was to kill the men; and that he knew of Preston's intentions to kill them with a gun. When arrested, Gillard claimed that he thought there was only to be a robbery, and he denied knowing that Preston was armed with the gun. At the trial, the judge was not asked to leave manslaughter to the jury. It appears Gilard's counsel, for tactical reasons, opposed the Crown's application for that issue to be left. Gillard was convicted of murder. In the High Court, the appellant and the Crown agreed that, the jury should have been directed as to manslaughter. The only issue on the appeal was whether the proviso should be applied. During the course of the judgments, however, there was some mention of the proper approach to the issue as to whether manslaughter should have been left. 

22In a joint judgment, Gleeson CJ and Callinan J examined the evidence before the jury to establish what, if anything, could be gleaned as to the possible state of mind of Gillard in connection with the actions of Preston. Their Honours examined the scope of the doctrine of common criminal purpose and the possible state of mind of Gillard in that regard as a secondary offender. Their Honours noted that the general principle allows for the possibility that a person who intentionally assists in a homicide may be guilty of manslaughter even though the principal offender is guilty of murder. That possibility may arise from a difference in the intention of the two parties. Having examined that possible distinction in Gillard's situation, their Honours succinctly stated (at [26]):- 

In our view, there was a viable case of manslaughter to be left to the jury, and the refusal to leave that case was a wrong decision on a question of law. 

23Hayne J (at [106]), having stated the primary facts, said:- 

The parties to the appeal were right in contending that it had been open, on the evidence led at trial, for the jury to conclude that the appellant was not guilty of murder or attempted murder but was guilty of manslaughter of the two victims who had died. There was a wrong decision on a question of law and, therefore, unless the proviso ... was engaged, the Full Court was bound to allow the appeal, quash the appellant's convictions and order a new trial. 

24Gummow J agreed generally with the observation by Hayne J concerning the principles relating to joint criminal enterprise, and added (at [32]):- 

In the present case there was, as Hayne J explains, a wrong decision by the trial judge on a question of law in not directing the jury that a verdict of manslaughter was an available outcome. 

25The expression ""a viable case of manslaughter to be left to the jury"" (as stated by Gleeson CJ and Callinan J) is a useful shorthand expression expressing the correct approach to be taken. Similarly, the question is often asked ""was manslaughter open to be left"". That too is a useful shorthand manner of approaching the issue. While we consider that the correct position is more akin to that urged by the Crown on the present appeal, namely whether a verdict of manslaughter was ""reasonably open"" on the evidence, we would prefer to state the proper approach (based on Hayne J's statement) in the following terms:- 

A viable case of manslaughter means that it was open on the evidence led at trial for the jury to conclude that the appellant was not guilty of murder but was guilty of the alternative charge of manslaughter. 

26The problem with Mr Odgers' approach is that it is perhaps too wide. It would mean that in virtually every case of murder, manslaughter should be left. Experienced trial judges commonly leave manslaughter before the jury but it is not invariably the case. We would not wish to disturb that situation. For that reason, we propose to approach the issue in each of the present appeals on the basis we have indicated. 

A summary of the evidence 

27It is necessary to turn next to a summary of the evidence relevant to the principal issue raised on the appeal. It will be convenient to start with the medical evidence establishing the nature of the injuries sustained by the deceased. As we have said, the cause of death was diffuse brain swelling, secondary to a closed head injury, a skull fracture. That evidence established:- 


There were a number of superficial bruises and areas of discolouration on the body: 
A finger was broken 
A laceration (number 9) on the left temple. This could have been caused by the metal bar 
A laceration (number 10) on the top of the skull that was probably caused by two impacts. It could have been caused by the metal bar (it was more likely to have been caused in that way than by a kick) 
Underneath laceration 10, there was a depressed fracture of the skull. This injury indicated ""a significant amount of force being applied locally"" 
A laceration (number 14) on the back right side of the head 
Near laceration 14, a skull facture which was not depressed like that underneath laceration 10 
A bruise (number 13) on the back of the head which could have been caused by a kick or a punch 

Dr Ellis gave evidence that it was not possible to determine the order in which these injuries were inflicted, although he believed that wound 14 may possibly have been inflicted before wound 10. 

28The weapon used to inflict the injuries was described as a metal bar approximately 30cm long. This piece of metal had later been found and collected by Bilson from outside Unit 6 where it had apparently been discarded after the assailants left Unit 5. There was a suggestion in the trial that, prior to the arrival of the three men, the bar had been abandoned, with other objects, in a common area in the flats. 

29As there was no forensic evidence linking either Carney or Cambey to the assault, the Crown relied on the evidence of four witnesses - Joel Grant, Jacob Epenian, Jessica Laing and Sean Berriman - all either friends or acquaintances of the appellants and the third man. Each of these gave evidence of various confessional statements made by the appellants as to the attack on the deceased. Grant, Epenian and Laing were with the appellants before and after the attack. Berriman was spoken to by the appellants a few weeks after the attack. Both Carney and Cambey were present during these various conversations, with the exception of conversations between Carney and Laing when Cambrey was absent. We shall deal with each of the witnesses separately. 

Joel Grant 

30Mr Grant was the driver of the car and gave evidence that after the decision to obtain cannabis, he drove the three men to Reid's unit and waited in the car. Grant was a user of cannabis and a friend of a person known as Jason. This man had introduced Grant to the deceased for the purpose of his being supplied with cannabis on a regular basis. Grant regularly attended Epenian's home in Lurnea for parties. He gave evidence that on 29 January 2006, just before dawn, he, the appellants and the third man agreed to visit the deceased in order to obtain marijuana. They were trying to organise a ""50"" (a reference to a quantity of cannabis). As we have said, Grant drove the men in Carney's motor vehicle to the deceased's block of apartments. He saw the three men leave the car and understood they were going to see the deceased. He did not see them carrying anything when they left the car. 

31Grant said that when the three returned, they appeared ""a bit fidgety"". They told him they could not obtain any marijuana. The Crown was granted leave under section 38 of the Evidence Act relative to certain paragraphs of Grant's witness statement, which he agreed was his truthful recollection of the conversation in the car:- 

Luke said he had nothing. The next thing someone said, ""We started bashing him"". Then (the third man) said, ""We couldn't get into the unit through the door because Derrick was fighting to keep us out"". 

I can't really remember the exact conversation but one of the boys then said that they kept bashing Derrick and that they couldn't knock him to the ground. The boys told me to drive away because people would see them because they made a lot of noise while they were in his unit. I did not see any blood on any of the boys. 

32The four then drove back to Epenian's home, where it was agreed they ""would not speak about it again"". 

Jacob Epenian 

33Mr Epenian testified that in January 2006 he knew the deceased after being introduced to him by Joel Grant, for the purpose of obtaining cannabis. He also knew Carney, Cambey and the third man. He said that in the early hours of 29 January 2006 there was a group discussion which involved the three men and Grant. The discussion related to obtaining some marijuana. The agreement was that the other four would go there, in effect, to endeavour to get some marijuana on credit (""tick up stick""). The four men left and returned about an hour and a half later without any marijuana. 

34Epenian said Todd Carney asked to have a shower. He did not notice anything wrong with Carney's clothes. He observed, ""they all looked a bit distraught and not much was said at first"". About half an hour later, Carney said, ""Things didn't go according to plan, it went really bad... they left him in a pretty bad way. Someone said, 'a weapon of some sort... was used repeatedly and that the deceased had said, 'it wasn't going to happen to him, not now and not ever'"". 

35The Crown was granted leave under section 38 of the Evidence Act relative to certain paragraphs of Epenian's statement:- 

All of a sudden Todd and Luke started bragging about what they did. Todd said we got there and knocked on the door. The guy next door came out and shit himself and then went back inside. Derrick asked who it was and came to the door and Carney said, ""It's Jas' mate"". Derrick opened the door and they casually walked into the flat. As they walked in one of them dropped the taser and Derrick turned around and said, ""This is not happening to me, not ever"". 

Todd said they he cracked him with a pole and he fell on the bed. He couldn't believe that he got back up. So then Cambey started kicking into him and Todd said that he was cracking him with the pole in the head and he was bleeding and there was blood everywhere. Todd said he kept getting up and that's why they left. 

Jessica Laing 

36Ms Laing was Carney's girlfriend between 2003 and April 2006. She had been at Epenian's home on 28 January 2006 with the others. When she awoke on that morning, she asked Carney where he had been, to which he replied, ""We went out - tell ya later"". Later that day at her home, Carney was upset and crying. When she asked him what was wrong, he said, ""They bashed someone and he thinks it went too far"". He said, ""it was bad"". Shortly after 29 January 2006, she noticed that Cambey had changed his hairstyle from mullet to short. On another occasion, Carney told her that ""they went in, then they had a fight, then they left"" and ""it was bad and the guy was, like kept getting back up and he didn't know what to do"". He said that he had ""a pole"" and ""he ran away and threw the pole"" and that the victim was ""badly injured"" from ""bashing him"". 

Sean Berriman 

37Mr Berriman testified that he was present at a party held at Jessica Laing's house in February 2006. A conversation had taken place between him, Cambey and Carney, during which Carney asked if Berriman knew what had happened about the deceased. Cambey then gave the evidence we have earlier recounted - ""(We) went to go do him over and we killed him"". He added, ""We went and knocked on his door and when he opened it we went in to do him over... he must have had something to live for because every time we hit him he kept getting back up"". 

38All four witnesses admitted that they were regular users of marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol. They conceded, in general terms, that their memory of the conversations they had had were affected, to one degree or another, by their substance abuse. In Berriman's case, he agreed he first recounted the conversation given during his evidence back in June 2008. This was after the time he had decided to claim the offered reward of $100,000. 

Submissions as to whether manslaughter should have been left 

39Mr Odgers first outlined the way in which the Crown had approached the issue of murder at trial. There, he said, the Crown had primarily argued that the appellant committed murder on the basis that there was an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. The Crown case was that there must have been an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm ""because of the number of blows and the weight of the bar"". There were ""at least four blows to the head"" and that ""significant force"" was required to fracture the skull. 

40Mr Odgers submitted, however, that a number of elements emerged from a careful analysis of the evidence given by the four friends and acquaintances. These included that the three young men went to the deceased's unit to obtain cannabis. All of them had been drinking and using drugs at a party for some hours before this. At some point prior to gaining entry to the unit, the young men must have formed the intention that, if they could not obtain cannabis on credit, they would use the threat of force to obtain it. The evidence was that just prior to entry the appellant, Carney, armed himself with a metal bar, and one of the others had a ""taser"", probably the third man. Once they had been admitted into the unit, the deceased made it clear that he would not supply cannabis on credit, nor would he allow it to be taken by threat of violence. 

41Against that background, Mr Odgers painted a possible scenario that Carney used the metal bar only intending to render the deceased unconscious or otherwise to incapacitate him. In other words, there was a reasonable possibility that there was no intention to cause him really serious harm. It is true that Carney struck the deceased over the head with the metal bar and he fell down. The confessional statements, however, indicate that Carney was ""surprised"" when the deceased stood up and fought back. The possibility was that the taser was used by the third man and that the deceased was kicked in the head by Mr Cambey and that, at the same time, he was being struck repeatedly with the metal bar to keep him down, but he ""kept getting up"" and kept fighting. 

42Mr Odgers submitted the manner in which the three young men retreated from the unit without taking any of the cannabis in the unit, the way in which the metal bar had simply been dropped on the balcony outside the unit and the statements immediately thereafter to Grant and the others, demonstrated a situation where serious injury may not have been intended. Rather, the altercation had simply got out of hand. Mr Odgers reminded the court that the appellant had been crying later that day, and told his girlfriend, in this context, that what had happened was ""bad and the guy was, like, getting back up and he didn't know what to do"". 

43Mr Odgers argued that there was final support for this scenario in the medical evidence. This was consistent with the deceased being hit with the bar once without a high level of force (causing laceration 9), then being hit with a greater level of force (causing laceration 14 and the fracture near it), then being hit again, twice in succession, with ""significant force"" (causing laceration 10 and the depressed fracture under it). Mr Odgers argued that these possibilities, reasonably arising on the medical evidence, were consistent with Carney striking the deceased once, intending to render him unconscious, or otherwise to incapacitate him, and then having to strike him again with greater levels of force because the initial blows were ineffective. On this scenario, it was reasonably possible that even the blows with the greatest force (causing laceration 10 and the depressed fracture) may have involved only an intention to incapacitate rather than cause grievous bodily harm. Mr Odgers submitted that overall the medical evidence was consistent with a scenario where Carney, surprised by the lack of effectiveness of the first blow and the deceased's violent response, struck him repeatedly without any precise intention in his mind, other than to stop the deceased from using violence on him, or, at most, to incapacitate him. 

44Mr Odgers argued that it was significant, in the context of the picture he sought to paint, that the only other weapon apparently used in the assault of the deceased was a taser gun, a weapon used to stun or disable a person without causing lasting injury. Mr Odgers conceded that the person using the taser may not have had the same state of mind as the person using the metal bar, but at least it gave some support to the proposition that the initial intention of all three young men was to do no more than to incapacitate Mr Reid, without causing him grievous bodily harm. 

45Events immediately after the assault suggested, Mr Odgers argued, that the young men were clearly shocked by what had happened. They did not take any cannabis from the flat, even though cannabis was clearly present. 

46Mr Odgers asked this court to accept that, having regard to the evidence, a jury, properly instructed, would not necessarily have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Carney formed an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. In relation to the other state of mind relied on by the Crown at trial, the possibility of reckless indifference, Mr Odgers suggested that this was not a realistic scenario at all, as there was no evidence to suggest that Carney realised it was probable or likely that the deceased would die. (The Crown did not quarrel with this latter proposition). 

47Mr Hanley, as we have said, supported the general propositions advanced by Mr Odgers. He submitted, however, that his client was in a much more favourable position than Carney. If his client was the person who had kicked the deceased in the head (but had not been involved in the use of the metal bar) it was necessary, on the Crown case, for the jury to be satisfied that Cambey knew that Carney intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased, and that he was present and assisting him at the same time. 

48Mr Hanley argued that, putting to one side the unreliability of some of the evidence adduced from the four ""confessional"" witnesses, their evidence demonstrated that when the three men went to the flat, none were apparently armed. It was reasonable to infer that the third man may, however, have had the ""taser"" with him. There was no evidence that the Cambey was aware of this prior to it being ""used"" on the deceased. He referred to the evidence that suggested that Carney may have armed himself with the metal bar ""spontaneously"" about the time the deceased refused to supply the drugs, as it had been probably opportunistically removed from a pile of mechanical equipment deposited by a tenant on the veranda of a nearby unit. 

49Mr Hanley said that the scenario that developed was one where, to the surprise of the assailants, the deceased kept getting up and fighting. In whatever order it occurred, the kicking by Cambey and the striking of the deceased by Carney must have happened within a very short timeframe. Their abrupt departure from the premises, without taking any cannabis, was consistent with all three being surprised by the deceased's response, and dismayed that the extent of his injuries exceeded their intended actions. 

50Mr Hanley argued that the comments made in the car to Grant immediately after the visit to the flat were quite inconsistent with any of the men having had an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. They were not consistent with Carney suddenly forming either of the requisite intentions after the three men had gained entry to the flat. 

51Mr Hanley argued that it was reasonably possible that Cambey assisted Carney by kicking the deceased, but only with the intention to incapacitate him. He never formed an intention to cause the deceased really serious harm. In any event, the evidence was certainly consistent, counsel argued, with it being reasonably possible that Cambey was assisting by his actions or his presence, but without knowing that the wounds inflicted by Carney were carried out by him with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. 

52Mr Hanley supported Mr Odgers' arguments based on the medical evidence. In particular, he said that there was no evidence when the kick to the head occurred in the chronological sequence of injuries. He accepted that the medical evidence was possibly consistent with the deceased being hit with the metal bar with increasing levels of force. This, in turn, was consistent with the admissions made by Carney or Cambey that the deceased was repeatedly struck to stop him from getting up and to incapacitate him. In that regard, the evidence supported the further reasonable possibility that Cambey assisted Carney by kicking the deceased to subdue him, but never formed an intention to cause him really serious harm. 

53Finally, Mr Hanley submitted that a jury, properly instructed, would not necessarily have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Cambey had the requisite intention to be convicted of murder. On the evidence, he submitted, an alternative verdict of manslaughter was a ""viable"" one. 

54The Crown submitted that the scenario painted by both appellants, but particularly that suggested by Mr Odgers, was both fanciful and speculative. First, the Crown submitted that the manner in which the trial had been conducted, leading to the directions given by the trial judge, reflected that a verdict of manslaughter was not reasonably open. In support of this argument, the Crown pointed to the fact that trial counsel for Cambey had conceded before the jury that, whoever assaulted the deceased must have acted with an intention to kill or cause really serious physical injury. The trial judge had referred to this ""concession"" in her summing up, and gave a direction, as the Crown pointed out, that focussed on the single issue as to whether either of the appellants had been present at the flat when the injuries were inflicted. The selection of this single issue by the parties reflected their mutual recognition at trial that manslaughter was not reasonably open on the evidence. 

55Secondly, insofar as reliance was placed on Gilbert and Gillard , the Crown submitted that, in this matter, Carney and Cambey were both in the flat when the injuries were inflicted, and, it might reasonably be assumed, participated in the attack. This contrasted with the situation in both Gilbert and Gillard , where each of those offenders had not been a direct participant in the killing. 

56Thirdly, the Crown submitted that it was not reasonably open on the evidence to infer that the appellants intended to render the deceased unconscious or merely incapacitated - short of intending to inflict grievous bodily harm. This could be seen, the Crown submitted, by the nature of the attack, the medical evidence, the crime scene, and the terms of the admissions made by each of the two men. There was no suggestion, for example, in any of the admissions, that they had been there, but had only intended to incapacitate the deceased. 

57The Crown argued that the only reasonable possibility emerging from the evidence was that the appellants deliberately armed themselves with the metal bar before entering the unit. Shortly after entry, the deceased, who was obviously caught by surprise and was defenceless, was repeatedly struck about the head with a metal bar wielded with enough force to fracture his skull. During the attack, and after blows with the metal bar had caused him to fall to the ground, Cambey joined in by kicking the deceased to the head. The nature and ferocity of the attack with the metal bar, focussed as it was on the deceased's head, reflected, the Crown submitted, at the very least an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. The attack was deliberate and sustained, and ""there was blood everywhere"" as the photographs amply demonstrated. 

58Moreover, the Crown submitted, that not only could it be concluded that the injuries were deliberately inflicted with the intention at least to cause grievous bodily harm, those participating in the attack, although not wielding the metal bar, must have known of that intention. It therefore followed that Cambey, by kicking the deceased in the head while he was on the ground, must at least have aided and abetted the other person, well knowing of the relevant intent. 

59The Crown placed particular reliance on the confessional statements:- 

We went in to do him over... he must have had something to live for, because he kept getting back up. 

And:- 

Todd said he cracked him with a pole and he fell on the bed. He couldn't believe that he got back up so then Cambey started kicking into him and Todd said he was cracking him with the pole in the head... and there was blood everywhere. 

60The Crown disputed both Mr Odgers' and Mr Hanley's arguments as to the meanings to be given to a number of the admissions. 

Resolution of the principal issue 

61We shall deal with each of the appellants separately. There can be little doubt that, had manslaughter been left, Carney may have had a difficult task persuading the jury that if, as it appeared, he had been the assailant striking the deceased with the metal bar, his intention was other than to inflict grievous bodily harm. The number of blows, the heavy bleeding and the increasing force of those blows would be likely to suggest to a jury that, at least at the time the blows were delivered, his intention went well beyond merely incapacitating the deceased. However, as Mr Odgers argued, there was evidence that could possibly point the other way. A number of the confessional statements, and the post-incident reaction of all the men, supported the existence of a situation that had simply spun out of control. That this may have been so could suggest, even in Carney's case, that the scenario painted by Mr Odgers was a reasonable possibility. We would not agree that there was no evidence to support it, as the Crown argued, although we acknowledge the force of the Crown submissions that the jury might well have rejected such a defence case, had it been put. Nevertheless, there was no forensic evidence as to precisely the order in which the blows were inflicted and the men, it appears, fled in some panic without taking any drugs with them. The deceased's behaviour immediately after the attack, and prior to his departure in the ambulance, was also a relevant factor. 

62It is important to bear in mind, as both Gillard and Kanaan made clear, that, in an argument such as the present, it is easy to fall into the error of asking whether the evidence that was before the jury was sufficient for them to be satisfied that the offender possessed the intention sufficient to constitute murder. Care must be taken not to reason that the jury's verdict of guilty of murder concludes any consideration of the alternative verdict of manslaughter at a new trial. In a trial where manslaughter has not been left, that may, unless caution is exercised, appear to be the case. The real question that arises is, whether a verdict of murder would have necessarily resulted, had the issues at trial been left on the alternative basis. 

63The position of Cambey is somewhat different from that of Carney. We think it can be safely said that the evidence we have recited, insofar as it impacted on the case against Carney, would have permitted a reasonable argument to be presented that either he did not possess an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased or, at the very least, he was not aware that Carney was acting with that intention in mind. This is not to say that a jury, properly instructed, could not have convicted Cambey of murder. But there was, as we have said, a respectable argument that would allow for the possibility of an alternative finding. The confessional statements relied on by the Crown, we accept, may have been sufficient to persuade the jury that murder was an appropriate verdict in the case of each appellant. These statements, however, were only one piece of evidence in the overall mosaic of the prosecution case. Moreover, there were doubts about the reliability and accuracy of the witnesses, particularly Mr Berriman. This extended to the evidence he gave about conversations he had with the appellants at a later time. 

64The Crown argument based on the conduct of the trial we do not find compelling. It has some attractions at first blush but it belies the fact that defence counsel, having selected the single issue they thought appropriate for the trial, could hardly abandon it after the conclusion of the evidence. It may be, although this is perhaps speculative, that their attack on the four witnesses had been, in their minds, successful, with the consequence that they were content to see the trial to its conclusion on that one issue. If manslaughter ought to have been left, trial counsel's decision to fight the trial on the basis that neither accused was the assailant cannot disentitle them from raising the point on appeal. It is true that ""armchair appeals"" are not to be encouraged ( Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170]) and we shall give further consideration to this aspect of the matter when considering Rule 4. 

65The ""concession"" made by trial counsel for Mr Cambey may have been simply an advocate's flourish. It was certainly not a concession that Cambey had an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. In any event, the Crown accepted, fairly and properly, that even in a single-issue trial where there emerges evidence that would support a reasonable finding of manslaughter, it should be left, and that this is so even where a request to that effect has not been made on behalf of the accused. 

66Accordingly, we conclude, albeit with some hesitation in the case of Carney, that it was reasonably open on the evidence led at trial for the jury to conclude that each man was not guilty of murder, but was guilty of the alternative charge of manslaughter. 

Rule 4 

67Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is in the following terms:- 

No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal. 

Neither counsel asked for manslaughter to be left, and it thus appears that leave is required. Leave to rely on an error to which no objection was taken at the trial will be granted where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice ( R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536; R v Wilson (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at [20]; R v Kanaan at [99]). 

68We conclude that, as the jury were not instructed as to the availability of the alternative verdict of manslaughter, this may have caused each appellant to lose a real chance (or a chance fairly open to him) of being found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter ( R v Kanaan at [101]). The fact that there was an obligation on the trial judge to give such a direction ( Pemble ) is further support for the grant of leave. Thirdly, we consider that there was an obligation on the Crown Prosecutor at trial to remind the judge or bring to the judge's attention the need to consider leaving manslaughter as an alternative verdict. This was not done. 

69It has been said that the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on the basis of one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial ( Darwiche at [170]). We would not wish to undermine this proposition. Where, however, the failure to leave the alternative verdict of manslaughter may have caused an accused to lose a real chance of being found not guilty of murder but guilty of the alternative charge, this places the case in a different category. We recognise that, as was probably the case here, the appellants' counsel may have been reluctant, as a matter of tactics, to see manslaughter left. But directions could have been framed by the trial judge so that it was left as an alternative verdict without unduly prejudicing the appellants in the case each wished to make. We have little doubt that had her Honour been asked to leave manslaughter, she would have done so, and that she would have crafted directions carefully to avoid any prejudice to the case presented by the appellants. 

70Accordingly, we consider that this is an appropriate case for leave to be granted to allow each appellant to pursue its ground of appeal against conviction. 

Should the appeals be dismissed pursuant to the proviso? 

71Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides as follows:- 

The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred [emphasis added]. 

72The application of the proviso was authoritatively discussed by the High Court in Weiss . The approach taken in Weiss has been adopted, explained and applied in a number of cases in both this court and the High Court (see, for example, DJS v R [2010] NSWCCA 200; RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147; Kessing v R [2008] NSWCCA 310; 73 NSWLR 22; Cesan v R [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358; AK v State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438; Gassy v R [2008] HCA 18; 236 CLR 293; Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60; 160 A Crim R 195 at [107] - [108]). 

73Mr Odgers SC (supported by Mr Hanley SC) argued that the answer to the Rule 4 provision, in the circumstances of this case, resulted in the same issue arising under the proviso. Senior counsel argued that the failure to leave manslaughter in the circumstances demonstrated that there had been a miscarriage of justice and that, pursuant to section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 , this court was bound to allow the appeal unless the proviso was engaged and then found to operate in favour of the prosecution. The issue he propounded in relation to the proviso, was whether ""it is clear that a jury, properly instructed, would necessarily have returned a verdict of murder"" ( Gillard per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J at 422 [19] - [20]). In answering that question, Mr Odgers submitted it is not permissible to reason that the jury's verdict of guilty of murder at the first trial excludes any consideration of the alternative verdict of manslaughter at a new trial ( Kanaan at [75] (4)). Applying these tests, Mr Odgers argued that a jury, properly instructed, would not necessarily have returned a verdict of murder rather than of manslaughter. 

74The Crown took issue with Mr Odgers in these regards. First, the Crown submitted that the issue as stated under Rule 4 is not, in substance, the same issue as arises in a consideration of the proviso. The Crown argued that the Rule 4 position was a separate and preliminary qualification to the appellant's right to appeal, and is one in which he bears the onus. Importantly, however, the Crown argued that the reference in Gillard to the manner in which the proviso is to be approached (as it had been relied on by Mr Odgers) was inconsistent with Weiss . The Crown argued that the proper approach to the application of the proviso is not whether ""it is clear that a jury properly instructed would necessarily have returned a verdict of murder"", but ""whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"". 

75As to the first point raised by the Crown, Mr Odgers conceded in reply that the onus under Rule 4 fell upon each of the appellants in the present matter. He accepted that this placed the burden on the appellant to show that there had been a miscarriage of justice, whereas under the proviso the burden fell upon the Crown to show that there had not been a substantial miscarriage of justice. However, notwithstanding this difference in the placement of onus, Mr Odgers argued that it was unlikely in the present matter to have practical consequences. In this regard, he referred to the observations of Basten JA in Carlton v R [2008] NSWCCA 244; 189 A Crim R 332 at 345. He submitted that, in practical terms, it was likely to be a relatively rare case in which the court was unable to reach a view and the burden thereby became decisive. 

76On the matter of critical difference between himself and the Crown, Mr Odgers emphatically submitted that, in the context of a case where manslaughter should have been left, there was no inconsistency between the High Court's decision in Weiss , and the earlier decisions such as Gilbert and Gillard . 

77In view of the competing submissions, it will be necessary to examine recent statements made by the High Court in relation to the following negative proposition stated in Weiss at [44]:- 

It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. 

78In Darkan v R [2006] HCA 34; 227 CLR 373, the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayden and Crennan JJ) addressed two possible defects in a criminal trial that were excepted from the proposition advanced in Weiss . At 401 [94], the judgment stated:- 

In Weiss v R this Court put aside questions relating to two particular kinds of defect in a trial. One was whether the proviso could be applied when there had been ""a significant denial of procedural fairness"". This does not arise, because the trial was procedurally fair. The other was whether the proviso could be applied where there had been a sufficiently ""serious breach of the presuppositions of the trial"". This was a reference to a trial which had ""so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all"" or ""where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings"". Neither defect existed in relation to the trial so far as it concerned the first appellant. 

79In AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438, Gummow and Hayne J qualified, in certain respects, the proposition in Weiss . This was a case in which the Court of Appeal in Western Australia had examined the record of the trial for itself to determine whether a substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred. At [41] - [42], the joint judgment stated:- 

[41] The focus of attention in the Court of Appeal in the present matter was whether that Court should be satisfied on the record of the trial that the evidence led at the appellant's trial proved beyond reasonable doubt his guilt of the three counts of indecent dealing. Two members of the Court (Roberts-Smith and Pullin JJA) concluded that a reading of the whole of the evidence led at trial left no doubt that it was the appellant who touched the complainant and committed the offences and, that being so, that [the proviso] was engaged. The third member of the Court ... was ""unable to conclude that a verdict of guilty was the only verdict reasonably open on the evidence"". 

[42] The Court of Appeal was wrong to focus only upon whether that Court could conclude from the written record of the evidence properly admitted at trial that the appellant was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offences charged. To approach the matter in that way paid insufficient regard to the error of law or miscarriage of justice which, by operation of s 30(3), otherwise required the Court to allow the appeal. 

(The particular error in the trial was that the judge who had conducted the trial without a jury, failed to give adequate reasons for his findings). 

80The joint judgment (at [52] - [53]) examined the Weiss proposition:- 

[52] In Weiss v R , the Court emphasised the need when applying a statutory provision to look to the language of the statute rather than secondary sources or materials. With respect to the proviso to the common form criminal appeal statute the Court said: 

It is neither right nor useful to attempt to lay down absolute rules or singular tests that are to be applied by an appellate court where it examines the record for itself, beyond the three fundamental propositions mentioned earlier. (The appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; the task is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks; the standard of proof is the criminal standard.) It is not right to attempt to formulate other rules or tests in so far as they distract attention from the statutory test. It is not useful to attempt that task because to do so would likely fail to take proper account of the very wide diversity of circumstances in which the proviso falls for consideration. 

[53] In Weiss , the Court identified one circumstance in which the proviso to the common form criminal appeal statute cannot be engaged. The Court said ([44]) that the proviso cannot be engaged ""unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty"". This negative proposition (about when the proviso cannot be engaged) must not be treated as if it states what suffices to show that no substantial miscarriage has occurred. To treat the negative proposition in this way would be to commit the very same error which Weiss sought to correct, namely, taking judicial statements about aspects of the operation of statutory provisions as substitutes for the statutory language. 

81Their Honours stated (at [55]) that:- 

In every case it will be necessary to consider the application of the proviso ... taking proper account of the ground or grounds of appeal that have been made out and which, but for the engagement of the proviso, would require the appellate court to allow the appeal [emphasis added]. 

82Finally, at [59], the joint judgment stated:- 

When there has been a trial by jury, and an appellate court concludes that the trial judge made a wrong decision on a question of law or that there was some other miscarriage of justice, deciding whether there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice necessarily invites attention to whether the jury's verdict might have been different if the identified error had not occurred . That is why, if the appellate court is not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt it cannot be said that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. But just as persuasion of the appellate court of the accused's guilt does not in every case conclude the enquiry about the proviso's application in appellate review of a jury trial, enquiring about the weight of the evidence led at a trial by judge alone does not determine whether there was a substantial miscarriage of justice. In a case, like the present, where the Criminal Procedure Act required that the trial yield a reasoned decision, but no reasons were given for the determination of the central issue tried, it cannot be said that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice [emphasis added]. 

83This qualification, albeit appearing in a different context, was again emphasised by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Gassy v R [2008] HCA 18; 236 CLR 293. In that case the majority (Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) considered whether a trial judge had erred in refusing to permit an accused to be represented by counsel during argument on a voir dire, and whether he had erred in giving a particular direction to the jury. Their Honours, referring to the proviso in the South Australian legislation (section 353(1) and (2) of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA)) said at [16] - [17]:- 

[16] As this Court pointed out in Weiss v R , judicial expressions describing the task presented by the proviso to the common form criminal appeal statute must not be taken as substitutes for the statutory language. It is the relevant language of the applicable criminal appeal provision that must be considered and applied. 

[17] The Court also pointed out in Weiss that the use of the word ""substantial"" in the proviso to the common form appeal provision (""no substantial miscarriage of justice"") was more than mere ornamentation. The expression ""substantial miscarriage"" was adopted to make plain that the common form appeal provision did away with the old Exchequer rule by which any departure from trial according to law, regardless of its nature or importance, entitled the accused to a new trial. But whether there has been a ""substantial miscarriage"" at any trial will depend, as was also pointed out in Weiss , upon the particular facts and circumstances and ""[n]o single universally applicable description of what constitutes 'no substantial miscarriage of justice' can be given "" [emphasis added]. 

84Their Honours, in Gassy , then referred to the passage in Weiss that had been selected for comment in AK v State of Western Australia . Once again, they referred to it as ""one important negative proposition"". Their Honours then stated (at [18]:- 

The negative proposition identified in Weiss states when the proviso may not be engaged but, as the reasons in Weiss make plain, it is not a statement that may be treated as a complete and sufficient paraphrase of the statute. To approach the application of the proviso as if its operation is sufficiently described by describing when it is not engaged would commit the very same error the decision in Weiss sought to identify. 

85The joint judgment then considered the impugned directions that had been given by the trial judge. The deficiencies in the direction, in their Honour's view, ""rendered this trial a miscarriage of justice"" ( Green v R (1971) 126 CLR 28 at 34). 

86Their Honours next considered whether the impugned direction was an error of a kind which precluded engaging the proviso. Their Honours said at [34]:- 

Whether the error constituted by giving the impugned instructions is properly described as ""fundamental"" or as an error going ""to the root of the proceedings"" would depend upon the content that is given to the expressions used. The statutory question is whether the Full Court considers that ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"". In answering that question it is necessary to consider the nature of the error and in doing that it will be important to consider the possible effect that the error may have had on the outcome of the trial [emphasis added]. 

In examining this, their Honours said at [36] - [37]: 

[36] The case against the applicant depended, in critically important respects, upon what the jury made of each of two separate mosaics of evidence adduced by the prosecution in proof of what was alleged concerning the applicant's presence and actions in Brisbane and in Adelaide. Important elements of each of those mosaics were provided by evidence given by persons who did not know the applicant but identified him as the man whom they had seen. 

[37] The conclusions which the prosecution urged the jury to reach at the applicant's trial depended upon an assessment of the accuracy and reliability of this evidence. The conclusions for which the prosecution argued cannot safely be reached by an appellate court when it can refer only to the written record of the evidence. 

87The joint judgment concluded that, on the record of the trial, the full court could not have been persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt, and that it followed that the appeal should be allowed. 

88Kirby J provided a separate decision. However, it is clear that his Honour (at [46]) agreed with the reasons given by Gummow and Hayne JJ that there had been an error of law in the interlocutory ruling concerning the applicant's entitlement to counsel. Importantly, Kirby J also agreed with the joint judgment that there had been a miscarriage of justice resulting from the supplementary jury direction referred to by Gummow and Hayne JJ. At [52], Kirby J stated:- 

Consequently, the applicant has established on each of the residual complaints about his trial either a ""wrong decision on any question of law"" or ""that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice"". According to the general provision of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act for the determination of criminal appeals in ordinary cases, it was therefore the prima facie duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to allow the appeal against conviction. 

89Kirby J then discussed the proviso and, in that regard, the decision in Weiss . 

90After an extensive and careful examination of the Crown evidence at trial, Kirby J concluded that a re-trial was necessary. At [106] - [107], his Honour said:- 

[106] In Weiss, this Court said (at [45]): 

[T]here may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt. Cases where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness at trial may provide examples of cases of that kind. 

There have been many cases where judges of this Court have made similar points ( See eg Mraz v R (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514 per Fullagar J; [1955] HCA 59; cf Nudd (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at 645 [162]; 225 ALR 161 at 200-201; Libke (2007) 81 ALJR 1309 at 1322 [53]; 235 ALR 517 at 533) . AK v Western Australia involved a trial by judge alone but the principles are relevantly the same. There Gleeson CJ and Kiefel J, although in dissent as to the disposition, said (at [23]): 

[S]ome errors are so fundamental or involve such a departure from the essential requirements of a fair trial that they exclude the operation of the proviso, irrespective of the strength of the prosecution case, or the appellate court's view as to the guilt of the accused. 

[107] To similar effect Gummow and Hayne JJ, in the majority, said (at [59]): 

[P]ersuasion of the appellate court of the accused's guilt does not in every case conclude the enquiry about the proviso's application in appellate review of a jury trial. 

And Heydon J, also in the majority, citing the foregoing passage from Weiss , observed that (at [87]): 

...there may be cases where it would be proper to allow an appeal and order a new trial without applying the proviso ... includ[ing] cases 'where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness at trial'. 

91Kirby J found that the applicant had lost the chance of a trial that was conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with law. This is as a consequence of the trial judge not adequately repairing the injustice to the applicant flowing from the late supplementary direction that had been given. Kirby J considered that the High Court was not in a position to conclude that no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. 

92Rafael Cesan v R [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 was an appeal that followed upon the ""sleeping judge"" trial. French CJ held that the circumstances of the trial judge falling asleep on a number of occasions during the trial had resulted in a miscarriage of justice. It was, as he described it (at [96]) ""a miscarriage of justice by failure of the judicial process"". It was constituted ""by the judge's substantial failure to maintain the necessary supervision and control of the trial"". Further, his conduct had created ""a distraction during the trial process"". At [97], French CJ considered the proviso:- 

It could not be said in this case that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice within the meaning of the proviso to s 6(1). The judge's conduct had a discernible distracting effect on the jury. The reaction of some of the jury members raised a real question about the extent to which they would have attended to the evidence and accorded to the judge's directions the respect and attention they required. The Court of Criminal Appeal was in no position to assess these imponderables. The nature of the miscarriage of justice which occurred put such inquiry beyond its reach. Further, this is a case in which the miscarriage of justice was substantial because it created the appearance of injustice which could not be cured by the Court of Criminal Appeal forming the opinion that a reasonable jury would have convicted the appellants in any event. 

93The joint judgment of Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ considered both the issue of a miscarriage of justice and the proviso. As to the first, the joint judgment, focussing on the consequences of the trial judge falling asleep, concluded that there had been a miscarriage of justice. The jury had been distracted from performing their proper tasks, and the trial judge had failed to cure this distraction caused by his own unfortunate medical condition. 

94As to the proviso, the joint judgment said (at [123] - [124]):- 

[123] In Weiss v R , the Court said that it was neither right nor useful to attempt to lay down absolute rules or singular tests to govern the application of the proviso beyond three fundamental propositions... the Court held that no single universally applicable description of what constitutes ""no substantial miscarriage of justice"" can be given. 

[124] The Court further held in Weiss that a necessary, but not always sufficient, step to the application of the proviso is that the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. But the conclusion that guilt of the accused was proved to that standard does not, in every case, suffice to show that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. An example of circumstances in which consideration of what was proved at trial is not a sufficient basis for applying the proviso is provided by AK v Western Australia . In that case the relevant statute required that the trial of an accused, by judge alone, yield a reasoned decision, but there were no reasons given at the appellant's trial for the determination of the central issue tried in the case. That being so, it could not be said that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. 

[125] In Wilde v R [1988] HCA 6; 164 CLR 365 at 373 , reference was made to the possibility that some errors occurring in the course of a criminal trial may amount to such a serious breach... as to deny the application of the proviso. 

95Their Honours then added (at [126]):- 

But just as the application of the proviso is not to be determined by deduction from expressions which attempt to describe the operation of the statutory language in other words, what was said in Wilde is not to be taken as if it were a judicially determined exception grafted upon the otherwise general words of the relevant statute. And the application of the proviso is not to be determined according only to whether the form of expression used in Wilde , or some other conclusive statement, appears to be an apt description of the course of the trial. Rather, it is necessary to have regard to the miscarriage of justice that has been identified [emphasis added]. 

96The joint judgment then identified that, as the miscarriage in the present matter lay in the distraction of members of the jury, it was not possible to conclude, on the written record of the trial, that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That was a necessary condition for application of the proviso, and accordingly, it had not been made out. In reaching this conclusion, the majority referred to the ""natural limitations"" that exist in the case of an appellant court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record of the trial. 

97Both Gummow and Hayden JJ supported the reasons given by Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. 

98Before coming to a resolution of the difference between the parties on this point, it is necessary to note that, in a recent decision ( R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8), the High Court at [50] declined to apply the proviso and, in so doing, referred to the principles as articulated in Gilbert and Gillard :- 

... The decisions in Gilbert and Gillard also require the further conclusion that it cannot be said that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice in the case of Dang Quang Nguyen in not leaving manslaughter as an available verdict. 

99This decision of the High Court was later picked up and applied by Beazley JA in Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93 at [50] and [55]. Her Honour went so far as to suggest that a failure to leave manslaughter equated to unfairness in the conduct of the trial. 

Resolution 

100We would prefer to base our conclusion in the present case on two propositions. 

101The first arises from the High Court statement that a ""necessary but not always sufficient step"" in the application of the proviso is the negative stipulation in Weiss . Having regard to our findings at [61] to [66], we are not persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved beyond reasonable doubt the appellants' guilt of murder. Moreover, the ""natural limitations"" referred to in the authorities have particular relevance in these appeals for the court's ability to be so satisfied, wholly or substantially on the record of the trial. We refer, in particular, to the lack of precision in the medical evidence concerning the injuries, and, more importantly, the difficulty in assessing the credit and reliability of the four ""confessional"" witnesses, based solely on our reading of the record. While we are entitled to take into account the verdict of guilty reached by the jury, this consideration must be given less weight in the present matter. This is because the jury were not invited to consider manslaughter, and were not directed on that issue. 

102The second proposition derives from the reminder in the authorities to which we have referred that the ""negative stipulation"" in Weiss is not itself to be treated as ""a complete and sufficient paraphrase of the statute"" ( Gassy at [18]). It is always necessary to consider whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. In considering that question, posed by the statute, it remains necessary to consider the nature of the error, and in doing that, the court is entitled to consider the possible effect that the error may have had on the outcome of the trial ( Gassy at [34]). In view of our finding (at [68]), in relation to Rule 4, we are satisfied on that basis also that the proviso should not apply. The nature of the error, we have found, may have caused each appellant to lose a real chance, or a chance fairly open to him, of being found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. It is the nature of the error itself in the particular circumstances of the present trial that leads us to this conclusion. 

103Contrary to the Crown submissions, we do not consider that there is anything in Weiss , as explained by later decisions, that prevents this approach being taken. It was the approach endorsed by Gummow and Hayne JJ in AK v Western Australia and later approved in Gassy by the majority. Further, the application of the approach taken in both Gilbert and Gillard were endorsed, as we have pointed out, in the recent decision of the High Court in Nguyen . 

Conclusion 

104We are satisfied that manslaughter should have been left in the present matter, notwithstanding that it was not raised as an alternative by either the Crown or the appellants at trial. Further, we do not consider that Rule 4 should stand in the way of the appeal being allowed in each case. We are satisfied that the proviso should not be applied in favour of the Crown. 

105Before departing from the matter, we should add, in fairness to the trial judge, that nothing we have said is intended to be critical of her actual conduct of the trial. The trial judge conducted each and every aspect of the trial in precisely the way she was asked to do by the parties. 

106The order of the court is that, in each appeal, the appeal is allowed and the appellant is to have a new trial.

		29 October 2012",2011-10-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758038,R v Helen Ryan ; R v Coralie Coulter [2011] NSWSC 1249,"SENTENCE 

1The offenders stand to be sentenced for the offence of murder, following verdicts of guilty on 4 July 2011. The victim was Helen Ryan's husband, and Coralie Coulter's son-in-law, Jeffrey Ryan, who was gunned down on his property on 23 October 2009 by a hired ""hitman"". Helen Ryan contracted with a Mr Ken Brooks to have her husband killed for the sum of $30,000, of which $10,000 was contributed by Coralie Coulter in the knowledge that Jeffrey Ryan would be murdered. 

2The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a standard non parole period of 20 years. Those two guideposts are to be borne in mind when the Court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of each of the offenders : Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39. 

3Helen and Jeffrey Ryan lived on a property near Tamworth, which they owned and operated together since 2001. They each had children from former relationships. Their marriage produced a daughter, CR, who was 13 years of age at the time of the offence. 

4In the 12 to 18 months prior to the murder, the marriage deteriorated to the point where Mr Ryan had engaged a solicitor in February 2009 to commence divorce proceedings. The evidence in the trial established that Mr Ryan had complained to family members and friends of minor assaults upon him by Helen Ryan. There was evidence of minor bruising to Mr Ryan's upper arm, consistent with such assaults. Similar claims were made by Helen Ryan against her husband, although the extent and severity of the assaults said to have been committed upon her were a matter of some contention. 

5I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Helen Ryan's claims in respect of the assaults upon her by her husband, and his general behaviour towards her and towards their daughter, were grossly exaggerated, no doubt in order to convince her mother, Coralie Coulter, and her younger sister, Ganene, that drastic action was needed to ensure their safety. In the course of several conversations between Coralie Coulter, Ganene Coulter and another person in the weeks after Mr Ryan's death, Helen Ryan's mother and sister both spoke of threats to Helen Ryan's life and serious physical assaults upon her by the victim. It was these asserted episodes of violence or threats of violence that were said to justify Helen Ryan's actions. These allegations originated from Helen Ryan and were not supported by other evidence in the trial, subject to what appears in the following paragraph. More importantly, there were features of Helen Ryan's behaviour before and after the victim's death that are inconsistent with these claims. 

6I accept that there were episodes of pushing and shoving between Helen Ryan and the victim, and that on occasions, the victim's greater strength resulted in the offender sustaining bruising. On one occasion, the victim pushed Helen Ryan against the wall, resulting in a break in the gyprock. 

7I also accept that there was an episode involving the victim's daughter, constituted by the victim pushing or throwing a bag of feed towards her, which resulted in a complaint by her to her teachers at school. The matter was reported to police, who applied for an apprehended violence order against the victim. The first return date for the order was 29 September 2009. The victim attended court on that day and the matter was adjourned to 12 October 2009. An interim order was granted by the court. When this order was served upon him, the victim moved to a shipping container on the property some distance from the house. However, before that time the victim and Helen Ryan occupied separate bedrooms. 

8In a covertly recorded conversation between the victim and Helen Ryan in the weeks before his death, the victim attempts to convince Helen Ryan that the marriage is over and that she should reconcile herself to that fact and seek happiness with someone else. Helen Ryan's response is one of disbelief and unwillingness to accept that position. The offender is heard to plead with the victim to reconcile, but she is consistently rebuffed. 

9The evidence at trial also established that Helen Ryan sought to persuade the police to remove the apprehended violence order. The offender made repeated efforts to contact a woman with whom the victim was having a close relationship and entreated the victim to finish the relationship. Helen Ryan also became aware that her husband had changed his will, to her detriment. As it became clear to the offender that her husband was resolute in his intention to end the marriage, Helen Ryan put her plan into effect. She paid Mr Brooks $15,000 by way of a downpayment, with the balance due after the job had been done. She provided Mr Brooks with photos of the victim and the information that her husband was living in the shipping container. 

10On the night of 23 October 2009, the victim left the main residence between 7:30 pm and 8:15 pm. When he returned to the shipping container, which was at some distance from the house, he had a cup of coffee and received a telephone call. It appears the victim got ready to retire, changing into a T-shirt, shorts and slippers. Sometime after 8:40 pm, something caused the victim to leave the shipping container, leaving his keys, wallet and phone inside. The killer fired at least two shots from a shot gun which penetrated the victim's chest and abdomen and the right side of the lower lumbar area, indicating that the victim was shot from behind and slightly to his right. 

11In the weeks and months after the murder, Helen Ryan and Coralie Coulter attempted to put various measures in place in response to police enquiries concerning the murder of Jeffrey Ryan. They became concerned about the ability of the police to track various phone calls made between Helen Ryan and Mr Brooks, and between each of them and the ""go-between"" who had put Helen Ryan in contact with Mr Brooks in the first place. Much of the evidence at trial tending towards proof of the nature of the agreement between Helen Ryan and Mr Brooks came through recordings of conversations between the offenders and other persons. 

12Following the charging of Helen Ryan on 15 December 2009, Helen Ryan accompanied another person to the Local Court at Tamworth, with the intention of paying $10,000 to an alleged corrupt official so that the matter would not proceed. On 10 February 2010, Helen Ryan attended the residence of Mr Brooks in Cessnock in order to pay the outstanding $15,000. She was arrested on her return to Tamworth and has remained in custody since. Coralie Coulter was also arrested that day and has remained in custody. Helen Ryan spent two days in custody prior to her release to bail in December 2009. 

13At trial, Helen Ryan gave evidence to the effect that she had contracted with Mr Brooks to assault her husband, short of inflicting any serious harm upon him, in order to ""bring him to his senses"" and bring about a reconciliation in the marriage. It is not surprising that, given the weight of the evidence summarised above, this account of how the killer came to be at the property, and the purpose of his confrontation with Mr Ryan, was rejected by the jury. 

14By its verdict, the jury determined that Helen Ryan deliberately and methodically plotted to have her husband killed, and that she enlisted the aid of her mother and her sister to bring about that result and avoid the possibility of detection for the offence. Far from the cowering, oppressed and terrorised wife that she attempted to portray, Helen Ryan embarked on a cold-blooded plan to get rid of her husband, rather than risk the dissolution of the marriage and the loss or diminution of the assets that they had jointly acquired. 

15The objective gravity of this offence is of a very high order. The callousness with which both offenders embarked upon this plan and carried it to fruition, knowing that it would deprive Mr Ryan's extended family of a much loved father, brother and son, not to mention Helen Ryan's own daughter of a father, beggars belief. In my view, the offence falls very close to the worst category for offences of this type. 

16In the case of Helen Ryan, the offence is worthy of the description ""wicked"" and ""gravely reprehensible"". To contemplate and carry out such a plan for purely selfish and largely financial motives demonstrates heinousness to a significant degree. There was a considerable deal of persistence exhibited by Helen Ryan. The killing was to have taken place weeks earlier but was called off by Mr Brooks. Throughout this period of time, the offender was acutely aware that there were agencies in the community, such as the police, the legal profession and the Family Court, which were capable of advocating on her behalf so as to preserve her lawful interests. She deliberately chose to exact revenge upon her husband. On the night that he was killed, Helen Ryan received a call from Mr Brooks and informed him that her husband had left the house. I am satisfied to the requisite standard that she did so, knowing that she was sending her husband to his death. 

17In the light of my rejection of the Crown's submission that this case falls within the worst category and therefore attracts the imposition of a life sentence, it is not strictly necessary to consider the criteria that would in fact justify the imposition of a life sentence. However, I would observe that if I had accepted the Crown's submission, I am not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the imposition of a life sentence is required in order to meet the combined effect of retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence. In particular, there does not appear to be a compelling need to protect the community from this offender. There is no material which justifies the conclusion that this was not a gross aberration. There is no reason to think that she represents an ongoing danger to the community at large. 

18That said, the objective gravity of the offence requires a very severe penalty. Helen Ryan continues to protest her innocence. There is very little that can be said in mitigation of the offence itself. 

19In the case of Coralie Coulter, the contents of the telephone conversations referred to above demonstrate that this offender was integral to the contract with Mr Brooks, in the sense that she provided the bulk of the deposit that initiated the killing. After the victim's death, this offender actively and consistently encouraged Helen Ryan and Ganene Coulter to remain firm in the face of the police investigation. Her involvement in the commission of the offence, whilst prompted by clearly fabricated allegations made by Helen Ryan against the victim, is difficult to comprehend, given her acknowledgement that she had previously regarded Jeffrey Ryan as a good husband and father. She personally had no motive for harming the victim, yet she was prepared to engage in a plot to have him killed on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations made by her daughter. Even if there had been some truth in what this offender was told, at no stage on the evidence in the trial did Coralie Coulter attempt to persuade her daughter that there were other lawful measures that were available to her. At every stage of the process, according to the jury's verdict, Coralie Coulter was a willing and active participant. 

20Her criminality is of a lesser order than that of Helen Ryan, primarily because she was not the instigator of the plot and, apart from providing the money, she played no direct role in the negotiations with Mr Brooks that led up to the killing : R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at 52. In addition, I am persuaded on the balance of probabilities that this offender's participation in the offence can be explained (albeit never justified) by her genuine belief that her daughter and her granddaughter were being subjected to gross physical and possibly sexual abuse. Both this offender and Ganene Coulter appeared to accept without reservation the claims made by Helen Ryan to the effect that both she and CR were being terrorised by the victim. 

21This offender's counsel has submitted that considerations of parity arise as between the offender and Ganene Coulter. Ganene Coulter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder and received a substantial discount on the sentence imposed for that offence on the basis of her willingness to give evidence in the offender's trial. In the course of the trial, Ganene Coulter maintained that her mother knew nothing of the purpose of the money until after the victim had been killed. However, that evidence was entirely inconsistent with the tenor of the recorded conversations and was obviously rejected by the jury in favour of the objective evidence at trial. 

22Whilst there are circumstances where considerations of parity arise, notwithstanding that co-offenders have been sentenced on the basis of different offences, the basis of the charge preferred against Ganene Coulter was that she made contact with the ""go-between"" on behalf of Helen Ryan, in the expectation that someone would be made available to kill the victim. Ganene Coulter played no further part in the commission of the offence, although she continued to communicate with both offenders and was present, at the request of Helen Ryan, when the victim's body was discovered. Of course, the most significant difference between Ganene Coulter and Coralie Coulter for the purposes of sentence is the fact that the former pleaded guilty to an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non parole period of 10 years, that is, half the standard non parole period for the offence of murder. 

23The Court received a number of very moving victim impact statements from members of the victim's family, including his sons and sisters. These statements were received on the basis that they provide those persons affected by the death of the victim with a voice in the proceedings. They have no bearing on the sentence ultimately imposed, because the long-standing policy of the criminal law values each life equally. 

24The victim's daughter, CR, provided a ""victim impact statement"" through her mother's legal representatives. In that statement, CR describes her distress at hearing that her father was engaged in another relationship and the ""emotional abuse"" to which she and her mother were subjected by the victim. The entirety of the letter reads as an apology for her mother's conduct and a damning indictment of the victim. To the extent that the statement purports to support Helen Ryan's account of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of the victim, it is an unsworn and untested statement that has no weight for the purposes of sentencing. 

25More importantly, I doubt that the statement qualifies as a victim impact statement for the purposes of s 26 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That provision defines a victim impact statement relevantly as :- 

a statement containing particulars of: 
................................................... 
(b) in the case of a family victim, the impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family. 


26As I have already noted, the statement is almost wholly concerned with events that predated the victim's death. It fails to express any impact upon CR arising out of the death of her father. 

27I turn to the offenders' subjective circumstances. 

28Helen Ryan is presently 51 years of age. She was born near Grafton in northern New South Wales. She is the second eldest child in a family of three boys and three girls. Her father died in 1987 of cancer. The offender reported to a psychologist (Exhibit 1) that her father was a placid, loving parent who was treated badly by her mother. The offender was educated in the Maclean area and obtained her school certificate in the course of an early pregnancy. 

29She claimed that she was kicked out of home by her mother when she fell pregnant to her first partner. She lived with her partner's parents for 12 months and then moved into rented accommodation. That relationship continued for 17 years. The offender described her first partner as a heavy drinker who was consistently verbally abusive and intermittently physically abusive. The relationship produced two daughters who remain supportive of the offender. 

30The offender met Jeffrey Ryan after she separated from her first partner. It appears that Jeffrey Ryan was in a relationship with Ganene Coulter when he transferred his affections to the offender. They moved in together in 1994 and in 1995 the offender gave birth to her daughter. At that stage the couple were living on a property near Casino owned by the Ryan family. That property was sold and they moved to Tamworth in 2001. 

31The property was affected by drought, necessitating the offender finding employment in the town. Jeffrey Ryan also took on employment in the town in 2008. At that time the offender was on workers compensation payments. It was at about this time that Mr Ryan commenced a close relationship with a woman at his workplace and the marriage came under stress. The psychologist's report also contains a statement by the offender that her husband was physically violent towards her ""on at least two occasions"" and that her mother, Coralie Coulter, advised the offender to leave Jeffrey Ryan. It is of some interest to note that, according to the psychologist's report, the offender said she was too attached to the country lifestyle and to her daughter's interest in horses to take that option. The report also states that ""at times the client maintained her husband was also sexually abusive of her although she never revealed that either because of feelings of shame and embarrassment. Ms Ryan commented that 'looking back, I guess you could call it rape'."" Not only is this latter statement to a psychologist unsubstantiated and untested by evidence on oath, the jury's rejection of the offender as a witness of truth renders this account highly questionable. 

32The offender is in reasonably good health. She has no history of treatment for mental illness and no history of illegal drug use. She is described as a very occasional light social drinker. She has no prior criminal history. She is described as just above average intelligence. The psychologist's finding that she displayed a ""marked depressive mood and high anxiety"" is consistent with the fact that at that time she was facing trial for the offence of murder. Otherwise, the offender was said to display ""depressive, dependent and avoidant personality attributes"". 

33The offender's letter to the court (Exhibit 2) purports to express sorrow and remorse for the death of her husband. The offender takes responsibility for ""wishing my husband had a better relationship with both CR and myself"" and maintains the version given at trial, namely that she paid $5,000 to have her husband ""touched up"". The letter essentially invokes the hardship occasioned to the offender's daughter by the loss of her father and now the effective loss of her mother. 

34The offender's daughter is presently under the care of the offender's older daughter, although technically in the custody of the Department of Community Services. It is trite to observe that it was the offender's conduct which brought about the death of her daughter's father and the offender's incarceration. These were the natural and inevitable consequences of the offender's behaviour and no mitigation of the sentence can be justified in the circumstances of this case. It is not the type of hardship which would cause the Court to draw back from imposing a sentence that properly reflects the objective and subjective factors. 

35It is clear that the offender refuses to take responsibility for the murder of her husband and must therefore be sentenced on the basis that she demonstrates no remorse or contrition. Her prospects of rehabilitation therefore remain guarded. I can see no basis upon which the Court should find special circumstances, particularly given that the length of the sentence necessarily imports a lengthy parole period which should be more than sufficient to allow the offender to re-engage with the community. 

36Coralie Coulter is presently 72 years of age. Her husband died in 1987 of cancer at the age of 47 years. The offender raised six children and worked hard together with her husband in the family business in the fishing industry. The letters before the court (Exhibit 4) from the offender's adult children (other than her co-offenders) speak highly of her love, support and dedication to her family. They paint a picture of a devoted and selfless mother and grandmother, inconsistent with the kind of person that would commit the instant offence. 

37The Pre Sentence Report (Exhibit 3) refers to ""ongoing difficulties in the relationship between Ms Coulter and the co-offenders beginning in their early teenage years. One .... commenced the use of illicit substances from about the age of 13 years while the other fell pregnant and moved out of home at the age of 15 years to reside with the father of her child. It appears that during difficult financial periods both co-offenders relied on the mother for financial support and contrary to advice from her more stable children, Ms Coulter would provide for them financially."" This statement provides some insight into the circumstances leading to the commission of the offence but it is far from explanatory. 

38This offender also continues to protest her innocence. She must also be sentenced on the basis that she demonstrates no contrition or remorse. She has no prior criminal history. Apart from a mastectomy 15 years ago from which the offender appears to have fully recovered, she has no ongoing health problems that one would not expect to find in a woman of her age. 

39It is unfortunate but inevitable that any sentence imposed upon this offender, commensurate with the objective gravity of the offence and her role within it, will probably result in the offender living the remainder of her life in prison. That is not a sufficient reason to refrain from imposing such a sentence : Barton v R [2009] NSWCCA 164. However, it does justify an alteration to the statutory ratio, in order to allow for the likelihood of a decline in the offender's health and the need for medical intervention in the furture. 

40Taking all of these matters into account, I propose to sentence as follows :- 

41Helen Ryan, you are convicted of the offence of murder. I sentence you to a non parole period of 27 years to date from 8 February 2010, expiring 7 February 2037, with a balance of term of 9 years, expiring 7 February 2046. You are eligible for release to parole on 8 February 2037. 

42Coralie Coulter, you are convicted of the offence of murder. I sentence you to a non parole period of 18 years, to date from 10 February 2010, expiring 9 February 2028, with a balance of term of 9 years expiring 9 February 2037. You are eligible for release to parole on 10 February 2028.

		08 November 2011",2011-10-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758042,R v Andrew Iskandar & R v Nita Iskandar (No. 1) [2011] NSWSC 1324,"Judgment 

1The Crown seeks to tender two pieces of paper. Both pieces of paper are folded in half. One contains two clothes pegs attached and one has one clothes peg attached. The two pieces of paper, when folded, appear to me to be roughly the size of a standard number plate. The Crown also seeks to tender, with those two pieces of paper, two photographs taken by Crime Scene Officer Anthea Windsor showing those pieces of paper on a seat in the black Toyota that has been referred to in the evidence and which was apparently hired by Hazairin Iskandar. 

2The evidence is tendered with the view to asking the jury to infer that the pieces of paper, as pegged, were intended to be used to obscure the number plates of the hired car. The Crown submits that this is some further evidence on the part of the accused, Andrew Iskandar, of planning in relation to the offences charged. 

3Section 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 defines relevant evidence as evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. A fact in issue is whether this offence was planned. On the face of it, the evidence is relevant. 

4Mr O'Sullivan, for the accused Andrew Iskandar, opposes the evidence being received, both on the basis of ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act and submits, in particular, that in either case the evidence is unfairly prejudicial to his client. Mr O'Sullivan submits that what the Crown is inviting on the part of the jury is speculation, or at least a ""very long bow"" (to use his words), in suggesting that these two pieces of paper could form any part of the planning by the accused in relation to the offence of murder as charged. He says that the jury could not reasonably use the evidence in support of the inference that the Crown will ask it to draw. 

5Section 137 in particular involves a balancing act between the probative value of evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice to an accused. 

6Probative value is defined in the dictionary of the Evidence Act as meaning the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. The definition differs only from s 55 in that regard by omitting the words, ""if it were accepted."" 

7The distinction between that definition and s 55 is discussed by Spigelman CJ in R v Shamoul [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 commencing at [47]. At paragraphs [60] to [62] of that judgment the Chief Justice refers to authority in the Court in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account when determining the probative value of evidence for the purposes of determining questions of admissibility. He says that evidence has probative value, as it is defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty. 

8Further, in Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [14] Gleeson CJ says that if evidence is, albeit of slight probative value, it is nevertheless admissible unless some principle of exclusion comes into play to justify withholding it from the jury's consideration. It is not enough to say that the evidence is weak to withhold it from the jury. 

9In my opinion the evidence has probative value because the jury could infer that the pieces of paper, as folded and pegged, might have been used as part of the planning of the commission of the crime to obscure the number plates of the car. 

10Mr O'Sullivan has, as I have said, submitted that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial because at least it would not be reasonable for the jury to draw that conclusion and that they might be swayed from their proper task in speculating about its use. 

11In R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142 James J (with whom Rothman J and Harrison J agreed) said at [38] and [39]: 

Provided the evidence is capable of bearing the interpretation of, or of giving the inference contended for by the Crown, the fact that the defence can suggest some other interpretation or inference which would be consistent with the innocence of the accused, does not of itself show that any probative value the evidence has is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. It is part of the function of the jury, as the judges of the facts, to determine what interpretation should be given to the evidence they accept and to determine what inferences should be drawn from the evidence that they accept. 

12What has been stressed in the cases is that unfair prejudice is concerned with the possible misuse by the jury of the evidence: R v Sophear Em [2003] NSWCCA 374; (2009) 194 A Crim R 223 at [120] per Howie J (with whom Ipp JA agreed), and Louizos v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 71 at [35] per Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed). 

13It does not seem to me that the fact that the jury might draw the inference that the pieces of paper, as they appear, might have been intended to be used by the accused to obscure the number plates and that this involved a measure of planning in relation to the crime, is, or could be, a misuse of the evidence. If it is an available inference then the drawing of it can scarcely be said to be a misuse of the evidence. 

14No matter how one characterises the strength of the evidence, it is evidence which is relevant under the definition in the Evidence Act and has probative value as defined. How the jury uses it, and the inferences that the jury draws, are matters peculiarly for the jury. It is not for the judge to exclude such evidence on the basis of its weight. 

15In my opinion, the evidence is admissible.

		27 June 2012",2011-10-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758043,R v Sheather [2011] NSWSC 1239,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 

1HOEBEN J : The Offender, Ricky John Sheather, is sentenced for the offence of murder. He pleaded guilty to that offence on 20 June 2011 which was the first day of his trial. The Offender has been in custody since his arrest on 6 December 2009. This was the date on which the offence occurred. 

Factual Background to Offence 

2The Offender was born in October 1967 and is now 44. He was aged 42 at the time of the offence. 

3The Offender had been in a relationship with Fiona Duckett for about 15 months. She and her two sons had initially lived with the Offender in his flat in Wauchope and, for about two months before 6 December 2009, Ms Duckett and her sons lived in Flobern Street, Wauchope. The Offender was a frequent visitor to these premises, often staying overnight. 

4The deceased, Brett Donald Jones, had a son who was also known as Brett Ritchie. The son was aged 24 at the time of the offence and the deceased was aged 41. They were known as ""Little Brett"" and ""Big Brett"" respectively. 

5The Offender and the deceased had known each other since school days. It would seem that over the years, there had been instances and occasions of acrimony - even some physical conflict between them. The best description of a somewhat volatile relationship is that given by a witness, Michael Donovan: 

""Ricky and Brett had their fights with each other but were good mates and would drink with each other and say hello."" 

6Given the circumstances in which the offence occurred, I am not prepared to find that the Offender and deceased were enemies and that they hated each other as was suggested by the Offender in his ERISP. 

7On Sunday, 6 December 2009, the Offender awoke at Flobern Street. At about 11.00 am, he commenced to drink white wine. During the morning, he stopped drinking to assist a neighbour to move some furniture in a trailer. When he returned to Flobern Street, he resumed his drinking. He also, apparently, consumed three cones of cannabis. 

8On that same day, the deceased and Brett Ritchie were also drinking. For part of the time, they were down near the river in Wauchope and for part of the time they were at the home of Michael Donovan where they consumed some beer and some cannabis. At about 11.15 am, Mr Donovan gave the deceased and his son a lift up the road, dropping them in the shopping centre of town. 

9During the afternoon, the deceased and his son were making their way home. After walking for some time, they entered Flobern Street. As a result of the hot weather, and because of the alcohol which they had consumed they were, by this time, finding the walk somewhat difficult. They noticed the Offender drinking on his front porch and the two men crossed the road and joined him on the porch. The time was about 4.00 pm. 

10The Offender invited the deceased and Brett Ritchie in for a drink and they went to the eating area just off the kitchen where they sat at a table. They commenced to drink and talk about old times. Ms Duckett was cooking in the kitchen. One of her children was in the lounge room playing and the other was with a friend at the rear of the house. 

11Whilst they were talking, the men commenced to get loud and Ms Duckett told them to quieten down, which they did. After some time, she sat on the lap of the Offender and then stood up. Immediately after she did so, the Offender got up, went to the kitchen bench and picked up two large knives. 

12At the committal proceedings, Ms Duckett described the deceased as ""heavily intoxicated"" and the Offender as a little bit more intoxicated than the deceased. She described Brett Ritchie as ""mid-range intoxicated"" . 

13Having picked up the two knives, the Offender turned back to where the deceased and Brett Ritchie were sitting at the table. Ms Duckett tried to push the Offender back telling him to stop and put the knives down. She tried to grab the knives but the Offender swung them about and she received cuts to both her hands. She called to Brett Ritchie to grab the knives from the Offender. 

14She was joined by the deceased who stood to one side of her and Brett Ritchie on the other side. The Offender then lunged at the deceased, striking him in the chest with one of the knives. This caused an open wound in the chest. The deceased stood for a short time before collapsing on the floor, bleeding profusely. Brett Ritchie went to his assistance. 

15The Offender walked out the front door of the house still carrying the knives. Ms Duckett followed him screaming for help. In the front yard, the Offender verbally threatened her and came towards her. She picked up a piece of timber and swung it at the Offender, striking him around the ankles. The Offender then dropped the knives. When he first emerged from the house, the Offender was heard yelling threats and shouting at the neighbours. 

16The screaming and yelling of Ms Duckett alerted various neighbours who made ""000"" calls. Police responded and two constables arrived at 5.02 pm. Immediately upon arrival, the Offender was arrested and handcuffed. 

17One of the police officers commenced to perform CPR upon the deceased, but was unsuccessful in reviving him. When ambulance officers arrived, they examined the deceased and pronounced him dead. 

18A post-mortem examination of the deceased identified the cause of death as a stab wound 8.5 cm long and 3.5 cm wide to the left side of the chest. The wound had damaged the second and third ribs and passed through the left ventricle of the heart, slitting the left front coronary artery. The deceased had a blood-alcohol level of .308. 

19When interviewed following his arrest, the Offender was unable to remember the details of what happened. Specifically, he was unable to identify what it was that caused him to go into the kitchen and pick up two knives. Similarly, Ms Duckett in her statement, was unable to identify anything which was said, or any action which had taken place which would account for the Offender's conduct. 

20I find beyond reasonable doubt that neither the deceased nor Brett Ritchie offered or inflicted any violence on the Offender, nor did either one of them do anything to provoke him other than being present at the time. 

Objective Seriousness 

21Section 19A Crimes Act 1900 specifies the maximum penalty for murder as imprisonment for life. 

22Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") provides for the imposition of the maximum penalty where the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme as to require that that sentence be imposed. 

23The offence of murder is, however, an offence for which a standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed, pursuant to the provisions of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing Act. This non-parole period is to be imposed after trial for offending which is in the mid-range of objective seriousness. Aggravating and mitigating factors justifying a greater or lesser sentence also need to be considered ( Maxwell v R [2007] NSWCCA 304; 177 A Crim R 498 at [18]). 

24In this case, there was no trial. Nevertheless the authorities make clear that the standard non-parole period remains relevant as a guidepost or reference point. Accordingly, it is necessary to assess the objective seriousness of this offence. On the facts of this case, the Crown submitted that the offence fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. In my opinion, that was a concession properly made by the Crown. 

25The circumstances of the offence, together with the very intoxicated state of the Offender, make it clear that the offence was unplanned and unpremeditated and occurred as a spur-of-the-moment act. Nevertheless, by resisting the efforts of Ms Duckett to restrain him, it was also clear that the Offender had a determination to use the knives against the deceased. That having been said, it is significant that having struck the blow to the chest of the deceased, the Offender ceased his attack on the deceased. 

26I am satisfied that the intention of the Offender at the time, was not to kill, but was an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. The actions of the Offender, both at the time of the offence and in the front yard thereafter, are demonstrative of the onset of his inexplicable rage, but not of an intention to kill. 

27An analysis of the facts of the offence, by reference to the aggravating and mitigating factors set out in s.21A of the Sentencing Act, confirms my conclusion that the objective seriousness of this offence falls below the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. 

28The fact that a weapon was used is clearly an aggravating factor (s.21A(2)(c)). However, the effect of that aggravating factor is reduced in that the Offender taking up a weapon was unplanned and spontaneous. 

29That the offence was committed in the presence of a child and at Ms Duckett's home are also aggravating factors (s.21A(2)(ea), (eb)). Whilst those are important matters, their seriousness is reduced by the circumstances in which the offence occurred. The onset of the Offender's rage was spontaneous and inexplicable. It is clear that the Offender had little, if any, awareness of where he was and who else was present when pursuing his single-minded intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the deceased. 

30By way of mitigation, the Crown accepted that the Offender did not have any significant record of previous convictions (s.21A(3)(e)). Whilst the Offender did have a relatively minor record of criminal offences consisting of the misuse of a motor vehicle on occasions and convictions for assault and damage to property more than 10 years before, these were not the sort of matters which would prevent him from gaining the benefit of this subsection. 

31Although the Offender did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings, I am prepared to find that he has shown remorse for the offence. I do so because of his plea of guilty and because of his expressions of remorse in the ERISP and to the forensic psychologist, Ms Robilliard. In his ERISP, he said: 

""I feel bad that Brett's passed away, you know. We went to school together, we played football together. Yeah I feel bad."" (Q150) 

In her report of 22 August 2011, Ms Robilliard recorded the Offender as saying ""I regret he is dead - we had some good times"" and ""I regret his kids are going to grow up without him"" . 

32His prospects of successful rehabilitation (s.21A(3)(h)) and the likelihood of him not reoffending (s.21A(3)(g)) are less clear. He clearly has strong family support and family members were present during the sentencing hearing. Whilst he has problems with his temper, his capacity to control it and therefore to not reoffend would appear to be closely linked to his regular abuse of alcohol in the 10 years leading up to the offence. If those matters could be addressed, his prospects of rehabilitation would improve and the likelihood of him reoffending would be less. 

33On the state of the evidence before me, I cannot reach any conclusion one way or the other on this issue. No doubt, he will have the opportunity while in prison to attend courses which will address these matters, but the evidence before me was largely silent on these questions. In the Offender's favour is the fact that despite his alcohol issues, his contact with the criminal law over the years has been comparatively minor. 

34The Offender's level of intoxication is not a matter which can be properly taken into account by way of mitigation. It provides an explanation, but not an excuse, for his otherwise irrational behaviour. To the extent that the Offender can gain some benefit from his state of intoxication, he has done so in my finding that the offence was unplanned, unpremeditated and spontaneous. 

Subjective Features 

35In the Offender's case, a comprehensive report from Ms Robilliard, forensic psychologist, was placed before the Court. In order to prepare that report, Ms Robilliard spent over three-and-a-half hours with the Offender and conducted a number of tests. Her report provided valuable information as to the Offender's background. 

36The Offender was the eldest in a family of two boys and a girl. His younger brother is in stable employment and his sister and her husband live in Wauchope as do his parents. He came from a caring and stable family. He left school at the end of Year 10 in order to obtain work at the local sawmill. The Offender was in steady employment in essentially labouring jobs from that date until approximately 10 years before the offence when he was forced to give up work as a result of a back injury and what he said was agoraphobia. He received a disability pension for those conditions and had been in receipt of that pension for 10 years until the date of the offence. 

37The Offender's IQ was found to be in the average range. Personality tests ""evidenced symptoms which could attract a diagnosis of Schizotypal Personality Disorder and he evidenced characteristic avoidant depressive and self-defeating behavioural attributes at an entrenched and characteristic level . This combination of significant scores describes an individual who would experience significant interpersonal difficulties because of deficits in his ability to comprehend the meaning and significance of interpersonal behaviour and marked reluctance to form close emotional ties"" . 
 
38In relation to his period of unemployment, Ms Robilliard said: 

""Without the structure of employment the client described a slow pace of life and he acknowledged developing an entrenched pattern of binge drinking and cannabis use. According to the scores he achieved on the personality test administered he barely saw his use of alcohol and illegal drugs as problematic. However, during our interview Mr Sheather acknowledged regularly experiencing consequent blackouts associated with his binges. This apparent anomaly suggests that Mr Sheather's attitude to his substance use is unrealistic and defensive."" 

39Ms Robilliard recorded an episode of the Offender being sexually molested from the age of five to nine years, but there was no connection made between that and his offending behaviour. There was certainly nothing in his history which would suggest that this sexual molestation was relevant to these sentencing remarks. 

40Ms Robilliard's conclusion was: 

""From the personality test results obtained from the client during our meeting symptoms of Schizotypal Personality Disorder were described which contributed to interpersonal difficulties because of deficits in the individual's ability to comprehend and interpret the meaning of interpersonal behaviours. An intelligence test administered showed the client's overall IQ score placed him into the Average range. He demonstrated an unusual deficit on the Verbal subtest which does not necessarily equate to deficits in verbal comprehension as higher order executory skills may also be relevant. Neuropsychological testing would be required to elucidate the aetiology and clinical significance of the client's spread of scores."" 

41Earlier in the report, Ms Robilliard defined the behaviour of schizotypal individuals as follows: 

""Schizotypal individuals lead socially isolated lives and exhibit eccentricities such as odd mannerisms, expressions and clothing. They often drift to and from various locations and sources of employment, and generally function on the fringes of society with very few, if any, enduring emotional attachment. Their thought processes are scattered and their capacity to comprehend the meaning of interpersonal behaviour is typically limited."" 

42While it is clear that the Offender had a personality disorder, the relationship between that disorder and the offence is not clear. The difficulty for the Court is to determine what, if any, weight should be given to the Offender's personality disorder in the sentencing process. 

43In R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228, Sperling J set out the principles that should be considered when an offender who suffers from a mental illness is to be sentenced. The issue here, of course, is whether in fact the Offender suffers from such a mental illness. The matters to be considered as set out in R v Hemsley are: 

""[33] Mental illness may be relevant ... in three ways. First , where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced: Henry at [254]; Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23]; Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [51]; Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]; Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]. 

[34] Secondly , mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: Pearce (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported); Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Letteri (NSW CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported); Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]. 

[35] Thirdly , a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Tsiaras at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]."" 

44There is no real explanation in the evidence for why the Offender became so upset and reacted so violently at the time of the offence. One can speculate and surmise that he may have misunderstood what was being said by the deceased and his son and that the reason for this was the personality disorder identified by Ms Robilliard. To make a finding to that effect, however, would involve exactly that - speculation. That is not an exercise which the Court should engage in. 

45There is no clear evidence either of a direct or inferential kind, which would indicate that the Offender's personality disorder contributed to the commission of the offence. Similarly, there is no evidence capable of establishing that this Offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Similarly, there is no evidence that a custodial sentence might weigh more heavily on the Offender than a person without his personality disorder. 

46As a result, I am not satisfied on the evidence before me, that the Offender's personality disorder should be taken into account in any significant way in moderating the sentence which should be imposed. 

Victim Impact Statements 

47I have received victim impact statements from the deceased's wife, his son, Brett, his daughter, Stacey, and his mother. Those statements eloquently describe the love which the deceased brought to his family, in particular his wife and children. The statements set out clearly the terrible loss that all of the family have suffered by the deceased's death. 

48The deceased's son, Brett, has set out in detail the significant effect which seeing his father's murder has had upon him and his family. He now suffers problems with sleeping and it has adversely affected his relationship with his friends and family. The loss of his father continues to cause in him a serious grief reaction. 

49The deceased's mother, daughter and wife have described their continuing sorrow at his loss and the great gap that his absence has brought into their lives. They all continue to feel great grief and loss because of his death. 

50I accept fully that the circumstances of the deceased's death have affected each member of the deceased's family and those close to him. Whilst the family may expect to see their loss and pain reflected in the sentence to be imposed, that is not the reason I have received their statements in these proceedings. I do, however, take into account their statements in the way permitted by the law and I note that no sentence of imprisonment can compensate for the loss of a loved one. I extend to them my sympathy for their loss. 

Conclusion 

51The Offender's plea of guilty was entered late. Nevertheless, it still had utilitarian value in that the cost of a two-week trial was avoided including the necessity of Ms Duckett's sons giving evidence in circumstances which would have undoubtedly been traumatic for them. In the circumstances, the Offender is entitled to a discount for his plea of guilty of 10%. 

52Murder has always been the most serious crime in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including denunciation and general deterrence. However, as I have already indicated, the objective seriousness of offences of murder need to be assessed within the appropriate range. 

53I have been referred to a number of sentencing decisions where attacks occurred similar to (but not identical with) the offence which occurred here. Some of these involved sentencing after trial, some after pleas of guilty and some preceding and post-dating the standard non-parole period provisions to which I have referred. I have examined the sentencing remarks in those cases, including those to which both the Crown and the defence drew my attention, making due allowance for their individual facts and circumstances. 

54The purposes of punishment include, in addition to general and specific deterrence, the rehabilitation of an offender, protection of the community and retribution. In view of my finding that the Offender's personality disorder had little influence on the commission of this offence, deterrence both general and specific, is important. In relation to this offence, I have had regard to factors in mitigation and factors of aggravation. What cannot be avoided, however, are the specific circumstances of the case. The offence involved a violent and unprovoked attack, the trigger for which has not been identified. 

55At the heart of the offence of murder is the taking of a human life. The infliction of violence upon a person is always serious. Where the act of violence causes the death of that person, the Courts must denounce such conduct by the imposition of appropriate sentences. A significant sentence of imprisonment is required in this case to punish the Offender and to deter others who may engage in similar conduct. 

56Contrary to the submissions made by senior counsel for the Offender, I do not propose to make a finding of special circumstances. The length of the term during which the Offender is under supervision will be sufficiently long to allow for the Offender's reintegration into the community. Any lengthier period would be of little utility. 

57The Offender's plea of guilty, my finding that the offence was below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of murder and my review of all relevant facts are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. 

58Ricky John Sheather, for the crime of murdering Brett Donald Jones, I sentence you to imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years. The non-parole period is to commence on 6 December 2009 and is to expire on 5 December 2024 and the balance of term of five years is to expire on 5 December 2029. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 5 December 2024.

2758050,R v Natasha YOUKHANA [2011] NSWDC 204,"Judgment 

1Natasha Youkhana has pleaded guilty to an offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime: s 193B(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). An important particular of that offence is the amount said to be involved in the crime. The Crown contends that $4,642,135 was involved. The defence say about $2,000,000 should come off that figure. The particulars are set out in the Facts document (Exhibit A, Tab 2). When that document was tendered I was informed that objection was taken to paragraphs [31]-[36] and [38]-[44]. That objection was later extended to paragraphs [28] and [37]. 

2Paragraphs [31]-[44], which follow a subheading ""E"" in the document, are the subject of this application and relate to allegations made by Alessio Torelli, whose statement is now before me as Voir Dire Exhibit D. On an earlier occasion in these proceedings I was informed by Mr Boulten SC, who appears for Ms Youkhana, that Mr Torelli was required for cross-examination. It is clear from Voir Dire Exhibits A, B and C that the Director of Public Prosecutions and the NSW Police have made all reasonable efforts to ensure that Mr Torelli was before the Court on 21 October 2011, the date that this matter was listed to determine disputed evidence. Mr Boulten accepts that evidence establishes Mr Torelli is ""unavailable"": Evidence Act, Dictionary Pt 2 Cl 4. 

3Ms Gray, for the Director, seeks to tender the statement and the annexures necessary to understand the statement made by Mr Torelli on 21 November 2007 (Voir Dire Exhibit D). Objection is taken to that tender. Mr Boulten asks that I direct that the Evidence Act applies to this part of the proceedings. I so direct. 

4Issue is joined on the question of whether, its maker being unavailable, Mr Torelli's previous statement should be admitted as relevant evidence on sentence because of the exception to the hearsay rule provided in s 65(2) Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Proper notice that s 65 would be relied on was provided in advance to the defence. Mr Boulten also submits that, should the document be admissible as hearsay, s 137 Evidence Act requires its exclusion. 

5Ms Gray relies on ss 65(2)(b) and (d) which read, relevantly: 

""The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation: 

(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or 
(d) was: 

(i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and 

(ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable"". 

6Mr Torelli clearly intended in his statement/representation to assert matters known directly by him relating to Ms Youkhana's dealings with sums of illicitly obtained cash in the order of $2 million. The statement, although made in November 2007, relates to events which occurred between March 2006 and March 2007. In making his statement, Mr Torelli had access to contemporaneous banking and other business records annexed to Voir Dire Exhibit D. The term ""shortly after"" in s 65 must be treated with a degree of flexibility. Much will depend on the circumstances, which include; temporal proximity, the subject matter and the maker's familiarity with it, and whether things such as contemporaneous documents were available to assist in the making of the statement. Mr Boulten accepts that, in all the circumstances, the statement/representation was made ""shortly after the event"" for the purposes of s 65. 

7It is for the party relying on the statement/representation to show that the statement/representation was made ""in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication"". Here, Ms Gray notes: 


Mr Torelli had previously given evidence to the Crime Commission about the subject matter of the statement and he concedes in his later statement that what he said to the Commissioner was not truthful. 

At the time he gave evidence before the Crime Commission Mr Torelli was represented by Senior Counsel who also represented Ms Youkhana before the Crime Commission. Senior Counsel subsequently withdrew from representing Mr Torelli. (No reasons were given for the withdrawal and none can be implied). 

The present statement was induced and in it Mr Torelli was given the opportunity to clearly set out his version of events, knowing that he only became subject to criminal penalty if what he said was false. 

Mr Torelli had, I can presume, become aware that the Crime Commission or NSW Police were in a position to check what he was saying and therefore he had a clear incentive to tell the truth and not fabricate. 

Mr Torelli had, or was provided with, contemporaneous bank and other business records to enable him to give an accurate recollection of events. 

8As to s 65(2)(d) Ms Gray submits the statement/representation was made against interest for, although induced, it was: 

(a)damaging to Mr Torelli's reputation; and 

(b)showed that he had committed an offence for which he had not been convicted. 

9Mr Boulten accepted this part of the submission. 

10On the question of whether it was ""made in circumstances that make it highly likely the representation is reliable"" Ms Gray noted, as she had in relation to the previous submission, that the witness was clearly aware, he having previously been before the Crime Commission and lied, that what he said would, so far as possible, be checked and that he would be liable to substantial criminal penalty if he lied. It is also clear that aspects of the statement contain reliable evidence, for example what is said in paras [76] and [77] were clearly accurate as they are the subject of matters about which Ms Youkhana has entered guilty pleas. On review, the circumstances of its making, which included its contents, clearly demonstrated the likelihood of if being reliable. 

11Mr Boulten submits that: 


Mr Torelli admitted to lying on oath to the Crime Commission on 15 May 2007 when he was examined on oath by Mr Standen and said he did not receive large sums of money from Alen Moradian or Ms Youkhana. Past behaviour is a good indicator of future behaviour. 

Mr Torelli was examined before the Crime Commission by counsel assisting Mr Standen, a now known criminal. 

Mr Torelli had significant incentive and motivation to downplay the extent of his involvement and exaggerate or emphasise the culpability of Ms Youkhana. 

The circumstances of the making of the statement to NSW Police were ""entirely opaque"". 

Mr Torelli changed his story four months later in circumstances where it is not known how, why or when he decided to do so. 

That Mr Torelli's statement was induced does not help the Crown. It is necessary in the interest of accuracy that the contents be tested by cross-examination. 

Mr Boulten notes, and it is accepted by the Director, that Mr Torelli was meant to be called as a witness at the committal proceedings but despite all attempts he did not attend and his statement was not the subject of earlier testing. 

There are real issues that relate to the probity and reliability of the statement and the prosecution has not met its onus. 

12Mr Boulten's submissions effectively went to the reliability of the representation but clearly encompassed a challenge whether the Crown had met its onus in relation to both unlikelihood of fabrication and likelihood of reliability in ss 65(2)(b) and (d). 

13Mr Boulten also submitted that I should exercise my discretion to reject the statement pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act. The thrust of his submissions went beyond the fact that Mr Torelli could not be cross-examined. He submitted the foundational facts give rise to potential for fundamental unfairness. 

14Ms Gray, in reply, noted no fundamental unfair prejudice had been shown and noted that s 65 permits the admission of evidence of the nature set out in the statement. 

Determination 

15My focus in applying s 65 is to look to the circumstances in which the representation was made and which applied when it was made. I have carefully read the proposed exhibit and examined, so far as practicable, the circumstances in which it was made. I was assisted by the evidence of Sergeant Klotz. I note the Crown has the onus of showing the unlikelihood of fabrication. This is a narrower test than likelihood of reliability. ""Fabrication"" includes the question of concoction, that is, whether the statement was made up. 

16The circumstance of its making include the content of the statement, the nature of the relationship between Mr Torelli and Ms Youkhana, and the factual setting of its making so far as I am able to determine. 

17The test pursuant to s 65(2)(b) is not a reliability test, it is perhaps narrower: see ss 65(2)(a), (c) and (d). 

18When I come to consider s 65(2)(d), again the Crown bear the onus, I must recognise that a person such as Mr Torelli may be motivated to downplay the extent of his involvement and exaggerate or emphasise the culpability of another. In making my determination I have found useful decisions: R v Jang [1999] NSWSC 1040 per Bell J; R v Suteski (No 4) (2002) 128 A Crim R 275; R v Ambrosoli (2002) 55 NSWLR 603; R v Mankotia [1998] NSWSC 295 and Conway v R (2000) 98 FCR 204. 

19In my opinion Mr Torelli, although he clearly is avoiding service, made a statement soon after the event in circumstances where he had been given an opportunity to avoid prosecution if he made a clear, verifiable and reliable account of his dealings with Ms Youkhana. The contents of the statement as far as his non-criminal relationship with Ms Youkhana were verifiable, as were payments, bank transfers and the like, which are evidenced by the annexures to the statement used by him in its preparation. He was, having previously lied to the Crime Commission, given an opportunity to be as accurate as he could, knowing that what he said would, and could, be checked. In those circumstances I find it unlikely what he said in the statement/representation (Exhibit Voir Dire D) was fabricated. 

20As to the alternative test in s 65(2)(d), the statement clearly was against interest, a fact which is not contested by Mr Boulten. It is also, given the fact that it was, and could be, checked made in circumstances that make it likely it is reliable. Clearly, the statement must be read with an understanding that, reliable or not, there was a clear motivation to downplay the extent of his involvement and exaggerate the culpability of others. That, of itself, does not cause me to reject its admission. 

21I now turn to the issue of whether I should exercise my discretion to reject the evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act . These are clearly criminal proceedings and I have directed that the Evidence Act applied. I must weigh the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice which I note requires me to measure what are in fact incommensurables. That is not an unusual task given a judge. I must look to the evidence, the particulars of the case and use experience of the Court. 

22It is clear that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue and, if admitted, has considerable probative value: here, the extent to which Ms Youkhana dealt with the proceeds of crime. I must weigh against that the dangers I will use the evidence on some improper basis or unconnected with the issues of the case or in a way, for example, that would cause me to be satisfied to a lower degree of probability than would otherwise be required: see ALRC (1985) No 26 Vol 1 at [644]. Clearly, if the prosecution is to rely upon the statement it must, when weighed with all the other evidence, establish beyond reasonable doubt the extent to which Ms Youkhana dealt with the proceeds of crime before it can be applied as a matter in aggravation of the sentence I must impose. 

23I am aware of the potential for improper use but I am also aware of the statement's significant probative value when it comes to my assessment of the overall gravity of the offending behaviour the subject of these sentence proceedings. The evidence is significant, it is probative, and the danger of unfair prejudice, with respect to Mr Boulten's submissions to the contrary, is unlikely. In the circumstances I propose to admit the statement of Mr Torelli.

2758056,R v Hawi & ors (No 31) [2011] NSWSC 1677,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: These are applications by counsel for the accused Hawi. The first application is for the discharge of the jury. Failing that, in the alternative, the second application is that the provisions of s 55F of the Jury Act 1977 be invoked, in short, to determine whether majority verdicts may be acceptable and, if so, to indicate to the jury that majority verdicts could be returned. 

2The first matter referred to in support of the application for the discharge of the jury was that there was a concern arising from a question asked by the jury last Wednesday, 19 October 2011. The question asked by the jury, in a note which is MFI 114, was as follows: 

""Can we please have clarification on the following: If we are unable to come to a unanimous verdict on murder, do we then address manslaughter or is this considered a compromise by the people who can meet the requirements for murder?"" 

3It was submitted that the note indicated that the jury had not adhered to instructions I had given to them during the course of my summing-up, and in particular to the instructions I gave them as to how their verdicts should be returned, including in the provision to them of a verdict sheet, a copy of which is MFI 103. 

4To deal with that first matter, I am not of the view that that question indicates that the jury had not adhered to any instruction I had given. It is unproductive to speculate about what gives rise to jury questions, but one view of that question simply is that the jury were seeking confirmation of an instruction that I had given. Such confirmation was given in response to it. Further, it is unknown, and not capable of being known, whether the question was asked on behalf of the entire jury, some of them, or just one of them. In other words, it would be inappropriate to draw an inference entirely from speculation that ""the jury were not adhering to judicial directions."" 

5The second matter raised was concerned with communications from the jury yesterday, 25 October 2011, the nub of which was that the jury had indicated that they had not determined verdicts that would completely and finally dispose of the case concerning any individual accused, and had indicated that they had in some cases reached unanimous decisions on lesser charges without having reached unanimous decisions on primary charges. It was submitted that such an approach was contrary to the instructions I had given in my summing-up and also in my response to the jury note of 19 October 2011. 

6In response to that submission, it is my view that there is nothing wrong with the jury considering how they might find in relation to any of the charges that are before them. The only requirement is that they return verdicts in only one order, that is, first for a primary charge before it may be possible to accept a verdict for an alternative charge if the verdict on the primary charge is not guilty. To use an example, in the charges that are presently before the jury in relation to six accused, there is a charge of murder for which there is an alternative of manslaughter, and for which there is a further alternative of riot. I see nothing wrong with the jury determining for themselves that they are unanimously of a view in relation to the charge of riot. That does not necessarily mean that they have done anything contrary to the instructions they have been given as to the order in which verdicts may be received from them. I refer to the directions I gave to the jury yesterday afternoon in which I reiterated the instructions in the latter respect that I had previously given. 

7Those two matters I have referred to are said to give rise to a concern about how the jury are going about the course of their deliberations. For the reasons I have given, I have no such concerns. 

8The final and possibly the more substantial matter raised is the length of time that the jury have been deliberating and reiterating that after such length of time the jury have not been able to determine a result in total in relation to any individual accused. 

9A fundamental problem with the application to discharge the jury is that I would not have power to discharge unless I was first to find, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a majority verdict: s 56 Jury Act . It would not be appropriate for me to make such an inquiry of a juror at this time because I have not, as yet, told the jury that a majority verdict may be returned. For that reason, the application is premature and cannot be granted. In any event, it does not, in my view, have merit. 

10Going to the application concerning majority verdicts, the provisions of s 55F(2) of the Jury Act apply: 

(2) A majority verdict may be returned by a jury in criminal proceedings if: 

(a) a unanimous verdict has not been reached after the jurors have deliberated for a period of time (being not less than 8 hours) that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings, and 

(b) the court is satisfied, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation. 

11Clearly, this is a case in which the period of time that the Court would consider ""reasonable"" is substantially more than eight hours. As of 3pm today, the jury have been deliberating for a total of 83 hours and 45 minutes. Today is the 16 th day of their deliberations. Some of those days have not been full days. 

12A feature of the trial that is relevant to the period of time that might be regarded as reasonable includes that the evidence is extensive, occupying in excess of 4,000 pages of transcript which the jury have a copy of, together with a large number of exhibits, including many exhibits comprising security camera footage. As the Crown Prosecutor rightly observed, during the course of closing addresses by most, if not all, counsel, and in the course of my summing-up, extensive reference was made to the evidence and particularly the security camera footage evidence. All of that would undoubtedly take a considerable period of time for a jury to review and discuss in the course of their deliberations. 

13Another relevant fact is that there are seven accused in this trial and there are 28 charges. On a rough calculation, the jury have been deliberating for an average of about 2 - 2.5 days for each accused. 

14I am not of the view that the length of time for which the jury have been deliberating is of concern at this point in time. 

15Yesterday, I gave the jury a direction in accordance with Black v The Queen [1993] HCA 71; (1993) 179 CLR 44 . That was yesterday afternoon, a little over 24 hours ago. Nothing has been heard from the jury since then. I think it is very much premature to unilaterally invoke the provisions of s 55F of the Jury Act at this point in time. In the immediate future I do not intend to do so, but would hope to receive some further communication from the jury if it is the case that they cannot reach unanimous verdicts. 

16As time goes by the position might change, but for these reasons both of the applications are refused.

		14 February 2012",2011-10-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758065,R v SAINI [2011] NSWDC 216,"SENTENCE 

1HIS HONOUR: Rajesh Kumar Saini has pleaded guilty to four very serious offences. They are all offences that he committed on 9 August, 2010. 

2The first offence is detaining the complainant, who I will not name, without meaning any disrespect to her of course, without her consent and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely to have sexual intercourse with her and at that time of detaining actual bodily harm was occasioned to her. That is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 

3The second offence is that he attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant knowing that she was not consenting. That relates to an attempt by the offender to penetrate the complainant's vagina with his penis. The maximum penalty for that offence is fourteen years. Had the offence been completed, a standard non-parole period would apply to it. 

4The third offence is an offence of having sexual intercourse with the complainant by penetrating her vagina with his finger without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting and at the time occasioning actual bodily harm to her. That carries a maximum penalty of twenty years with a standard non-parole period of ten years. 

5Attached to that offence are two offences on a Form 1. They are both indecent assaults, one relating to the offender placing the complainant's hands on his penis and the other relating to the offender placing his hands upon the complainant's breasts. 

6Finally, the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence of sexual intercourse without consent relating to an act of fellatio. That has a maximum penalty of fourteen years with a standard non-parole period of seven years. As is obvious I have taken into account both the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods where appropriate. I will not impose the standard non-parole period for the reasons which appear in these remarks on sentence. 

7The offender worked as a cleaner in the McDonald's store. The complainant worked at the same McDonalds store. After the store closed one day the two of them were left alone. The complainant was performing her function. She knew that the offender was there. She was approached by the offender who told her that there was a leak in the crew room. This was not true. This was part of a ruse that the offender used to get the complainant in a position where he could do what he later did. 

8The complainant was able to smell alcohol on the offender and he appeared unsteady on his feet. Once they got to the crew room and it was apparent that there was no leak, the offender grabbed the complainant around her waist with his hands. She said ""let me go"" and began to cry and attempted to struggle free. She also had with her a small knife that she had been using to open boxes. She threatened the offender with that knife and kicked him in the shins. Nonetheless, the offender continued to hold onto the complainant around the waist. 

9I will interrupt this narrative to refer to something that the offender has said by way of explanation as to why he committed the offences. He said that he misunderstood that the complainant liked him. Whatever misunderstanding there was, as soon as the complainant began to cry, struggle, threaten the offender with a knife and kick him in the shins, it must have been apparent to the offender, even intoxicated as he was, that the complainant had no wish to do what the offender then did. 

10What then happened, or at least part of what then happened, was captured on closed circuit television. At 8.28pm the footage shows the offender grabbing the complainant by the waist near the entrance of the crew room and pulling her towards the staff change room. He pulled her into the change room and positioned himself in front of the door blocking the way out. For the next two hours and twenty-three minutes the complainant was detained by the offender. 

11Once more the complainant began to cry and told the offender that she was scared. He told her he just wanted to talk. The offender let the complainant leave the change room when she said she needed to go to the toilet, but rather than allow her to go to the toilet in a dignified manner, he told her that she could use the drain in the wash room. She tried to run away but he grabbed hold of her once again. She still had the knife so the offender grabbed hold of it and tried to pull it out of her hand. He told her to let go of the knife and eventually she did so, the knife falling to the ground of the crew room. She tried to get away but she could not break free of his grip. He said ""I do not want to force you, you are forcing me, if you do as I say I will not force you"". The agreed facts then say that, despite that, the offender did force the complainant into a chair at the far end of the crew room. He knelt down in front of her and said that he was sorry and did not mean to scare her. He told her that he loved her and did not want to hurt her. She did not respond. 

12Even if what the offender said is true, what he then did is not any demonstration of affection at all. He said to her ""what are we going to do now. I cannot let you go, you will tell everyone"". He then told her to stand up, grabbed her around the neck and dragged her from the crew room to the change room. He let her go and told her to sit down next to him, which she did because she was scared. He then tried to kiss her on the lips, not surprisingly she drew away from him. Again he told her he loved her and that he would not hurt her if she did as she was told. He told her that if she did not struggle and let him do as he said, it would all be over in five to ten minutes. He said he would give her three chances and after that he would force her. 

13By now the complainant was curled up on the floor with the offender leaning over her. He said ""will you co-operate"" and she said ""no"". So what the offender did was to put his hand in the complainant's underpants touching her skin just above the vagina. He then took his hand out and said ""will you cooperate?"". 

14The complainant remained curled up on the floor crying. He forced open her legs and started to unbutton her trousers. He then pulled her trousers and underpants down. She continued to struggle to try to resist the offender removing her clothes. The offender then pulled his trousers down, knelt on the complainant and pinned her shoulders down with his body weight forcing her legs apart. He attempted to put his penis inside her vagina but he was unable to penetrate her vagina because his penis was not erect. At the same time the complainant was trying to push the offender off her. The offender said ""this is not going to work for us"" and took all his clothes off. He then pulled the complainant up off the floor and tried to kiss her once again. He kept trying to put his tongue inside her mouth. The complainant was still crying and tried to keep her mouth shut and as a result was having difficulty breathing. 

15The act of attempting to penetrate the complainant's vagina with his penis is count 2 on the indictment, the attempt at sexual intercourse without consent. 

16The next act that occurred is the first matter appearing on the Form 1. The offender stopped trying to kiss the complainant and she tried to get away. Unfortunately she could not open the door quickly enough. The offender told the complainant to sit down, pulled her towards him, grabbed her hand and made her touch his penis. She pulled her hand away. He then pushed the complainant back down on the floor on her back. He grabbed her hair because she was struggling. She was sobbing and begging the offender to let her go. All the offender did by way of response was to put his hand over her face, force her legs apart and put his finger into the complainant's vagina which hurt her, causing her pain and discomfort. He said ""why are you crying, other people enjoy this"". It was later observed when the complainant was taken to hospital that this act of digital penetration had injured the complainant's genitals amounting to actual bodily harm. A medical examination revealed abrasions, a laceration and blood. 

17The offender then took off the complainant's jacket and shirt. He tried to take her bra off too and in his attempts he hurt her so he asked the complainant to remove her bra. She did so, clearly as a result of the position that she was in. The offender then began to rub her breasts and suck her nipples. That matter is the second offence appearing on the Form 1. 

18He then put his finger back inside the complainant's vagina for some time. That is not a separate act of sexual intercourse without consent but is a continuation of the offence that I have referred to earlier. 

19Once more he tried to force her legs apart so that he could put his penis inside her vagina and once more he was unsuccessful because the complainant was struggling and he could not maintain an erection. Again that is not a separate act of sexual intercourse without consent but is a continuation of the attempt that I referred to earlier. 

20For a third time he penetrated the complainant's vagina with his fingers. At the same time as he pushed her head towards his groin. Again that is a continuation of the offence of digital penetration I referred to earlier. 

21The offender said ""suck my dick"". He pulled her up so that she was standing and began kissing her on the lips, then he pushed her back towards the ground and pulled her up so that she was kneeling in front of him. He was trying to put his penis in her mouth and she was trying to keep her mouth shut, but she had to breathe. When she opened her mouth to breathe the offender took the opportunity of forcing his penis inside her mouth. The complainant felt like vomiting but the offender continued to thrust his penis inside her mouth for some time. Eventually he withdrew and began to masturbate until he ejaculated. After he did so he put his penis back into the complainant's mouth as he had before. 

22The offender then pulled the complainant up from the ground so that she was standing and kissed her again during which time he bit her lip. He said, ""what are you going to do now"" and she said ""I am going home."" When the offender offered to help she said ""I am going home, it can wait until tomorrow."" Finally the offender let the complainant get dressed but he would not let her leave the change room until he got dressed. He handed her her keys and swipe card and she unlocked the change room and ran away. 

23The CCTV footage that I referred to earlier shows what time all this ended, at 10.51. The footage shows the complainant running from the staff change room towards the exit of the store. The offender simply walked out of the change room and started cleaning. 

24Although I have described a great deal of sexual activity, the statement of facts records that at sometime within that two hours and twenty-three minutes when the complainant was in the change room with the offender they sat there in complete silence. 

25The complainant ran out of the shopping centre and went to another McDonalds where she spoke to the assistant manager of that store telling her some of what had happened. The police were then called. They went to the McDonalds where the offender was working and arrested him. They observed a smell of alcohol and that his eyes were red and glazed. 

26The offender was interviewed by police. He told them lies. He denied speaking to the complainant on the night of the offence and said he simply started his cleaning duties. He said he had not gone into the locker room or staff room with her. 

27He said that before work he had been drinking with a friend at Auburn. He said that he had three to four small glasses of red wine, arrived about 2 o'clock and left about 6.30 or seven. He told police that when he left he was not intoxicated. He was able to get the train, or two trains actually, to work and started work at about 8 o'clock. 

28As a result of all the matters that I have just described the complainant suffered a number of injuries. She had a small scratch on her left chin. She had scratches to her upper back, across her left shoulder blade and across her right shoulder. She had scratches on the upper outer aspect of the right arm and below this several linear scratch abrasions. She had a scratch on the back of her left hand. She had a bruise on the outer aspect of the right breast. She had two linear scratches on her left lower back. She had a large extensive area of bruising on the inner aspect of the right mid thigh. This was described as being quite extensive and may have been caused by a blow or a firm grip. She had an oval shaped bruise on the left lower leg just below the knee and a large bruise on her right foot. 

29DNA analysis was later conducted. DNA matching that of the offender was discovered on the complainant's pants. Semen was discovered. One sperm cell was detected on the complainant's shirt. Other DNA analysis was conducted which tended to suggest the falsity of what the offender had told police. 

30The offender initially faced an indictment containing more charges than those now appearing on the present indictment. He pleaded not guilty to every one of those charges, even though four of the counts on that indictment are exactly the same as the four counts to which the offender has now pleaded guilty. Indeed he did not plead guilty until two days after his trial in this Court was due to start. In those circumstances it is agreed that I should impose a sentence upon the offender which is 12.5 per cent less than it would otherwise have been. I must also say that the belated pleas of guilty are quite inconsistent with the offenders suggestion as to when he began to feel guilt and remorse for what he had done. 

31The offender is now twenty-five years of age. He was born in India and grew up in a large household where a number of families lived together. His family are respectable people. His father ran a restaurant and his uncles, who also lived with him, owned businesses. 

32The offender has had a good upbringing. He can blame none of what he did on any aspect of his upbringing. He suggests that attitudes to things such as sexual matters are different in India to the way they are in Australia, but this scarcely explains violent sexual activity such as I have described. 

33The offender completed high school in India and went to university. His studies suffered a bit because he was focussing on sport but he was achieving a great deal whilst in India. He decided to come to Australia to study, to start afresh after he abandoned his sporting aspirations and so he arrived in Australia in 2008 to do a hospitality management course. He enjoyed the practical course work but found the theory difficult and he failed to complete assignments and eventually left the program in May, 2010. He then had a number of different occupations before finally starting at McDonalds as a parttime cleaner in October, 2009. 

34Whilst in Australia he met and married his wife, a woman who still supports him. So does his mother-in-law. Indeed both of them have written references which speak highly of the offender and their feelings towards him. Other references from friends were also tendered. It is to be noted that the offender has no criminal history and so this series of very serious offences is, the evidence would demonstrate, out of character for him. 

35I mentioned when reciting what the offender did that he was observed by the complainant and police to be smelling of alcohol and acting in an intoxicated manner. The offender blames his intoxication for these offences. There needs to be some explanation as to why the offender, with a good upbringing who is spoken of as highly as he is, who has no criminal history, would embark upon a series of quite serious offences involving the sustained detention of a woman who was crying and clearly fearful. The only explanation that can be offered is the offender's intoxication. He was not a heavy drinker by any means and so I will regard the circumstance that these offences appear to have been committed whilst the offender was intoxicated as a mitigating factor. However not too much can be made of it. An intoxicated person may lose his or her inhibitions more easily than a non-intoxicated person but the conduct that I have described of the offender is so extreme that it is really difficult to see how even a heavily intoxicated offender could act so out of character. 

36The offender has been in custody since he was arrested on 9 August, 2010. He receives visits from his wife, his mother-in-law and friends. So it is not the case that, even though the offender is serving a sentence in a country other than that that he was born in, he is isolated whilst in custody. 

37Because the offender has no prior criminal history and has people that speak highly of him, he does have good prospects of rehabilitation. Part of his rehabilitation and part of the finding that I can make that he is unlikely to reoffend in the future is based on the idea that the sentence that I must impose upon the offender will necessarily be lengthy. 

38It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of what an offender did. As I have repeatedly said, what the offender did was serious indeed. So in the future the offender will know that if he commits an offence of this kind he will go to gaol for a very long period of time. Also relevant to the prospect of the offender committing further offences is his promise that he will not drink alcohol in the future. 

39Counsel raised the question as to whether the sentences for these four offences would be concurrent. Ms David, who appears for the offender, suggested that wholly concurrent sentences should be imposed. I do not propose to do this. The offences all cover separate aspects of what the offender did. Even the actual bodily harm, the subject to count 1, is different to the actual bodily harm the subject of count 3. It would be quite wrong for any offender or potential offender to think that having committed one serious offence they could commit other serious offences without receiving extra punishment. Each offence that the offender committed no doubt added to the harm that the complainant suffered. There is no evidence that that harm went beyond what is to be expected in cases such as this, but there has been no challenge to the suggestion that I would take into account that the complainant was harmed by the offender's conduct. 

40It was put that the offender did not plan what he had done. There is some element of planning apparent on the evidence in that the offender used a ruse, a trick, to get the complainant into the crew room in the first place, but before that we simply do not know. There is no evidence that he planned the offence before that, there is no evidence that he did not. It is not an aggravating factor that I take into account, nor is the lack of planning a mitigating factor. 

41The complainant was detained for a relatively lengthy period of time. Certainly the offence is committed in circumstances where the detention extends over days and even weeks, but the offence is also committed where the period of detention is much shorter than that in the present case. As far as the period of detention is concerned, I will thus say, quite simply, it could have been worse and it could have been better. 

42Another matter that was specifically addressed was the nature of the intercourse. The offender did not actually penetrate the complainant's vagina with his penis, not through lack of trying of course, and the acts of intercourse that he achieved were digital penetration and fellatio. I have no hesitation in finding that in the circumstances of this case digital penetration of the complainant's vagina is less serious than other forms of intercourse that might have occurred. 

43The same conclusion is not as easily reached regarding the act of fellatio. There is no blanket rule that fellatio is necessarily less serious than penile vaginal intercourse. Certainly it does not carry with it the same risk of pregnancy but it remains an intensively personal act, carrying the risk of sexually transmitted disease amongst other things. I note that the offender did not actually ejaculate whilst his penis was inside the complainant's mouth, but, on the other hand, immediately after ejaculating he put his penis back in her mouth. It remains a very serious example of sexual intercourse without consent. 

44I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. When a calculation is made of the ratio, it will be seen that the variation from the statutory ratio is a fairly modest one. I have done the maths and I have noted that the variation is modest, but the effective non-parole period I am about to announce is the least which, in my view, properly reflects the criminality of the offender's conduct. The offender is sentenced as follows. 

45For count 1 on the indictment I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of three years, that is to date from 9 August, 2010. 

46For count 2 on the indictment I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to date from 9 August, 2011. 

47For count 3 on the indictment I impose a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of four years to date from 9 August, 2012. 

48Count 4 on the indictment, I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting the non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of four years to date from 9 August, 2013. 

49The overall sentence thus imposed is of a non-parole period of five years, a period of eligibility for parole of two years and a total overall term of seven years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 9 August, 2015.

The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 

3The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence at the Local Court. Following the application of a combined discount ""in the order of 30%"" for the plea of guilty and the provision of some assistance to the authorities, the applicant received a sentence of 14 years imprisonment, including a non-parole period of 9 years. 

4The facts upon which the judge sentenced the applicant were agreed between the parties. It is helpful to set them out in full, given the applicant's submissions in relation to the role that he played in the importation. They appear from the remarks in the following terms: 

In late December 2008, information was received by the JACG in relation to the impending importation of a commercial quantity of crystal methyl amphetamine (""ice"") into Australia. The JACG is the Joint Asian Crime Group, being a multi-agency task force of both Federal and New South Wales police and Crime Commissions. As a result of that information, police commenced covert monitoring of the activities of the offender ....., also known as Daniel, including the interception of a mobile telephone service subscribe to in the false name and details of Kuola Liu. The date of connection of the service was 24 June 2008. Enquiries into the details provided, together with the name for the service, indicated that all the details were false and that no such person existed. 
Monitoring of the service identified a number of calls between that service and a mobile service from the People's Republic of China. On 11 February 2009, a conversation was monitored between the offender and an unknown male on the PRC service. The offender and the unknown male discussed the price of an unspecified item. The offender stated ""220 for one pair, 220 for 700"". ""220"" is a reference to Australian dollars, $220,000 being the average price of the standard unit of the prohibited drug heroin. The reference to 700 refers to 700 g of the prohibited drug heroin, which is the standard unit of compressed heroin. During the conversation, the offender asked ""if the goods can be cut, can be mixed?"" He stated that he wanted it to be ""80% pure"". 
On 16 February 2009, a further conversation was monitored on the mobile service used by the offender between him and the unknown male on the People's Republic of China mobile service. The offender asked which address he gave him. The unknown male told the offender that ""it has already been posted out"". The offender stated that he knew that he had to give the address to another person and was not sure of it and said ""is it 1078?"" The unknown male said ""They are all gone this morning, the stuff has left Hong Kong"". 
On 17 February 2009 a further conversation was monitored between the offender and the unknown male. The unknown male referred to ""1078"" and told the accused that ""three sets of his old clothing has gone, weight is 5.7 or 5.8. There is tape which is marked."" There was further discussion concerning the price and the accused's share, which is agreed between the parties as having been $30,000-$40,000 of an expected A$120,000. Enquiries conducted by police established that the reference to ""1078"" was a reference to a post office box at Ultimo Post Office. 
On 19 February 2009, a further conversation was monitored between the offender and the male. The male informed the offender that ""according to parcel tracing, the parcel arrived today"". The offender said that ""he would do it tomorrow, the shop has already closed."" The call took place at 5:23 p.m. The reference to the shop is a reference to the post office. 
At about 11:45 a.m. on Friday 20 February 2009, the offender was observed walking in the Broadway shopping centre, Ultimo, and was seen to walk to the vicinity of the post office boxes. He entered the post office and was handed a cardboard box by an Australia Post employee. On leaving the post office the offender was stopped and spoken to by police. He was arrested and conveyed to the Australian Federal Police offices. 

5The examination of the cardboard box disclosed three blocks of compressed white powder (heroin) wrapped in black electrical tape. The gross weight of the blocks was 2.57 kg. The weight of the pure heroin was 1527.6 g. The applicant declined the services of a legal representative and made full and frank admissions to the Australian Federal Police. 

6The applicant volunteered to police a further importation to the same post office box within the next few days of a quantity of crystal methyl amphetamine concealed in a box of clothing. On 24 February 2009, police went to the Post Office and took possession of a parcel addressed to the same person at the same post office box as the parcel containing the heroin. Police located two heat sealed clip-lock plastic bags wrapped in aluminium foil containing a gross weight of 143 g of methyl amphetamine. The total weight of the drug was 108.6 g. This importation is the subject of part of the applicant's assistance to authorities. 

Ground 1 : Failure to Take into Account Demonstrated Contrition. 

7Section 16A(2)(f) of the Crimes Act (Cth) 1914 requires the court to take into account the degree to which an offender has shown contrition for the offence by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence or in any other manner in so far as it is relevant and known to the court. The basis of this ground is an alleged failure by the judge to ""pay any regard"" to the evidence of the applicant's contrition. 

8The source of the evidence relied upon by the applicant on this ground consists of the applicant's testimony, his assistance to the authorities and a letter written by the applicant that was tendered to the court (Ex 4). The applicant's evidence in chief in the course of the sentencing proceedings revisited the contents of Exhibit 4. The extent to which the applicant's assertions of contrition were supported by his co-operation with police, his disclosure of the details of his offending and the involvement of others (that is, in a manner other than by making reparation) was a matter for assessment by the judge, after taking into account other relevant evidence bearing on this issue. 

9Essentially, the applicant maintained that his decision to engage in the importation was driven by an inability to obtain funds for the purchase of a business, following the loss of his employment. The applicant said that he was depressed following the discovery that his girlfriend was pregnant and the realisation that he could not afford to support a child. His girlfriend terminated the pregnancy and the applicant commenced using illicit drugs out of a sense of hopelessness and despair. 

10The applicant said that he had expressed his remorse by telling the police the truth and co-operating in the interview. In the course of the interview, the applicant said that he called a close friend in China in order to suggest a ""joint venture"" whereby the applicant would take delivery of the drugs, pass them to a purchaser and remit a portion of the money back to his ""sponsors"". The applicant said that he had discussed the packaging, cutting and pricing of the drug with this person. The applicant was to receive $120,000 in cash, which would be split with two other people in Hong Kong. The applicant arranged for the post office box at Ultimo to be opened in a false name and used a falsely subscribed mobile phone service, which he acquired through an associate. 

11The contents of the intercepted telephone conversations confirmed what the applicant told police, namely that he insisted on some taping or marking of the box containing the drugs so that he could determine whether the box had been tampered with. The applicant appeared concerned that the importation was a setup and he was reluctant to meet with anyone in Sydney. The applicant was recorded telling the other person, in relation to the pricing of the drug by the supplier, ""we don't need to work with him after this is done, .... we shall have money to do it ourselves."" There was a further conversation in which the applicant was told that there was a big shipment of drugs coming into Australia in about April or May. The applicant asked the other person if he could ""help get me a few to play with"". The applicant acknowledged in cross-examination that he was indicating an interest in distributing the drug, once it was imported. 

12The applicant submitted that his letter ""clearly expressed contrition and remorse for his commission of the offences"" and that this evidence was not challenged by the Crown in cross-examination. A reading of the letter does not support an unqualified expression of remorse and contrition, rather the applicant is at pains to express to the judge ""the motivations behind the crime that I committed"". The letter recounts the applicant's personal history since leaving prison on the last occasion and his efforts towards obtaining employment, refraining from the use of illicit drugs and the financial pressures that led him to make the ""desperate"" decision to engage in the importation of drugs. 

13Relevantly, the letter states:- 

Then my friend from overseas contacted me saying that if I pick up some drugs for him, he would give me the money. I just agreed without thinking because I was so desperate to find a way out that I didn't consider any consequences. .......... All I wanted was my family to be healthy and happy. I did not want to commit a crime. I did not want to harm others and I did not want to go back to jail. 
After I was arrested I did so much damage to [my family] physically, emotionally and financially. ......... I feel guilty and ashamed and I feel that I cannot lift my head up in front of them. I am a terrible son and now I am paying heavily for the consequences of my stupidity, and I cannot live with myself. 

.............................................................................. 
At the police station, I made full admissions of the crime that I committed and told them who sent the drugs to Australia and I was willing to testify against that person. I was very cooperative and I was really remorseful and still genuinely am. I went to the Australian Federal police headquarters on three separate occasions to give more information for their future investigations and told them I wanted to help the police further in the future after my release date. I honestly am so remorseful and will do anything to help their investigations and I know for a fact that I will NEVER make the stupid MISTAKE EVER again. It is just not worth it, for the sake of my family and for the sake of all the people I am harming. 

14It is immediately apparent that the applicant's account of the offence in the letter stands at odds with his account to the police immediately following his arrest. The judge was entitled to take the view (as he did) that the applicant was attempting to retreat from his acknowledgement to the police of his responsibility for initiating and organising the importation. The fact that the Crown did not cross examine the applicant on the contents of the letter did not preclude the judge from forming his own view of its reliability. The extent of the applicant's assistance to the authorities is dealt with more fully in relation to ground 3. 

15The avowal by the applicant in Exhibit 4 of his remorse for what he describes as a ""stupid mistake"" must be considered in the light of the applicant's conviction in August 2002 for knowingly importing a commercial quantity of heroin (3.3kgs pure), committed on 24 December 2001 when the applicant was 18 years of age. The applicant was apprehended at Sydney airport carrying two suitcases, each of which concealed approximately 2 .5 kg of heroin. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months to date from 24 December 2001, expiring 23 September 2006, with a balance of term of 3 years and 9 months, expiring 23 June 2010. 

16The remarks of his Honour Judge Woods QC DCJ (Exhibit 5) indicate that an otherwise appropriate head sentence of 12 years was mitigated by the applicant's youth, his plea of guilty and the fact that the judge accepted that the applicant had been coerced into the importation by threats from persons to whom he owed money for drugs and gambling. However, the applicant declined to name his co-offenders. Relevantly, Judge Woods observed that the applicant was genuinely contrite and that he had ""become conscious of the large number of people who are [in gaol] for drug-related matters. This [had] apparently opened his eyes."" Further, the judge was in ""no doubt that he personally will be deterred."" 

17The commission of the instant offence within 18 months of the applicant's release to parole was in breach of an express condition that the applicant not unlawfully use, possess or sell any substance that is a drug or narcotic preparation and that the applicant not associate with anyone who unlawfully possesses, uses or sells a drug or narcotic preparation. 

18In these circumstances, the weight to be attached to the most recent expressions of contrition must be slight. The applicant's contrition, such as it is, appears to spring from his arrest and incarceration for the second time. It should also be remembered that the applicant's expressions of contrition are tempered by the strength of the Crown case against him on the importation of the heroin: R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309 ; 49 NSWLR 383 ; R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225. 

19It was in the above context that the judge found that ""the court is unable to find that the offender has been frank with the court as to how he became engaged in the imports or his motivation. This most significantly affects consideration of remorse and the prospect of rehabilitation."" Elsewhere in the remarks on sentence, the judge referred to the applicant's early plea of guilty, his cooperation with the police immediately following his arrest and his offer of assistance to the authorities, which the judge assessed as of low or limited value. 

20I am not persuaded that any error has been demonstrated. It is clear that the judge did have regard to the applicant's evidence, his cooperation and assistance on the question of his contrition. There is no merit in this ground. 

Ground 2 : Failure to Give Appropriate Consideration to the Voluntary Disclosure of a Further Importation. 

Ground 3 : Failure to Adequately Reflect the Plea of Guilty and Assistance to Authorities. 

21These two grounds may be conveniently dealt with together. 

22The applicant's complaint on ground 2 is that the judge ""made bare reference in his remarks on sentence to the fact that the applicant had disclosed his guilt of the offence of importing the methylamphetamine"" and he made no reference to the evidence of a Federal police officer on this aspect of the applicant's co-operation or to the principles in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. Further complaint is made that the judge did not expressly acknowledge or assess the significance of this factor on the applicant's sentence. It is further submitted that the judge made a finding which was not open to him, namely that it was likely that the importation of the methyl amphetamine would have been discovered, without the applicant's voluntary disclosure. It is said that this failure to give appropriate or adequate weight to these factors is borne out by the term of the sentence that was imposed. 

23In the course of his remarks, his Honour said :- 

In this matter, the offender was arrested in possession of a commercial quantity of heroin on collection from a post office box registered in a false name. He rapidly formed the opinion that his relevant communications had been intercepted. Indeed, the material before the court indicates that he believed he was under surveillance before attending to collect the heroin. ...... [Of] significance in that regard is that the offender made full and frank admissions at the outset, and disclosed his expectation of the subsequent arrival of the methyl amphetamine, albeit in circumstances that he would have anticipated the authorities were either already aware of it or would in due course discover it when it arrived for collection at the same post office box as the heroin. The offender disclosed the expected arrival of the methyl amphetamine. 

24The Federal police officer gave evidence that the applicant disclosed on the day of his arrest, after the record of interview, a pending importation of methyl amphetamine of which the police were unaware, to the same post office box at the Ultimo Post Office. The police were maintaining communication with the staff at the post office, so that if another parcel had arrived, ""there is a chance that we would have picked it up."" Thus, the applicant's complaint that the judge made a finding that was not open on the evidence must be rejected. 

25The fact that no specific reference was made to the evidence of the police officer, or to the principles discussed in Ellis , does not constitute error. The sentencing considerations were those set out in s 16A, including, relevantly, (2)(h), the degree to which the applicant co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence, and the plea of guilty as an expression of the applicant's willingness to facilitate the course of justice. The judge acknowledged the applicant's co-operation and his plea of guilty, the value of which was in some measure reduced by the realisation that he had been caught red-handed. In that regard, the judge referred to Tyler v R ; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247 and Danial v R [2008] NSWCCA 15. 

26In the circumstances of this case, there was considerable overlap between the applicant's co-operation with police in the investigation of the offence, his disclosure of the importation of the methylamphetamine and his plea of guilty. That is not to say that the applicant was not entitled to have all three factors taken into account, but the instinctive synthesis of these factors, among others, was a matter within the exercise of a broad sentencing discretion. 

27In Ellis , the then Chief Justice said (at 604) :- 

The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned . (italics not in original) 

28This passage was the subject of further comment by McHugh J in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267, when addressing an argument advanced by the appellant not unlike the argument advanced in this application (at [15] ; 272-273) :- 

The appellant's argument based on the trial judge's failure to indicate that he was giving the appellant ""a significant added element of leniency"" reflects a misunderstanding of the use that can properly be made of statements by judges in other cases. Judgments are not to be read as if they were Acts of Parliament. In Broome v Cassell & Co Ltd , Lord Reid pointed out that it is not the function of judges ""to frame definitions or to lay down hard and fast rules"". Their function is ""to enunciate principles and much that they say is intended to be illustrative or explanatory and not to be definitive"". The statement in Ellis that ""the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency"" is a statement of a general principle or perhaps more accurately of a factor to be taken into account. It is not the statement of a rule to be quantitatively, rigidly or mechanically applied. It is an indication that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the disclosure of what was an unknown offence is a significant and not an insubstantial matter to be considered on the credit side of the sentencing process. How significant depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. 

29Assuming that the judge had specifically referred to Ellis , I am not persuaded that any significant additional leniency to that already extended to the applicant by reason of his co-operation and plea of guilty was justified. There was a real likelihood that police would have been alerted to the arrival of another package at the post office box and there is no reason to think that the applicant's guilt of that importation would not have been circumstantially proved, without any admission on his part. 

30The applicant claims that the combined discount of 30% for the applicant's plea of guilty and his assistance was inadequate in all the circumstances. The applicant supports that claim by noting the 25% discount for the plea of guilty, which was referred to in the course of the sentencing proceedings, and not contradicted by the Crown. The applicant goes on to say that ""a total combined discount of 35% would have been more appropriate."" That was the submission made below. The Crown's submission below was that a combined discount of 30% properly reflected these two factors. It is apparent that the judge accepted the Crown's submission. 

31Leaving to one side the disclosure of the importation of methyl amphetamine, the applicant gave the police information concerning an additional importation by a different syndicate, but was unable to identify the syndicate members. Consequently, police were unable to identify the importation or the syndicate itself. In March 2009, the applicant provided further information concerning domestic and international based syndicates. This information assisted police in identifying another person of interest. However, police were unable to identify any criminal activity conducted by that person. At about the same time, the applicant provided information which allowed the police to identify an overseas male whom the applicant alleged was involved in the importation of heroin. The police have not been able to confirm that the identified person was so involved. 

32In August and December 2009, the applicant provided information to police regarding members of Sydney-based drug syndicates. Some of the information was consistent with information already known to the police. The information confirmed a police suspicion that a particular person was no longer able to participate in the drug trade, although police had already removed their surveillance of this person. In December 2009, the applicant gave police copies of documents he had been translating on behalf of another inmate, although nothing of substance was known about the inmate. Further information that the applicant gave concerning alleged corruption of public officials was investigated and was unable to be substantiated. 

33The combination of the information provided by the applicant was accordingly assessed as low in value. It has long been recognized that, notwithstanding the importance of encouraging offenders to assist the authorities by providing an appropriate reward regardless of the offenders' motive, the effectiveness of the assistance and its value remain integral to the allocation of a discount : R v Barrientos [1999] NSWCCA 1. 

34His Honour was correct to classify the assistance as ""intelligence"" of a hearsay nature. The applicant has not demonstrated that the combined discount fell outside the appropriate range, particularly when the high point of the applicant's submissions on this ground urges no more than a further 5% as ""more appropriate"". 

35Grounds 2 and 3 fail. 

Ground 4 : Manifest Excess 

36The applicant contends that the sentence imposed is ""plainly unjust or unreasonable"", particularly having regard to the applicant's role in the commission of the offence. The applicant submits that the judge erred in his assessment of the role played by the applicant in the commission of the offence and that the correct characterisation of the applicant's role was ""between that of a courier and a principal"". 

37The judge's remarks contained the following :- 

The material before the court, particularly the intercepted telephone calls and the record of interview, allows the court to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender : 
* initiated the importation of both the heroin and the methamphetamine with his overseas contact. 
* directed his overseas contact as to relevant considerations such as price, quantity, quality, expected proceeds, security arrangements to indicate if the importation had been detected on entry, arrangements for delivery in Australia after importation, and distribution of proceeds to be shared for conducting the importation. 
* established directly or indirectly a post office box in the false details of John Chow approximately 2 months before the importation. 
* personally collected the first of the two imported substances. 
* conducted all conversations with his overseas contact on the mobile service obtained or subscribed to in the false details referred to. 
In short, the offender was entirely responsible for determining, instituting and controlling the whole of the importation system. The offender's role in the importation was, in the circumstances, as the principal. 
He held himself out as being the ""can-do"" person to carry out the importation. While he had not purchased the border controlled drugs overseas, he undertook to import them for a substantial share, 20% of the wholesale price in Australia. 
The calls evidenced that he was encouraging his overseas contact to pursue future importations so that they would be able to operate entirely on their own behalf in the future by reinvesting the proceeds obtained by conducting importations. The subsequent importation of the methyl amphetamine demonstrates that the offender intended to undertake a continuing course of action, and that this was not intended to be a ""one-off"". 

38By way of taking issue with these findings, the applicant points to the fact that he did not know the identity of the person who would take delivery of the drugs in Australia, and the fact that there were a number of persons involved in the importation, apart from himself, including the supplier of the drugs, the applicant's friend who sourced the drugs, and an associate of that person. The applicant points to the 24 telephone and SMS transcripts over a three-week period in February 2009, only two of which involve conversations between the applicant and persons other than the applicant's friend. 

39Ultimately, the applicant submits that he falls within the third and fourth group of the cases collated in DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 205 A Crim R 1 at [212 - 215]. There, McClellan CJ at CL said :- 

213 In [the third] group the head sentences range from 8 years to 15 years, and non-parole periods start at 4 years and end at 11 years. A number of the sentences in this group involved pleas of guilty. The range of sentences represents a noticeable ""step down"" from the sentences in the previous group. A number of factors appear to explain this. First, the pure quantity of drugs imported is generally below 7 kg. (Two obvious exceptions are Chalmers and Np v R : the former was a successful Crown appeal and the latter involved a very favourable subjective case for the offender.) Secondly, the offenders in this third group occupy mid-range roles between that of principal and courier. (The exception is Speer , which may have been placed within the fourth group had the offender's plea been entered at an early stage.) Finally, in this group, there are instances of assistance, sometimes significant, provided to the authorities (e.g. Vasquez-Felipe; Np; Speer; W ). These efforts attract discounts of up to 30%. 
214 The cases which I have included in the fourth group are Soewandi v R [2002] WASCA 315; R v B [2004] WASCA 1; R v Labanon [2006] QCA 529; Tyler v R [2007] NSWCCA 247; (2007) 173 A Crim R 458; R v Lake [2007] QCA 209; (2007) 174 A Crim R 491; R v Geerlings [2007] QCA 209; (2007) 174 A Crim R 491 and Davidson v R [2009] NSWCCA 150. 
215 In this group the head sentences range from 6.25 years through to 8 years, while the non-parole periods range from around 3 to 4.5 years. The cases are roughly split between those in which the offenders pleaded guilty and those in which they pleaded not guilty. Quantities of drugs range from 1 kg to 30 kg and offenders occupy roles variously described as instigators, overseers, collectors and couriers. Many offenders in this group had good antecedents and no prior convictions. 


40More particularly, it is said that the applicant is akin to the offender in R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65; 205 A Crim R 429 Notwithstanding the fact that Holland undertook two trips to Australia, leased the subject premises, registered a business associated with the importation, liaised with customs and advised the supplier of the arrival of the drug, he was not found to be a principal. 

41Before passing to consider these submissions regarding Holland , it is worthwhile noting that the Chief Judge said in that case at [3] :- 

Much of the argument in the appeal focused upon the ""Categories of offence"" which I developed in the course of my reasons in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 243 FLR 28 . Some of my remarks may have been misunderstood. When preparing my reasons in De La Rosa it became increasingly apparent that there were many significant decisions with respect to the sentence for individual offenders which had never been gathered together and analysed. The number is such that to merely list them without further classification was likely to be of modest assistance to practitioners and judges required to sentence future offenders. As I said in my reasons in De La Rosa , so as to assist others to readily access the information I grouped the decisions by reference to common characteristics, so far as they could be identified. However it would be wrong to sentence an offender by seeking out the ""category"" into which they fit and imposing a sentence which is thought to be appropriate for an offence which happens to have the characteristics found in that category. 

42The applicant's reliance on Holland is misplaced. The offender in Holland was engaged in the establishment of a seemingly legitimate business which then became the recipient of a piece of machinery, within which a large quantity of cocaine was concealed. The offender did not initiate the importation and was unaware of the precise nature and quantity of the drug. The Crown's characterisation of the role of Holland was that of a middleman, with extensive involvement in assisting the importation of the drug. That is a far cry from the objective features of the applicant's role. 

43The specific findings set out at [37] above were well open to his Honour. The applicant does not contend otherwise. The applicant's ignorance of the ultimate purchaser in Australia, the involvement of others in the importation and the restricted nature of his communications are not inconsistent with the role attributed to him by the judge. 

44I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. As I have already noted, this was a serious offence committed whilst on parole for a like offence. Specific and general deterrence demanded a significant term of imprisonment. 

45The orders I propose are :- 

(1)Leave to appeal granted. 

(2)Appeal dismissed. 

46HARRISON J : I agree with Latham J.

		18 November 2011",2011-10-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758069,BAGHDADI v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 234,"Judgment 

1CAMPBELL JA : The Applicant pleaded not guilty to two charges in an indictment. The first charge was that on 9 April 2006 at Berala in the State of New South Wales when armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a firearm, he assaulted Tammy Manaton with intent to rob her. The second charge was that on 13 April 2006 at Enfield in the State of New South Wales, when armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a firearm, he robbed Joseph Mifsud of certain property, namely a sum of cash, a mobile phone, car keys and a wallet. On 24 November 2008 a jury found him guilty of both charges. 

2Well before his trial on these charges began, the Applicant had pleaded guilty, on 29 August 2007, to a different charge. It was of having engaged in carjacking on 9 April 2006. The vehicle that was taken that day was a silver 2004 model BMW coup e with registration plates 4FRODO. The particular carjacking offence with which the Applicant was charged was ""aggravated take and drive vehicle whilst armed"" . 

3The Crown wished to call evidence, at the trial of the two charges to which the Applicant had pleaded not guilty, of the fact that he had been involved in the taking of that car, and the circumstances in which he had done so. It wished to call that evidence as a means of linking the Applicant to other evidence showing that the silver BMW had been involved in each of the incidents concerning which the Applicant was charged. 

4The Applicant contested the admissibility of that evidence. The judge conducted a hearing on the voir dire , before the jury was empanelled, to decide its admissibility. He held it was admissible under s 98 Evidence Act 1995 as ""coincidence evidence"" , and also that it was admissible as circumstantial evidence. 

5On 20 November 2008, after the evidence in the case had concluded, counsel for the Applicant made two applications to the trial judge. One was for a verdict by direction, the other was for discharge of the jury. The judge dismissed both those applications. In the judgments given, the judge adhered to the view that, in light of the evidence that had actually been given at trial, it was open to the jury to consider the evidence concerning the carjacking in the case against the Applicant. The judge's directions to the jury included directions concerning the manner in which they would be entitled to use evidence of the carjacking. The judge directed the jury that they were entitled to use the evidence of the carjacking to establish that the Applicant committed the offences because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally. 

6The Applicant seeks to raise two grounds of appeal, namely: 

1. His Honour erred in admitting evidence of the ""carjacking offence"" to be used as coincidence evidence in relation to both counts in the indictment. 

2. That the verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 

Extension of Time 

7Though the Applicant was convicted on 24 November 2008, sentence was not passed until 21 August 2009. The Appellant filed a notice of intention to appeal against the convictions on 24 August 2009. He did not seek to appeal against the sentence. Section 10(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides: 

""The following provisions apply to an appeal, or application for leave to appeal, under this Act against a person's conviction or sentence: 

(a) the person is required to give the court, in accordance with the rules of court, notice of intention to appeal, or notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal, within 28 days after the conviction or sentence."" 

8That provision is read distributively, so that a person who wishes to appeal against conviction must give notice of intention to appeal or notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal, within 28 days after their conviction, and a person who wishes to appeal against sentence is required to give notice of intention to appeal or notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal within 28 days after the sentence. Street CJ (Begg and Ash JJ agreeing) construed s 10(1) in this distributive fashion in R v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990 at 991. Thus, even though the notice of intention to appeal was filed within the time that would have been appropriate for a notice of appeal against sentence, it was well outside the time for a notice of intention to appeal against conviction. 

9Section 10(1)(c) requires the appeal to be made in accordance with the rules of court. Clause 3A(1) Criminal Appeal Rules provides that a notice of intention to appeal has effect for six months after the day of filing. Thus, even if the notice of intention to appeal had been filed in time when it was filed on 24 August 2009, it would have expired on 24 February 2010. The Registrar made orders extending time under the notice to 28 May 2010, but time has not been further extended. 

10Clause 3A(2) Criminal Appeal Rules permits the court to extend the period for which such a notice has effect, either before or after the expiry of the period. 

11Clause 3B(1) Criminal Appeal Rules provides that a notice of appeal in respect of a conviction may be given (in the circumstance where a notice of intention to appeal has been given with respect to the conviction) only within the period during which that notice of intention has effect. 

12On 31 August 2010 the Appellant's legal representatives filed both a notice of appeal against the two convictions, and a notice of an application for extension of time for a notice of appeal. Unless orders are made, nunc pro tunc , extending the time for filing a notice of intention to appeal to 24 August 2009, and also ordering that the period for which the notice of intention to appeal has effect is extended to and including 31 August 2010, the appeal will be incompetent. 

13In R v Sunderland (1927) 28 SR 26 at 27 PW Street CJ (Gordon and Ferguson JJ concurring) said that ""an extension of time will not be granted as a matter of course but that the Court will in every case require substantial reasons to be advanced before granting such a concession."" That view has repeatedly been restated: eg R v Tyrrell (NSWCCA, 31 May 1974, unreported); R v Waterhouse (NSWCCA, 20 September 1979, unreported); R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 at [74], 148; McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174 at [5]; Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262 at [24]. 

14When this matter came on for hearing in this Court no affidavit or other evidence was available that explained the delay. The Court directed that evidence be filed concerning the delay. 

15In accordance with that direction, an affidavit of the Applicant's solicitor was filed. The solicitor had been assigned the matter by the Legal Aid Commission. The solicitor says that the delay in sentencing the Applicant (between 24 November 2008 and 24 August 2009) was due to the unavailability of trial counsel for the Crown and the Applicant. However, he makes no attempt to explain the delay in filing the notice of intention to appeal against conviction during that period. He explains several months of delay after 24 August 2009 as arising from difficulty in obtaining complete copies of the exhibits and transcript. In late January 2010 he briefed Senior Counsel to advise on the merits of the conviction appeal. When Senior Counsel warned the solicitor that the advice could take some time because of its complexity, the solicitor told him that, because of sentences in unrelated matters, the Applicant would be in custody for at least another five years, and thus was not waiting on the outcome of the appeal to determine whether he remained in custody. At least 13 days of preparation were involved in the preparing of the advice on prospects, which needed to be fitted in with counsel's other commitments. A completed advice on prospects, together with written submissions, was provided by counsel on 13 August 2010. The Legal Aid Commission gave approval to proceed with the conviction appeal on 30 August 2010. 

16The absence of explanation for the delay between 24 November 2008 and 24 August 2009 is a factor tending against the grant of the extension of time, but not the only relevant matter. 

17It is a reasonable inference (on the civil standard applicable to a matter such as extension of time) that Legal Aid was necessary for the bringing of the appeal. The Notice of Appeal was lodged promptly once a grant of Legal Aid was received. So far as the delay after 24 August 2009 is concerned, none of the delay can be laid at the door of the Applicant personally. While preparation of the advice on prospects took about seven months, the matter was fairly complicated, counsel was specifically instructed that the matter was not urgent, and the history the Applicant's solicitor gives shows that there was no lengthy period in which the matter was not being advanced in some way. 

18The prospects of success and significance of the consequences if an extension is denied are relevant matters to take into account. As will appear, I have decided that the appeal should be upheld. The sentence he received for the two counts has a non-parole period that expires in March 2017, so the consequences of not granting an extension of time would be quite severe, even bearing in mind that he is serving sentences for other offences. 

19In all these circumstances, the extensions of time should be granted. I will henceforth refer to the Applicant as the Appellant. 

The Statutory Standards 

20At the time of the trial, the Evidence Act contained the following provisions: 

98(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: 

(a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, or 

(b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 

(a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and 

(b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. 

(3) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party. 

... 

101(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 

(3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant. 

(4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant. 

21The Dictionary to the Evidence Act provided: 

"" Coincidence evidence means evidence of a kind referred to in section 98(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection."" 

22The name is inapt, because s 98 deals with evidence of lack of coincidence, but the statute requires that it be used. 

23With effect from 1 January 2009, s 98 has been amended quite significantly. However, it is the form of s 98 as at the time of the trial that is relevant for the present appeal. 

24No question arises concerning the giving or adequacy of the type of notice referred to in s 98(1)(a). Thus, s 98(3) does not arise either. 

The Evidentiary Basis of the Decision About Admissibility 

25When a decision about admissibility of evidence is made, the judge must necessarily make it by drawing factual conclusions and making evaluative judgments on the basis of such material as is before him or her at the time. As the function of this Court on appeal concerning questions of admissibility of evidence is to decide whether the decision of the judge in the court below was erroneous, in principle this Court should decide that question of admissibility on the basis of the same evidence as was before the judge at the time of making the decision appealed against. Thus, in the present case, we were provided with the exhibits that had been tendered on the voir dire. 

26As commonly happens when a judge makes a decision about admissibility of evidence on the voir dire, the evidence that the judge considered in the present case when deciding the admissibility of evidence about the carjacking offence included proofs of the evidence that the Crown expected witnesses would give. The procedure of making decisions on the voir dire by reference to proofs of evidence expected to be given involves a risk that the witnesses will not come up to their proofs in some significant fashion. It also involves a risk that evidence that it was expected would be adduced turns out not to be available. If either of those events happens, it well may be that the decision of the judge concerning admissibility of the evidence was correct, on the basis of the evidence that was tendered on the voir dire, but that the departure of a witness from the proof of evidence or unavailability of evidence it was expected would be given has the effect that, if the question of admissibility were approached again in light of the evidence as it was ultimately placed before the jury, a different result would be arrived at. In that situation, any appeal would need to be based, not on the incorrectness of the decision to admit the evidence, but on a miscarriage of justice having arisen from the jury having had before them evidence that, as the facts ultimately unfolded, they should not have had. 

27In the present case, it has not been submitted that any of the witnesses made a significant departure from their proof of evidence. Nor has it been submitted that evidence that it was expected, at the time of the voir dire, would be called was not actually called. As the argument on the appeal was presented, the second ground of appeal extended to the judge leaving to the jury the evidence concerning the carjacking. Thus, in the circumstances of the present appeal, it is appropriate to consider the matter by reference to the evidence that was actually given before the jury. 

Circumstances of the Carjacking 

28Ms Alison Saleh gave evidence that she took her husband's 2004 model M3 BMW coup e with licence plates ""4FRODO"" to the Original Car Wash on the intersection of Hume Highway and Cosgrove Road, South Strathfield at about 4:10 pm on Sunday 9 April 2006. When the washing and waxing processes were complete, at a time she estimates (she does not wear a watch) as being about a quarter to five, the car was brought to the part of the carwash premises where she was waiting. When the carwash attendant had driven the vehicle to her, and she was standing by its open door with the attendant still in the driver's seat, a man approached, brought out a gun, and told her in terms of unmistakable clarity to go away. A taller man who ""had a hoodie, a jacket with a hood over his head"" was standing on the other side of the car, and got into the passenger seat. In due course the man with the gun got into driver's seat and drove the car away. Ms Saleh described the gun as being: 

""... a black pistol, I don't know the exact make or model because I'm not familiar with guns, but it had a lot of divots, a lot of little holes on the handle, I noticed it was quite a thick weapon as well, and I just remember thinking that looks a lot like a police weapon."" 

29She described the man holding the gun as: 

""He had a hood, he had a hooded top on, he had a clean shaven face, it was quite slender, he had a darker complexion, a Mediterranean appearance, I would say Middle Eastern appearance ... 

He was medium build, he certainly was not overweight, he was quite slender, but he wasn't skinny, he was just a normal build. He wasn't especially tall, I just think an average height maybe 175."" 

30Some CCTV footage, taken at the carwash at the time, was played to the jury, and some still images taken from that CCTV footage were tendered. The times recorded on those images were all between 18:15 and 18:16. Ms Saleh identified the man who had got into the passenger side door in those still images. Notwithstanding her oral evidence, the man she identified was not wearing a hoodie. Rather, he was wearing a light coloured baseball cap, sunglasses, long trousers and what appears to be either a white garment whose sleeves reached to his wrist with a blue T-shirt worn over it, or a long sleeved garment that was dark blue in its body and in its sleeves to just above the elbow, and white for the rest of its sleeves. The Crown prosecutor suggested to the jury in address, without any objection from counsel for the defence, that they might well think that the trousers shown in the pictures as being worn by the man who got into the passenger's side door were ""cargo style pants"" that were green (tp 523). The man who had the gun did not appear in that footage as the CCTV camera was located behind and several meters away from the passenger's side of the car, and the edge of the CCTV image did not include the whole of the driver's side of the car. It would have been well open to the jury to decide that the man depicted as getting into the passenger side was the man they could see in the dock. Indeed the trial seems to have been conducted on the basis that there was no issue about that. 

31Mr Mohammed Jafari gave evidence that he worked at the Original Car Wash in South Strathfield on 9 April 2006. He drove the silver BMW to the customer when it was ready to be taken, and was confronted by a man who pulled out a gun and threatened him. Mr Jafari ran away and hid. He did not describe the man, or the gun. He said nothing specific about a second man being involved. Though his evidence at first was that the theft occurred about 3 pm, he later accepted that he had told police on the day of the incident that it happened at 5:15 pm, and that what he told police then was more likely to be right. 

The Robbery at Berala 

32Though the men involved in this incident did not succeed in stealing any property, it is convenient to refer to it as the Berala robbery. 

33Ms Tammy Manaton was working as duty manager at the Food For Less store on Woodburn Road at Berala on 9 April 2006. At around 8:00 pm she made an announcement from the office area in the rear of the store that the store was closing soon. Such an announcement was normally made five minutes before the door was to be closed. She then walked around to the front area where the checkouts were located and as she did so, she could hear some male voices asking for Tammy. She walked around to the service desk and said that she was Tammy. One man then grabbed her, showed her a gun, and told her to take him to the office area. She could see another two men. All three men had balaclavas on their heads. She said that the gun that she saw ""looked like a gun that a police officer would carry on them."" The man with the gun ""told me to go to the office and to do it quickly"" . She saw one of the men with another employee at the store, Susan Bardouh, walking down a different aisle. She heard one of the men tell the man with the gun that ""they had to get out of there"" . The man with the gun fired it ""right next to me"" and then disappeared from her eyesight. She ran to the office, locked the door, and dialled 000. The office contained ""our main safe where we keep all the money for the registers"" . 

34She could not remember anything about the man with the gun except ""he sounded Middle Eastern"" , and a language he used ""sounded like Arabic"" (though Ms Manaton is not an Arabic speaker). As well, she said that ""the two guys that took Susan in the beginning were speaking in Arabic to her"" . In cross-examination she qualified that to being ""some sort of Mediterranean language"" , said that her friends spoke Mediterranean languages even though she did not, and rejected the possibility that it could have been an Asian dialect. 

35Ms Manaton was unable to describe the clothing of the men. However some CCTV footage of the incident showed the rear of the three offenders. One of them had a hooded top with the word ""NIKE"" in large letters on the back; the other had a hooded top with ""GS"" in large letters on the back, while the third had a hooded top with no such distinctive lettering. Ms Manaton identified herself in some of the CCTV images that also showed a rear view of the assailants. The man in the Nike jumper appears to be considerably taller than Ms Manaton. Deciding the significance of that would need to take into account that Ms Manaton is unusually short, having a height of 4' 7"", that the image was taken somewhat from above, and the man in the Nike jumper was closer to the camera than she was. 

36Ms Manaton was unable to estimate how long she had been in the office, but ""maybe a minute or two"" after she came out from the office she went to the front of the shop, and saw an old yellow sedan, of square shape, that might have been a Nissan. It had some men in it who looked like they were ""Middle Eastern-type appearance"" . In chief she said that the Nissan was sitting out in front of the shop, in line with the front door, and that at the same time the police were outside and ""up the road"" . She said in chief that she did not see the Nissan arrive. The yellow car ""sped off"" when Ms Manaton saw it, towards the roundabout of Elizabeth Street. 

37In further cross-examination she accepted that it was when she and others were standing outside the store after the robbery that the yellow sedan pulled up on Woodburn Road just outside the front of the store. 

38It eventuated that the would-be robbers had left the store through the emergency fire exit door at its rear. The Berala railway station is on the other side of the street that runs at the rear of the Food For Less store. CCTV footage from the railway station showed three men crossing the tracks from the direction of the Food For Less store, crossing the railway platform, then crossing the tracks on the other side of the platform and heading in the direction of an adjacent street. 

39Mr Tu Phuong Du gave evidence that on the evening of 9 April 2006 he and his wife drove to the Food For Less supermarket in Woodburn Street Berala with their children, and parked their car in front of the supermarket at around 7:45 pm. About 10 minutes later, when he returned to his car, he saw that a silver BMW, with a driver in it, and its left blinker on, was double-parked, parallel to the car behind his car. When he turned to talk to his wife in the passenger seat he saw ""about three"" people ""wearing kind of jumpers with hoods on"" rushing into the supermarket. When he saw ""one person holding onto the security female person and the other two just going into the supermarket"" he drove away, and his wife talked to the operator on 000. While the vehicle was double-parked behind him, he saw its number plate, which began with ""4F"" . He had seen the rest of the number plate, but could not remember it. He ""saw just a driver, someone driving or someone in the driver's seat."" He had no recollection of what that person looked like, because ""it was pretty dark"" . He noticed that the BMW was fairly new. 

40Though Mr Du accepted that it was night time, and that the BMW had its headlights on, he denied that he could not see clearly the ""4F"" of the numberplate. He said he saw the numberplate in his side mirror, as he was preparing to leave his parking spot. The BMW had its left side blinker on as he was getting out of the car spot, as would happen if a driver was indicating an intention to park in the place that Mr Du had previously occupied. He could not remember anything about seeing a yellow Nissan. 

41In earlier legal proceedings (in fact a trial of other men accused of conducting the robbery, though the jury was not informed that that was the nature of the proceedings) Mr Du had said he had seen the numberplate ""when you were driving away and looking in your side mirror"" . When that evidence was put to him, he adhered to the evidence he had given at the trial of the Appellant. (In any event, the question that was put to him in the previous trial was not inconsistent with his evidence in the Appellant's trial, because ""when you were driving away"" could as a matter of ordinary language encompass events immediately preparatory to actually moving in the vehicle.) 

42Susan Bardouh gave evidence that she was working at the Food For Less supermarket at Berala on 9 April 2006 as a checkout operator. At a time she estimates as being about 8:05 pm, when the doors were closing and they were serving the last customer, three men pushed the door open and pushed the security guard against the wall. She said: 

""Then they came into the store and they went to Jamie and they asked if she was Tammy and they yelled 'Take me to the cash office, where's the money'."" 

43One of the men pointed a gun at Jamie, whereupon Ms Bardouh said ""That's not Tammy"" . She said they were speaking in Arabic. In cross-examination she clarified that, saying she heard two of the men speaking in Arabic, but did not hear the third speaking in Arabic. She is of Lebanese background and is fluent in Arabic. She was not able to discern anything about the accent of the men in the shop apart from their use of Arabic words. 

44Ms Bardouh said that the three men were wearing balaclavas. She described the men as being ""a head taller than me, maybe more"" and of medium build. She was 160 cm tall. A man with a white hooded jumper was wearing khaki cargo pants. Two of them stayed with her while one was ""at the front area"" . One of the men who stayed with her told her to take them to the cash office. She heard a gunshot. Part of the contents of a tin of instant coffee spilled on the floor, and were identified by Ms Bardouh by the DVD footage. 

45Then the men went out through the fire exit door. She opened the door, and saw that they either jumped the fence or walked through the fence on the other side of the road, crossed the railway line, and jumped onto the railway platform. It was at that stage that she called out to Tammy. 

46About 10 to 15 minutes after she first saw Tammy, she saw an old yellow car, that she described as ""a four door hatchback with faded yellow paint"" travelling in Woodburn Road. At the time the yellow car went by, ""everybody was outside and the police cars were there and the police were outside. "" She saw four people in the car, who ""were staring"" . On seeing the men in the yellow car, she said to Tammy 'I think that's them"" . She said ""I only recognised the white hooded jumper"" . Her evidence continued: 

""Q. Now when you saw recognised the white hooded jumper, what are you referring to? 
A. The white hooded jumper that was in the store. 

Q. Did you see during the robbery a man with a white hooded jumper? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you see any markings, particular markings on the white hooded jumper? 
A. I saw black markings but I couldn't make out what they were. 

Q. The person that you saw in this car, did you see a white hooded jumper with the driver or somebody else in the car? 
A. It was the passenger, back seat passenger. 

Q. Were you able to make out any markings on that person's jumper? 
A. No. 

Q. How are you able to say it's the same jumper? 
A. I can't say it's the same jumper."" 

She did not notice anything else about the people in the car. 

47Her description of the gun that she saw was: 

""A. It looked like a police gun, one that flings back so you can shoot it. 

Q. It slings back? 
A. Like the top part pushes back."" 

48Ms Katie Randall was working as a supervisor at the Food For Less supermarket. She gave evidence that one of the men involved in the robbery wore a dark coloured balaclava and a khaki coloured jumper. She described the gun from which the bullet was fired as ""a black gun that looked as if it was made of plastic, it was matt black."" She said that the gun was in the hand of one of the men, was pointed at Tammy's back, and the man then put down his arm to the right to shoot the gun. She described hearing a ""Middle Eastern or Lebanese accent"" . Ms Randall said that she was about 164 cm tall, and the three men were ""around about 185 cm tall, taller than me, and they were quite slim"" , and ""they were all very similar"" . 

49Part of the police statement that Ms Randall gave on the same day as the robbery was cross-examined into evidence. In it, she described the man with the gun as 185 cm tall and slim built, that he was wearing a khaki jumper and black balaclava, one of the other men as being 185 cm tall, slim built, wearing a black balaclava and white long sleeved jumper, and the other man as being 185 cm tall, slim built, wearing a black balaclava, denim jeans and long-sleeved top. 

50Zeljka Varinic was working at the Berala store as a liquor assistant on the evening. She noticed a car pulling up, and three people run out of the car. The vehicle appeared to be double-parked. She was unable to determine the make of the car. When asked about its colour, she said ""it was dark so it just seemed darkish to me"". (tp 150) When asked whether she was able to describe the men she said, ""No, they were just wearing hooded jumpers with balaclavas"" (tp 151). She was unable to say anything about their height or build. The Crown conceded that in previous proceedings her evidence was ""I could see a car and it was on the road, it wasn't parked, and then I saw three guys running towards the shop and the car drove off"" . At the trial of the Appellant she could not remember whether she had given that evidence. 

51Ms Minaxiben Patel was employed as a security and loss prevention officer at the Berala store. She said that after she had closed the store that evening two men came to the main door of the store and told her to open it. Then the man opened the door, and pushed her to the wall and grabbed her. She gave evidence of seeing a gun, and that it was ""like a police, like a black colour police, they have"" (tp 163). While the men were in the shop, 

""I saw the police car and I said 'Oh there's a police car' so I run through and open the door and I saw - I tell the police there was three men inside and police said to me, 'Come out, come out'."" 

52The police officer she spoke to was not in a car. Beyond recalling one of the men as ""skinny"" , and wearing a ""white shirt"" she could not describe the men. In cross-examination she accepted that, in a statement she had made to the police on the same day as the attempted robbery she had described them as all being of similar height and skinny. In that statement, she had said that she saw the face of one of the men briefly, before he pulled a woollen mask down over his face, and that he looked Asian, but not Chinese or Philippino, and that he had long brown hair down to his collar. In re-examination, her evidence was that that person looked ""like Lebanese"" . 

53Ms Nhu Nguyen was a service supervisor at the shop. Her description of the entrance of the men into the shop was that she saw Ms Patel ""wrestling with the door because some people were trying to pull it open"" (tp 176). She described the gun that she saw as: 

""It was black, the butt was a bit square, it was similar to police pistol that the police lady showed me at - when I was giving my statement."" 

54Ms Nguyen pressed a portable hold-up alarm that she had which was silent. Very soon after, on her account, one of the men went to the front door and yelled out that the police were there. It was after that that she heard a gunshot towards the back of the store. She saw the police at the door ""yelling at us to get out of there so we ran out"" . Tammy was the last of the staff members to come out, ""it might have felt like 10 minutes"" after Ms Nguyen came out. Ms Nguyen described the men as: 

""... about 180 centimetres tall, they were slim, they were all wearing black balaclavas, they had a grey - one person had a grey shirt on with black sleeves underneath and the person standing next to Mina had darkish pants on."" 

55Constable Kim Burgess gave evidence that on 9 April 2006 she was on duty with a Constable Beavin, driving a police car in Woodburn Road, Berala about 7:55 pm. She saw someone standing on the footpath pointing what looked like a gun. The police parked, and stopped their car outside the front of the Food For Less store. They heard a gunshot. 

56Later that evening, about 10:45 pm she saw a Detective Senior Constable Laing arrive, after which she saw Detective Senior Constable Laing placing a grey and maroon hooded jumper into an exhibit bag, as well as two black balaclavas. Those items had been located at the rear of the store. 

57Detective Senior Constable Amanda Laing conducts forensic examination of crime scenes. She gave evidence of finding a coffee tin with two holes in it consistent with being made by a projectile. She was unable to identify the type of gun that had been used, from the projectile evidence. 

58At the rear of the Food For Less premises was a solid fence, with several strands of barbed wire strung between poles projecting from the top of it. The barbed wire between two of those poles was broken. Senior Constable Laing went through a door at the rear of the shop. In the immediate vicinity of that break in the barbed wire she found a grey coloured Nike brand front zip hooded jacket hanging from the barbed wire, and two woollen balaclavas nearby. 

59All of the eyewitnesses to the first attempted robbery were shown photographs including one of the Appellant, but none of them identified him as one of the assailants. 

The Robbery at the Fresh Fruit Palace 

60Mr Joseph Mifsud was one of the owners of a business that traded as the Fresh Fruit Palace at XX Mitchell Street, Enfield. A driveway leaves Mitchell Road, goes past a shop called Flower Power, and then to the Fresh Fruit Palace at the rear of the same complex in which Flower Power is located. A CCTV recording obtained from the Flower Power computer showed, at times recorded on the images as 17:54:17 and 17:55:55 on 13 April 2006, a motor vehicle bearing number plates AUK 75Z in the vicinity of the Fresh Fruit Palace. 

61A statement of Mr Charlie Radd was read. He gave evidence that he owned a car with registration number AUK 75Z. At about 9:25 am on Monday, 10 April 2006 he drove his car to his workplace, and parked in a carpark. The front and back registration plates of his car disappeared between that time and about 1:35 pm on the same day, when he returned to his vehicle. He reported the disappearance to the police. 

62The premises of the Fresh Fruit Palace contained some stairs leading to an upper floor on which there was an office that contained a safe. On 13 April 2006 around closing time, 6:00 pm, Mr Mifsud said he had collected money from the cash registers of the shop, and taken it upstairs to count. Around 6:10 pm he was in the office with girls called Simone and Lily, and perhaps another girl. A few minutes after 6:10 pm he saw ""two blokes grab one of my staff members and brought him upstairs"" . That staff member was called Luciano. Very soon before he saw Luciano being grabbed, he heard a gunshot. After he saw Luciano being grabbed: 

""I heard Luciano screaming 'Open the door Joe', at that time I heard another shot which was at the office door, as I was walking to it to open it, which I got hit, then the two men came inside, I gave them the bag of money."" 

63After Mr Mifsud had given them the money, the men told him to open the safe, and he did so. The men said, ""give us your wallet, mobile phone"" , and he complied. He was able to see the gun one of the had because it was laying on a table. He described it as ""one of those pistol-type guns that police use"" . He heard another shot. Mr Mifsud said that the amount of money the men took was about $40,000. After the men went out of the office he rang 000 and the police came soon afterwards. 

64He described the men as wearing hooded jackets, and gave the following evidence about their height and build: 

""A. One was quite, a bit taller than the other and thin build. 

Q. How tall are you sir? 
A. About five foot nine. 

Q. Are you able to say by reference to your height, how tall the two people were? 
A. I'd say one was a bit taller, I'd say two inches taller. 

Q. Than you? 
A. Than me, and one was maybe a little bit shorter. 

Q. A little bit shorter than you? 
A. I'd say so. 

Q. Do you remember anything about the build of the second gentleman, you said one was a thinner build? 
A. The taller guy was a thinner build, and the other guy was a little bit stocky, but not fat."" 

65He described their complexion as being ""a little bit dark skinned"" and concluded that they were of Middle Eastern ethnic background. The men were not wearing balaclavas, and he noticed that they ""had like a few days growth on their face, unshaven"" . He heard them speaking and said that their use of English was good, and he did not detect any accents, that it seemed to be an Australian accent. 

66Mr Mifsud later noticed that he was bleeding on his thigh and recalled that he had felt a sting when he had heard one of the gunshots. His wound was only superficial. 

67In cross-examination Mr Mifsud confirmed that one of the men was three inches at the most taller than he was, and the other seemed a little shorter than he was. 

68Ms Sonya Garofano was working as a cashier at the Fresh Fruit Palace on 13 April 2006. At maybe 6:05 pm she heard more than one shot; she thought it was about three shots. Another employee told her to look up, and through the window of Mr Mifsud's office: 

""I saw Joe standing and a guy tall and skinny standing next to him and wielding a gun, a small gun in his hand and he had like a tracksuit but it was a darker colour and he had the hood on his head."" 

69About five minutes or less later she saw a man in a white tracksuit with no hood, who was tall and slim, emerge from upstairs. This was a different man to the one that she had seen with Mr Mifsud. This man fired a gun in the air. 

70Mr Joao Goncalvs was working at the Fresh Fruit Palace on 13 April 2006. He could see two men standing on the stairs, and Luciano sitting on the stairs. One of the men was about 170 cm tall, and skinny. One of the men had a gun. 

71Mr Massimiliano Tusino was working at the shop that day. His attention was drawn by ""a braking noise, like a car stopping"" coming from outside the store. 

72Another employee, Simone, then went to the office. It was at that stage that two men came into the shop. He said he had also seen a third man ""he was there standing near the door, so he was always there"" . Of the two men who went to the back of the shop ""one was a bit taller than the other one"" . He saw all three men leave the shop, but did not see where they went. He described the man standing at the door as probably about the same height as himself, which was about 174 cm, and that all three were ""sort of slim build, not very big"" . In Imperial measurement 174 cm is 5' 81/2"". 

73Mr Luciano Santoro gave evidence that when he saw two men coming into the shop about 6:10 pm and approached them, one of them grabbed him and said ""lets go upstairs"" . The man held a gun to Mr Santoro's head and ""asked me to call Joe to open the door"" . The man fired about three shots at the door, and Mr Mifsud then opened it. He thought the gun looked like a Berretta. He described one of the men as being ""little bit taller than me"" . Mr Santoro was 5'7"". The first man looked Lebanese and had ""a bit rough accent, good English but a bit, bit hard accent"" . 

74On 11 April 2006 a police officer showed a collection of 12 photographs of men to Mr Mifsud, a Ms Galea who had been in the store that night, and Mr Santoro. That collection included a photograph of the Appellant. Neither Mr Mifsud nor Ms Galea were able to identify any of the people photographed as being present at the store on the night of the robbery. Mr Santoro identified someone other than the Appellant. 

75The office door had on it a security number pad key lock, that Detective Senior Constable Nicholas Sedgwick observed, when he visited the premises later that evening, to have been extensively damaged. 

76A police ballistics expert identified five cartridge cases that had been recovered from the Fresh Fruit Palace as having been fired from a Glock. She said that, while there was a variety of different types of Glock, they were similar in appearance. New South Wales police had been using Glock pistols for 9 or 10 years. 

Police Pick Up the Appellant 

77There was evidence from police officers, that was not cross-examined on, that on 14 April 2006 two police officers pulled over a white BMW in which the Appellant was a passenger. The Appellant was searched, and was found to have on him $1,040 in cash, a key with a BMW logo on it, and a pair of sunglasses. 

78Mr Graham Thornton, a service advisor with a BMW dealership, gave evidence that, on being presented with a BMW key by a police officer, he was able to use a key reader to identify the vehicle from which the key came by its identification number, and that it was a silver BMW M3 coup e , 2004 model. 

79He was shown photographs taken from the Flower Power CCTV recording and dated 13 April 2006 at 17:54 and 17:55 (in each case, plus some seconds) that depicted the motor vehicle with licence plates AUK 75 Z. On those photographs he identified a front bumper bar and headlight arrangement that was distinctive of the M3 BMW, some rear wheel arches that were distinctive of the M3 model, and an arrangement of LED tail lights that was indicative of a BMW produced between 2003 and 2006. 

The Silver BMW After the Robbery 

80Ms Jody Wilmen gave evidence that she lived in a block of units at a particular address in Liverpool Road at Enfield. The Byer Street carpark is located next door to that block of units. Access to an underground carpark of the block of units requires one to drive through the Byer Street carpark. On a date that she put as being 11 April 2006 she went to the Byer Street carpark and saw a silver BMW that was parked in the loading zone. 

81She described the Byer Street carpark as ""the council carpark"" . Her evidence was: 

""A. ...We had to drive around the car park to get into the underground car park itself and we drove past the BMW and that's when I saw it. 

Q. Was anybody at the vehicle when you saw it? 
A. Yes there was. 

Q. How many people? 
A. Right next to the BMW itself I saw one person but there was also another vehicle behind it that had another person standing there as well. 

Q. And the other vehicle do you know what sort of vehicle that was? 
A. It was a black BMW. 

Q. Do you recognise any of these people that you saw? 
A. The person with the silver BMW yes I - I don't know his name but I do recall him being around the units quite a lot but never with that car. 

Q. At the time that you saw the vehicle was it open, closed, how would you describe it? 
A. As we came around the car park the car was actually facing forwards so we came around the rear end of it. The gentleman that was with the car he had the car door open and was actually leaning into the car to get something out of it, but he had been talking to people in the units just above where the car was. 

Q. Now apart from seeing this car, the BMW-- 
A. Mm hmm. 

Q. --did you see them on any other occasion in that week? 
A. Yes, we came home from the show one night and we went and parked our car downstairs, about the third level down, and as we were walking towards the lift a BMW was right next to the lift and I looked at the registration number and it just was the same one as we saw upstairs with the guy. 

Q. Which one, the black one or the silver? 
A. The silver one I'm sorry. 

Q. On this second occasion did you see anybody near it? 
A. No."" 

82She said that the second occasion on which she saw the silver BMW would have been about four days after the first time she saw it. She had heard that a silver BMW had been used in a robbery, so she rang the police. When a police officer arrived, she pointed out the vehicle to him. 

83The tender of some sketch plans that Ms Wilmen had drawn made clear that on the second occasion that she saw the BMW it was parked in the carpark that was underneath the flats. She said that the man she saw with the car, on the first occasion that she saw it, was about 5'10"" tall. She also said that the carpark of the units 

""... is a security car park where you should have a remote to get in, however people often let the door up so at times anybody could drive down there."" 

84Constable David Imrie gave evidence that soon after 10:35 am on 15 April 2006 he was shown a silver BMW coup e with number plates AUK 75Z in the basement carpark at the address in Liverpool Road, Enfield where Ms Wilmen lived. He found it was locked, and arranged for the vehicle to be taken to the Gladesville towing holding yard. 

85In the afternoon of 20 April 2006 Constable Sedgwick went to ""the Gladesville towing yard"" , where he saw a silver two door BMW with number plates AUK 75Z. The registration label of the vehicle showed that its registration number was 4FRODO. There was no evidence of damage to the ignition of the car, or on the internal side of the driver's door, and no evidence of damage to the door or door locks on the passenger side door. 

86Police found that the key that had been in the Appellant's possession when he was picked up could remotely unlock that motor vehicle, could open its boot, and could start the vehicle. 

Other Evidence 

87A police officer agreed that the money stolen from the Fresh Fruit Palace would possibly have on it fingerprints and DNA from the employees at Fresh Fruit who had handled it. He also agreed that no attempt was made to check the money that the police found on the Appellant for DNA or fingerprints to see whether it matched the DNA or fingerprints of the employees at the Fresh Fruit Palace. 

88A certificate from the Roads and Traffic Authority was tendered, showing the results of a search for vehicles that were a BMW, and had 4F at the start of their registration number. There were only three such vehicles. The two apart from 4FRODO were different in both year and colour to 4FRODO. The certificate was a certification as at 2 April 2008, not as at the date of either of the offences. 

89An RTA listing of BMW's with 4F at the end of their registration number showed that there were approximately 460 such vehicles. 

90Ms Virginia Friedman conducted DNA analysis. One of the balaclavas recovered from the scene of the Berala store was found to have on it DNA consistent with that of a man she named, who was not the Appellant. That DNA had a profile expected to occur in few than one in ten billion individuals in the general population. The other balaclava had traces of DNA from another individual. The DNA recovered from the jacket and the other balaclava was found to originate from at least three individuals, who could not be identified. 

91DNA testing of a polo shirt obtained from Mr Santoro showed DNA of at least three individuals, one of whom was Mr Santoro himself, but the other two could not be identified. 

92DNA samples taken from the interior of the silver BMW motor vehicle were taken from at least two individuals. The major contributor of that DNA was consistent with a Mr Zaylah (with a profile occurring in approximately one in 19 million individuals in the general population.) The identity of the other person could not be determined. A water bottle recovered from that car had DNA on it, and according to Ms Friedman the Appellant could be excluded as the source of that DNA. He could not be excluded as being possibly the source of other unidentified DNA that she tested. 

93Before the trial, police had sent the Appellant a cheque for $1,040. Counsel for the Appellant suggests that that action is inconsistent with the police regarding the money they took from the Appellant when he was picked up, as being itself stolen property. 

94No fingerprints were found to link the Appellant with any of the crimes. Fingerprints of three different people (but not of the Appellant) were on the exterior of the silver BMW. 

95A police officer agreed that he had measured the Appellant as having a height of 196 cm, at a time when the Appellant was wearing flat-soled shoes. In Imperial measurement, that is a little over 6'5"". 

96There was no evidence about the nationality of the Appellant, what languages the Appellant could speak, whether the Appellant spoke with an accent and if so what type, or with what degree of facility he spoke English. There was no evidence that linked him with the address in Liverpool Road, Enfield at which the silver BMW was found. 

The Judge's Decision on the Voir Dire 

97The judge noted that the Crown contended that the evidence of the carjacking was admissible both under s 98, and also as circumstantial evidence. He set out the principles concerning admissibility of coincidence evidence that Simpson J had stated in R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; (2005) 158 A Crim R 504 at [139]. It was common ground on the appeal that Simpson J had correctly stated the relevant principles. 

98The judge then set out what he described as the Crown's argument concerning circumstantial evidence. In that context he listed certain similarities between the first and second robberies, including: 

The involvement of the silver BMW in both of them, 

The robbery was undertaken at the close of business of the premises involved. 

99The judge further noted that the stealing of the silver BMW just three hours before the first robbery provided grounds for an inference that it was stolen as part of the planning preparatory to the commission of the first robbery. 

100The judge then listed more fully various similarities between the first and second robberies: 

""1. A silver BMW motor vehicle was used bearing the plates '4FRODO' in the first robbery but bearing stolen number plates in the second; 

2. Shots were fired from a gun in both robberies; 

3. There were multiple offenders involved in both robberies, apparently three, although in the second robbery only one witness sees a third person; 

4. Only one offender in either robbery had a gun, other weapons not being used; 

5. In the first and second robberies underlying counts 1 and 2, the offenders arrive at the close of the business they intended to rob; 

6. In each robbery the offenders appear to know where the office of the premises is located."" 

He also listed another factor, that he later discounted. The judge noted that it was not the Crown's case that the self same gun was used in the carjacking and the first and second robberies. 

101The judge stated the Crown's argument as being: 

""... there are at least six relevant similarities which are coincidental between the first and second robberies and that, in turn, the stealing of the silver BMW motor vehicle in the carjacking which the accused was admittedly involved is relatively coincidental with the appearance of that same motor vehicle bearing the same numberplate as the one which was stolen in the first robbery, and of the silver BMW motor vehicle otherwise resembling that vehicle, although with stolen numberplates, seen at the second robbery underlying count 2, so that the Crown ought be permitted to introduce evidence of the carjacking as evidence of the accused's involvement in the first and second robberies of an admittedly coincidental kind within s 98, and separately as evidence in support [of] its circumstantial evidence case."" 

102He then lists some similarities between the carjacking and the first robbery: 

""1. That the carjacking was a form of robbery; 

2. That a weapon was used; 

3. It occurred on the same day, within three hours of the first robbery; and 

4. The car stolen in the carjacking was outside the victim's premises in the first robbery."" 

103He stated that the Crown's submission about the consequence of those similarities was that: 

... s 98 permits the evidence of the carjacking in which the accused was admittedly involved to be admitted as coincidence evidence in proof of his involvement in the first robbery, and by the coincidental links between the first and second robberies which I have traced above from the Crown's argument, of his involvement in the second robbery."" 

104At tp 13 the judge gave some general consideration to the balancing of probative value and prejudicial effect: 

""The accused frankly submits that the introduction of the carjacking evidence will amount to character assassination, because the jury's emotions will be inflamed and a fair trial will be subverted, because the jury will in an illegitimate fashion use the evidence of the accused's involvement in the carjacking as propensity evidence, in a way that will mean that its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, so as to preclude its admission, not only under sections 135 and 137 but also under s 101. I pointed out at the time that it is not of course uncommon for coincidence evidence to be introduced under s 98 which has the effect of attacking the character of an accused, even though that is not intended. 

The arguments presented in this case are not without difficulty, and I have taken very seriously the argument of the accused that a fair trial may be subverted, and that some degree of character assassination may be effected, even if it is not intended, by admission of the carjacking evidence, if I can so comprehensively so call it. However, when one carefully examines the terms of s 98, quite apart from the Crown's coincidence evidence argument, the argument in favour of its admission is powerful."" 

Following that, he proceeded to give seriatim consideration to the subsections of s 98. 

105Later in his judgment (tp 14) the judge reiterated the approach he was taking to the question of admissibility. He summarised again the similarities between the carjacking and the first robbery, and summarised similarities between the first and second robberies. He continued: 

""The question I ask myself within s 98 is whether those similarities in the events I have described are substantially and relevantly similar within s 98(2), and whether taken by themselves or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the Crown within s 98(1)(a), they have significant probative value. I think they have, and I think indeed there are powerful inferences permissibly available to the jury, although they of course are matters for it, that the accused, being admittedly involved in the carjacking, was involved in the first and second robberies."" 

106Apart from the passing mention of s 101 at tp 13, that I have set out at [104] above, the only explicit consideration of s 101 was: 

""When one passes to s 101, one must ask oneself within subs (2) whether the carjacking evidence has probative value which substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. I think it does, and its probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect on the accused because of what I see as the powerful similarities between the circumstances of the carjacking and the circumstances of the first robbery, committed a matter of only three hours after the carjacking as set out above, so that I think the s 101 barrier is passed."" 

Decision 

107The matters that the Crown seeks to prove through the avenue of s 98 are that: 

1. Because of the improbability of the carjacking and the Berala robbery occurring coincidentally, the Appellant committed the Berala robbery. 

2. Because of the improbability of the carjacking and the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery occurring coincidentally, the Appellant committed the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery. 

When I refer to the Appellant committing a robbery, I mean that he was a participant in the criminal enterprise of the robbery, even if he did not actually enter either of the stores that were robbed. 

108The purpose for which the Crown was seeking to adduce the evidence of the carjacking was to prove that the Appellant ""did a particular act"" , namely, each robbery. Thus, the questions arising from ss 98 and 101 that the judge should have in substance asked himself were: 

(1) Are the carjacking and the Berala robbery events that are substantially and relevantly similar? 

(2) Are the circumstances in which the carjacking and the Berala robbery occurred substantially similar? 

(3) Will evidence of the carjacking (either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the Crown) have significant probative value concerning whether the Appellant committed the Berala robbery? 

(4) Will the probative value of the evidence concerning the carjacking substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the Appellant, so far as the jury's consideration of whether he was guilty of the Berala robbery was concerned? 

(5) Are the carjacking and the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery events that are substantially and relevantly similar? 

(6) Are the circumstances in which the carjacking and the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery occurred substantially similar? 

(7) Will evidence of the carjacking (either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the Crown) have significant probative value concerning whether the Appellant committed the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery? 

(8) Will the probative value of the evidence concerning the carjacking substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the Appellant, so far as the jury's consideration of whether he was guilty of the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery was concerned? 

109I recognise that sometimes it will be possible for a judge to consider more than one of these questions in the same passage of reasoning. However, for the judge to have performed the statutory task, it must be clear that in substance all the questions have been considered. 

110In my view, the judge did not perform the statutory task. He recited the terms of s 98(2), but did not apply them. Instead he considered ""similarities"" between the carjacking and the first robbery, without differentiating between whether the events themselves were substantially and relevantly similar, and whether the circumstances in which they occurred were substantially similar. Both ss 98(2)(a) and 98(2)(b) must be satisfied before the exhaustive definition ( ""if and only if"" ) of ""related events"" in s 98(2) is satisfied. 

111There was no explicit consideration at all of similarities (whether in general terms, or explicitly differentiating, as it should have, between similarities in events and circumstances) between the carjacking and the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery. One could not infer that the judge had in effect regarded there as being the same similarities between the carjacking and the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery as those that the judge explicitly identified between the carjacking and the Berala robbery. The Fresh Fruit Palace robbery occurred four days after the carjacking, and thus one of the factors he identified as a relevant similarity between the carjacking and the Berala robbery, namely close temporal proximity on the same day, was missing. 

112Further, the judge's detailed consideration of the similarities between the Berala robbery and the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery was not required for a decision about whether evidence of the carjacking could be admitted, concerning either of the charges, under s 98. 

113Notwithstanding the general matters he stated concerning balancing prejudice and probative value, set out at [104] above, I am not persuaded that the judge has applied s 101, so far as the admissibility of the carjacking evidence concerning the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery is concerned. The general remarks set out at [104] are not a decision that s 101 is satisfied. Rather, they are introductory to his attempt to apply the relevant elements of ss 98 and 101 seriatim. 

114Thus, in my view, the judge permitted the evidence to be adduced under s 98 without having satisfied the statutory preconditions. Thus, there has been a ""wrong decision on any question of law"" , within the meaning of s 6 Criminal Appeal Act . 

115Section 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act permits the court to dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. It is not clear to me that, if the judge had asked himself the right questions, he would have come to the conclusion that the carjacking evidence should have been admitted concerning both counts. 

116That can be sufficiently illustrated by considering the application of s 101 in relation to the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery. 

117The judge placed explicit reliance on the three hour time gap between the carjacking and the Berala robbery, in reaching the conclusion that s 101 had been satisfied concerning the Berala robbery. Therefore, it could not be assumed that he would have reached the same conclusion had he explicitly considered s 101 concerning the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery. 

118Evidence that the Appellant had committed a different crime shortly before the robberies had a significant potential for prejudice. 

119So far as probative value goes, the Appellant had committed the carjacking, and there was evidence from which a jury could comfortably conclude that the same BMW had been involved in the carjacking and each robbery (notwithstanding the evidence about the yellow car, and Ms Vranic's evidence about the car she saw seeming darkish). Further, the Appellant's possession of the BMW key after both robberies had occurred is significant evidence against him. However, as the Appellant was the passenger in the car at the time of the carjacking, rather than the driver, the very act of stealing the car would not itself put the key into his possession. It is not shown when, between the carjacking and his being picked up by the police, he obtained possession of the key. Further, Ms Wilmen's evidence of seeing someone, apparently not the Appellant, with the silver BMW on 11 April 2006 has some tendency to weaken any inference that might otherwise be available that the Appellant had had a continuous connection with the car from the time it was stolen until the time the key was recovered from him. 

120Against that, evidence other than the carjacking connecting the Appellant with the robberies was far from strong. There was no evidence of identification of the Appellant by an eyewitness, from CCTV footage, or by forensic testing. The evidence about the height of the men who actually entered premises to carry out the robberies does not appear consistent with the striking and unusual height of the Appellant. The description and images of the clothing worn by the robbers at Berala does not match that worn by the Appellant at the time of the carjacking (apart perhaps from cargo pants, which are far from a distinctive item of clothing). When it was not the Crown case that the same gun had been used in the carjacking as in either of the robberies, evidence about the similarity of appearance of the various guns (itself not particularly precise) becomes considerably less powerful. In all these circumstances this is not a case where this Court can be satisfied that if the judge had considered the application of s 101 to the Fresh Fruit Palace robbery he would have concluded the section was satisfied. 

121The judge held that the carjacking evidence was admissible as circumstantial evidence, as well as being admissible under s 98. However, he gave specific directions to the jury about the permissibility of using the evidence of the carjacking as evidence of guilt of the offences charged ""because coincidence is a very unlikely explanation for the substantial similarities"" . That direction could not have been given if he had decided ss 98 and 101 were not complied with. 

122Section 95 Evidence Act provides: 

""(1) Evidence that under [Part 3.6 - Tendency and Coincidence] is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose. 

(2) Evidence that under [Part 3.6 - Tendency and Coincidence] cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose."" 

123If the evidence had not passed the tests in ss 98 and 101, but been admissible on another basis, it would have been necessary for the judge to give the jury a direction in accordance with s 95, concerning the use that they could make of the carjacking evidence. 

124In all these circumstances it cannot be said that the Appellant did not lose a real chance of acquittal. Thus, this is not a case in which the proviso in s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act applies. The first ground of appeal is made out. 

125In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the second ground of appeal. 

126I propose the following orders: 

(1) Extend the time for filing of a Notice of Intention to Appeal to and including 24 August 2009. 

(2) Extend the time during which the Notice of Intention to Appeal has effect to and including 31 August 2010. 

(3) Appeal allowed. 

(4) Set aside each conviction in the court below. 

(5) Remit the matter to the District Court for a new trial. 

(6) Direct the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions to notify the Registrar of this Court, and my Associate, in writing, promptly after the new trial has concluded. 

127RS HULME J : I agree with Campbell JA. 

128HOEBEN J : I agree with Campbell JA.

2758101,R v Hawi & ors (No 33) [2011] NSWSC 1679,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Usama Potrus was found yesterday by the jury to be guilty of the offence of riot. That is an offence against s 93B of the Crimes Act 1900 for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. 

2Mr Potrus seeks that bail be granted to him for the period between now and when his sentence proceedings are finalised. The application is subject to s 8D of the Bail Act 1978 which provides for a presumption against bail for offences of riot and related offences. In short, bail is not to be granted unless the applicant satisfies the Court that bail should not be refused. That is a significant hurdle to the application. It has been held in relation to similar provisions in the Bail Act providing for a presumption against bail that they should be interpreted as meaning that bail would normally or ordinarily be refused: see R v Masters (1992) NSWLR 450; R v Kissner (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt CJ at CL, 17 January 1992, unreported). 

3There is some force in the submission of Mr Driels of counsel that the rationale for there being a presumption against bail in s 8D is really to deal with concerns in the aftermath of riots and other matters involving public disorder. A significant matter, in his submission, which I accept, is that there has been in excess of two and a half years that have elapsed between the incident giving rise to the offence and now. 

4A considerable number of matters have been put with earnest in support of the application. They include that the applicant has no previous convictions; he has no previous failures to appear in court as required; he may be taken to be a person of good character; he has considerable community support; he has friends and family present in court as a demonstration of that support; he has accommodation available in the family home; he has work available to him; he is prepared to surrender his passport; security is available from both the applicant and his family; and, he is prepared to report to the police if required. 

5Mr Driels also referred to there being no fear, because of the time at which the application is made, that is following conviction, for the interference with witnesses or evidence. 

6The circumstances of the applicant's custody, particularly over the last six months or so, is also a relevant matter to take into account. I accept that it has been in circumstances more harsh than usually encountered by a person denied bail. 

7A particularly relevant matter to take into account is the likely sentence that might be imposed. It is premature for me to form any concluded view, or anywhere near a concluded view, about that at this stage. 

8A submission was made that there had been an offer to plead guilty, put in writing and submitted to the Crown in November last year. That was an offer to plead guilty to riot in full satisfaction of the indictment. This would be a matter that may tend to mitigate the sentence that is imposed, but the extent to which it may do so will depend upon the submissions I hear on sentence. I note in that respect that the applicant pleaded not guilty to that offence, that is of riot, before the jury. 

9It is difficult, until I hear submissions as to the findings I should make as to the objective seriousness of the offence, to form a concluded view, or anywhere near a concluded view, as to such findings that should be made. I do, however, wish to comment on one aspect of the submissions that were made. It was submitted that there was no suggestion of any person other than the participants in the riot being physically injured. I accept that seems to be the case. But it was also submitted that the emotional harm to others who were present concerned perhaps one, or very few, of those people. That is not the impression I have formed during the course of hearing the evidence of many witnesses during the course of the trial. My tentative view is that the situation, in reality, is that emotional harm was suffered by a great many people who witnessed the events at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009, to the extent that it may well be likely that those people will never forget that experience. 

10The applicant has been in custody for almost two years and four months. I do not know when sentence proceedings will be finalised, but I anticipate the submission will be that Mr Potrus should not serve any further time or, if any further time, not very much. As I say, I have nowhere near a concluded view about that, but it seems to me to be a distinct possibility that the sentence may require him to serve a further period of time of some substance. 

11Having regard to all of the very positive things that have been put in support of the application, but also having regard to the presumption against it being granted and the prospect of the applicant being required to serve more than a trivial further amount in custody, on balance, my view is that the application should be refused.

2758104,R v ROBERTS [2011] NSWDC 212,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Gareth Llewellyn Roberts appears for sentence today on a number of matters; cultivate a commercial quantity of prohibited plant by indoor means; supply prohibited drug (namely some cannabis); possess some LSD, as well as a number of matters on the Form 1 which are to be taken into account for the cultivate offence; using electricity without authority, interfering with network operators, and possessing a protected fauna (relating to a snake), which Mr Roberts had in his possession, that snake not being registered. 

2The number of offences and their seriousness is immediately suggestive of the need to impose on Mr Roberts a sentence of some severity. 

3The offences were detected when police went to his home on 7 December 2010, armed with a search warrant. They knocked on the door. Mr Roberts opened it. Police immediately smelled a strong odour of cannabis. The offender took them to a rear door that appeared to go under the house, he used a key pad to open the door and once inside police located three separate rooms, each containing growing cannabis plants and sophisticated equipment used for its cultivation. There were 119 cannabis plants in one room, twenty-one in the second room, and forty-five in the third room, thus there was a total of 185 cannabis plants found. 

4As well as the growing plants, there was a significant quantity of cannabis; 3.8 kilograms in fact. Police also discovered two sheets of coloured cardboard, segregated into small squares, which on analysis were found to contain LSD, 

5The offender made admissions to the police about cultivating the cannabis plants, bypassing the electricity supply, and his knowledge of the loose cannabis about the premises. He was taken to the police station and has remained in custody since that date. 

6Mr Roberts is twenty-five years of age. He had a happy childhood but matters started to go downhill in a number of areas, particularly after his father was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. His father died in February 2010, but leading up to his unfortunate death his behaviour deteriorated, which caused a great deal of distress in the family and which distressed Mr Roberts considerably. 

7Mr Roberts initially did well at school but he left in year 11 without completing his HSC. He has worked since then for a supermarket, and at the time of his arrest he was working as a train conductor for State Rail. He married, and his wife was living with him at the time of his arrest, but that relationship appears to be on the rocks. She does not visit him in custody very often and she is not in Court to support him here today. 

8A psychological report was tendered today. Much more than most such reports, I found this one to be helpful. It describes a number of challenges that Mr Roberts faces as regards his mental wellbeing. He is, for example, currently on anti-depressant medication, and he was being treated in a similar way before his arrest. 

9He suffers from an eating disorder. He has a serious problem with alcohol, so much so that he would consume enormous quantities of alcohol by himself and this seems to be one of his main occupations; that, and cultivating his cannabis plants. 

10His problems with alcohol have continued whilst he has been in custody because he has been dealt with whilst in custody for making alcohol. Unsurprisingly, he has problems with drugs too, using various forms such as cannabis and ecstasy in the period up to his arrest. 

11The psychologist says that there appears to be a strong self-medicative component to his abuse of alcohol whereby he reportedly ""drank his emotions away"". Given the distress of watching his father deteriorate and die, one might be forgiven for thinking that a person in Mr Roberts' position might easily adopt that attitude. 

12The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I will impose upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

13The material suggests the need for intensive supervision of the offender to deal with the various problems he faces in life. The purposes of sentencing are varied and often work in competing directions but ultimately what I do is fashion orders which will protect society. In most cases it is thought that where people commit serious offences the best response is to impose harsh sentences upon them, to deter others who may be tempted to act in a similar way. 

14On occasions, however, this Court, and even the Court of Criminal Appeal, recognise that the protection of society can sometimes best be achieved by focusing on the rehabilitation of a particular offender. I note that the offender has spent almost eleven months in custody. The Crown quite properly did not suggest that he would need to spend more than two years further in custody. That raises the consideration of the possibility of whether it would be an appropriate order to impose a further sentence of imprisonment upon Mr Roberts but order that it be served by way of an intensive corrections order. 

15Such a means of serving a sentence is by no means a necessarily lenient one. Unlike a suspended sentence there is a real component of punishment as well as rehabilitation. In my view if I were simply to impose a sentence of imprisonment to be served full-time upon Mr Roberts, and make a finding, of course, of special circumstances in his favour, the resources - limited as they are - of the Probation and Parole Service to supervise Mr Roberts upon his release on parole would not be of the same intensity as the supervision which comes with an intensive corrections order. 

16I fully appreciate that, by focusing on Mr Roberts' rehabilitation, I am giving less weight to general deterrence and even, perhaps, personal deterrence, but as I have tried to suggest earlier, there are occasions - and this is one - where the protection of society is best achieved by focusing on rehabilitation. 

17I am going to refer Mr Roberts for assessment as to his suitability to serve his sentence by means of intensive corrections order, having determined that the sentence I am likely to impose upon him, if it were to date from today, would be likely to be two years or less. 

18It is always possible - and possibly more than that - that Mr Roberts will be found to be unsuitable for an intensive corrections order and if he is not suitable, he must, as Mr Nicol concedes, spend further time in custody. If he is found to be suitable, however, I consider it appropriate that any further term of imprisonment I might impose would be served in that manner. 

19Accordingly, I will adjourn this matter to 9 December 2011 at 2pm. I order an assessment be made as to his suitability to serve a sentence by means of an intensive corrections order. 

20Mr Nicol, as well as the standard conditions, if your client is suitable for an intensive corrections order, I can impose additional conditions and there are some recommendations made in Dr Seidler's report as to your client receiving treatment with psychologists, being referred for an atheroma, his general practitioner. I would like you and possibly the Crown to do, is to discuss possible further conditions you think appropriate having looked carefully at Dr Seidler's report in order to enhance Mr Roberts's rehabilitation. 

21Mr Roberts do you understand what I have done? You probably were not expecting this when you came to Court, but what I have done is this, the Probation and Parole Service are going to come and see you, they are going to make enquiries as to whether you can serve the rest of your sentence in what is called an intensive corrections order. Now, that is not an easy way of serving your sentence by any means. For a while you are subject to a curfew, and for you one of the hardest things might be, that you are not allowed to drink alcohol. So you should cooperate with them when they come and see you and do all that you can to satisfy them that you will be able to meet their requirements, because if you do not, if you are not suitable for an intensive corrections order, you will be in gaol for a while longer. Do you understand that? Right. 

22Thank you Madam Crown and Mr Nicol, I will see you both on 9 December.

2758106,R v Andrew Iskandar & R v Nita Iskandar (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 1325,"Judgment 

1The Crown applies to cross-examine Mr Maiava pursuant to s 38 Evidence Act 1995 on the basis that evidence he gave was unfavourable to the Crown and on the basis of a prior inconsistent statement. The particular evidence concerns whether Mr Maiava sought clarification from Andrew about what Andrew meant when he said he wanted Mr Maiava to find someone to do a job for him in respect of a witness. When the Crown asked Mr Maiava if Mr Maiava sought to clarify what Andrew meant Mr Maiava said that he did not. 

2The Crown pointed to what is contained in paragraph 7 of Mr Maiava's Statement of 13 October 2011 where Mr Maiava said that he told the Police: 

When we were doing these laps, Andrew said to me, ""Do you 
know anyone that will do a job?"" 

I said, ""What kind of a job?"" 

He said, ""Just a job"" 

I said, ""Oh yeah I know what you mean"" 

He said, ""I'll pay them 10 grand to make sure a witness doesn't get to court"" 

I understood that to mean, that he wants me to organise to get rid of the witness, as in kill him. I said to him, ""So you want me to get rid of him as in kill him?"" Andrew laughed in an evil way, which I took as an agreeance with my understanding of his request to kill a witness in his court case. 

3Mr Maiava's Statement then went on to say this: 

8. Andrew said to me, ""The witness I want to get rid of was a mate of mine who I asked to give me an alibi."" 

4The Crown submitted that Mr Maiava's oral evidence was unfavourable to the Crown because it did not go as far as what the Statement contained and, therefore, left the question of what precisely Andrew meant when he spoke to Mr Maiava about doing a job. 

5Mr O'Sullivan submitted that the evidence given by Mr Maiava was not unfavourable to the Crown. He submitted also that it was not inconsistent with what was contained in the Statement. 

6At the time the Crown first made the application the relevant question and answer of the witness was this: 

Q. Did you ever ask him, when you say you understood him to mean knock, did you ever ask him about that, if that's what he meant? 
A. No, I didn't. 

7That evidence was not inconsistent with what appeared in Mr Maiava's Statement because the Statement did not suggest that Mr Maiava had asked Andrew what he meant. Because there was no clear inconsistency that suggested that at that point the evidence was not unfavourable to the Crown. For that reason I said that I would not permit the Crown to cross-examine Mr Maiava, but would permit the Crown to seek to obtain from him in a non-leading fashion the evidence that was contained in paragraph 7 of his Statement. I said that if the Crown was unsuccessful in obtaining that evidence I would reconsider the question of cross-examination. 

8In the presence of the jury the following evidence was then given: 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

Q. Mr Maiava, you told us that Andrew Iskandar asked you to ""get rid of a witness"", I think were your words? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. Were they the words that used 
A. Yes. 

Q. ""Get rid of""? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you ever tell him what you thought that meant, ""get rid of""? 
A. I just asked him what he said to me, you wanted to do a job, and that's all I asked him. 

Q. And you've told us what you understand ""do a job"" means? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did you ever tell Andrew what you believed that meant? 
A. No. 

9At that point the Crown Prosecutor renewed her application to cross-examine Mr Maiava. 

10In R v Pantoja [1998] NSWSC 565 James J (with whom Wood CJ at CL agreed) said: 

Although the heading to s 38 of the Evidence Act is ""unfavourable witnesses"", the section itself refers to ""evidence"" given by a witness and in my view leave can be granted to cross-examine a witness on part only of his evidence if it is unfavourable to the party calling him or inconsistent with a prior statement made by the witness, even though the rest or most of the rest of the witness's evidence is favourable to the party calling him. 

11Mr O'Sullivan accepted, in the light of the further attempts by the Crown to obtain the evidence in paragraph 7, that there was now a clear inconsistency between his oral evidence and the evidence in the Statement. I consider further, in the light of the relevant offence charged (solicit to murder) that the oral evidence of the witness was unfavourable to the Crown. A proper basis was therefore available under either paragraph (a) or (c) of s 38 to permit the Crown to cross-examine Mr Maiava. 

12In giving the leave sought under this section regard is to be had amongst other things to the matters in s 192 Evidence Act . 

13In my opinion, the nature of the proceedings (a trial on a charge of soliciting to murder) and the importance of the evidence in relation to that charge make it appropriate to grant the leave sought. I do not consider that it would unfair to the Accused to permit that when the evidence was otherwise contained in the Statement signed by the witness. 

14The Crown is permitted to cross-examine in relation to paragraphs 7 and 8 of Mr Maiava's Statement.

		27 June 2012",2011-11-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758112,AM v R [2011] NSWCCA 237,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : The test to be applied with respect to a challenge to the reasonableness of the verdict of a jury or that the verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidence is that formulated by the majority in SKA v The Queen (2011) HCA 13 at [21]. I have reviewed the whole of the evidence and I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty as charged. I agree with Harrison J's analysis of the relevant issues and with his Honour's reasons with respect to the other grounds of appeal. I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J. 

2LATHAM J : I agree with Harrison J. 

3HARRISON J : The appellant was convicted on 19 October 2009 following a trial before Sweeney DCJ and a jury on one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of that Act. He was sentenced on 27 July 2010. No complaint is made about the sentence. 

4There were originally seven grounds of appeal but only the fourth, fifth and seventh grounds are now pressed. They are in these terms: 

Ground 4 : The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that there was evidence on which it could find that the accused was reckless as to having a belief that the complainant consented to sexual intercourse. 

Ground 5 : The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that it could find the accused guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant because he was reckless as to his belief that the complainant had consented. 

Ground 7 : The verdict of the jury was in all the circumstances unsafe and unsatisfactory [ sic : ""unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence""] insofar as the evidence as appears below and given in the course of the trial: 

(i) the manner in which the parties go from the kitchen to the laundry; 

(ii) who locked the door and why only one door in the laundry was locked; 

(iii) how the clothing came to be off one leg of the complainant's body, including her underwear; 

(iv) the after event concerning how the appellant on one view arrogantly and yet on another comfortably went back ahead of the complainant into the kitchen area and sat by the breakfast bar partaking of not one but three beers; 

(v) the subsequent conversation in Exhibit E which, consistent with in part admissions but nevertheless in circumstances where there is inevitably a degree of marital embarrassment for both parties expressed by the appellant and consistent with innocence as opposed to guilt, but more importantly highlighting and without being negated to the requisite standard the fact that the door was, according to the appellant, locked by the complainant and not by him, and only one door as such, and not both doors, 

constituted a miscarriage of justice insofar as a verdict of guilty was rendered by the jury as it was, in the circumstances, unreasonable and unsatisfactory in terms of its reception and consideration in finding the appellant guilty of the offences charged. 

Factual background 

5The evidence in the Crown case was as follows. The appellant came to the complainant's home on 28 February 2008. The complainant resided on a farm at Benerembah with her partner and her son. Her partner had gone to work that morning. She had gone to pick up her son from his work at some time between 1.40pm and 2.10pm when she returned with him to the property. Her son had a shower and went to lie down, as he was tired. When the complainant went outside to clean up around the house, she saw a silver-grey ute heading along the road towards the homestead. The complainant did not immediately recognise the vehicle or the driver until the appellant stepped out of it. She then recognised him as someone she had met previously when accompanied by her partner. 

6The complainant enquired of the appellant what he was doing there and he asked her whether her partner was home. She told him that her partner was not at home. The appellant then told the complainant that he had some melons for her and she made a comment to the effect that that was nice of him. The appellant was carrying a rockmelon and a watermelon and asked the complainant where she would like them. She told him that the kitchen would be appropriate. The appellant did not hand the melons to the complainant as she expected but instead took them into the kitchen himself. In doing so he walked in through the back door of the house, through the laundry and the pantry and then into the kitchen. He placed the melons on the sink, turned to the complainant and pushed her into a corner, wedging her between the oven and a bench. He said to her, ""I've wanted to fuck you since the first time I met you"". The appellant then placed one of his hands under her clothing, grabbing at her breasts. The complainant asked him not to do that to her. She said, ""Don't do this, my son is here asleep"". The appellant replied, ""No, there is no-one here, only me"". 

7The appellant attempted to kiss the complainant but she resisted. She reminded him that her partner would soon be home. The appellant then walked through the kitchen and into the laundry. The complainant followed him to make sure that he was leaving. He then turned back and grabbed her around the waist and with his other arm closed and locked the door between the laundry and the pantry. The appellant disputed that he closed or locked the door, contending instead that it was the complainant who did so. 

8The appellant then undid the belt of the complainant's jeans, turned her around and pulled her jeans and her underwear down to just below her bottom. He pushed her forward in a bent over position facing away from him and attempted unsuccessfully to penetrate her from behind. He then turned the complainant around and attempted to place her hand on his penis. The appellant then told the complainant that he wanted her to perform oral sex upon him. She made no reply. The appellant then pushed the complainant backwards and she lost her balance, falling onto the toilet seat, which cracked under her weight. The appellant then grabbed the complainant's legs and pinned her feet under his armpits from the ankles and grabbed at her jeans, which then came down. 

9The appellant then penetrated the complainant. This lasted for about a minute. The appellant and the complainant then tidied themselves using toilet paper that was placed in the toilet and flushed. The complainant washed her hands. The appellant had by then walked into the kitchen. He sat down on a stool at the breakfast bar and said, ""I might have a beer now"". He proceeded thereafter to drink three beers to which he helped himself. The complainant sat opposite him. He said to the complainant, ""Don't tell anyone about this. Don't tell anyone"". The complainant replied, ""Alright, alright"" or ""No I won't, no I won't"". 

10The complainant was very scared and was trying to keep herself calm. She did not call out to her son for help, as she was afraid of her son's reaction. The appellant asked her how often she went to town and he said to her, ""When you do, ring me. [Your partner] has my phone number"". The complainant said that she thought she agreed because she would have said anything to get him to go. The appellant said, ""I can't keep coming here, people will get suspicious, I'm known as a bad boy around town"". The appellant left via the laundry. The complainant went with him out to his vehicle. The appellant asked her to look at a plastic sign on the rear window, which read: ""I like my beer cold, my women hot, my cars fast"". He turned to her again and pushed her backwards onto the bonnet of an old Ford. She said, ""You'd better go, [my partner] will be home soon"". He left. The whole episode lasted about 45 minutes. 

11The complainant then showered and changed her clothes. She did not tell her partner what had happened when he came home, as she was ashamed and frightened of his reaction. She did not tell her son either. She went to bed late but could not sleep. She told her partner what had happened the next day by saying, ""[The appellant] raped me"". The police were called on the evening of 29 February 2008 and attended the home at about 2.30am on 1 March 2008. They left at about 7.40am. The complainant and her partner went to the hospital that same day. 

12While the complainant was at the hospital, her partner's phone rang. It was the appellant. He identified himself and asked if the complainant's partner would come and see him. He was told ""No"". He then asked if he could come and see the complainant's partner. He was told ""No"". The appellant then said, ""Please ... don't cause any trouble"". The complainant's partner hung up. 

13The complainant made a statement to police on 2 March 2008. 

14On 6 March 2008 the complainant took part in a telephone conversation with the appellant. This was organised by the police who were present when it took place. A transcript of the recording of the conversation became an exhibit in the proceedings. Part of that recording is as follows: 

""C: Been a week now. 
A: Yeah. 
C: I been pretty upset by all this. Um.. 
A: Well I'm upset too because I know I shouldn't have done it. But you could've said Look, don't do it. 
C: I did say that to you. 
A: Yeah. 
C: I did say that to you I did. 
A: I just hope that you don't make much trouble for me please. 

... 

C: Oh right. Right but why after all this had happened and I had said no to you when you had been there in the kitchen in that corner and you were putting your hands up under my T-shirt and that and you were grabbin' me you knew I didn't want you to do that didn't you? 
A: Yep. 
C: You knew that. 
A: Yeah. 

... 

C: When you put me in the laundry, why did you lock the door? Why why did you lock the door? 
A: No you locked the door. 
C: No I did not lock that door. 
A: [Complainant], you locked that door. 
C: No I didn't. 
A: Because because your son was in there in, in, in, ah in the bedroom. 

... 

C: But the thing is [appellant], at the, at the end of the day you know that what you've done you have raped me. You know that don't you? 
A: I'm not goin' to I'm not denyin' it because I tried and I thought, I thought you wanted to right? 
C: You thought I wanted to? 
A: Oh that I thought you wanted, honest but.. 
C: You thought I wanted.. 
A: I but [complainant] I know I'm I'm in the wrong."" 

15The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. 

Grounds 4 and 5 

16As the Crown's submissions indicate, no guidance is provided by the terms of these grounds of appeal as to the respect or respects in which it is said that the learned trial judge erred so as to give rise to a miscarriage of justice. Counsel for the appellant did not advance oral argument in this Court in support of these grounds of appeal, instead relying on his written submissions. Those submissions do not identify, discuss or analyse any single portion of the trial judge's directions on recklessness at all, and certainly not in a way that makes good the complaints about the directions, which the appellant seeks to advance. This is very unsatisfactory in my view. 

17In contrast, counsel for the Crown proffered a detailed consideration of the directions, and the relevant law, in support of a submission that no error had been made. She did so in the following way. 

18Section 61I of the Crimes Act provides that any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. In bringing that charge the Crown undertook to prove that: 

(i) sexual intercourse took place between the appellant and the complainant; 

(ii) the complainant did not consent to the intercourse; and 

(iii) the appellant had the requisite mental element for the offence. 

19In seeking to prove the requisite mental element the Crown was entitled as a matter of law to rely upon recklessness. Section 61HA applied to the circumstances of this case. It is relevantly in these terms: 

"" 61HA Consent in relation to sexual assault offences 

(1) Offences to which section applies: This section applies for the purposes of the offences under sections 61I, 61J and 61JA. 

(2) Meaning of consent: A person 'consents' to sexual intercourse if the person freely and voluntarily agrees to the sexual intercourse. 

(3) Knowledge about consent: A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse if: 

(a) the person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or 

(b) the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or 

(c) the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse. 

For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case: 

(d) including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but 

(e) not including any self-induced intoxication of the person. 

***** 

(7) A person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not, by reason only of that fact, to be regarded as consenting to the sexual intercourse. 

(8) This section does not limit the grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse."" 

20The Crown's opening to the jury included the following: 

""You have to be satisfied that [the appellant] knew that [the complainant] did not consent to the sexual intercourse or that he was reckless as to whether she was consenting and, thirdly, that he had no reasonable grounds for believing that [the complainant] consented to the sexual intercourse."" 

21The Crown's closing address contained the following: 

""It is clear the Crown says that on the evidence this man, the accused, knew that [the complainant] wasn't consenting and if you at least listen to the tape he was reckless as to whether she was consenting and, given the way that she behaved and what she said, if you accept her evidence, there was no reasonable grounds for believing that she was consenting."" 

22On the issue of consent her Honour directed the jury in the following terms: 

""The issue for you to consider in this trial is consent. The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that [the complainant] did not consent to intercourse with [the appellant]. [He] does not have to prove that [she] did consent. A person consents to intercourse if she freely and voluntarily agrees to have intercourse with another person. Consent can be expressed in words or actions. Absence of consent can also be expressed in words or actions, but a person who does not offer physical resistance is not by that fact alone to be taken as having consented to intercourse. 

The Crown relies on [the complainant's] evidence that she did not consent, that she said to [the appellant] 'Don't do this' and tried to push his hand away when he touched her breasts, that she moved her head to prevent him kissing her. Her evidence was she did not say anything or do anything when the sexual intercourse occurred because she was scared. 

If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the complainant] did not consent you go on to consider whether [the appellant] knew she was not consenting. If the Crown has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that [she] did not consent to the intercourse you will find [the appellant] not guilty. 

The third element the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is that the [appellant] knew [the complainant] did not consent to intercourse. It is the [appellant's] state of mind which you must consider. The Crown relies on what it says are admissions by the [appellant] in the phone conversation with [the complainant]. You can also draw the conclusion that the [appellant] knew [the complainant] did not consent from evidence of the words she spoke at the time and her actions which I have just referred to. To draw that conclusion from that evidence you will need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that conclusion is available to be drawn from that evidence. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant] knew [the complainant] did not consent to intercourse then the Crown will have proved that element of the offence. 

You may also consider whether the [appellant] honestly believed that [she] was consenting to intercourse. This issue might be raised in your minds by [the appellant's] statement in the telephone conversation with [the complainant] when he said, 'I thought you wanted to'. The test is whether [the appellant] honestly believed [the complainant] was consenting to intercourse, and if he did have that belief whether he had reasonable grounds for having such a belief. 

The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant] either (1) did not honestly believe that [she] was consenting or (2) if he did have that honest belief he had no reasonable grounds for that belief. The Crown case is that given [her] evidence of her actions the [appellant] did not have reasonable grounds for such a belief. 

The Crown bears the onus of proving that the [appellant] had a guilty mind, so if there is a reasonable possibility that [he] did honestly believe on reasonable grounds that [the complainant] was consenting the third element of the offence is not made out and you will find [him] not guilty of the charge. 

The other way in which the Crown can prove that the [appellant] had a guilty mind for this third element of the charge is if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that [he] was reckless as to whether [she] consented to have intercourse with him. If the Crown proves [he] was reckless about whether [she] was consenting the law says he is taken to know that [she] did not consent. 

To prove beyond reasonable doubt that the [appellant] was reckless about [the complainant's] consenting the Crown must prove one of two situations, either (1) that [the appellant] failed to consider whether or not [she] was consenting and just went ahead with the act of intercourse, even though the risk that [she] was not consenting would have been obvious to someone with [the appellant's] mental capacity if he had turned his mind to it or, (2) that [he] realised at the time of intercourse the possibility that [she] was not consenting but went ahead with the intercourse regardless of whether she was consenting or not. 

The Crown says [the appellant's] statements during the phone conversation with [the complainant] show he was reckless, so you will examine his words in that conversation and see whether either one of those states of recklessness which I have just referred to are established by that evidence."" 

23Her Honour's direction on recklessness was in accordance with the example contained in the Criminal Trials Bench Book. No objection was taken to that direction when it was given. 

24Subsequently, the jury asked her Honour to explain the concept of recklessness again. Her Honour did so in these terms: 

""To prove recklessness beyond reasonable doubt the Crown can prove that in one of two ways. The first way is if the Crown proves that [the appellant] failed to consider whether or not [the complainant] was consenting and just went ahead with the act of intercourse even though the risk that [she] was not consenting would have been obvious to someone with [his] mental capacity if he had turned his mind to it. 

The second way the Crown can prove recklessness is if it proves beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant] realised at the time intercourse was occurring the possibility that [the complainant] was not consenting but went ahead with intercourse regardless of whether she was consenting or not. Why I talk about 'at the time' it's not what he might have realised afterwards, it must be his state of mind at the time. 

If the Crown proves either one of those states of recklessness then the law says that that's equivalent to [the appellant] knowing [the complainant] did not consent. Does that answer the question? 

FOREPERSON: Yes."" 

25Counsel for the appellant at the trial then said this: 

""Having thought about it over the luncheon adjournment, my concern is that the Crown opened, as is its right, raising the issue of recklessness. In its closing, however, on my notes the Crown really referred to the issue of recklessness in relation to the phone call which was recorded. So that's my concern and yet I think the Crown closed on the strength of the evidence is that on [the complainant's] account of what occurred at the house on the day that no real issue of recklessness arises out of her evidence there, it's only in relation to the phone conversation that's recorded that one can really speak about the possibility of recklessness arising and I would be wanting your Honour to give the jury a direction along those lines."" 

26Her Honour declined to give the further direction sought. 

27Counsel for the appellant in this Court referred to Banditt v The Queen [2005] HCA 80; (2005) 224 CLR 262 at [37] in these terms: 

""[37] A direction that 'reckless' has the meaning to be given by the jury in the particular circumstances of the case would be erroneous... In the present case, the trial judge properly emphasised that it was not the reaction of some notional reasonable man but the state of mind of the appellant which the jury was obliged to consider and that this was to be undertaken with regard to the surrounding circumstances, including the past relationship of the parties."" 

28Unfortunately, the appellant's submissions did not attempt to explain, either by reference to this passage or otherwise, how it was suggested that her Honour's direction was erroneous. Instead, the submissions dwelt upon a particular factual issue in the proceedings, concerning who closed the laundry door. This approach was presumably taken in aid of the contention that if the jury believed that the complainant closed it, then it amounted to an indication that she consented to the intercourse. 

29I confess that I have had some considerable difficulty understanding the appellant's written submissions in support of this ground. The apparently relevant paragraphs of those submissions are in these terms: 

""55. When one looks at the recording as transcribed and the conversation had in the course of that recording, it is, we would respectfully submit, patently obvious that the matter under consideration was, in terms of the appellant's appreciate of what had occurred, a situation where - marital embarrassment and feelings of guilt aside - he was adamant that he did not close the door, thereby securing the scene and the privacy more importantly for the conduct of the intercourse in question and its commission, and equally did not allow himself to be entreated to admit that it was he who closed the door, but maintained it was the complainant. He further indicated that it was the complainant who had sought to have intercourse from a standing position, but that it was impossible for him to do so and that intercourse thereafter took place in a more facilitative format, bearing in mind the height difference between the complainant and the accused. 

56. These critically were matters that should have been redirected by the trial judge as to the nature of the recklessness to be appreciated by the jury and, more importantly, matters that should have been taken into account by the jury in the circumstances if such a direction had been given as a result of which a miscarriage of justice has occurred. This ground has also been made out, but in any event impacts upon the ground taken in the submissions made on whether the verdict was unsafe and/or unsatisfactory."" 


30While this issue of who closed the door and what is said about it in the recorded telephone conversation is referred to in more detail in relation to Ground 7, it is sufficient at this point to observe that it was plainly open to the jury to disbelieve what the appellant said in the telephone conversation and believe what the complainant said in that conversation or in her evidence generally. Its relationship to the issue of recklessness, and to the possibility that her Honour misdirected the jury on the issue, is obscure at best and illusory at worst. There was to my mind no error in the way in which her Honour directed the jury on the recklessness issue or in failing to redirect them as requested. This is not a case where the direction could be regarded as ""an unfortunate side-wind"", to adopt the words of Callinan J in Banditt at [112], nor was the direction strictly unnecessary: see R v Kitchener (1993) 29 NSWLR 696. As the Court said in R v Henning (NSWCCA 11 May 1990, unreported at 32): 

""...recklessness will become a relevant issue...when there is a possibility of ambiguity in the signals of consent or non-consent emanating from the complainant or arising from the circumstances"". 

31There was no argument in this case at trial or in this Court that a direction was unnecessary, and there were circumstances that bore upon the desirability of the direction being given notwithstanding the appellant's claim that the complainant was consenting. These were notably the contents of the recorded conversation. The appellant expressly accepted that recklessness was an issue raised at the trial. I can discern no error in the direction on recklessness that was given to the jury to prove that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent. Nor was there any error by the trial judge in leaving this lawfully available method of proof to the jury. 

32These grounds of appeal are not made out. 

Ground 7 

33In Kurdi v R [2011] NSWCCA 179 at [3]-[18], Bathurst CJ reviewed the principles applying to cases where the verdict of a jury is challenged under the provisions of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 upon the basis that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. Those principles are uncontroversial and guide this Court in the determination of this ground of appeal. 

34The appellant's case at trial was that the jury would reject the complainant's evidence as not credible, to the effect that it was she who initiated the sexual contact, and that she had taken the appellant by the hand and led him into the laundry. The appellant's case at trial also challenged the complainant's account that any sexual activity had occurred in the kitchen. The complainant wholly rejected the case put to her in cross-examination. Those denials included the following: 

that she offered the appellant a beer or a cup of tea; 

that she presented him with a beer or made herself a cup of tea; 

that she sat at the breakfast bar with him; 

that the television was on and that she told the appellant that her son was watching it; 

that the appellant asked to meet her son; 

that the reason that she did not call out to her son was that the appellant did not touch her on the breast; 

that the appellant wished her a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and gave her a kiss on the cheek; 

that she kissed him back; 

that she took his hand and proceeded into the pantry and then the laundry; 

that she pulled the door closed and locked it; 

that she closed and locked the door to make sure that her son would not disturb them in the laundry; 

that the reason her jeans leg came off easily was because she pulled her leg out herself; 

that she and the appellant engaged in marital infidelity and she consented to sexual intercourse with the appellant. 

35It was open to the jury to accept these denials. More importantly, in the light of recent authority and having regard to the whole of the evidence, I consider that they should be accepted. 

36The appellant's submissions focussed primarily on three matters. First, who locked the laundry door. Secondly, the failure to complain, resist or escape when there were ready means available to do so and when the complainant's son was available to come to her aid. Thirdly, the fact that after the offence the appellant went into the kitchen and drank beer. 

37None of these features was an intermediate fact upon which the jury had, or this Court on appeal has, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict. The jury was, and this Court is now, entitled and required to assess and evaluate the evidence relating to each matter in the light of the totality of the evidence. Each matter had to be viewed in context. 

38The issue of who locked the door and why was agitated at length in the course of the evidence at the trial. The appellant's arguments are predicated upon him being truthful in the telephone conversation when he disputed that it was he who locked the door and upon a rejection of the complainant's evidence that he did so. However, the fact that the appellant denied that he locked the door does not correspond necessarily to a finding that the complainant should not be believed. 

39There was no relevant failure to complain. The complainant told her partner what had occurred within 24 hours of the events in question. She waited that long because she was ashamed and frightened of the reaction she might get. She did not tell her son what had happened because she wanted to protect him from it. The complainant conceded that she could have moved quickly up the hallway to her son's room and that she made no attempt to do so while the appellant was there. She did not call out for help. She did not try to escape, despite an opportunity to do so, because she was scared. The Crown contended that all of this evidence was entirely understandable and commonplace in cases of sexual assault. I agree. 

40All of the matters to which the appellant draws attention were matters that were properly within the province of the jury. It is convenient at this point to recall what was said in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, cited by the Chief Justice in Kurdi at [6] as follows: 

""[6] In M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, the majority of the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) set out the approach which should be adopted when a ground of appeal is that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. Relevantly, their Honours stated at 493: 

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.' 

And, at 494-495: 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.' "" 

41I consider that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was clearly open to the jury, and it is clearly open to this Court, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. I do not consider that any reasonable doubt attends that conclusion. The matters to which the appellant points were matters about which the complainant gave evidence and upon which she was cross-examined. The fact that an alternative possibility may have been raised in each case does not mean that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to that evidence. 

42The complainant described how she and the appellant went from the kitchen to the laundry. It was open to the jury to accept, and I accept, that version as truthful. No part of the evidence leads to the result that an acceptance of the complainant's version was unreasonable. The same applies to the issue of who locked the door. The issue of why only one door was locked does not seem to be particularly relevant and its importance or significance has not otherwise been explained by the appellant in support of this ground. 

43The complainant gave evidence that the appellant removed her clothing. The appellant's submission appears to be that because the complainant was wearing jeans, he could not have undressed her without her co-operation. However, once again, that was evidence that was open to the jury to accept or to reject. It is evidence that I accept, having regard to the whole of the evidence. It is not evidence, in the light of all the evidence in the case, that apparently contains discrepancies, or displays inadequacies, or which is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead this Court to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted. The same can be said of the fact that the appellant proceeded to go to the kitchen and drink beer before leaving. It was clearly open to the jury to find, and I would find, that audacious conduct of its kind was consistent with the appellant's other conduct exhibited by him immediately beforehand in the commission of the offences. 

44Moreover, the whole of the evidence in the case included the taped conversation between the complainant and the appellant. The jury considered these preceding issues in the light of the terms of that conversation, which are strongly probative of the appellant's guilt. I consider them to be strongly probative of the appellant's guilt. His comments to the complainant during that conversation are consistent with knowledge on his part that he did not have the complainant's consent to engage in sexual intercourse. There was no issue at the trial or in this Court that the appellant's comments in that conversation amounted to admissions. 

45As the authorities make clear, the ultimate question must always be whether this Court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury, properly directed, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. In my view it was. 

46I consider that this ground must also fail. 



Conclusion 

47It follows, in my opinion, that the appeal should be dismissed.

2758114,El-Jalkh v R [2011] NSWCCA 236,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J and his reasons. I also agree with the remarks of Latham J. 

2LATHAM J : I agree with Harrison J. I would only add that, notwithstanding the applicant's asserted medical condition and putting to one side the need to grant leave to correct the error conceded by the Crown, I would have refused leave in this case. The criminality inherent in a conspiracy to import 4.3 kg of pure MDMA, instigated by the applicant, was incapable of being adequately reflected in any sentence less than that imposed. The parity arguments advanced by the applicant fail to appreciate the fact that the co-offender Kellaway was sentenced by the same judge on a number of drug offences, of which the conspiracy to import was one. In addition, Kellaway was serving sentences for other unrelated offences, thus requiring the judge to consider the totality of that criminality in setting the head sentence and non-parole period for the conspiracy offence. In these circumstances, there is no utility in undertaking a direct comparison between the sentence of Kellaway and this applicant. 

3HARRISON J : Antoine El-Jalkh pleaded guilty on 17 December 2009 to one count of conspiracy to import not less than the commercial quantity of MDMA into Australia between about 1 August 2002 and 1 May 2003 contrary to the provisions of s 11.5(1) of the Schedule of the Criminal Code Act 1995 and s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 . The quantity of the drug involved was 4.3721kg of pure MDMA contained in 62,459 ecstasy tablets weighing 17.4 kgs. The maximum penalty for this offence was life imprisonment. Williams DCJ sentenced the applicant on 1 October 2010 to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months. 

4The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. He relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

Ground 1 : The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender Paul Kellaway. 

Ground 2 : Although his Honour took into account the medical condition of the applicant in determining the appropriate non-parole period, his Honour erred in failing to consider [it] when determining the appropriate overall term of imprisonment. 

Ground 3 : Evidence subsequent to the sentencing of the applicant has revealed that [his] medical condition has deteriorated to such an extent that the learned sentencing judge did not have a full appreciation of [his] condition. 

Ground 4 : His Honour's sentencing exercise [ sic , discretion] miscarried as a result of the prison authorities' failure to make medical treatment available to the applicant, as well as their consequent breach of duty to guard against any further deterioration of his medical condition. 

Ground 5 : His Honour erred by miscalculating the commencement date of the sentence in light of the time the applicant had already spent in custody. 

5The Crown concedes the error contemplated by Ground 5 and that the applicant is entitled to an adjustment of his sentence to correct it. 

Background 

6His Honour Williams DCJ originally sentenced the applicant on 16 February 2006 to a term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. He appealed against his conviction to this Court and on 25 June 2009 a new trial was ordered: El-Jalkh v R [2009] NSWCCA 139. When the matter came back before his Honour for the new trial, the applicant pleaded guilty. The sentence imposed by his Honour following that plea is the subject of this application. 

7The facts are relevantly set out in the judgment of James J in this Court at [6]-[28] as follows: 

""[6] In his remarks on sentence Judge Williams said that he was satisfied that the jury had found the appellant guilty on the basis of 'the following general facts', which his Honour then set out. I am satisfied that this statement of general facts by his Honour in his remarks on sentence was in accordance with what had been the Crown case at the trial. The following summary by me of the Crown case at the trial is based on his Honour's statement in his remarks on sentence and on parts of the evidence in chief of the principal Crown witness Carlos. 

[7] Carlos was born in Venezuela to Syrian parents and had been in Australia since 1981. 

[8] In 2002 Carlos was carrying on a business of importing in containers shoes and clothing, principally from Syria and Lebanon. He had a warehouse in a Sydney suburb. 

[9] Carlos first met the appellant in the year 2000 and from early 2002 both Carlos and the appellant, who was a hairdresser, carried on businesses in the same suburban shopping centre. They became friends. 

[10] Carlos [ sic , 'the appellant'] was friendly with Paul Kellaway and Scott McGee. 

[11] At some time in 2002, which was not precisely fixed by the evidence, the appellant had a conversation with Carlos in which the appellant asked Carlos 'how you getting all these stuff from overseas?' and Carlos replied 'I get them by container'. 

[12] On a subsequent occasion the appellant told Carlos 'look I can make you to make big money to bring, you know, if you help me to bring some stuff from overseas in Lebanon'. Carlos said to the appellant 'what, what do you mean?' and the appellant said 'I'm very well connected overseas and I'm very well connected here. I can put my hand, I can, if you know organise some drugs and cocaine and hash oil, oil-hash, in Lebanon. Can you put them in the container and you know we make big money and you not have to work hard and selling shoes and something like that'. 

[13] Carlos said that he would think about the appellant's proposal. He contacted a New South Wales police officer for whom he had been an informant and told him about the proposal. The police officer encouraged Carlos to obtain further information. 

[14] The appellant told Carlos about a conversation the appellant had had with Paul Kellaway, in which he told Kellaway that he could get drugs from overseas but did not have any money and 'Paul say ok, we can put in money in this'. Kellaway had said that he had a partner 'Scott' (McGee). 

[15] The appellant told Carlos in a subsequent conversation that the appellant had told Kellaway that the appellant had a quantity of 10 kgs of cocaine in a drum in Lebanon. 

[16] In a later conversation between the appellant and Carlos, Carlos told the appellant that he did not currently have any container coming from overseas. The appellant said that that would not be a problem. 'These people would pay the money to organise a container of shoes' and said that Carlos' job would be to go to Syria, organise the container and the shoes or other stock which would be loaded into the container and bring the container to Lebanon, where it would be stored and the drugs would be placed in it. Carlos reported this conversation to the New South Wales police officer. 

[17] There was an attempt by the New South Wales police to have police officers observe Kellaway handing money to Carlos but, although $50,000 in cash was handed over by Kellaway to Carlos, police were unable to be present. 

[18] Carlos became dissatisfied with the New South Wales police officer and approached the National Crime Authority, as the Australian Crime Commission was then called. In early November 2002 he came under the supervision of Detective Purchas and he remained under Detective Purchas' supervision. Purchas encouraged Carlos to involve himself in the proposed importation of drugs. Listening device and telephone intercept warrants were obtained by the Crime Authority. 

[19] A further amount of $200,000 was paid to Carlos for the purpose of the drug importation. 

[20] On 29 December 2002 Carlos left Australia and travelled to Lebanon and Syria. 

[21] On 3 February 2003 the appellant left Australia and travelled to Lebanon. On 15 February 2003 the appellant went to Syria, where he had a meeting with Carlos, and on the following day he returned to Lebanon. 

[22] It had been intended by the conspirators that the drug which would be imported would be cocaine. However, cocaine could not be obtained in Lebanon or Syria. There was a change of plan, so that the conspiracy became a conspiracy to import MDMA. 

[23] On 24 February 2003 the appellant flew to Holland and arrived in Amsterdam. 

[24] On the following day 25 February 2003 McGee left Australia and flew to England. McGee then flew to Holland. The appellant and McGee had a meeting in Holland at some time between 25 February and 28 February. 

[25] On 28 February 2003 the appellant left Amsterdam and he arrived in Australia on 5 March 2003. 

[26] McGee transported MDMA that had been obtained in Holland to Italy for the purpose of bringing it to Australia. McGee was arrested in Italy on 21 March 2003. The appellant and Kellaway did not become aware that McGee had been arrested until 7 April 2003, although, of course, they were aware that there had been no communication between them and McGee since 21 March. 

[27] On 25 March 2003 a conversation occurred between Kellaway and the appellant at Kellaway's apartment, the recording of which was referred to at the trial as LD 123. 

[28] Kellaway was arrested in early May 2003..."" 

8The learned sentencing judge referred to the following matters, among others, in his remarks on sentence: 

""Mr Eljalkh has no previous criminal history. 

***** 

Since the initial trial and sentence, I have sentenced the co-offender Kellaway and am now privy to facts as to his background and offending which, in retrospect, would have to be regarded as substantially worse than Mr Eljalkh's. The point is made by Mr Lange, who now appears for Mr Eljalkh, that Kellaway offended whilst on bail for similar matters, was a former Customs officer and so had inside knowledge of how that organisation worked, and had previous criminal convictions. Indeed, as I stated in sentencing Mr Kellaway, [he] had been in the business of making money out of drug supply since 1996. 

Having regard to Mr Kellaway's situation, whilst I still regard Mr Eljalkh as a principal in the conspiracy, I have no doubt that the moving force was primarily Kellaway, and to a lesser extent McGee. Nonetheless, Mr Eljalkh was prepared to go to considerable lengths to effect the importation, by travelling to Lebanon and Europe so that it could not be said that he was a mere conduit or facilitator. It is, however, of some concern that as recently as 16 April 2010, Mr Eljalkh was continuing to minimise his part in the offending, as appears in this passage from the Probation and Parole report. 'He alleged that his only involvement was in introducing the parties, who he met through his business and at nightclubs. He maintains that he has never had anything to do with financing, sourcing or distributing drugs, and he believed that he was to take part in the importation of shoes. Alternatively, he was brokering an arms deal between Syria and China'. 

The offender admitted culpability for introducing his co-offenders, and expressed regret that he did not report the matter to police when he realised that they were involved in drug importation. He stated that he was very remorseful for performing the introductions. 

My remarks on sentence as to the seriousness of the offending still stand. Mr Eljalkh has served three years and ten months of a seven and a half year non-parole period imposed in the original sentence. I am satisfied that there are a number of factors that need to be taken into account in redetermining an appropriate sentence at this point in time. The first is the now plea of guilty which has had the effect of saving the community the considerable cost of retrial, as well as evincing a willingness on his part to facilitate the administration of justice. Second, is the information and sentence available in regard to the co-offender, Kellaway, as far as the question of parity is concerned. The third is the change in Mr Eljalkh's medical condition, and the fourth is the issue of delay, which has been attributable both to problems associated with my availability, and cannot be sheeted home to Mr Eljalkh. 

***** 

There is also a concern as to the parity of sentence between Mr Eljalkh and Mr Kellaway, although it needs to be remembered that the question of totality had to be considered in Mr Kellaway's case in determining the overall penalty that he should serve. However, I would concede that there are a number of factors that make Mr Kellaway's offending of a more serious kind than Mr Eljalkh's, despite Mr Kellaway's plea of guilty, which was quite late and resulted in a ten percent discount sentence. 

The first factor is Mr Kellaway's previous record of drug offences. The second factor is the fact that Mr Kellaway offended whilst on bail for similar offences. The third is that Mr Eljalkh, although a principal, was not the driving force behind the conspiracy and was a person of prior good character, inasmuch as that can be taken into account in serious drug offences. 

***** 

I am not persuaded that the sentence I initially imposed in this matter is outside the appropriate range. However, having regard to the matters that I have referred to, I am going to impose a slightly different sentence."" 

9It is in the context of these events and his Honour's remarks on sentence that the applicant's contentious grounds of appeal have to be considered. 

Ground 1 

10In his submissions in this Court, counsel for the applicant emphasised the similarity between the head sentences of the applicant and Mr Kellaway, whilst simultaneously appearing to avoid the importance of the dissimilarity between their corresponding non-parole periods. This is unsurprising. Mr Kellaway was sentenced by his Honour to a term of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months His Honour said that Mr Kellaway was ""clearly the principal offender and had been a Customs officer and involved in drugs and prostitution over a long time"". He also offended whilst on bail. He had criminal convictions and ""had been in the business of making money out of drug supply since 1996"". His Honour characterised Mr Kellaway as ""the moving force"" in the conspiracy. 

11His Honour described the applicant ""as a principal in the conspiracy"". He sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months. Whereas there is only 6 months difference in the head sentences, there is a difference of 18 months in the respective non-parole periods. Notwithstanding the submissions of counsel for the applicant to the contrary, I consider that to be a significant difference. It more than adequately takes account of the differences in the roles played by the applicant on the one hand and Mr Kellaway on the other hand. Having characterised the applicant as a principal in the conspiracy, a matter that was not put in issue, there was necessarily a limit upon the extent to which his Honour could legitimately differentiate between sentences imposed on these co-offenders without doing a disservice to that description. This is not a case where the applicant was no more than a courier or someone who provided a postal address for the delivery of goods. The applicant travelled overseas for the purposes of actively promoting and facilitating the criminal purposes of the conspiracy. 

12His Honour not only did not fail to advert to the principles of parity applying to the imposition of like offenders, he specifically referred to them in the sentencing exercise. His Honour was indeed uniquely placed to understand and appreciate the interwoven and independent roles of the applicant and Mr Kellaway. Curiously his Honour had, in the events that occurred, a second opportunity to sentence the applicant. I can find no basis for concluding that his Honour infringed any of the well known principles emanating from cases such as Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 or Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 to which the applicant refers. The applicant's strong subjective factors, including his medical condition and the absence of any prior criminal history, do not to my mind indicate that any different sentence is called for in this case. 

13I do not consider that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance, having regard to the sentence imposed upon Mr Kellaway. In my opinion, this ground is not made out. 

Ground 2 

14One of the applicant's strong subjective factors was his medical condition. His Honour referred to this in some detail in his remarks on sentence. This is what he said: 

""Further evidence has been provided as to Mr Eljalkh's medical condition, about which he has also given evidence. He recently underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate... to relieve obstruction to his lower urinary tract. According to a report of Dr Bajpe of 16 September 2010, he also suffers from major depression. 

Dr Bajpe is a medical practitioner with some qualifications in psychology. Mr Eljalkh suffered from prostate cancer that is reasonably controlled, but which results in ongoing urinary tract blockages. Whilst we are told that the modern reality of our prison system is capable of overcoming any difficulty, the evidence coming out of this court, via persons who have been incarcerated, is substantially different to the gloss that the Department of Corrective Services would like everyone to accept. The fact is that whilst there is a medical service within the prison system, it does not function in the same way as the system does within the community; delay is endemic, and not assisted by prisoners being transferred to different facilities, often with little or no warning. Non-urgent matters receive virtually no priority. Mr Elkaljh's illness falls into this category, and I have no doubt that it will be difficult, if he should require urgent assistance in prison. See Dr Aslan's report of 17 September 2010. 

In addition, Mr Eljalkh also suffers from stomach ulcers and a hernia. I accept what Dr Chen, radiation oncologist, said of Mr Eljalkh on 7 September 2010, that it would be more difficult for Mr Eljalkh, if he remained in custody, to access medical care and treatment for his prostate cancer, and the multiple urinary tract conditions, because his symptoms may come on suddenly and he needs frequent specialist follow-ups. Treatment in custody would potentially be inferior, due to delay which could impact on the future outcome of his medical condition. 

I have also been supplied, this morning, with a more recent report from Dr Aslan, who performed a further TURP recently. The report...in part, says: 

'However, he has had quite blocked bladder outlet obstruction in the past which has resulted in large bladder diverticula. These are pouches coming from the back of the bladder. When I examined him last week there was a lot of redness in one of them and I went ahead and biopsied it. It showed foreign squamous metaplasia, which is a precancerous condition of the bladder, which can result in quite nasty bladder cancer. I think over the next three months or so that we should book him in to have an operation and resection of his bladder diverticula, which is going to require about a ten-day admission to hospital.' 

For this or any other court to ignore the realities of imprisonment in New South Wales by passing the responsibility off to the deeply flawed public service bureaucracy, whose principal task is to keep persons in confinement, at the least cost possible, is, in my view, irresponsible and contrary to the principles the court is required to take into account in sending an individual to prison. Mr Eljalkh has ongoing physical problems akin to, but not as serious as, those mentioned in Miranda [2002] NSWCCA 89, such that this is another factor to be considered on the question of the effect of imprisonment being more onerous for him than for other, healthy inmates."" 

15The applicant made the following submission in support of this ground: 

""Thus, it seems highly probable that the medical condition did carry some weight in the determination of the appropriate non-parole period, but curiously, by comparison [with Mr Kellaway], very little weight, if indeed any at all, in the determination of the head sentence. By definition, any variance in the non-parole period must have an even greater impact on the head sentence, since the non-parole period must bear a proportionate relationship to the head sentence. By limiting the consideration of the applicant's medical condition to a fixing of the non-parole period, his Honour fell into error, see Withers v R [2009] NSWCCA 133 at [37] per Hulme J: 

'[37] The Court was not referred to any authority that indicated that the mental illness of an offender, relevant in the way it is in this case, should be confined to the assessment of the non-parole period. Indeed, there is authority to the contrary that in an appropriate case it may be relevant to the assessment of the total sentence as well as the non-parole period: see the discussion in the judgments of Grove J in Regina v Szabo [2003] NSWCCA 341 at [14]-[16] and of Hulme J in Fisher v R [2008] NSWCCA 103 at [38]-[39].' "" 

16The applicant contended that a comparison between his Honour's relevant remarks on sentence and authorities such as Withers v R [2009] NSWCCA 133 demonstrated that his Honour erred in failing to give any weight, or sufficient weight, to the applicant's medical condition when determining the appropriate head sentence. I am unable to agree. It seems to me that if his Honour was concerned in any way at all to take into account the particular subjective considerations at play in the applicant's case, his particular indifferent medical condition was paramount among them. It is once again significant that the applicant makes no challenge to the non-parole period, understandably preferring instead to concentrate upon the head sentence, of which the non-parole period forms only 52.5 percent. 

17The particular passages from R v Szabo [2003] NSWCCA 431 and Fisher v R [2008] NSWCCA 103 referred to by Hulme J in Withers bear scrutiny here. The passages from Szabo are as follows: 

""[14] At the hearing the court raised the possibility of there being an error of principle discernible in a failure by the sentencing judge to take into account the medical condition of the respondent in setting the whole length of sentence rather than in simply focusing upon the non-parole period. That the respondent's medical condition is relevant to the length of sentence is well-established law. See R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR at 351. That is not to say of course that it has not often been said that such a condition is relevant to the setting of a non-parole period. We were referred to R v Sellen (1991) 57 A Crim R 313. The relevant passage is at 318 which indicates that it was the view of the court, 

'If it is shown that imprisonment will cause particular hardship (either because of a pre-existing physical or mental disability of the prisoner or because of the circumstances in which the prisoner must be kept for protection) this is a circumstance to be taken into account in determining the duration of imprisonment.' 

Their Honours then referred to a number of authorities. 

[15] Duration of imprisonment would be taken to be a reference to length of sentence. Their Honours later said at (page 320) when proceeding to re-sentence in the particular case that it was their view that the prisoner then before them had established poor health and that this constituted special circumstances within s5(2) of the Sentencing Act as it then applied. 

[16] As I have said, there is ample authority that the condition of health of a prisoner can be relevant to the setting of a non-parole period. The remarks of Brennan and Dawson JJ in R v Griffith (1989) 167 CLR 372 where their Honours gave an offender's health as an example of something that can be taken into account in setting a non-parole period was recited with approval by Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson [2001] 53 NSWLR 704 at page 713."" 

18The passages from Fisher are as follows: 

""[38] I have quoted from his Honour's judgment a passage that makes it clear that he recognised that the Applicant had serious health issues and took those into account in making a finding of special circumstances. It was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that the Applicant's condition and recognition his Honour expressly gave to the fact that treatment in prison might not be of the same standard as is available in the community, that the Applicant's condition meant that he would be in protective custody, and his imprisonment more onerous than for the average prisoner should also have been taken into account in the determination of the head sentence. In this connection reference was made to remarks made in R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 at 353; McDonald (1988) A Crim R 470; Hameed (2001) 123 A Crim R 213 at [58] and R v Baraket [2004] NSWCCA 201 at [30], [31] and [33]. 

[39] I agree with the submission. However, it is clear that his Honour did take these matters into account. When he was directing attention to the Applicant's subjective factors, and before he came to deal with the topic of special circumstances, his Honour specifically addressed the Applicant's health and the specific factors mentioned above. There is just no basis for the conclusion that his Honour failed to consider the Applicant's medical condition in determining the appropriate head sentence. This ground fails."" 

19This is also a case in which his Honour directed his attention to the applicant's medical condition. He did so in considerable detail and in association with remarks that could only be interpreted as sympathetic to the applicant. A submission that his Honour gave insufficient weight to a matter, such as a medical condition, suffers from the problem that it requires the proponent of the submission to identify one or other of the factors emphasised in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. There is no suggestion in this case, for example, that the learned sentencing judge acted upon a wrong principle, was guided or affected by extraneous matters, was mistaken about the facts or failed to take account of some material consideration. No errors of this kind are specifically identified. Having regard to his Honour's remarks on sentence, this is unsurprising. I am not satisfied that any such errors exist. 

20This ground of appeal fails. 

Ground 3 

21Ground 3 is infelicitously expressed but distils to the proposition that the applicant's medical condition has deteriorated in a way that was not capable of being appreciated when the sentence was passed and so as to warrant the imposition of a lesser sentence now. The applicant made the following submissions. 

22First, although the jurisdiction of this Court is narrowly confined to remedying errors of law, it may nevertheless, in certain circumstances, take into account events that occurred after the imposition of the sentence under challenge. The circumstances were recently summarised by this Court in Anderson v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 130; (2010) 202 A Crim R 68 at [46]-[48]. The applicant submitted that evidence of the deterioration of his medical condition, as well as his inability to obtain the necessary medical treatment in custody, were matters that may properly be taken into account as ""fresh evidence"" on appeal. The applicant now suffers from increased urinary incontinence and considerable pain. These are matters that the applicant contended would, if then known, have had a considerable impact upon his Honour's sentencing discretion. 

23His Honour noted that the applicant suffered from prostate cancer that was reasonably controlled but which resulted in ongoing urinary tract blockages. The applicant's affidavit sworn 11 October 2011 annexes the medical report of Dr Aslan dated 30 September 2010 to which his Honour referred. The applicant says that he has ""constant pain in [his] lower stomach when crouching"" and ""bad urine flow and leaking which is associated with [his] prostate condition"". He also deposes to his considerable efforts to secure appropriate and timely medical care and attention. Extraordinarily, none of his efforts has yielded the slightest success. That includes the fact that he has not yet had the operation on his pre-cancerous bladder condition to which Dr Aslan's report refers. 

24Unfortunately, the applicant's current medical condition is not different to what was foreshadowed at the time of his sentence. Indeed, the prospect of deterioration and the need for treatment to ameliorate the applicant's condition and its symptoms were implicitly contemplated by his Honour's remarks. The prospect of an operation to deal with his condition was very much in the contemplation of the learned sentencing judge. The manifestation of the applicant's current plight does not mean that with hindsight a different sentence is now warranted. I am not satisfied that the effect of the post-sentence events is such as to underline something that was not fully appreciated at the time of the sentencing in the sense discussed in R v BEG [2001] NSWCCA 341 at [26] and R v Keir [2004] NSWCCA 106 at [78]. It has not been difficult or practically impossible to manage the applicant's medical condition adequately in gaol. The simple and unfortunate fact is that it just has not happened, in the rather prescient way discussed by his Honour at the time of sentencing. That is a matter for consideration under Ground 4. 

25This ground is not made out. 

Ground 4 

26The applicant was sentenced over a year ago. His precancerous condition should have alerted the prison authorities to his need for urgent intervention. The fact that the applicant was unlikely to receive proper or adequate treatment, or medical care and attention, was specifically considered by his Honour. Both sides in this Court have referred to the oft cited passage from R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 at 353-354 in these terms: 

""...as an Appeal Court, it is not its function, nor is it equipped, to fulfil a continuing supervisory role over the effect of imprisonment upon an individual. Such a matter involves essentially administrative considerations and remedial action involves essentially an exercise of administrative power that this Court does not possess. This Court exercises judicial power; it has no power or authority to give administrative directions regarding the treatment of prisoners. Nor has it power or authority by administrative order to change the character or concomitants of sentences or to bring about total or qualified release of persons in custody. That power and authority resides in the hands of the Executive Government."" 


27Comments to a like effect were made by Street CJ in R v Munday (1981) 2 NSWLR 177 at 178 in the terms: 

""It has been made plain in this Court on many occasions that the Court is essentially charged with an appellate function involving the determination of whether a decision at first instance upon sentence was right or wrong, was excessive or inadequate, as things existed at the time when it was passed. The review of a sentence in the light of subsequent events is the proper province of the executive Government and not of an appeal court. It would seem to me, therefore, that, as the essential first step in the argument Mr Purnell foreshadows on the merits would involve this Court trespassing into the function of the executive Government, the case is not one in which there should be granted the very lengthy extension of time which is the prerequisite to the hearing of the challenge to the sentences."" 

28The applicant submitted that his Honour felt unable to take into consideration the likelihood, or more particularly the unlikelihood, that the applicant would be treated in custody, minimising any deterioration in his condition. He further submitted that it was now entirely proper for this Court to consider the fact that he has not received the required medical attention. The applicant contended that to the extent that Vachalec stood in the way of such a submission, it and cases like it no longer represented good law in New South Wales. 

29It can be accepted that the Department of Corrective Services owes a duty of care to inmates in its custody. That was so at common law (see generally New South Wales v Bujdoso [2005] HCA 76; (2005) 227 CLR 1) and is also recognised in the terms of s 72A of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 . The applicant contends that there has been a failure by the Department to comply with the duty and this statutory provision. He points to what is revealed in his affidavit. The relevant portions are as follows: 

""2. On 1 October 2010, I was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and entered custody on that day. 

3. The first opportunity I was afforded to speak with a doctor after having entered custody was at the Silverwater Correctional Centre on 4 October 2010. On that day, I provided the doctor with a letter from Dr Aslan dated 30 September 2010. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter 'A' is a true copy of that letter. 

4. This doctor at the Silverwater Correctional Centre took a copy of the letter and put it in my file. 

5. On 8 October 2010 I was moved to the Dawn DeLoas Correctional Centre, where I was seen by a nurse. This nurse also took a copy of the letter from Dr Aslan and took some notes in relation to my general health. 

6. On 9 October 2010 I saw a doctor and a copy of Dr Aslan's letter was taken and put in my file. This doctor informed me that she would be conducting the required tests. 

7. I was moved from the Dawn DeLoas Correctional Centre on 12 November 2010 to the Long Bay Correctional Centre before any tests were performed. 

8. On 15 November 2010 I saw a doctor at the Long Bay Correctional Centre, and she also took a copy of Dr Aslan's letter dated 30 September 2010 and put it in my file. 

9. That doctor informed me that she would book me in to see a specialist at the Prince of Wales Hospital. She told me this could take up to three months. 

10. During the consultation with the doctor at Long Bay Correctional Centre on 15 November 2010 I told the doctor about my bladder, prostate and hernia conditions. 

11. I visited the same doctor sometime in December 2010 to enquire about patches to stop smoking. During this visit I enquired about my appointment at the Prince of Wales Hospital, and was informed that I was on a waiting list. 

12. I have also spoken to my case officer, Mr Bob Tracy, and shown him the letter from Dr Aslan. 

13. In early February 2011 I was assigned a new case officer, named Sam. I do not know his last name. Sam told me that he spoke to the clinic and then said words to the effect 'it is all by turn, no one is more important than anyone else'. 

14. On 19 April 2011, I requested to see a doctor and was told that there would be no doctor for two weeks. 

15. My condition is getting worse, and I have constant pain in my lower stomach when crouching, Furthermore, I have bad urine flow and leaking which is associated with my prostate condition. 

16. Around the end of May, I saw two nurses at the Long Bay Correctional Centre; these nurses were from the Silverwater Correctional Centre, and I showed them the letter from Dr Aslan. They said that they would organise for me to see my specialist, Dr Aslan, within two months. 

17. Also around this time I was told that Dr Aslan had booked a bed for me at St George Hospital to have my bladder operation. I know this because St George Hospital called Dr Bajpe, my family GP, sometime in late June 2011 to confirm that a bed will be available for me to have my bladder operation in July 2011. Dr Bajpe contacted my son David Jalkh. He in turn called me, and told me that I needed to confirm that I would be attending the St George Hospital. I told my son that the prison would have to confirm that. 

18. I work at the Long Bay Cafe, and four or five days after speaking with my son, David, a nurse whose name was Bloss said that she had some paperwork for me to sign. She said that it had something to do with Dr Aslan but nothing else. She said she would bring the papers for me to sign. 

19. I never received that paperwork. I have never seen Dr Aslan, and I have never been to the St George Hospital. 

20. About five weeks ago, I approached that same nurse whilst working at Long Bay Cafe and asked her what had happened to the papers and if there was anything for me to sign. I also asked her if there were any dates for me to attend the St George Hospital or to visit Dr Aslan. She said that she would get back to me in a couple of days. 

21. Two days later at the cafe she said there was nothing booked in for me. I asked if there were any papers to sign, and she said that she would have to check. To date I have not heard anything back from this nurse or anyone else. 

22. On 10 August 2011, I attended the Prince of Wales Hospital. The doctor only spoke to me in the waiting room. I asked him if he had seen the letter from Dr Aslan dated 30 September 2010, and he said that he had not. He said that he only had notes from the prison doctor. I told him that I believed that I was going to see my specialist, Dr Aslan, within the next week or two as that is what I had been told. The doctor said that it would be best to wait and see Dr Aslan. I saw the doctor at Prince of Wales for a maximum of four minutes. 

23. I am still waiting to see Dr Aslan or to have any tests or treatment."" 

30The material in that affidavit was tendered by the applicant to be read both in circumstances where this Court was minded to resentence and as fresh evidence that could be taken into account as previously discussed. The Crown objected to this material and did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the applicant upon his affidavit. There is no basis therefore to assume the accuracy of the matters to which the applicant has deposed. 

31However, whilst I am not persuaded that this is a case in which it is appropriate to divert from the approach outlined in Vachalec , I am considerably troubled by the unsatisfactory attention that appears to have been paid by the prison authorities to the applicant's medical problems, upon the assumption that the matters deposed to by the applicant are true. This is particularly so when regard is had to the fact that the learned sentencing judge went into unambiguous detail about what he feared might occur, presumably unless comments of the sort that he made were published at length. If the way in which the applicant contends his medical affairs have been responded to in gaol are an accurate guide, his Honour's comments would appear to have fallen on deaf ears. 

32In Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Refrigerated Roadways Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 263; (2009) 77 NSWLR 360 at [265], Campbell JA commented that ""[i]t would ignore reality for a court to proceed upon the basis that a statutory authority should be taken to have sufficient resources to carry out all its statutory duties, powers and discretions"". In the present case there is nothing to suggest that the treatment, or lack of it, received by the applicant, had anything to do with the unavailability of resources. It is also unknown whether or not it is the result of flaws in the bureaucracy to which his Honour specifically adverted. Whatever may be the true position regarding the applicant's assertions, it is apparent that the applicant suffers from a potentially very serious and treatable condition, which on one view may for all practical intents and purposes have been effectively ignored by those with the responsibility for his care. The consequences, if any, flowing from that remain to be seen. 

33I would endorse the learned sentencing judge's comments. It is trite to observe that offenders are sent to gaol as punishment, not for punishment. In the present case, that translates to an expectation that the applicant would be properly and adequately cared for and that his particular medical condition would be attended to in accordance with prevailing medical and therapeutic standards applying generally in the community. On one view of the evidence available to this Court, that would not appear to have occurred. The matter certainly calls for some attention. 

34I am not satisfied that that apparent failure results in a conclusion that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried. Indeed, it was with a degree of patent frustration that his Honour imposed the sentence that he did in the expectation, almost approaching certainty, that his criticisms of the Department would not generate any action benefiting the applicant. He obviously took these matters into account when passing sentence. 

35I do not consider that his Honour fell into error in approaching the matter in the way that he did. 

Conclusion 

36It follows from the error identified in Ground 5 that the appeal should be allowed and that the applicant should be resentenced. I consider that the following orders should be made: 

1. Grant leave to appeal. 

2. Allow the appeal. 

3. Quash the sentence imposed upon the applicant by Williams DCJ on 1 October 2010 and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 10 years commencing on 24 November 2006 and expiring on 23 November 2016 with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months commencing on 24 November 2006 and expiring on 23 February 2012.

     Remarks on Sentence 
    1. The offender is charged with Publishing a False Statement for a Financial Advantage. The Prosecution is brought pursuant to Section 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is 5 years imprisonment. The value of the financial advantage tainted by the offender’s conduct is $955,620. As the value of the advantage is in excess of $5,000.00 the offence falls within Table 1 of Section 267 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The maximum jurisdictional penalty that may be imposed in the Local Court is 2 years imprisonment. 2. In proceeding to sentence and identifying the objective seriousness of the offence the Local Court is not constrained by the jurisdictional limitation. In line with the principles set out in R –v- Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 the sentencing court is to have regard to the legislated maximum penalty. It is only after so doing and having turned its mind to the appropriate penalty that reference need be made to the jurisdictional limit.  
     
     THE FACTS 
    3. The agreed facts in this matter are extensive. The historical narrative arises out of an extensive investigation by the Independent Commission against Corruption into tendering within Railcorp. Despite the lengthy history the Crown relies only on one act of dishonesty in relation to the conduct of the offender. This relates to a statement made in the course of submitting a tender for air conditioning work and maintenance. Succinctly re-cast the offender, knew that a person called Said Marcos was a member of the Tender Evaluation Committee of Railcorp. He also knew that Marcos was a Director of companies styled B&S Mechanical Services and Isis Australia Pty Ltd. The offender had a commercial arrangement with these entities and a history of sub-contracting work to them under a previously awarded contract.4. In 2002 the offender submitted a tender for further work. . The tender price was $955,620. In the course of tendering he asserted that no other sub contractor would be employed. At the time he knew this was untrue. He also knew by virtue of the conditions of tender that Section B 15 required him to provide details of any sub-contractor and Section C 11.1 prohibited the use of a sub-contractor without permission. On 11th November 2002 the company of which the offender is a director was awarded the contract by Railcorp. The person Said Marcos was part of the Tender Evaluation Committee that awarded the tender. Once the investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption reached a certain stage another member of the Marcos family approached the offender to seek his assistance in fabricating false invoices for the purpose of misleading the investigation. To his credit, on the agreed facts, the offender refused. Paragraph 55 of the agreed facts states “At no time did Tony Mourched seek to mislead the ICAC or give evidence to assist Marcos’”.5. The agreed statement of facts are silent on whether the initial relationship between Said Marcos and the offender was the product of the offender’s proposal to Marcos or an approach by Marcos to the offender. Irrespective of the formative aspects of the relationship it is clear from the facts that it existed for the purpose of financial gain. 
     
     THE PLEA 
    6. The Independent Commission Against Corruption brought proceedings against the offender on 24th March 2009. The Director of Public Prosecutions represents the Commission and the matter first came before the Court on 21st April 2009. On that date the Court made orders for service of a brief of evidence. A number of subsequent adjournments took place during which time, so the Court record suggests a combination of representations and negotiations were taking place between the offender and the prosecutor. 7. On 1st December 2009 the offender entered a plea of guilty. Given the objective seriousness of the offence the Court ordered the preparation of a Pre Sentence Report by the Probation and Parole Service. That report is attached to the Court papers. Certain aspects of the report were challenged before me. I indicated that the issue taken was not ultimately relevant to the resolution of the proceedings.8. Counsel for the offender prepared written submissions to assist the Court. They are attached to the Court papers. I intend to firstly deal with the submission set out on page 5 at (f) namely that the plea was entered at the earliest opportunity. Considerations relevant to a plea of guilty are set out in Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1989 and in the Guideline Judgment of R –v- Thomson & Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The Guideline was revisited more recently in R –v- Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 wherein Howie J. drew together the various authorities since the Guideline Judgment to re-state relevant principles applicable in assessing the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. Considered against the context of both the Guideline Judgment and R –v- Borkowski the Court cannot agree with the submission by counsel for the offender that the plea in this matter was entered at the earliest opportunity such that it might attract consideration of a discount towards the upper end of the range between 10-25%.9. The plea of guilty was not entered until some 8 months after the proceedings were commenced, and after the prosecution was put to the requirement of preparing and serving what the court record of 30th June 2009 describes as “a significant brief”. It is also clear from an examination of the Court record that there was a degree of negotiation between the offender and the prosecution during that time. Principles 8 and 9 of the “Principles of General Application” set out in Borkowski make it clear that a choice by an offender to engage in delay in the entry of a plea for reasons unconnected with his ultimate guilt will result in a reduction in the discount. Paragraphs 13-29 of the statement of agreed facts provide an insight of what may have been the subject of “negotiations” during the lengthy periods of adjournment. What is set out in those parts of the statement of facts is not directly relevant to sentence on this matter but they are nonetheless, explanatory.10. In my view the utilitarian value of the plea is measured at 15%. The offender; above all others knew of his guilt. It was apparent from the time he signed the document containing the false and dishonest representation. Whether it is on the basis of legal advice or otherwise he cannot have it both ways. By creating a situation of delay he is not in my view then entitled to claim that his plea of guilty is entered at the earliest opportunity when the administration of justice is delayed and the prosecution is put to the task of preparing a brief of evidence. 
     
     AGGRAVATING FACTORS 
    11. In his written submissions on behalf of the offender counsel conceded that four of the factors set out in Section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being aggravating factors in the commission of an offence were relevant to the facts in this matter. I agree with the concession. 12. It is clear from the relationship between the offender and Said Marcos that they were operating collusively. The modus operandi of their agreement was to use Marcos’ position on the Tender Evaluation Committee to skew consideration of tenders towards the offender’s company. There was a mutuality of agreement that a financial benefit would then flow to Said Marcos as payment for his corrupt influence.  13. Accordingly I agree that the offender’s conduct was, for the purpose of Section 21A(2)(n) a planned or organised criminal activity. The relationship between the offender and Said Marcos, the agreement to provide what is commonly described as a “kick back” financial benefit through the use of companies with whom Marcos had a direct and beneficial financial relationship came about through agreement and planning by both parties as to the way in which a tender was to be structured and the manner in which the product of the successful tender was to be shared.14. I also accept the concession by counsel for the offender that the offender was in a position of trust relative to Railcorp. The requirements in Clause B 15 and C 11.1 for honest disclosure carry with them an implicit understanding that the evaluation of the offender’s tender was dependent on the truthfulness of the answers. It is reasonable to accept his assertions were to be taken at face value and trusted for their reliability. 15. Given the value of the tender awarded to the offender, viz., $955,620 and accepting that this sum contained an element of profit for the offender [and for Marcos] it is clearly the case that the offence was committed for financial gain. This is also a circumstance of aggravation. 
     
     MITIGATING FACTORS 
    16. Section 21A (3) of the Act identifies a number of matters that may be taken into account in mitigation of the prospective penalty. The statutory considerations are well known within the criminal justice process and are part of the balancing process of competing considerations necessary to arrive at what it believes to be a sentence appropriate to the offence and the offender. 17. The offender comes before this Court as a person with no prior convictions Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 Section 21A(3)(e). References tendered on his behalf establish, conduct the subject of this offence to one side that he was hitherto a person of good character Ibid Section 21A(3)(f). 18. It is said the offender is unlikely to re-offend. At 48 years of age and with no prior convictions this is a reasonable inference that may be drawn in his favour Ibid Section 21A(3)(g). I accept the submission that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. Similarly I am satisfied, given the manner in which he refused to assist Said Marcos attempt to evade detection and what I am told was his frank evidence before ICAC that he has provided evidence of remorse and contrition ibid Section 21A(3)(I). 19. I have already dealt with the plea of guilty. Referring to it again in the context of the Act would constitute an element of double counting.20. Counsel further submits that Section 21A(3)(l) and (m) apply to further mitigate the penalty. Dealing firstly with Section 21A(3)(l) I reject the submission that it is relevant to these proceedings. The provision refers specifically to pre-trial disclosure “as provided by Section 22A”. Section 22A is limited in its application to sentences imposed on an offender who was “tried on indictment”. The Local Court is a court of summary jurisdiction. Section 22A is only relevant in matters dealt with before the Supreme or District Courts.21. Turning to Section 21A(3)(m) the application of this provision in mitigation is to be considered in the context of Section 23 of the Act. Whether a Court decides to impose a lesser penalty as a consequence of assistance is discretionary. It is also subject to taking into account, where applicable, the criteria set out in Section 23(2). Putting to one side for the moment the reasonable expectation on the part of the ICAC and society in general that the offender would be truthful in his answers to questions regarding his conduct and the related conduct of others as a matter of course there is nothing persuasive before me or within paragraphs 42-54 of the statement of facts that is sufficiently convincing that the contribution by the offender in assisting law enforcement authorities is of such weight that it justifies an additional level of discount or mitigation of penalty on this basis.22. In R –v- Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at [252] the Court said, inter alia:“The information which he gives must be such as could significantly assist authorities”. A consideration of the agreed statement of facts persuades me that the authorities already knew the truth of the relationship between the offender and Said Marcos and that an examination of the invoices tendered by B&S Mechanical Services and/or Isis Australia Pty Ltd. Together with the corporate records of either or both those companies would readily disclose that Said Marcos was the registered proprietor of one and a Director of the other. Against that background the truthfulness of the offender can hardly be said to be an exercise in the provision of “significant assistance to authorities”. 
     
     SUBJECTIVE FEATURES 
    23. The offender is a 48-year-old married man with 2 children. He has tertiary qualifications in Engineering and is the principal in the company involved in the tendering process that brings him before this Court. References tendered to the court both on a personal and professional level suggest he is well regarded within the community. He appears to be successful in his business. Given the enormity of the sum involved in the contract the subject of the charge and the sums involved as described in the past history of his relationship with Said Marcos it may well be argued that part of that success can be attributed to a mutuality of reward to both he and Marcos arising out of biased success in the tendering process. 
     
     
     THE SENTENCE 
      
      
    24. Counsel for the offender contends that the appropriate sentence in relation to the offender’s conduct and after taking his subjective circumstances into account is for the dismissal of the charge pursuant to Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Paragraph 23 of his written submissions encapsulate the tenor of his submission. 25. The basis of the submission is that the work performed by the offender’s company was of a sufficiently high standard that no loss accrued to Railcorp. Counsel also tendered a letter dated 20th October 2006 from the Project Engineer, Major Projects Division of Railcorp to the offender’s company inviting it to submit an offer for further work as indicating that in the eyes of that organisation the regard for the capabilities of the offender’s company is such that it has taken no action to prohibit it from ongoing participation in the tender processes with Railcorp.26. In support of his submissions Counsel refers the Court to the decisions of R –v-Ingrassia 41 NSWLR 447 and Thornloe –v- Filipowski 52 NSWLR 60 as authorities to which the Court may turn to assist it in coming to the conclusion that such a sentence is both possible and in the context of this matter, appropriate. Since making those submissions Counsel has also provided two further decisions to bolster his submission. These are decisions of the Queensland Court of Appeal – Dodd –v- R [2010] QCA 31 and R –v- Seiler [2003] QCA 217.27. Dealing firstly with the decisions of the Queensland Court of Appeal I am of the view they contain no statements of principle, rather they represent the substitution of the exercise of one Court’s discretion on sentence for that of another, albeit in an appellate context. Additionally the relevant provision of the legislation under which the court in both instances exercised its discretion – Section 12 or the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 QLD is expressed in different terms to that contained within Section 10(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Inasmuch as they represent statements of legislative authority the differences are important. 28. The focus in the relevant Queensland provision is on the impact of a conviction on the offender. For the sake of clarity the provisions in question are expressed as follows: 
     
     “12 (2) In considering whether or not to record a conviction a court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including – 
    (a) the nature of the offence and(b) the offender’s character and age, and(c) the impact that recording a conviction will have on the offenders (i) economic or social wellbeing; or(ii) chances of finding employment 29. Section 10(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is materially different. A court considering the exercise of its discretion is required to consider: 
     
     “10(3)  
    (a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition(b) the trivial nature of the offence(c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed(d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider30. Although the decision of Thornloe –v- Filipowski contains, particularly at [151]-[154] statements of principle reinforcing the observations made in earlier cases that decision was one in which the offence was one of absolute liability and in relation to which the offender had made little or no personal contribution in terms of conduct. It ought be distinguished from the circumstances under consideration in this matter.31. Counsel also referred the Court to the decision of R –v- Ingrassia (supra) as authority for the proposition that the exercise of discretion not to record a conviction is one ultimately to be exercised by the Court. In particular counsel referred to the observations of Gleeson C.J. at 449 [E] wherein he said: 
     
      
      “ 
      The essence of S.556A is that it empowers a court which considers that a charge has been proven in certain circumstances to take certain steps “without proceeding to conviction”. The legal and social consequences of being convicted of an offence often extend beyond any penalty imposed by a Court. As Windeyer J. said in  
      Cobiac –v- Liddy (1969) 119 CLR 257 
       at  
      269 “ 
       a capacity in special circumstances to avoid the rigidity of inexorable law is of the very essence of justice.”  
      
    32. When considering this passage it is important not to lose sight of the deliberate use of the words “special circumstances”33. It is also important to re-state the observations of the Court at [G] 
     
      
      “Whilst subs (1A) confers upon the court a wide discretion, the discretion is a judicial discretion, to be exercised consistently with the scheme and purpose of the section as a whole.”  
      
    34. It is important not to lose sight of the deliberate use of the words “consistently with the scheme and purpose of the section as a whole.” In considering whether the section has application the entirety of the provisions are relevant. This includes considering whether the offence is trivial or whether the court is satisfied that there are extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed.35. The offence can hardly be described as “trivial”. This much is conceded at paragraph 7 of counsel for the offender’s submissions wherein he describes the conduct as “a very serious matter”. I agree with that observation. The objective seriousness of the offence is to be judged by reference to the legislated maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Objectively any offence capable of being dealt with on indictment would be difficult to classify as trivial. The fact that it is dealt with summarily before this Court does not, taking the principle set out in Doan’s case into account, change the objective nature of the offence. It simply limits the sentencing discretion of the Court to that of the jurisdiction being exercised.36. Subjectively the offence cannot be regarded as trivial. Here the offender was engaged in a course of conduct that he well knew was an organised, premeditated course of conduct. The intended purpose was to win a contract for the provision of work valued at almost 1 million dollars. Within this sum there is undoubtedly a significant level of profit after costs in carrying out the work. 37. It may be the case that the work was carried out for a fair price. It may be that it was carried out efficiently but it was tainted by the willingness of the offender to encourage the corrupt conduct of Said Marcos by deliberately creating a veil of falsity in the tendering process. His conduct and the context in which his dishonest participation in it took place cannot be regarded as trivial. Without the offender’s dishonesty and deliberate misleading of the two other members of the Tender Evaluation Committee a different outcome may have eventuated. An honest tenderer may have carried out the work just as well. The level of his moral turpitude is significant. This is particularly so when one has regard to the statutory provisions to be taken into account as matters of aggravation and referred to earlier in these remarks. 38. A similar conclusion comes to bear when considering the question of whether there were any extenuating circumstances sufficient to operate in favour of the offender under these provisions. I can find none. That the offender refused to participate in any further attempt to cover up Marcos’ involvement is commendable but this was conduct after the event not in relation to the commission of the offence in the first instance. This was an offence committed for commercial reasons to do with contracting work of significant value to the offender’s company and by extrapolation, to his own benefit. Whilst the satisfactory performance of the work may have represented value for money such that greed in its usual form is less visible it remains the case that there is nothing either redeeming or representative of any qualified justification for his behaviour. 39. The clear inference arises that he had an arrangement with Said Marcos that was intended to improve his chances at being awarded contracts with Railcorp in return for siphoning off an [undetermined] amount of money from the total value of the contract to Marcos as payment for his preferential, corrupt participation in the tender evaluation process.40. I acknowledge for the remainder of the provisions of Section 10(3) that the offender was previously a person of good character without any criminal antecedents. The effect of those characteristics has already received consideration by the court. At this point I note the observations of Gleeson C.J. in R –v- El Rashid (unrep, 7/4/95, NSWCCA) that crimes such as this are frequently committed by persons of previously good character because it is that previous character that enables them to be in a position where the offence can be committed. The other heads of consideration under Section 10(3)(a) do not warrant consideration at all. They are unremarkable.41. Before leaving consideration of counsel’s submission that the provisions of Section 10 are appropriate to dispose of this matter I turn to the extraordinary concession made by the DPP. At paragraph 23 of his written submissions counsel for the offender makes the statement that the Crown is not opposed to this matter being dealt with pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 of the Act. The solicitor representing the DPP confirmed that approach when the matter was last before me but did not elaborate on why that ought be so. I reject it as a reasoned concession on the facts of this matter and against the important purpose of sentencing set out in Section 3A. 42. How; one might ask rhetorically is an offender to be adequately punished for what is conceded to be planned criminal offending behaviour if he is not to be convicted? How are the principles of general and particular deterrence to be advanced if such conduct is to be treated with a degree of leniency that the general public would find inexplicable? How would it discourage others from seeking to dishonestly enrich themselves at the expense of the public purse when they knew manifestly lenient sentences would follow such that it made the risk and reward worth taking? How would it make the offender accountable for his actions other than in a superficial manner? How would it contribute to a denunciation of this type of conduct? The simple answer to all of those questions is that it would not. I can find no justification for extending the provisions of Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to this offender in the circumstances of this offending.43. Having reached the conclusion that the submission made on behalf of the offender must be rejected I return to the objective seriousness of the offence. It is already conceded that it is serious. There are other reference points that go towards influencing the assessment of the gravity of the crime. They are succinctly stated at paragraph [19-970] of the Sentencing Bench Book but can generally be stated as follows: - “authority makes it clear that the amount of money involved in premeditated deception is important, and the period of time over which offences are committed” R –v- Mungomery (2004) 151 A Crim R at [40]. In this matter the amount of money involved is $955,620, a significant sum. The conduct occurred over a relatively short period of time and is limited to a single course of conduct. - The motive for the crime is relevant. If the fraud is based on greed, and there is nothing before me to suggest that greed was not an important element driving the offender’s willingness to participate in the deception then the penalty imposed should be more severe R –v- Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141 at 145.- The fact that the offence was part of a planned and organised activity is an aggravating factor to be taken into account under Section 21A(2)(n) of the Act. Taking it into account twice would result in double counting- Such is also the case where there has been a breach of trust.44. Taking such factors into account in this offence I find that the objective seriousness or the offender’s conduct places it at the middle range of seriousness. It certainly places it at the other end of the spectrum relative to counsel’s submission. I have considered the provisions of Section 5 of the Act relative to the objective seriousness of the offender’s conduct and after taking into account the mitigating factors in his favour. In so doing I come to the view that the offender’s involvement in what appears to have been a form of institutionalised corrupt conduct is sufficiently egregious to warrant condign punishment.45. It is contrary to the interests of the community for the reliability of an objective process such as tender evaluation for the purpose of expending public funds to be corruptly manipulated in favour of vested interests. That the product of such behaviour is subsequently found not to be deficient in terms of workmanship is not to the point. This outcome is irrelevant for the purpose of considering the act of dishonesty. 46. The amount of money involved, the clear inference that the offence was committed out of greed together with the established aggravating factors point towards imprisonment. Corruption within the administration of government and the Public Sector cannot be tolerated. General and particular deterrence together with denunciation are of signal importance and are to be reflected by the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment.47. Taking into account the objective seriousness of the offending and the subjective circumstances in mitigation of penalty the appropriate sentence is one of 20 months imprisonment. After applying the discount of 15% the resulting penalty is a sentence of imprisonment of 17 months. It is at this point in the sentencing process that the court is required to determine the manner in which such sentence is served. This includes consideration whether in the exercise of its discretion the Court should suspend the sentence in accordance with Section 12 of the Act. 48. Having come to the view that general deterrence remains the paramount consideration and in line with the observations made in R –v- Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442 that suspending a sentence of imprisonment “provides very little, if anything, by way of general deterrence.” I decline to exercise my discretion to suspend the sentence.49. The offender is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 15 months. The sentence is to consist of a minimum period of 12 months and 23 days with an additional period of 4 months and 8 days during which the offender is to be released on parole. 50. Having determined the length of the sentence and taking into account the offender’s age, lack of prior antecedents and good prospects for rehabilitation I come the view that general deterrence would not be so materially affected if the Court was to consider the offender as being suitable to serve the sentence by way of Home Detention. Such a sentence cannot be determined without an assessment of the offender’s suitability by the Probation and Parole Service. This necessitates a further adjournment. The proceedings are adjourned until 4th May 2010 at 9.30 for that purpose. The offender is not currently subject to bail. Despite the sentence imposed by the Court there are no reasonable fears that he will not attend on the next occasion. Bail is dispensed with.

2758134,BJS v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 239,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a judgment of Finnane DCJ in respect of an indictment containing 12 counts, but seven complainants. By notice of motion dated 17 January 2011 the applicant had sought an order for separate trials in respect of each complainant, together with rulings on the admissibility of certain evidence. His Honour severed three counts (involving one complainant), but otherwise refused to order separate trials. That decision was interlocutory and an appeal therefrom lay only with leave, pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

2When the matter came before the primary judge, on 7 February 2011, his Honour heard evidence from each of the witnesses proposed to be called by the prosecution. On 21 February 2011, he ruled that there should be a separate trial in respect of counts 10, 11 and 12; the prosecution abandoned count 9. Accordingly, his Honour ordered that the eight remaining counts (involving six complainants) be heard together. The first two charges, relating to events in 1984, were brought under s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), as then in force. The remaining charges were brought under s 61E(1A), which was introduced by the Crimes (Child Assault) Amendment Act 1985, Sch 2(3). Section 61E was repealed by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1989, Sch 1(2). Although s 61E was amended from time to time, the changes are not relevant for present purposes. The provisions relied on continued to apply to offences committed before their repeal: Crimes Act, Schedule 11, Part 1, cl 2.

3The first two counts each alleged an assault with an act of indecency on a person under 16 years of age; the remaining charges included the further element that the victim was under the authority of the applicant. Throughout the period covered by the charges, the applicant was a priest and teacher resident at St Stanislaus College, Bathurst; the complainants were boys who were boarding at the College. Each charge carried a maximum penalty of 6 years imprisonment.

Nature of application for leave to appeal

4Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act relevantly provides:

(3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case.

(4) An appeal under this section shall, unless the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to adduce fresh, additional or substituted evidence, be determined on the evidence (if any) given in the proceedings to which the appeal relates.

(5) The Court of Criminal Appeal: 

(a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and
(b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against.""

5An undoubted line of authority in this Court establishes that a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is not ""an interlocutory judgment or order"" for the purposes of s 5F: R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136; 34 A Crim R 360 and other authorities referred to by Spigelman CJ in DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 278 ALR 765 at [6].

6Pursuant to s 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), two or more counts can be joined in the one indictment: 

""29 When more than one offence may be heard at the same time

(1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances: 

(a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent,
(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,
(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.""

7No issue arose as to the power of the prosecution to seek to have the various counts heard together, presumably on the basis that they formed part of ""a series of offences of the same or a similar character"", within the terms of s 29(1)(c). Rather, the applicant relied on the power of the Court to order separate trials, pursuant to s 21 which, relevantly provides:

""21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial

...

(2) If of the opinion: 

(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or
(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.
...

(4) An order under this section may be made either before trial or at any stage during the trial.
...

(6) Any power of the court under this section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes.""

8In Ludlow v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1971] AC 29, at 39, Lord Pearson cited with approval a statement in Reg v Kray [1970] 1 QB 125 at 130-131:

""... Offences cannot be regarded as of a similar character for the purposes of joinder unless some sufficient nexus exists between them. Such nexus is certainly established if the offences are so connected that evidence of one would be admissible on the trial of the other, but it is clear that the rule is not restricted to such cases.""

9After referring to that principle, Gibbs CJ in De Jesus v The Queen [1986] HCA 65; 61 ALJR 1 at 2 noted an established line of authority in cases involving sexual offences that ""the charges should not be tried together if the evidence on one count is not admissible on another count"": citing Sutton v The Queen [184] HCA 5; 152 CLR 528 at 531. In De Jesus, Brennan J (at 7) and Dawson J (at 10) accepted that approach, without adopting categorical language. 

10Dawson J in De Jesus noted that the concept of a ""series"" of offences appeared to impose an additional characteristic beyond the fact that the offences must be of the same or a similar character, while noting that similarity is itself a feature capable of enabling the offences to be described as a series, quoting Lord Pearson in Ludlow at 39.

11The general principle that there should be separate trials unless the evidence to be called in respect of one count is admissible in respect of another, was accepted without demur by the parties. Accordingly, the motion for separate trials was effectively to be determined by a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence. In DAO, Spigelman CJ identified the fact that ""what is involved is, in substance, an attempt to appeal from a preliminary ruling on evidence is a strong consideration against the grant of leave"": at [16]. However, his Honour also acknowledged a countervailing consideration at [17], namely that:

""... the decision is a pre-trial ruling of potentially critical significance, in that it determines a fundamental aspect of the structure of the trial. This is not a case in which this Court is asked to micromanage the conduct of a trial, nor does it involve intervention in the course of a trial, nor is it an appeal which would lead to delay. Furthermore, if the ruling is in error, it is of a character which, assuming a conviction, would almost inevitably lead to a successful appeal and, probably, a new trial.""

12There was a further factor militating in favour of a grant of leave in DAO, namely a conflict of authority as to the appropriate test to apply to an appeal from a ruling on the admissibility of tendency evidence: DAO at [18]. It appears that the Chief Justice was significantly influenced in granting leave by the second factor referred to above; Allsop P expressly stated that he would have refused leave had a five judge bench not been assembled not to consider the latter question. Simpson J (with whom Schmidt J agreed) would also have refused leave if the substance of the application had only been an appeal against an evidentiary ruling: at [208]-[209].

13Although this case too turns on rulings with respect to evidence, it is, in the words of the Chief Justice in DAO, ""of potentially critical significance, in that it determines a fundamental aspect of the structure of the trial"": at [17]. In contrast to the circumstances in DAO, the applicant had reasonable prospects of success in demonstrating an erroneous approach by the trial judge with respect to his refusal to admit evidence of media coverage of the applicant's arrest and the charges laid against him. Accordingly, this is an appropriate case to grant leave to appeal.

Tendency and coincidence evidence

14There was no challenge to the requirement that the various counts involved a series of offences of the same or a similar character, for the purposes of s 29(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act. Rather, the issue was joined over the proper application of s 21(2), conferring on the Court a power to order separate trials. It was further accepted that the power was engaged wherever evidence admissible in respect of one count was inadmissible in respect of another. Once engaged, it was further accepted that the power should properly be exercised.

15In this way, the issues were narrowed to the operation of the rules of evidence with respect to tendency and coincidence evidence. Thus, the prosecution proposed to rely upon evidence which was admissible with respect to one count in relation to each of the other counts, either as demonstrating a tendency on the part of the applicant to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind or to demonstrate the improbability that particular events occurred ""coincidentally"". The rules of evidence impose significant constraints on the admissibility of such evidence, because of its potential to be used impermissibly against an alleged offender.

16This case is concerned with what used to be described generally as ""similar fact"" evidence, prior to the commencement of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). That epithet was described in a leading text as ""doubly misleading because it describes the exclusionary rule in a phrase more apt to describe one of the principal exceptions to it, and because it suggests a unifying factor between the situations in this area which they do not necessarily possess"": D M Byrne QC and J D Heydon, Cross on Evidence (3rd Aust ed, 1986) at [11.1]. The exclusionary rule under the general law related to evidence which tended to discredit the accused by reference to character or reputation, or conduct on occasions other than those the subject of the charge. There were a number of reasons for excluding such evidence, some of which were readily capable of amelioration, but others less so.

17One difficulty with such evidence is the risk that the accused might be surprised by the evidence and not be in a position to meet it. That potential unfairness has been addressed by a requirement that the prosecution give reasonable notice in writing of an intention to adduce such evidence: Evidence Act, ss 97(1)(a) and 98(1)(a). Secondly, such evidence could distract from the focus of the trial by requiring the accused to deal with events on other occasions, and possibly numerous other occasions, than the events giving rise to the charge. That concern is of limited significance in circumstances where the conduct on other occasions is itself the subject of charges which the accused will need to meet, if not in the course of the current trial, then at a future time. Thirdly, and critically, there is a risk that such evidence will form the basis of an impermissible chain of reasoning in assessing guilt. That danger can be ameliorated by directions to the jury, but their effectiveness may be contestable: Director of Public Prosecutions v Boardman [1975] AC 421 at 453 (Lord Hailsham). 

18An exclusionary rule is, of course, premised on the proposition that the evidence could, by a permissible (""rational"") process of reasoning, affect the probability of a fact in issue in the proceeding: Evidence Act, s 55(1). If there is no such rational effect, the evidence has no probative value and is inadmissible for that reason: s 56.

19The exclusionary rule, as it arose under the general law, placed significant weight on the risk of ""prejudice"", that is the tendency of such evidence to affect a verdict improperly, whether by unacceptable processes of reasoning, or by working on unconscious prejudices or attitudes: R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 227 ALR 311; 196 FLR 152; 158 A Crim R 504 at [41]. As explained in Pfennig v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 488 by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ:

""Propensity evidence (including evidence of bad disposition and prior criminality) has always been treated as evidence which has or is likely to have a prejudicial effect in the sense explained. That is because the ordinary person naturally (a) thinks that a person who has an established propensity whenever opportunity arises has therefore yielded to the propensity in the circumstances of the particular case and (b) may ignore the possibility that persons of like propensity may have done the act complained of. Hence, the necessity to find something in the evidence or in its connexion with the events giving rise to the offences charged which endows it with a high level or degree of cogency.""

20Indeed, to be admissible, their Honours accepted that such evidence must possess ""a particular probative value or cogency such that, if accepted, it bears no reasonable explanation other than the inculpation of the accused in the offence charged: at 481, following Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; 165 CLR 292 at 294 (Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ). The judgment in Pfennig continued:

""In other words, for propensity or similar fact evidence to be admissible, the objective improbability of its having some innocent explanation is such that there is no reasonable view of it other than as supporting an inference that the accused is guilty of the offence charged.""

21As will be noted shortly, that test no longer applies under the Evidence Act. However, in addition to the inherent cogency required of propensity evidence, the general law also required that it not be subject to inherent weakness which would potentially preclude its acceptance. That proposition was illustrated by Hoch, which, in circumstances not entirely dissimilar to the present case, involved a student teacher employed at an institution for young boys who was charged with separate offences of indecency involving each of three boys. After referring to a passage in the opinion of Lord Wilberforce in Boardman, Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ accepted that ""the possibility of concoction - not a probability or real chance of concoction - served to render such evidence inadmissible"": at 296. Their Honours explained why that approach was adopted in the following passage at 296:

""In cases such as the present the similar fact evidence serves two functions. Its first function is, as circumstantial evidence, to corroborate or confirm the veracity of the evidence given by other complainants. Its second function is to serve as circumstantial evidence of the happening of the event or events in issue. In relation to both functions the evidence, being circumstantial evidence, has probative value only if it bears no reasonable explanation other than the happening of the events in issue. In cases where there is a possibility of joint concoction there is another rational view of the evidence. That rational view - viz. joint concoction - is inconsistent both with the guilt of the accused person and with the improbability of the complainants having concocted similar lies. It thus destroys the probative value of the evidence which is a condition precedent to its admissibility.""

22As mentioned above, the general law principles have been varied by the Evidence Act. That Act deals separately with what is described as ""the tendency rule"" and ""the coincidence rule"". Each has been described as a ""contingent exclusionary rule"": see J Anderson, N Williams SC and L Clegg, The New Law of Evidence (2nd ed, 2009), par 97.2. In each case, the exclusion, subject to exceptions, is set out in ss 97 and 98 respectively, but is subject to a further restriction imposed by s 101. Those provisions, so far as relevant, are as follows:

""97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency ... to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 

...
(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

...

98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: 
...

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.""

23The language of ss 97(1)(b) and 98(1)(b), each referring to the evidence having ""significant"" probative value is not consistent with the requirement that there be no rational explanation for the evidence, apart from its cogency in respect of the charge. Further, the balancing test required by s 101(2) is also inconsistent with a general requirement as to probative value in terms of the Pfennig test. As explained by Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully, O'Keefe, Hidden agreed) in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 at [95]:

""The 'no rational explanation' test focuses on one only of the two matters to be balanced - by requiring a high test of probative value - thereby averting any balancing process. I am unable to construe s 101(2) to that effect.""

24As explained in Hoch, the rejection of propensity evidence on the basis that there is a reasonable possibility of concoction followed logically from the proposition that the evidence was inadmissible if there were any reasonable explanation for it, inconsistent with the guilt of the accused. The conclusion that the general principle is inconsistent with the Evidence Act must mean that, at least as a general rule, the subsidiary principle falls away. No doubt the reasonable possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in assessing the ""prejudicial effect"" of the evidence, but a more nuanced approach is now required under s 101(2), dependent on the circumstances of the particular case: cf Ellis at [96]. 

25That approach is consistent with the approach preferred by Hulme J in R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 at [115] (Hidden J agreeing) and in R v Andrews [2003] NSWCCA 7 at [16] (Heydon JA noting the issue as one not requiring resolution). On the other hand, there is a line of authority to the contrary, requiring that the principles adopted in Hoch be applied in trials conducted in accordance with the Evidence Act: R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [107] (Mason P, Grove and Dunford JJ agreeing), applied in R v OGD [No 2] [2000] NSWCCA 404; 50 NSWLR 433 at [74] and [112] (Mason P and Dowd J agreeing) and R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125; 129 A Crim R 126 at [23]-[27] and [48] (Wood CJ at CL, Meagher JA and Bell J agreeing). The authority of this category of cases has been removed by the decision of a five judge Court in Ellis, which post-dated each of them.

26There are, however, authorities subsequent to Ellis which continued to apply the approach adopted in Colby and its progeny: BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303, and, most recently, FB v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [35] (Whealy JA, Buddin and Harrison JJ agreeing). In BP, Hodgson JA (with the agreement of Price and Fullerton JJ) stated:

""[109] The possibility of prejudicial effect with which s 101 is concerned is the possibility that the jury will act on the evidence otherwise than by way of its rational effect on the probability of a fact in issue .... An assessment must be made whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that the evidence may have: R v Ellis ... at [94]-[95]. ...

[110] One matter that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence. If the evidence of tendency from different witnesses is reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, then it will not have the necessary probative value: Hoch .... However, this will be so only if there is a real chance rather than a merely speculative chance of concoction: R v Colby ..., R v OGD (No 2) .... The onus is on the Crown to negate the 'real chance' of concoction: OGD at [74], R v F ... at [48].""

27The statements at [109] and in the first sentence of [110] are unimpeachable; the second and third sentences (relying on Hoch and Colby) at [110] are, in my view, inconsistent with Ellis and should not be applied as a general rule.

Application of principles

28The trial judge set out at [9]-[11] critical passages from the joint judgment in Hoch (recognising that it was handed down before the commencement of the Evidence Act) and from the judgment of Hodgson JA in BP, including [106]-[111]. He applied those principles in addressing the motion for separate trials. In adopting that course, his Honour acted in accordance with the authority of this Court in BP; by applying the strictness of the principle articulated in Hoch, he approached the matter on a basis which was, according to the analysis set out above, likely to be more favourable to the accused than the law required. However, because the prosecution did not challenge the correctness of that approach as a matter of law, either in the Court below or before this Court, the appeal should be approached on the basis of the principle articulated in Hoch.

29There is a further live issue, not authoritatively resolved in this Court, as to the nature of the exercise to be undertaken by this Court on an appeal under s 5F. To the extent that the order on a motion seeking a separate trial is discretionary, pursuant to s 21(2), there is no doubt that the intensity of scrutiny is constrained by the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. In the present case, however, there appears to have been no element of discretionary judgment in the refusal to grant separate trials: the outcome was controlled by the finding with respect to the admissibility of the evidence. Relevantly, the appeal was limited to that issue. As explained by Spigelman CJ in Ellis (with the concurrence of the other four members of the Court) s 101(2) ""requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion"": at [95]. That view was confirmed by a further five judge Court in DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [40] (Spigelman CJ); [98] cf at [171]-[173] (Simpson J).

30In principle, the distinction between the exercise of a discretionary power and the formation of an evaluative judgment is clear: in respect of a discretionary power, mandatory, permissible and impermissible considerations are generally derived by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the statutory provision conferring the power. In relation to an evaluative judgment, the criterion is identified (with greater or less precision) by the applicable statute or the general law. Further, a discretionary power may permit a decision as to where the appropriate judgment of the court should settle, within a range or, alternatively, it may permit only a binary decision. (The power under s 21 fell into the latter category, there being a choice only to accept or reject the application for separate trials.) Further, a discretionary power may be linked more or less directly, to the formation of an evaluative judgment.

31These considerations lead, not to a rejection of the validity of the distinction, but to the adoption of a functional approach in respect of the intensity of scrutiny of what is, in substance, a ruling on evidence, for the purposes of an interlocutory determination of a procedural application. In DAO, the whole Court appears to have accepted that the test to be applied involved a level of constraint close to, if not precisely equivalent to, the principles stated in House v The King. However, even on a less constrained approach, no error was identified: at [205]. Again, the resolution of this somewhat technical question is unnecessary: for the reasons explained by Hall J and for the further reasons given below, the trial judge erroneously rejected a volume of evidence tendered by the applicant. 

32To determine whether the error was material, it is necessary to reconsider the evaluative exercise undertaken by the trial judge. On the assumption, accepted by Allsop P in DAO at [83], that the appeal is by way of rehearing, as explained in Norvenska v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWCCA 158 at [11]-[13] and in R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 273 ALR 286; 201 A Crim R 451 at [69]-[72] (Campbell JA), it is open to this Court to re-exercise the powers available to his Honour. That can be done in such a case as the present, as no issue of credibility arose from his Honour's findings with respect to the oral testimony before him and, indeed, his findings as to primary fact are undisputed. The exercise is thus reduced to an assessment of the factual material and the formation of the relevant evaluative judgments for the purposes of ss 97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act.

Erroneous rejection of evidence

33The trial judge heard evidence from each of the witnesses intended to be called by the prosecution at a joint trial of the various charges. The witnesses were cross-examined as to the circumstances in which they came to give statements to the police, their knowledge of material published in the media in respect of the applicant and whether they had obtained access to information about complaints made against him by others available on the internet and, if so, when such access was obtained. Inquiry was also made as to the extent to which the complainants and other witnesses may have had contact with each other or with other complainants.

34The manner in which his Honour addressed the application may be understood from two perspectives, namely the findings with respect to MB and CB and the findings with respect to the other witnesses. With respect to the brothers, MB and CB, his Honour noted that, according to CB, who was to be a witness, there had been a discussion between them before MB made his statement to the police. His Honour continued at [25]:

""In that statement, he claims to have been indecently assaulted during confession. [CB] in his evidence said that [MB] had first thought he was assaulted in a group prayer session and [CB] told him that it was in confession. Subsequently, [MB] made his police statement. In those circumstances, I am of the opinion that the Crown has not excluded the real possibility of concoction of evidence by [MB] and for that reason I exclude the evidence of [MB] as a complainant in the trial and of his brother, [CB] as a tendency witness in the trial.""

35In respect of the other witnesses and complainants, his Honour set out in a table at the end of his judgment the access to public reports about the applicant, his arrest and surrounding circumstances, which each witness conceded in his evidence: at [21]. His Honour then continued at [22]:

""There is no evidence that any of the complainants or the tendency or coincidence witnesses in giving statements to the police and in giving evidence before me, were affected by anything in the media, nor that any media coverage had any relevance to any memory any of them had about what happened.""

36The applicant tendered on his motion a large bundle of material involving publicly available statements, either from the traditional media, including newspapers and newssheets with more limited circulation, or from the internet. In respect of any suggestion of direct collaboration between witnesses (including complainants) his Honour was no doubt entitled to rely upon the apparently credible and unimpeached evidence of those called before him. However, in respect of publicly available materials generally, to restrict consideration to those materials which the witnesses acknowledged they had seen, or may have seen, at a relevant time, is to impose an undue fetter on the inquiry. First, it is easy for people to forget what they have read or heard in the media. Especially is that so in circumstances where their statements were made some time prior to the hearing and some time after likely observation of material in the media. Secondly, memories may be influenced by a process of infection which is partly or wholly subconscious. The fact that a witness denied such a process would not be conclusive as to the absence of any such influence. 

37The applicant was entitled to have the trial judge take into account all of the material which might reasonably have been available to the witnesses at relevant times. If a particular story appeared only in one newspaper and a witness gave evidence that he never read that newspaper, the judge might well be persuaded that the article was irrelevant in respect of his evidence. On the other hand, if the story appeared in all major newspapers at a particular time, and the witness was not able to say affirmatively that he never read any newspapers, a different assessment would be required. Such an assessment might need to take account of where the articles appeared, the nature of the headlines and so on. That exercise could not be undertaken in full, without access to the material. That material should have been admitted in evidence and taken into account as the circumstances required.

38That step not having been taken, as it appears from his Honour's reasons, there should be a grant of leave to appeal and this Court should undertake that exercise itself. In carrying out that exercise, no reason has been demonstrated to interfere with the conclusions reached by the trial judge. In this regard, I agree with the assessment undertaken by Hall J in respect of grounds 3, 4, 5 and 6, and having regard to the schedules to his reasons. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed.

39RS HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for Judgment of Basten JA and Hall J and I can accordingly be brief.

Ground 1

40I agree with their Honours that Mr Walsh's Affidavit sworn 17 February 2011, and the material exhibited to it, was admissible and with their Honours' reasons for that conclusion.

Ground 2

41Undoubtedly there are passages in the reasons for Judgment of Finnane DCJ which tend, at times strongly, to indicate that his Honour did not apply the test concerning the risk of concoction set out in Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 and BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303. Nevertheless, when his Honour's reasons are considered in totality, I am satisfied he did.

42I agree with Basten JA that the approach to tendency and coincidence evidence for which Hoch (supra) stands as authority is not consistent with the terms of s 97 and s 98 of The Evidence Act 1995. However, as his Honour observed, Finnane DCJ's use of the Hoch test did not disadvantage the Applicant and in the absence of a challenge as to its correctness it is appropriate to proceed on the assumption it is correct. 

Grounds 3 and 4

43Central to the Applicant's arguments in support of these grounds was the statement by Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ in Hoch (supra) at 297:-

""If the depositions or the statements indicate that the complainants have a sufficient relationship to each other and had opportunity and motive for concoction then as a matter of common sense and experience, the evidence will lack the degree of probative value necessary to render it admissible.""

44Turning to the evidence, the Applicant's submissions might not unfairly be summarised as follows. The students on whose evidence the Crown seeks to rely attended the same school. As a result, they had shared experiences and would have had a special interest in media and other, e.g. internet, reports about the Applicant's offending. They became aware of the allegations of sexual or indecent assaults by the Applicant. Some of the reports were bizarre, graphic and prejudicial. Therefore there was the sufficient relationship, opportunity and motive for concoction of which the High Court spoke.

45As a matter of simple logic and some worldly experience, I am unable to accept that this conclusion flows, certainly unless one gives to the terms relationship, opportunity and motive an operation vastly different from anything Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ can have intended.

46In any event, having read the statements of the relevant complainants, one is struck by the differences between their individual accounts and the differences between those accounts and the material exhibited to Mr Walsh's Affidavit. 

47The differences are such as to provide compelling proof of a lack of concoction or contamination by the accounts of others. A fortiori is this so when regard is had also to the evidence of the complainants before Finnane DCJ, evidence his Honour seems to have accepted.

Grounds 5, 6, 7 and 8

48I agree with the conclusions Hall J has reached concerning these grounds and generally with his Honour's reasons. I would merely add this. I have referred to above and relied heavily on the differences between the accounts given by the complainants. Those differences do not detract from the fact that the accounts all provide significant support for the tendencies and lack of coincidence relied on by the Crown.

Resolution of the Application

49I agree with Basten JA and Hall J that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed.

50HALL J: By notice dated 21 February 2011, the applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s.5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of judgments of the District Court (Finnane DCJ) given on 21 and 22 February 2011 refusing to separate the counts on an indictment, apart from Counts 10, 11 and 12.

51The order sought in the Notice is that there be separate trials in relation to each complainant.

52The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:-

""Ground 1: His Honour erred by rejecting relevant evidence in the application.

Ground 2: His Honour erred by applying an inappropriate test concerning the risk of concoction.

Ground 3: His Honour erred by finding that there was no relevant evidence of contamination, concoction or fabrication in the cases of any of the witnesses other than [MB] and [CB].

Ground 4: His Honour erred by failing to find that there was a real chance of contamination or concoction on the part of all of the witnesses except [MB] and [CB].

Ground 5: His Honour erred by finding that the contended tendency evidence of each complainant had significant probative value.

Ground 6: His Honour erred by finding that the probative value of the contended tendency evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect.

Ground 7: His Honour erred by finding that the contended coincidence evidence had similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred which made it improbable that the events occurred coincidentally.

Ground 8: His Honour erred by finding that the contended coincidence evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect.""

Background

53The applicant was committed for trial in relation to a number of counts of alleged child sexual assault dating from 1 January 1971 through to 31 October 1990.

54On 1 April 2010, the Director of Public Prosecutions filed an indictment containing 146 counts involving 31 complainants.

55On 27 August 2010, the Director indicated that, in lieu of that indictment, multiple trials would be brought against the applicant on several different indictments.

56In the period 29 September 2010 to 29 October 2010, various pre-trial applications in relation to the indictment were determined by Finnane DCJ.

57On 2 November 2010, a jury was empanelled in relation to that indictment.

58The applicant pleaded not guilty to all counts and the trial continued until 20 November 2010. On the latter date, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to Counts 5, 6 and 11.

59On 30 November 2010, the jury delivered further guilty verdicts in relation to Counts 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

60The jury were unable to reach agreement in relation to Counts 3 and 4 and were discharged in relation to those counts.

61The applicant is yet to be sentenced in relation to the offences that resulted in convictions.

62On 25 November 2010, an indictment was filed containing 30 counts involving eight male complainants. This indictment was the first of a number involving allegations of child sexual abuse upon students at St Stanislaus College, Bathurst (""the College"") allegedly committed by the applicant when he was employed at the school and that are relevant to the present proceedings.

63That indictment was subsequently withdrawn and the current indictment (the subject of the present application) was filed containing 14 counts involving seven complainants.

An application for severance of counts and separate trials

64The applicant filed a Notice of Motion dated 17 January 2011 seeking the following orders:-

(1) That there be separate trials in respect of each of the counts in respect of each of the complainants referred to in the indictment.

(2) That there be a ruling as to the admissibility of tendency evidence pursuant to s.97 of the Evidence Act and coincidence evidence pursuant to s.98 of that Act as specified in the Notices served on him by the Crown.

65Mr P Boulten SC appeared on behalf of the applicant on the present application.

66It was contended on behalf of the applicant that the evidence of each complainant was inadmissible in a joint trial because their evidence failed the tests arising from or imposed by s.97, s.98 and s.101 of the Evidence Act. It was also argued that the evidence was not otherwise admissible and that the counts should be severed from the indictment and that separate trials be ordered.

67An order was also sought for the exclusion of evidence from five ""non-complainant"" tendency and coincidence witnesses whose evidence was to be led in respect of each count. It was submitted that the evidence of those persons also failed ""the test"" arising in terms of s.97, s.98 and s.101 of the Evidence Act and that their evidence was not otherwise admissible.

68The Crown's contention in opposition was that all of the complainants' evidence and that of the ""non-complainant"" witnesses was admissible in relation to each count because their evidence constituted tendency and/or coincidence evidence.

69The hearing of the notice of motion took place before Finnane DCJ over a number of days between 27 January 2011 and 21 February 2011. For the purpose of conducting the voir dire, the applicant was arraigned on an indictment containing 12 counts of sexual offences concerning seven complainants.

70On 21 February 2011, orders were made in relation to the Notice of Motion as follows:-

(1) That counts relating to the complainant, MB, be severed from the indictment and that the evidence of MB and his brother, CB, not be admitted at the trial.

(2) That the Notice of Motion otherwise be dismissed.

71A further judgment in respect of the above rulings was delivered on 22 February 2011 (discussed below).

72Accordingly, the position as it presently stands is that the current trial will proceed in relation to all the remaining counts (that is, 9 in total).

73The present application does not require the determination of an issue in respect of the proposed evidence of the five ""non-complainant"" tendency and coincidence witnesses.

The indictment

74The Crown intends, following the judgment of Finnane DCJ, to proceed with the indictment in relation to the following counts:-

(1) Count 1 - 1 February 1984 to 31 December 1984: s.61E(1), Crimes Act 1900 (complainant: AM).

(2) Count 2 - 1 September 1984 to 31 December 1984: s.61E(1), Crimes Act (complainant: PK).

(3) Count 3 - 1 April 1986 to 31 August 1986: s.61E(1A), Crimes Act (complainant: GS).

(4) Count 4 - 1 May 1986 to 15 July 1996: s.61E(1A), Crimes Act (complainant: DJS).

(5) Counts 5, 6 and 7 - 1 April 1988 to 31 August 1988: s.61E(1A), Crimes Act (complainant: DS).

(6) Count 8 - 1 September 1988 to 31 December 1988: s.61E(1A), Crimes Act (complainant: AK).

Tendency and coincidence notices

75The prosecution served a Notice of Tendency Evidence pursuant to s.97 of the Evidence Act and a Notice of Coincidence Evidence pursuant to s.98 of the Evidence Act. During the proceedings, there was some amendment to these notices in order to reflect the fact that the prosecution had reduced the number of counts on the indictment and this resulted in a reduction of the number of complainants.

76The notices disclosed that the Director of Public Prosecutions sought to prove that the applicant had four tendencies:-

· To have a sexual interest in 11 to 14 year old boys.

· To engage in sexual activities with 11 to 14 year old boys.

· To use his pastoral relationships with 11 to 14 year old boys so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.

· To use his position of authority to obtain access to 11 to 14 year old boys so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.

77The Tendency Notice then listed a number of activities which alleged the applicant had engaged in and which were said to demonstrate the four tendencies set out above.

78The Notice of Coincidence Evidence identified three complainants who the applicant was alleged to have indecently assaulted whilst in his bed. The Notice made it apparent that it extended to four of the complainants and five others (who were also tendency witnesses). 

79The evidence of each of the complainants was relied upon as tendency evidence concerning the other counts on the indictment in respect of each of the other complainants. The evidence of the seven other witnesses was relied upon to support the alleged tendency for all counts.

80The Notice of Coincidence Evidence stipulated that the evidence related to the actions involved in Counts 3 and 4-5 which allegedly concerned three separate complainants. However, the body of the document clarified that one other complainant (Counts 1 and 4) of the tendency witnesses were also relevant and to be included. The Crown annexed to its submissions a coloured schedule identifying the complainants, the witnesses as to tendency only and the witnesses as to both tendency and coincidence. 

81The Crown case in relation to the above counts is that the applicant, at the relevant times, was a priest who held the position of chaplain at the College, a boarding school. The alleged victims were boarders who were under the age of 16 years. The offences charged allegedly occurred in the period 1984 to 1989. The applicant was arrested in May 2008. He made a number of appearances at Court during 2008.

82There were reports in the media of the arrests of the applicant and others. Each complainant was aware, at least in a general way, of at least one or more of those media reports. Some also looked at the internet and saw the applicant's name. Some accessed a website entitled ""Catholic Cover Up"". The website had extensive material on it. The relevant facts as to these matters is discussed below.

The application under s.5F, Criminal Appeal Act 1912

83The Crown acknowledged that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the application under s.5F: Dao v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; Saunders v R (1994) 72 A Crim R 347. However, it submitted that, although jurisdiction lies, leave should not be granted: Crown's written submissions at [16].

84The Crown observed that the substance of the application (as in Dao (supra)) concerns a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, noting that it was the admission of the evidence as tendency/coincidence evidence that formed the basis of the ruling that the counts not be severed. In this respect, the Crown relied upon the observations of Simpson J in Dao (supra) at [126] and [209] that leave ought not be readily granted where the appeal concerns an evidentiary ruling of a trial judge.

The issues before the trial judge

85In general terms, the following matters were relied upon in support of the application made to the trial judge:-

(1) That the probative value of the evidence of the complainants and the proposed tendency/coincidence witnesses was significantly diminished as there was a real risk that their evidence had been affected by their knowledge of the nature and the multiplicity of similar allegations made against the applicant (the issue of publicity and commentary).

(2) That there was a risk of concoction sufficient to justify the exclusion of the evidence. That risk, it was submitted, went to the substance of the witnesses' testimony and not merely to incidental details of no materiality. Accordingly, the evidence lacked the significant probative value required by s.97 and s.98 of the Evidence Act and such value as it had did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect: s.101 of the Evidence Act.

(3) That there was insufficient similarities between the alleged conduct of the applicant on each occasion to render the evidence of each witness of sufficient probative value to meet the requirements of s.97, s.98 and s.101 of the Evidence Act.

86The Crown submitted, inter alia, that:-

(1) None of the witnesses had had any prior contact with each other (hence there was no risk of contamination).

(2) The evidence did not demonstrate that any of the witnesses had been relevantly affected by the publicity referred to in the submissions for the applicant.

(3) The evidence of each witness demonstrated the tendencies contended for.

(4) In respect of witnesses said to constitute coincidence evidence, there was a reliable basis for coincidence reasoning.

(5) That the requirements of s.97, s.98 and s.101 of the Evidence Act were met.

Ruling on the issue of concoction or contamination of evidence

87The trial judge, in his judgment delivered on 21 February 2011, determined:-

(1) With the exception of the brothers MB and CB, he was not satisfied that any of the other witnesses had spoken to one another about the crimes they allege the applicant had perpetrated on them.

(2) Each of the witnesses were, to some extent, aware of the publicity surrounding the arrest of the applicant. However, the trial judge was not convinced that any were affected by the publicity or media.

(3) The trial judge was of the opinion that there was no relevant evidence of contamination, concoction or fabrication in the case of any of the witnesses other than with the brothers MB and CB.

88In his judgment delivered on 22 February 2011, his Honour concluded and found:-

(1) There was no evidence that any of the witnesses were affected by anything in the media.

(2) There was no evidence that any media coverage had any relevance to any memory any of them had about what happened.

89Accordingly, the applicant's argument to the effect that there was a real chance of contamination as a result of the witnesses' exposure to the media was rejected.

90Finnane DCJ concluded that the evidence claimed to constitute coincidence evidence had striking similarities justifying admission as coincidence evidence.

91In accordance with his Honour's determination and rulings, orders were made removing MB as a complainant. CB evidence was ordered to be excluded.

The findings as to a risk of contamination

92The trial judge referred in his judgment of 21 February 2011 to events that occurred after the applicant's arrest in 2008. His Honour noted the arrest was followed by considerable publicity in the print media, in television news programmes and on radio news programmes. He also noted that there were a number of web sites that contained material about the charges against the accused.

93The submissions in support of the application by the accused for a series of separate trials, his Honour observed, emphasised that the Crown presented seven separate indictments so that the complainants would each give evidence at trial in relation to the relevant charge with the accused facing multiple counts only in trials concerning the complainants DS, AK and MB.

94On the application, the Crown called each of the complainants and the tendency and coincidence witnesses, tendered their statements and each was examined and cross-examined. 

95His Honour noted in his judgment of 26 February 2011, that the argument advanced on behalf of the accused was that because the trial concerned sexual offences, where the Crown was relying on the evidence of more than one complainant (at [14]):-

""... consideration had to be given to the question whether there was a reasonable possibility of concoction/contamination between a complainant or other witnesses after he became aware of some like event or allegation by another complainant or witness. It was also contended that there might have been concoction or contamination because the complainant or the tendency/coincidence witness may have been affected by what he saw or heard in the media, including the Internet ...""

96The trial judge noted that the accused, at relevant times, was a priest holding the position at the College as chaplain and that the witnesses the Crown intended to call as tendency or coincidence witnesses were, at the relevant times, boarders at the school. His Honour noted at [15]:-

""... Each of them knew [the accused], but with the exception of [CB] and [MB], they did not know each other complainant or tendency/coincidence witness [sic].""

97Following a consideration of the evidence given on the voir dire by the complainants and each of the tendency/coincidence witnesses, his Honour stated at [16]:-

""... Each of them, including [the brothers, CB and MB], said they had not ever spoken to any other pupil about these assaults; nor had they sought to speak to anyone who had been a pupil at the school at any time after they left the school.""

98His Honour then observed:-

""17. Some had spoken to family members after there was widespread news of the arrest of the accused and the laying of charges against him and other men who had worked at the school in the 1980s.

18. ...

19. Each complainant was aware in at least a general way of some media reporting of the arrests of the accused and others. Some of them looked at the Internet and saw the name of '[the accused]'. Some got access to a website entitled 'Catholic Cover up'. This website was created by a former pupil called Nielson, whom none of the complainants knew. The witnesses called as tendency and coincidence witnesses did not know him.

20. The website has extensive material on it.

21. I set out in this judgment a table setting out the contact of the witnesses who gave evidence before me claimed to have had with media reports. It can be seen from looking at this material that each of these persons had very little contact with the media.

22. There is no evidence that any of the complainants or the tendency or coincidence witnesses in giving statements to the police and in giving evidence before me, were affected by anything in the media, nor that any media coverage had any relevance to any memory any of them had about what happened.""

99Finnane DCJ referred to the contention by Mr Boulten that there was ""... a real chance that all of the witnesses were influenced by the publicity such that their evidence was contaminated or concocted"": at [23]. His Honour further stated at [23]:-

""... I have carefully examined the evidence of each of the witnesses and, in my opinion, there was no real chance that the evidence of any of them, with the exception of the brothers [CB and MB], was contaminated or concocted. The evidence of [the brothers CB and MB] was not affected by any publicity in the media or on the Internet.""

100His Honour proceeded to state that the claim as to the ""real chance"" of contamination could not be accepted (at [24]):-

""... because there is no evidence that any of the witnesses to whom I have referred were affected in their evidence by reading anything or listening to anything. There must always be a bare possibility that one or other of these witnesses did have greater regard to media reports than he claimed to have, but that would not be sufficient to show a 'real chance' of contamination. There is no evidence at all from which any conclusion could be drawn that any of the witnesses concocted their statements to the police or that any of them were influenced in any way by any media or Internet material to give a false or exaggerated account to the police or to this Court.""

101The learned judge subsequently concluded at [26]:-

""With the exception of the two witnesses, [MB] and [CB] who are brothers, I am satisfied that none of the other witnesses spoke to one another about the crimes they alleged that the accused had perpetrated on them. I am satisfied that each of them, to some extent, was aware of the publicity surrounding the arrest of the accused but I am unconvinced that any of them was in any way affected in the making of a police statement or giving evidence before me by the publicity. In my opinion, there is no relevant evidence of contamination, concoction or fabrication in the case of any of the witnesses other than [MB] and [CB].""

102His Honour then stated that he proposed to allow the evidence of each of the complainants to be given as tendency evidence in relation to each other count in the indictment, with the exception that he would not allow the evidence of MB or his brother, CB, to be given as evidence in the trial at [27]). His Honour stated that he was satisfied that the evidence had significant probative value that substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused (at [28]).

The ruling as to similarities in the evidence

103His Honour proceeded to deal with the proposal by the Crown to lead the evidence of AM, GS, DS and AK as coincidence evidence in the case of each other's complaints as well as the proposal to call the evidence of FD, LC, FVA and PW as coincidence witnesses in the case of those four complainants only.

104The submission for the applicant was that those witnesses should not be called as coincidence witnesses because the similarities in their evidence may be explained by concoction/contamination arising from the excessive media coverage of the group prayer session and the alleged abuse that occurred therein. In any event, it was submitted to his Honour there was nothing remarkable or noteworthy in the complainant seeking the presence of boys in his room because he was the Chaplain: at [30].

105It was further argued for the applicant that there was no underlying unity in the evidence that would warrant its admission as coincidence evidence. The submission to that effect was supported by reference to the analysis of the Victorian Court of Appeal in PNJ v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) [2010] VSCA 88.

106His Honour rejected that submission, stating at [35]-[36]:-

""The complaint witnesses all speak of sexual assaults in the room of the accused, which served as his office and his bedroom. The assaults allegedly occurred during night prayers in his room. These sessions happened during weekdays after the night study period was over and after the conclusion of the normal night prayers in the Chapel. The room of the accused was away from that of other priests.

In my opinion, the circumstances could not be equated to that of children in a juvenile detention centre. The accused was a Chaplain, the children (allegedly) abused were not captive and there is something quite striking about the abuse occurring at a time of night when other boys were in bed and its being carried out the Chaplain's room under the guise of it being part of a prayer session.""

107His Honour subsequently stated at [37] that the similarities had to be considered carefully, and concluded :-

""... In my opinion, the evidence of the coincidence witnesses has a striking similarity and an underlying unity and it should be admitted as coincidence evidence at the trial.""

108His Honour also concluded that the similarities in the accounts of the witnesses in question made it improbable that the events spoken about by each of them happened coincidentally. He again expressed the opinion that there was significant probative value in the evidence which outweighed any prejudicial effect.

109Accordingly, the trial judge rejected the application for separate trials.

The grounds of appeal

110Before turning to the individual grounds of appeal, I will set out the general submissions made on behalf of the applicant.

111Mr Boulten acknowledged that the House v King (1936) 55 CLR 499 principles are applicable in this appeal. He submitted that there were errors in the trial judge's reasons which fell within those principles. In particular, it was contended that his Honour had acted on wrong principle in determining the application.

112In rejecting relevant material, namely, the Walsh affidavit (including the exhibited material), it was submitted that his Honour ignored relevant facts and thereby failed to take into account relevant considerations that were ""enlivened by the evidence"".

113It was further contended that, in material respects, his Honour had failed to reveal his reasons as to how s.101 of the Evidence Act operated in the exercise of his discretion.

114The ""centre point"" of the applicant's challenge, Mr Boulten emphasised, was the risk of contamination of evidence. That risk was a matter of central importance in determining ""significant probative value"" in terms of s.97, s.98 and, on the issue of ""probative value"", in the context of s.101 of the Evidence Act.

115Mr Boulten contended that the nature of the publicity provided ""the source of potential adverse motive, whether it be adverse motive deliberately hatched to maliciously giving false testimony or whether it was the sort of publicity which in its graphic detail and prejudicial flavour was likely to shape a person's attitude more subtly"" (transcript, 19 April 2011 at p.4)

116It was, however, accepted in argument that not all publicity of the fact that a person had been charged with an offence would give rise to ""such passion and feeling as to change a person's attitude ..."" (transcript, 19 April 2011 at p.5). However, it was submitted:-

""... but when one looks at what was actually published in this case, this shows that this was not an ordinary case and the publicity was not artificial publicity, which is why it is important to look at the evidence that was received by his Honour and the evidence that his Honour rejected as being irrelevant. We say that there was such prejudicial publicity that was designed almost certainly to inflame people's passions against the accused in a way which almost certainly was prejudicial in an unfair sense, in a way that would be likely to raise the sorts of problems that judges must guard against or jurors, if they were exposed to this sort of publicity. But in this instance it was the witnesses who were exposed to it in a period before they made their allegations to the police and, indeed, in some instances, it was demonstrated in the evidence, contrary to his Honour's broad findings, that the publicity itself changed the manner of the witness or witnesses concerned.""

Ground 1: His Honour erred by rejecting relevant evidence on the application

Applicant's submissions

117In support of the application, the applicant sought to rely upon the affidavit of his solicitor, Gregory Alexander Walsh, sworn 17 February 2010 (""the Walsh affidavit""). That affidavit exhibited copies of media reports and commentary including internet material concerning the applicant's alleged offending.

118In his affidavit, Mr Walsh stated that the applicant had been arrested on 22 May 2008 and charged with 33 offences in respect of alleged (historical) sexual assaults involving five named complainants.

119Mr Walsh, on information and belief, stated that in the period 22 May 2008 to 8 September 2008, there was extensive publicity concerning the arrest and charging of the applicant and other former members of the same order of priests who taught at the College. Mr Walsh exhibited to his affidavit extensive extracts from various sources. He identified, in particular, the internet site entitled ""The Catholic Cover-Up"" and a number of well-known newspapers and radio and television channels as having reported on the above events.

120Mr Walsh stated, again on information and belief, that certain representations had continuously been made on the Catholic Cover-Up website since it was set up in August 2001. He stated that certain of the representations made by a Mr Tor Nielsen were directed against the applicant.

121Mr Walsh referred in his affidavit to the fact that investigating police had caused a media release to be published in August 2008.

122On 17 February 2011, Mr Boulten sought to read Mr Walsh's affidavit. The trial judge stated that he would admit it subject to relevance (transcript, 17 February 2011, p.311).

123The affidavit was marked as Exhibit 4. On 21 February 2011, the trial judge ruled that the material in the affidavit was irrelevant and excluded it (transcript, 21 February 2011, p.2).

124The Crown objected to the admission of the material exhibited to the Walsh affidavit on the basis that it was irrelevant. As noted above, the trial judge said that he would ""admit it subject to relevance"" (transcript, p.311). He stated ""I can't judge anything until I see what it is exactly"".

125Accordingly, the affidavit of Mr Walsh and the exhibited material was received conditionally. The Crown's objection to the affidavit was ultimately upheld.

126In the course of oral submissions to this Court, Mr Boulten stated that the exclusion of the Walsh affidavit was a ""central feature of our argument about the judge's failure to have regard or sufficient regard to the evidence about publicity"" (transcript, 4 May 2011, p.7). It was contended that at material times there was a ""campaign"" which in submissions he described as (transcript, 4 May 2011, p.9):-

""... a massive media campaign in graphic and highly prejudicial terms over a period of many months and a witness says, yeah I saw some of that but I can't remember which parts but I remember seeing things about the accused, about him sexually assaulting boys, about him being charged, about him conducting ritual religious practices that were opportunistic attempts to get access to victims, et cetera, then if there is evidence that there was such publicity then that's relevant especially if they say they saw such publicity."" 

127It was contended that the widespread publicity at the relevant times resulted in the witnesses being exposed to ""highly prejudicial media articles and internet sites which was a crucial factor to be considered in determining whether there was, in any case, a real risk that a witnesses' evidence was contaminated"".

128It was argued that, although a particular witness could not recall exactly what information he had seen, nonetheless the material in the Walsh affidavit established the detail as to the nature and type of publicity to which it was likely the witnesses had been exposed. This was significant given that it would be impossible now to ascertain precisely what particular articles or news bulletins they had seen.

129The material exhibited to Mr Walsh's affidavit, it was submitted, was directly relevant to fact-finding by the trial judge. Exclusion of the material amounted to error insofar as:-

""... his Honour's fact finding occurred without reference to the nature of the evidence concerning the publicity that was seen or likely to have been seen by the witnesses. His Honour determined the application based on the assertions of the witnesses that they were not affected by the publicity. He did not adequately consider the potential risks of contamination of witnesses' testimony as a result of their exposure to the media because, in part, he rejected the tender of the relevant evidence."" (Written submissions at [32])

130It was argued for the applicant at [28] of the written submissions that:-

""Most of the witnesses had seen publicity about the applicant's alleged offending in the media and/or had accessed internet sites containing commentary about the applicant and his alleged offending ... In some circumstances witnesses were able to identify particular articles in newspapers that they had read or at least perused. In those cases, the relevant articles were admitted into evidence ...""

131It was additionally submitted that, for reasons discussed, ""the witnesses' exposure to highly prejudicial media articles and internet sites was a crucial factor to be considered in determining where there was, in any case, a real risk that a witness' evidence was contaminated"" (at [29].

132Through media reports, it was argued, some witnesses had become aware of invitations by investigating police to former students to come forward with further allegations. Media reports containing such invitations as well as press releases by police were therefore said to be relevant material.

133The finding by the trial judge that his Honour was ""... unconvinced that any of (the witnesses) was in any way affected by the publicity"" (judgment, 22 February 2011 at [26]) and his Honours conclusion that there was no evidence that any of the complainants or tendency/coincidence witnesses were affected by anything in the media, it was submitted, were made without reference to the nature of the evidence concerning the publicity that was seen or ""likely to have been seen by the witnesses"" (at [32] of the applicant's written submissions). Accordingly, so the submission went, that findings of that nature were flawed as they failed to take into account relevant material.

134The findings were further criticised on the basis:-

(1) That they were made without an adequate consideration of ""the potential risks of contamination of witnesses testimony as a result of their exposure to the media because, in part, he (the trial judge) rejected the tender of the relevant material"" (at [32] of the applicant's written submissions).

(2) They were founded on assertions by the witnesses that they had not been affected by publicity.

Crown submissions

135The Crown observed that certain articles were identified by witnesses as having either been seen by them or they were similar to articles they had read. Articles of that kind were tendered and became Exhibits 1 to 3 on the voir dire.

136The Crown also observed that many of the annexures to Mr Walsh's affidavit sworn 17 February 2011 (Exhibit 4 on the voir dire) constituting ""media and internet publicity"" had been identified as having been seen by some of the witnesses. Accordingly, the evidence concerning them went only so far as to prove that they were in circulation. Some of them, the Crown noted, were not generally available. These included media releases and statements made by police. 

137It was contended that the trial judge's determination that the evidence was not relevant was correct. His Honour had been assisted by witnesses identifying what they had been exposed to in various media forms. Where there was no evidence that any witnesses had had access to or seen such, the same such material could not possibly have been of assistance in determining the issues on the voir dire: Crown submissions at [27].

138The Crown submitted that the trial judge had appropriate regard to the evidence that was admitted concerning media publicity and specifically referred to the same at [19] to [21] and the table annexed to the judgment.

Consideration 

139The trial judge was required to consider two matters. First, did some or all of the witnesses read material of the kind referred to and described in the applicant's submissions (by way of radio, television, print media and/or on the internet)?

140Second, if some or all of the witnesses did read the material, was the content of it such as to give rise to a real risk that it would affect or influence the individual complainants and witnesses?

141The evidence before the learned judge established that there was considerable public interest in and media exposure of the fact that the accused (and others) had been charged and that the charges related to allegations of sexual abuse of former school boys at the College.

142Not surprisingly, it would have been difficult for many witnesses to identify the particular media reports and articles that they had actually read or heard. I consider, however, that the material exhibited to Mr Walsh's affidavit ought nonetheless have been admitted into evidence. It constituted material, some of which at least, is likely to have come to the attention of one or more of the Crown witnesses, having regard to the prominence that had been accorded by the print and electronic media to the matter. The judge was required to assess the risk of possible influence from widely publicised material. By reason of the widespread media coverage of the above matters and the fact that many of the witnesses agreed that they had read or heard media reports (and, in two instances, had read internet commentary), the risk had to be assessed against the nature and extent of the publicity.

143Mr Walsh's affidavit evidence established that there had been significant publicity. It was relevant in that it was quite possible that the complainants and other witnesses had seen or heard much of it. However, given that the evidence as a whole could not establish exactly the full extent of what a particular complainant or tendency/coincidence witness had read or heard, that fact itself would clearly reduce the weight that could be accorded to it.

144I have concluded that the copies of the media news reports or articles published at and after the laying of the charges in question against the accused were relevant under s.55 of the Evidence Act on the basis discussed above. In other words, it constituted evidence which, if accepted, could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a face in issue, namely, innocent contamination. (The issue of contamination is discussed below in relation to other grounds of appeal.) Accordingly, I consider that error, as asserted in Ground 1, has been made out.

145It remains a matter for determination as to whether or not that error was one of any consequence to the ultimate decision and ruling made by the trial judge. That aspect is considered below.

Ground 2: His Honour erred by applying an inappropriate test concerning the risk of concoction

146It was not contended in the present proceedings that there had existed either relationships or ""circumstances of association"" between the complainants and/or the tendency and coincidence witnesses which led to any of them getting together to discuss the charges. The risk of contamination was principally argued on the basis of a risk arising from of a prejudicial effect said to have arisen from media reporting of charges that had been brought against the applicant and from other publicity concerning events that allegedly took place in the relevant period at the College.

147This ground raises the question as to whether the trial judge applied an ""inappropriate test"" or whether his Honour correctly determined the question of alleged ""concoction"" or ""contamination"" by inquiring whether there was a real chance or a real possibility of concoction or contamination. In paragraph [11] of the judgment of 22 February 2011, his Honour quoted at length from the judgment of Hodgson JA in BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303. In paragraph [110], Hodgson JA stated that tendency evidence will not be of sufficient probative value to be admitted where there is a ""real"" chance, as opposed to a ""speculative chance"" of concoction. At [111], his Honour noted that:-

""Relevant to consideration of concoction are the factors mentioned in Hoch at 297, namely, relationship, opportunity and motive. One of these on its own is not sufficient to base a finding of a real possibility of concoction: R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413 at [15], OGD at [111]-[112].""

148Before turning to how his Honour concluded that there was no evidence of contamination, I set out the submissions of the parties.

Applicant's submissions 

149On behalf of the applicant it was submitted:-

(1) The terms of the judgment of 22 February 2011 indicates that the trial judge approached the issue upon the basis that it was for the applicant to positively prove that the witnesses were affected by the publicity.

(2) That there was a need for the applicant to prove that there was actual evidence of contamination, concoction or fabrication.

150It was further argued that his Honour ""misguided himself because he required proof of actual contamination. This error was compounded when he rejected the tender of evidence of the media to which the witnesses were likely exposed (Ground 1) ..."" (written submissions at [38]).

151Accordingly, it was submitted that the trial judge's ruling was grounded in an approach which required the applicant to demonstrate or prove that the complainants and the other witnesses were confabulating their evidence rather than considering whether the prosecution had negatived a real chance that they were.

152Finally, it was submitted that the trial judge seemed to consider that the witnesses' denials that they were influenced by the media was decisive but that he failed to consider the real potential of the media to influence a witnesses' approach.

Crown submissions

153On behalf of the Crown, it was submitted that his Honour had determined that there was no evidence from which it could be concluded that there had been concoction. Accordingly, that there was no real chance of concoction or contamination as distinct from a bare possibility. It was contended that the evidence called on the voir dire supported a finding to that effect.

154The Crown also observed that his Honour specifically cited (at [11]) the relevant passages from BP (supra) which included reference to the fact that the onus was on the Crown to negate a real chance of concoction.

155Accordingly, the trial judge, it was submitted, had utilised the correct approach or test in determining the issue of contamination.

Consideration

156The passages in the judgment referred to in the written submissions for the applicant must be read in the context of the judgment. There can be no doubt that the trial judge was conscious of the correct approach, having set out at length the relevant observations of the High Court in Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 and of Hodgson JA in BP (supra). This is reflected in the trial judge's observations at [14] as follows:-

""... consideration had to be given to the question whether there was a reasonable possibility of concoction/contamination between the complainant or other witnesses after he became aware of some like event or allegation by another complainant or witness. It was also contended that there might have been concoction or contamination because the complainant or the tendency/ coincident witness may have been affected by what he saw or heard in the media, including the Internet."" (emphasis added)

157His Honour, firstly, proceeded to deal with the question of concoction by referring to the evidence which established that there was no ""relationship"" between the complainants or the tendency/coincidence witnesses. The evidence in that respect clearly established that each had not spoken to any other former pupils of the College on the subject of alleged sexual assaults: at [16].

158His Honour also referred, at [21], to the table in his judgment which set out the extent to which the witnesses who gave evidence before him claimed to have seen media reports. His Honour concluded that it could be seen from looking at the material that each of the persons concerned had ""... very little contact with the media"". Having read the statements and evidence given by the witnesses, that finding was certainly open. I will deal with the evidence on that aspect below.

159The references in paragraphs [23] and [24] of the judgment to the phrase ""real chance"" or ""no real chance"" indicates, as I have earlier stated, clearly enough that his Honour was mindful of the proper test to be applied in accordance with the relevant authorities. The criticism was directed to statements such as ""... I have carefully examined the evidence of each of the witnesses and in my opinion, there was no real chance that the evidence of any of them, with the exception of the brothers [MB and CB], was contaminated or concocted"" at [23] and the statement ""... there is no evidence at all from which any conclusion could be drawn that any of the witnesses concocted their statements to the police or that any of them were influenced in any way by any media or internet material to give a false or exaggerated account to the police or to this court"".

160In order to analyse and determine whether the trial judge did, in fact, apply the correct test, it is necessary, in my opinion, to examine the observations made by his Honour in paragraphs [21], [22], [23] and [24] of the judgment of 22 February 2011. 

161The statement that there was ""no evidence"" that the witnesses were affected or influenced by the media coverage (paragraph [22] and [24]), should, in my opinion, be considered in light of the conclusion or finding expressed by his Honour in paragraph [23], namely:-

""... I have carefully examined the evidence of each of the witnesses and, in my opinion, there was no real chance that the evidence of any of them, with the exception of the brothers [MB and CB], was contaminated or concocted ...""

162That conclusion was expressed in terms that reflect the correct test, namely, that ""there was no real chance ..."" of contamination or of concoction being the test enunciated by Hodgson JA in BP (supra) at [110].

163Although consideration of Ground 2 is somewhat obscured by the trial judge's reference to there being ""no evidence"" of contamination or concoction, on analysis, it is, in my opinion, apparent that his Honour did correctly apply the relevant test. It was on that basis that he determined, as expressly stated, that there was no real chance on the evidence and, in particular, the evidence of the complainants and the coincidence/ tendency witnesses, of contamination or concoction.

164A critical question before the learned judge was whether, having regard to the particular content of the media and/or internet material, the published reports and articles had the potential or capacity to influence a complainant or witness in making statements to police. 

165In relation to this last-mentioned question, I accept the submission for the applicant that the effect of publicity is not one that can simply be determined by an acceptance of a witness' denial that the publicity had any effect upon him. In determining the question of leave for the purposes of the present application, a detailed examination of the content of the published material has been essential. For the reasons discussed below in relation to Grounds 3 and 4, there was, in my assessment, no basis for a finding as to a real possibility of a contamination.

166I have, for reasons earlier set out, concluded that Ground 2 has not been made out and should be dismissed.

Ground 3: His Honour erred by finding that there was no relevant evidence of contamination, concoction or fabrication in the cases of any of the witnesses other than MB CB

Ground 4: His Honour erred by failing to find that there was a real chance of contamination of concoction on the part of all of the witnesses except MB and CB

Applicant's submissions 

167It was contended on behalf of the applicant that the following matters had to be taken into account:-

(1) All of the witnesses were former students at the College and, accordingly, they had a relationship to the school, to the applicant and to each other. This was said to form an essential factual background against which to consider the potential risks of concoction.

(2) The ""shared experiences"" at the school were said to provide them with ""a special interest in the media reports"" in respect of the applicant's alleged offending. It was submitted at [46]:-

""... It would be likely to make them especially sympathetic to plight of other, fellow former students who were claiming to have been sexually abused by the applicant.""

(3) The issue of timing in the making of witness statements and the publicity over allegations of indecent assault had to be taken into account. The contention was that, by the time the witnesses came to make their statements to police, they were aware of other allegations of indecent assault by the applicant upon students at the College as having occurred in the relevant period. Furthermore, it was submitted they were aware that the allegations in their terms raised issues of indecent assaults on boys and said to have taken place in the applicant's bedroom at the school as well as other allegations that included claims of abuse of boarders during prayer groups.

168The submission for the applicant was that awareness in the complainants of the allegations against the accused provided the ""opportunity"" for concoction as contemplated by the majority in Hoch (supra). In other words, the opportunity was said to stem from the witnesses' exposure to information that provided a source of knowledge about the fact of other, similar allegations.

169This, it was argued, constituted an opportunity for them to gain the type of knowledge that was necessary to concoct allegations of a similar type against the applicant. Mr Boulten cited as an example the case where there was a real possibility that complaints about alleged misconduct by a psychiatrist were not truly independent where some of the complaints were not spontaneous but prompted by a common source as occurred in R v Ananthanarayanan (1994) 98 Cr App R 1 where the Department of Social Services sought potential complainants who may have been in a position to make allegations of indecency against the appellant.

170Additionally, it was submitted that the allegations created an opportunity for the complainants and the witnesses to become familiar with some of the details of matters raised by others, including details concerning time frames, locations and settings (including pastoral care and prayer groups sessions).

171In the assessment of these matters, it was submitted that account had to be taken of the fact that media reports were ""... extremely provocative and prejudicial"" at [49]. Some articles were said to portray the applicant's alleged misconduct ""... in sensational and graphic terms laced with vitriol"".

172It was submitted that the published articles employed sensationalised, prejudicial and pejorative use of language ""... designed to deliberately prejudice the applicant in these proceedings ..."" and that these were ""... likely to cause significant risks of prejudice such as to make a joint trial unfair"" (at [50]).

173Further, it was submitted ""... the publicity was such as to provide potential witnesses with a relevant motive for concoction like that considered in the majority judgment in Hoch"" (at [52]).

174Mr Boulten contended that the trial judge erroneously failed to find that there was ""a real chance of contamination or concoction"" on the part of all witnesses (except MB and CB) and, in doing so, relied upon the test espoused by Hodgson JA in BP (supra) at [110]-[111].

175It was submitted that the evidence indicated that there had been an awareness in almost every case that other allegations of indecent assault by the applicant had been made in the same period that the complainants and witnesses had been students at the College. Some were aware of the circumstances surrounding those allegations including the allegations of events said to have occurred during prayer group meetings. The exposure to such allegations, it was argued, gave rise to the risk of concoction of allegations of a similar type against the applicant.

176The analysis undertaken by the trial judge in determining the issue of contamination, it was contended, was impeded by the fact that his Honour excluded from evidence the material in the Walsh affidavit which was described as ""graphic and prejudicial material"".

177It was submitted, as noted above, that it was no answer that the complainants and other witnesses claimed that the publicity had no effect on them. It was contended that one would expect them to deny or downplay any such suggestion. The trial judge, it was submitted, had not dealt with what was described as ""these fundamental problems"": at [56].

178In summary, it was submitted that the ""publicity and commentary provided a sufficient relationship [and] opportunity"" and ""motive for concoction"" (per Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ in Hoch (supra)) ""so as to justify the exclusion of each witness' testimony and thereby justifying an order for separate trials"".

179The risk of concoction in this case, it was argued, went to the substance of the witness' testimony and not merely to incidental details of no materiality. Accordingly, it was contended the evidence lacked significant probative value as required by s.97 and s.98 and the probative value of the witness' evidence did not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect: s.101.

180As to the requirements for admissibility under s.97 and s.98, it was submitted that there were insufficient similarities between the alleged conduct of the applicant on each occasion to vest the evidence of each witness with sufficient probative value to meet the requirements of s.97, s.98 and s.101.

Crown submissions

181The Crown acknowledged in its written submissions that it was not in dispute that concoction could occur independently of contact with another person, and could arise purely by exposure to information (Crown's written submissions at [44]). The issue, the Crown observed, was whether, despite the proof of exposure to information, the prosecution was able to establish that there had been no reasonable possibility of concoction.

182In paragraph [43] of its submissions, the Crown set out a summary of the evidence of the media and internet material accessed by the complainants and the witnesses the Crown proposes to call. The Crown submitted that the most that the trial judge found was that there had been an awareness of publicity. His Honour did not find that this awareness equated with a real possibility of concoction. It was noted that, consistent with what was found in BP (supra) at [117], whilst there may have been an opportunity for concoction, the circumstances proved in evidence weighed strongly against the possibility of concoction occurring: Written submissions at [49].

183The Crown submitted that the trial judge had adopted the correct test. Based on the analysis of evidence before him, the finding made was open. In other words, the Crown contended that the finding that there was no real possibility of concoction was not one that was at all indicative of error.

Consideration

184The real possibility of a risk of contamination of evidence may, of course, occur ""in isolation"" after a particular complainant or witness becomes aware of allegations against an accused person and/or having read media reports and/or internet commentary. 

185Reference was made to dicta of Simpson J (with whom Mason P and Dowd J agreed) in R v OGD (No 2) (2000) 50 NSWLR 433 in which her Honour at [70] stated:-

""... concoction is not limited to the circumstance where the witnesses might have agreed, in what was referred to in Hoch as a conspiracy, to give false evidence; the term is wide enough to include concoction by a potential witness in isolation, but after becoming aware of the allegations against the accused person.""

186In this respect, it was observed that her Honour was following dicta of Gaudron J in BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275, where, at 301, her Honour stated:-

""In some cases, the possibility of joint concoction is the only issue that arises. In other cases, however, there may be a question whether the complainant might have concocted his or her account after becoming aware of some like event or some like allegation involving the accused and, in some cases, it may be necessary to consider both questions.""

187The nature of the decision that the trial judge was required to make attracts the House (supra) principles. Accordingly, the applicant must point to some error of law or mistaken principle concerning the way in which the trial judge evaluated and determined that there was no real possibility that the various accounts given to police were contaminated by reason of prejudicial publicity in relation to the College and the applicant.

188Mr Boulten submitted that error arose in circumstances where:-

(1) In determining whether the statements and evidence of the complainants and the tendency/coincidence witnesses were contaminated, the trial judge applied an incorrect test as earlier discussed in relation to Ground 2. 

(2) In determining the issue of the risk of contamination, his Honour proceeded on the basis of accepting the evidence of individual witnesses to the effect that they did not believe that their respective accounts had been infected or influenced by media or other publicity.

189The trial judge's decision was made in the context of the exercise of a discretion to order a separate trial of counts in an indictment. The task in that respect, therefore, involved a decision concerning the admissibility of evidence. That issue of contamination was one directly relevant to the issue of the probative value of the evidence which the Crown intends to call at the trial pursuant to s.97 and s.98 and s.101(2) of the Evidence Act.

190However expressed or understood, I proceed upon the basis that Grounds 3 and 4 are to be taken as embodying a contention on behalf of the applicant that Finnane DCJ, in dismissing the application (other than in respect of the brothers MB and CB), acted on wrong principle. In particular, in relation to the issue of alleged contamination of evidence, the argument for the applicant included the contention that the failure of the learned judge to conclude that the Crown had not discharged the onus on it to establish that there was no real risk of contamination manifested latent or patent error: House (supra) at 505. 

191In order to consider and determine the challenge raised by Grounds 3 and 4, it has, in my opinion, been necessary to examine in detail the evidence concerning each complainant and each tendency/coincidence witness and the circumstances in which each came to provide their statements to police. In light of that examination, the Grounds 3 and 4 may then be considered.

192Attached to this judgment are Schedules 1 and 2. Schedule 1 provides a summary of the evidence of each of the complainants and the coincidence/ tendency witnesses based upon statements each provided to police. The particular accounts given by each have been examined in order to determine, in light of the media publicity and internet commentary, the issue as to whether or not the evidence before Finnane DCJ was capable of establishing a real possibility of contamination. Schedule 2 to this judgment, records the evidence concerning the exposure of an individual complainant/ witness to particular media publicity/internet commentary.

193It may be noted at this point that the analysis in Schedule 1 proceeds upon the basis that the complainant and non-complainant witnesses, in terms of the assaults alleged, can be separated into two categories, namely, those who alleged assault occurring at prayer group meetings and those that alleged assault in private session with the accused. 

194Complainant witnesses AM and AK and non-complainant witnesses FD and SP all allege that they attended prayer groups, and that assault in some form, usually kissing or brushing up against them, by the applicant, occurred. It is important to note that none of those witnesses alleged any of the graphic sexual detail, including, inter alia, rape and masturbation, referred to in the articles and websites. Importantly, PK, GS, LC, FVA and PW all state that they attended the prayer sessions, and that no abuse is said to have occurred to them, or that they witnessed any abuse upon others during such sessions. DJS is said to have never attended a prayer session. 

195In relation to the second category, AM, PK, GS, AK, LC, FVA and PW all alleged, to varying degrees of severity, that the applicant sexually assaulted them in his bedroom when he was alone with them. DJS reported that the applicant performed an ""exorcism"" upon him, once, in his office. DS also reported that an exorcism was performed on him in a room adjacent to the main staff room. It is noted that FD reported that although he was in the applicant's bed on occasion, no alleged sexual activity occurred. AM also stated that alleged abuse did not occur on all occasions that he was present alone with the applicant.

196Importantly, none of the complainant or non-complainant witnesses make reference to the alleged occurrence of the sort of graphic sexual misconduct as referred to in the websites, newspaper articles and various media at the time including rape or ""orgies"". 

197Further, there is no reference in any media reports or other commentary to assaults in private session as are to be found in some of the statements given to police. It is those alleged assaults that arguably form the basis for the most serious offences alleged to have been committed by the applicant.

198In Hoch (supra), Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ stated that, when assessing evidence for the purpose of ruling on an issue of concoction of evidence, the trial judge's function is not to make a preliminary finding whether there was or was not concoction. The same would equally apply to an issue of contamination. In R v Dawson-Ryan (2009) 104 SASR 571 the Court stated at 578 [28]:-

""The Court in Hoch was stating the principle that a judge on a voir dire should not make findings of credibility for the purpose of determining the truthfulness of the complainant's account of the alleged act constituting the offence. Rather, the purpose of receiving evidence from a complainant, or any other witness, on the voir dire is to determine whether there was such a possibility of concoction that it would render the similar fact evidence capable of a reasonable explanation other than guilt. When receiving a complainant's evidence viva voce for this permissible purpose, an assessment by a judge inevitably involves findings as to credibility."" (emphasis added)

199In that case, the issue was joint or collaborative collusion. The Court stated at [25]:-

""Thus, a bare possibility of collusion, as opposed to a real or reasonable possibility, is not sufficient to warrant exclusion of the similar fact evidence in the present case. Accordingly it is not sufficient to identify merely that the complainants had a mere opportunity to collude; that they discussed the alleged offences amongst themselves; that one complainant encouraged another to make a complaint to the police; and that witnesses encouraged a complainant to make a complaint to the police. Therefore, the possibility of concoction has to be understood as a reasonable possibility based upon a factual foundation and not merely a fanciful possibility.""

200In the present case, his Honour made findings as to credibility of the complainants, not for the purpose of determining the ultimate issue of whether the complainants' allegations were truthful, but in determining the issue as to whether there was a reasonable possibility of concoction. In carrying out the inquiry and making findings, his Honour was required to apply the correct test and in doing so, to consider the weight to be given to the evidence given by the complainants as witnesses and to the evidence of the non-complainant witnesses. 

201In relation to the issue discussed in Hoch (supra), namely, whether the evidence ""is capable of reasonable explanation on the basis of concoction"", the following propositions may be derived from relevant case law:-

(1) In a sexual assault case, contact or antecedent friendship between complainants may be an insufficient basis to warrant a conclusion that there is a real chance of conspiracy between them: Hoch (supra) per Brennan and Dawson JJ at 304.

(2) However, particular circumstances or contact or friendship may warrant an inquiry as to whether there was a real chance that they had agreed to concoct their allegations. When such circumstances appear, the judge must inquire: Hoch (supra) at 304.

(3) The unconscious influence or innocent infection of statements provided by complainants may supply the explanation for the similarity between the respective complainants' accounts without there being any dishonest fabrication: R v Glennon (No 2) (2001) 7 VR 631 at [155] per Callaway JA (with whom Winneke P and Ormiston JA agreed).

(4) As noted above, on such an inquiry, it is not for the judge to make findings of credibility for the purpose of determining the truthfulness of the complainant's account of the alleged act constituting the offences. The purpose of receiving evidence on the voir dire is to determine whether there was a possibility of concoction that it would render the similar fact evidence capable of a reasonable explanation other than guilt: Dawson-Ryan (supra) at [28].

202It has been observed that, just as collusion deprives disputed similar fact evidence of its probative value, the same may well arise with unconscious influence or innocent infection from media publicity. In Glennon (No 2) (supra) at [155] it was stated that:-

""... The unconscious influence or innocent infection may supply the explanation for the similarity between the respective complainants' accounts without there being any dishonest fabrication. Where that is an issue at a trial, the judge should direct the jury that they have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such unconscious influence or innocent infection is not the explanation for the similarities on which the Crown relies ...""

203When there is an issue raised as to whether complainants and other witnesses have been affected or influenced by media publicity or internet material such to have contaminated their evidence, the inquiry, in my opinion, involves the investigation of a number of issues. In general terms, these include the following:-

(1) The content of media releases or articles or internet material to which complainants and/or non-complainant witnesses have had access or to which they are likely to have had access.

(2) In particular in that respect, the extent and level of detail in the discussion of factual matters concerning the accused person and his/her alleged conduct or that of others.

(3) Whether the subject matter of published material related to matters that were central to proof of charges made against the accused.

(4) Whether the complainants and/or witnesses discussed such material amongst themselves.

(5) Whether there are signs of contamination having infiltrated or influenced the contents of the statements of complainants and/or witnesses.

204Whatever the criticism as to the terms in which the trial judge expressed himself in relation to the issue of contamination, there is no basis, in my opinion, for a conclusion that the decision was either unreasonable or plainly unjust or contrary to the evidence.

205Whilst the accounts provided by the complainants and tendency/ coincidence witnesses exhibit similarities, the matters to which they relate do not, in my assessment, indicate that the statements were infected by the type of publicity to which I have referred. I note the following are matters are referred to in the statements of complainants and witnesses:-

(1) The applicant's practice of conducting prayer meetings at a relatively late hour in his room.

(2) That the meetings were conducted without any other adult being present.

(3) The atmosphere of the meetings which included talking in tongues, chanting and incense.

(4) The inclusion of alleged physical contact either by way of the applicant allegedly kissing students by way of greeting or otherwise at the prayer meetings and other forms of alleged physical contact by the applicant with students.

(5) Occasions, other than prayer meetings, in which accounts were given of alleged intimacy of contact between the applicant and certain students.

206Although references are to be found in the material exhibited to Mr Walsh's affidavit to the applicant having held prayer meetings and the chanting, speaking in tongues and laying on of hands and such matters, the level of detail concerning such meetings as given by the complainants and other witnesses in their individual statements to police travel well beyond the publicised material.

207Furthermore, as earlier indicated, there was no reference in any of the statements made by the complainants or tendency/coincidence witnesses to police of the following matters as recorded in some of the internet commentary:-

(1) The raping of students.

(2) Forced sexual or other abuse by one student upon another.

(3) The forced masturbation of the applicant by students.

208In addition, an examination of the statements to police reveal what I consider to amount to a discernible restraint in the accounts contained in them. Certain witnesses, for example, stated that, in some situations (including, in particular, prayer meetings), there was no inappropriate conduct by the applicant observed.

209In resolving the question of whether the Crown negatived contamination as a real possibility, it is necessary, as I have earlier stated, for an assessment to be undertaken of the individual statements and evidence of the complainants and tendency/coincidence witnesses in order to determine whether or not the accounts given exhibit or reflect the influence of the published material.

210An exercise of that kind, in my opinion, was required in these proceedings in order to determine whether the Crown discharged the onus on it of establishing that the evidence of each of the witnesses does not have a common source in media reports and/or internet commentary. 

211The issue of contamination as argued in this Court was put upon a number of bases:-

(1) That there was highly prejudicial and even vitriolic publicity on the subject of alleged predatory sexual conduct having been carried out by persons who occupied positions of trust at the College. 

(2) The substantial amount of publicity concerning the applicant's arrest and that he had been charged with sexual offences. 

(3) Public invitations or requests by police for persons with information concerning alleged sexual misconduct at the College to provide information to police.

212In relation to the first, the allegedly highly prejudicial publicity, it is relevant to inquire whether any of the statements of the complainants and/or other witnesses exhibit any influence from such ""vitriolic"" or extreme material referred to in submissions. In that respect, I have noted in paragraph [207] that there are no references in any of the statements to the more extravagant accounts published on the internet of extreme allegations of sexual misconduct. Given the emphasis that was placed upon such material in the submissions for the applicant, the absence of any references of that kind in the statements is significant in determining the present application. It, of course, points against infection or contamination having occurred.

213I do not consider that publicity as to the applicant's arrest and charging with other sexual offences, of itself, can be taken as having given rise to a risk of contamination. The publicity was limited in its terms. It lacked specificity as to precisely what it was that the applicant had allegedly done. The fact that the charges related to alleged sexual assault does not in itself suggest there was a real possibility of contamination. Accepting that some media reports stated that the charges related to some form of alleged sexual assault occurring at prayer meetings, that, as earlier noted, is to be considered against the fact that the detail of the accounts provided in the statements vary in relation to matters of detail, whilst, as also noted above, some statements said that no inappropriate conduct was observed.

214In relation to the third category, invitations by police to those with relevant information to make contact, again the evidence does not establish that there was released any material that gave rise to a risk of contamination. I do not accept that, insofar as such invitations may have prompted persons to make a complaint to police that that of itself carries the real possibility that the particular complainants or tendency/coincidence witnesses were influenced in the detailed accounts they provided to police. Certainly, there is no suggestion that any of them were actuated by spite, vindictiveness or revenge in making their statements. 

215A similar issue arose in Glennon (No 2) (supra). Although that case was concerned with the effect of publicity on the jury in an application to set aside a conviction, the approach taken in that case is nonetheless instructive.

216There had been wide media coverage prior to the trials of the applicant in that case in 1986 and 1992. It was argued that the prejudicial and widespread publicity which had attached to the applicant's criminal activities had been enlivened and compounded by desultory references to him in the media since the conclusion of the proceedings 1992. In one advertisement placed in a newspaper in 1996 by a firm of solicitors seeking information from victims of the applicant, he was referred to as a ""paedophile"". In 1998, in an interview, a person referred to the applicant and his prior activities and called him ""a very evil priest"".

217The Court of Appeal observed (at [66]):-

""Although there may be circumstances where an appellate court might be moved to set aside convictions on the ground that they have been shown to be unsafe by reason of adverse pre-trial publicity, thus effectively granting to an accused person immunity from prosecution for the offences concerned, such circumstances must necessarily be extreme and unusual and would require the court's satisfaction that the verdicts were the product of partiality inevitably engendered by the publicity. Only in such a case would the clear public interest in bringing to trial persons charged with serious criminal offences have to cede to the inability of the criminal justice system to provide a fair trial to the applicant.""

218The issue of adverse pre-trial publicity in that case and the principles that apply to setting aside a conviction are obviously very different to the issue presently under consideration. However, the proposition that may be drawn from it is this; in cases where there is adverse publicity, even though potentially very prejudicial, it is not, ipso facto, to be assumed that complainants, witnesses or jurors will be influenced or contaminated by it. It is true that jurors, unlike complainants and witnesses, are bound to follow trial directions which are directed at preventing the intrusion of pre-trail publicity into jury deliberations. However, the first paragraph of each of the statements contains the usual declaration by the witness as to the truth of the statement and warning as to the consequences of wilfully untrue statements being made. The warning may be taken as, at least, sounding the need for appropriate caution. It does not, of course, itself address the issue of media publicity, but it does emphasise the seriousness that attaches to statements made to police in relation to alleged criminal activities.

219A further matter touched on above that points against contamination is the fact that the individual statements of complainants and other witnesses do contain statements and descriptions of events that could not be characterised as being extravagant or exaggerated accounts and contain material that, in certain respects, is clearly favourable to the applicant.

220The comparative assessment of the content of each statement and the allegations in media and internet sites has led me to conclude that there was before Finnane DCJ a sound basis in the evidence for determining that the onus on the Crown was discharged. 

221A close analysis of the media and other material in the Walsh affidavit and the individual statements does not, in my assessment, support a conclusion that the statements were infected by such material.

222Grounds 3 and 4, in my opinion, should be dismissed.

Ground 5: His Honour erred by finding that the contended tendency evidence of each complainant had significant probative value

Ground 6: His Honour erred by finding that the probative value of the contended tendency evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect

223These two grounds were argued together.

Statutory provisions

224For the purposes of the present appeal, the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act are s.97 s.98 and s.101(2). Those provisions are in the following terms:-

""97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:- 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if:-

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.


98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:-

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if:-

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.

...


101(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.""

Applicant's submissions

225The written submissions for the applicant emphasised the need for particular care when considering the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence relying, in that respect, upon observations of the High Court in KRM v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 221, Phillips v R (2006) 225 CLR 303, CGL v DPP (2010) 24 VR 486 and PNJ (supra) at [19].

226The submissions drew attention to the statutory dictionary meaning of the expression ""probative value"" in the Evidence Act and the meaning to be accorded to the phrase ""significant probative value"" (as meaning ""important"" or ""of consequence"": R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457).

227Reference was made to the observations of Beazley JA in R v PWD (2010) 205 A Crim R 75 at [64] (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) in which the proposition was confirmed that tendency evidence need not show a tendency to commit acts that are closely similar to those that constitute the crime with which a particular accused is charged.

228In R v Ford (2009) 201 A Crim R 451, Campbell JA (at [125]) noted that there was no need for there to be a ""striking pattern of similarity between the incidents"". The evidence should make more likely however, to a significant extent, that the facts make up the elements of the offence charged.

229The submissions correctly emphasised that, to determine if evidence has significant probative value, it is to be assessed in relation to its connection with the facts in issue. It was contended that striking similarities and unusual features remain relevant in determining whether the evidence is likely to be of significant probative value. The greater the degree of specificity with which similarities can be identified then more likely will it be that the evidence will be probative of the tendency to act in a distinctive way or do acts of a distinctive kind: CGL (supra) at [40].

230It was argued for the applicant that the tendency evidence which the Crown seeks to rely upon does not possess the requisite significant probative value for the following reasons:-

(1) The contended tendencies are very general.

(2) The lack of degree of similarity between the alleged conduct on the various occasions.

(3) The lack of degree of similarity of the circumstances in which the alleged conduct took place.

(4) The risk of concoction and contamination of the proposed tendency/ coincidence evidence.

231The alleged tendencies specified in the Tendency Notice were said to be extremely broad and non-specific.

232It was also contended that there was a lack of degree of similarity between the alleged conduct on the various occasions. Exhibited to the applicant's written submissions was a schedule which was said to particularise the similarities and dissimilarities in respect of the tendency/coincidence evidence.

233It was submitted that, whilst there are a number of common features alleged by the complainants and tendency witnesses, there are also a number of dissimilar features. Particular instances are set out in the written submissions.

234It was further submitted that there was a lack of degree of similarity to the circumstances in which the alleged conduct took place.

Crown submissions

235The Crown stated that the prosecution was not seeking to advocate the admission of the tendency evidence based on striking similarities. In this respect it cited the observations of Beazley JA in PWD (supra) at [35] as follows:-

""The Crown does not rely on a case of striking similarities, but rather on a pattern of behaviour, modus operandi, system or pattern and common threads (the pattern) in the respondent's conduct.""

236The Crown contended that the trial judge had not engaged in any error of process.

237The Crown relied upon a schedule which was said to identify the claimed vulnerabilities of witnesses and details of the offences by act and location.

238Reliance was also placed upon the following observations of Beazley JA in PWD (supra) as applicable to the present case wherein her Honour stated at [83]:-

""... [A] feature of the evidence sought to be relied upon as tendency evidence was an element of selection and encouragement of the boys to whom he directed his sexual attention: only boarders were involved, all of whom reported feelings of isolation, home sickness and not fitting in, although this exhibited itself variously as discussed in the outline of the evidence given above. A combination of the student's vulnerability and the respondent's authority enable the respondent to act on his tendency to be sexually attracted to young male students.""

Consideration

239The assessment of the probative force of coincidence evidence, as with evidence of similar facts at common law, depends, inter alia, on the issue to which the evidence is relevant. That is, how does the evidence tend to prove that issue?: Hoch (supra) at 301.

240The grounds on which evidence of particular indecent acts may be admitted as tendency or coincidence evidence has been identified as including the following:-


Where the evidence is relevant to showing ""a system"".


Where the evidence may be relevant in rebutting a ""defence"" of innocent association.


Where the evidence may confirm the truthfulness of the complainant's evidence in the particular case: Kilbourne v R [1973] AC 729 at 748 to 749.

241In determining the admissibility of particular special classes of evidence, it is inevitable that the trial judge must make an initial determination of questions of fact which the jury may ultimately have to decide: Hoch (supra) at 303 per Brennan and Dawson JJ.

242Accordingly, in a case such as the present, the trial judge, in essence, makes a preliminary finding whether, on the available evidence, there was or was not a real possibility of concoction. Ultimately, of course, if the evidence is admitted, it will become a question for the jury to determine the reliability of such evidence: see Hoch (supra) at 297.

243The dictionary defines tendency evidence as meaning ""... evidence of a kind referred to in sub-section 97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that section"".

244Section 97 permits evidence to be adduced that a person has a tendency to act in a particular way or have a particular state of mind. To be admissible as tendency evidence, the evidence must have significant probative value. It must be capable of rationally affecting the probability of the existence of a fact in issue to a significant extent: BP (supra) at [107].

245One matter, where present, that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence: BP (supra) at [110] per Hodgson JA:-

""... If the evidence of tendency from different witnesses is reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, then it will not have the necessary probative value: Hoch v The Queen ... However this will be so only if there is a real chance rather than a merely speculative chance of concoction: R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [111], R v OGD (No 2) [2000] NSWCCA 404; (2000) 50 NSWLR 433 at [74], [112]. The onus is on the Crown to negate the ""real chance"" of concoction: OGD at [74]."" (emphasis added)

246Coincidence evidence admitted under s.98 serves two functions:-

(1) Firstly, as circumstantial evidence, to corroborate or confirm the veracity of the evidence given by other complainants.

(2) Secondly, as circumstantial evidence of the occurrence of the event or events in issue: Hoch (supra) at 296.

247In the present case, the evidence did not establish:-


The existence of any relationship between the complainants to each other during their adult life.


An opportunity for corroborative or joint concoction between them.


A motive for concoction.

248The probative force of coincidence evidence by a number of witnesses as the basis for its admission is derived, if at all, from the circumstance that the facts testified to by the several witnesses bear to each other such a striking similarity that they must, when judged by experience and common sense, either all be true, or otherwise have arisen from a cause common to the witnesses or from pure coincidence.

249In relation to the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence, the expression ""a cause common to the witnesses"" has been applied where there exists a possibility that the witnesses may have invented a story in concert.

250However, it may also be applied to the possibility that a similar story may have arisen by a process of infection from media publicity or comparable forms of publicity: Lord Wilberforce in R v Boardman [1975] AC 421 at 444.

251The nature and content of the publicity must be carefully considered. There must be ""... a risk of contamination that goes to the substance of the evidence, and not merely to incidental details of no materiality"": BP (supra) at [123].

252Similarly it has been observed in BP (supra) at [123] per Hodgson JA:-

""... However, the risk of unconscious influence as to incidental details would not, in my view, necessarily require the evidence to be excluded."" 

253At common law, the criterion of admissibility of similar fact evidence was that its probative force clearly transcended its prejudicial effect.

254I do not consider that error has been establishing concerning the finding made by the trial judge that the tendency evidence has significant probative value and that it substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect. In my assessment, that finding was well open on the evidence

255The Crown observed that it did not contend, in respect of each of the complainants and tendency witnesses, that there was an identity or pattern of similarity between the specific incidents. It claimed that the evidence to be adduced would establish:-

(1) The applicant, as College chaplain, at all material times was in a position of a trust relationship with each of the complainants and tendency witnesses.

(2) The alleged acts are all said to have occurred in the applicant's room or living quarters.

(3) The alleged physical acts were said to have occurred when no other adult was present.

(4) The alleged acts were each said to have involved some form of physical contact between the applicant and one or more of the students.

(5) Each of the students, the subject of the alleged acts, were said to be in the same age range (early teenagers).

(6) The nature and circumstances in which the alleged acts occurred were said to fall outside the scope of what might be considered conventional contact between a male chaplain or teacher and male students.

(7) The alleged incidents, including both those where the applicant and the student was alleged to be in the applicant's room on a one-to-one basis as well as the prayer meetings, involved (if such conduct were proved) unlawful acts (namely, assault with sexual overtones) and overt sexual assaults.

256In relation to such alleged conduct, there existed a similarity of circumstances, in particular, with respect to the prayer meetings conducted by the applicant and, in the case of alleged conduct involving physical (sexual) assault, one-to-one encounters in the applicant's living quarters.

257The evidence, if accepted by a jury, would demonstrate that the applicant was a person who was sexually attracted to young male students and acted upon the predilection in various ways and at different times. This is alleged to have occurred in a setting where the students to whom the applicant directed his sexual attention were students boarding at the College and who exhibited a certain level of trust in the applicant and who fell into a particular age group.

258The specific conduct alleged by each of the complainants and the tendency/complainant witnesses is set out in Schedule 1 to this judgment. An examination of the statements and evidence summarised in the schedule, if accepted, would constitute evidence that is capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the facts and matters referred to in paragraphs (1) to (7) in paragraph [255] above and that the applicant engaged in conduct as alleged and had a sexual interest in doing so.

259It follows that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the evidence of the complainants and tendency witnesses was admissible under the relevant provisions of s.97 of the Evidence Act. In particular, it was open for him to conclude that the evidence had significant probative value in rebutting any suggestion that the applicant's relationship with each of the complainants was innocent.

260It was also, in my opinion, open to the sentencing judge to conclude that, having determined that there was no real risk of concoction that the judge determine under s.101 of the Evidence Act that the evidence had significant probative value that substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect.

261Accordingly, I am of the view that Grounds 5 and 6 should be dismissed.

Ground 7: His Honour erred by finding that the contended coincidence evidence had similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred which made it improbable that the events occurred coincidentally

Ground 8: His Honour erred by finding that the contended coincidence evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect

262These two grounds were argued together.

Applicant's submissions

263It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the dissimilarities between the alleged offending conduct in each instance and the number of witnesses making allegations against the applicant gives rise to a real risk that the jury will inappropriately conclude guilt on the basis of a general impression that the applicant had a generalised sexual interest in the complainants, rather than focussing on the need for proof of the actual offences charged: Written submissions at [117].

264It was further submitted that there was a risk that the jury would give undue weight to the tendency and coincidence evidence and thereby misuse it by substituting proof of the uncharged acts with proof of the charged acts. Reliance was placed upon the observations of Hodgson JA in BP (supra) at [109]-[111].

265It was also contended that the applicant faces the danger of unfair prejudice because he cannot safely introduce evidence of the circumstances in which the complainants came forward with their allegations. To do so, it was submitted, would be to reveal numerous other untested allegations. Further, a full understanding of the potential risks of concoction would require the jury to become familiar with the extremely prejudicial media reports and internet commentary that was viewed or likely to be viewed by the witnesses.

266Accordingly, it was submitted that unless the evidence of each offence charged is admissible in relation to the other offences on some other basis, a separate trial should be ordered in respect of the counts.

267In addition, it was submitted that the risks of considerable unfair prejudice to the applicant are:-


Firstly, because the ordinary person naturally thinks that a person who has an established tendency will yield to the tendency whenever opportunity arises and therefore yielded to the tendency in the circumstance of the particular case.


Secondly, once the evidence of tendency and/or coincidence evidence is admitted, it would require a superhuman effort by a jury not to regard the applicant as a person of depraved character whose uncorroborated evidence could not be acted upon except where it supports the prosecution case.


Thirdly, the particular type of case, the subject of tendency and coincidence notices, involves conduct prone to generating irrational and emotional responses on the part of ordinary persons. In particular, in this context, reference was made to the capacity for ""exorcism"" allegations to involve concepts of evilness is prone to generating such irrational responses.


Fourthly, the cases that involve evidence of assaults in the prayer groups will, necessarily, involve evidence about charismatic or Pentecostal religious practices. Many potential jurors would be unfamiliar with such practices and sceptical of them. Such matters, it would said, would have the potential for unfair prejudice.

268In addition to the particular matters identified in the written submissions, Mr Boulten adverted to the weight of potential prejudice arising from multiple counts on indictments presented against the applicant as adding a further risk that justice will not be achieved. He urged this Court to sever the counts on the indictment and return the proceedings to the Court of trial for further argument concerning the admissibility of the evidence of non-complainant witnesses in accordance with this Court's rulings.

Crown submissions

269The Crown referred to and relied upon the particular findings made by Finnane DCJ as to the particular circumstances that were said to indicate similarities and an underlying unity sufficient for the evidence to be admitted as coincidence evidence at the trial.

270As to the submission that the appellant would face a risk of unfair prejudice due to the challenge of cross-examining on the media content, the Crown submitted that, whilst cross-examination of witnesses would require skill and structure as well as judgment, such requirements were not prohibited or insurmountable.

271As to the potential risks identified in the written submissions as reproduced in paragraph [267], the Crown contended that all such risks were capable of being addressed through appropriate warnings and directions from the trial judge. 

272Finally, the Crown contended that no demonstrable error within the House v King principles had been established and that leave should not be granted.

Consideration

273The common law concept of ""similar fact evidence"" has, of course, been the subject of consideration in many well-known cases. The case law in that respect is instructive to the extent to which it provides assistance in elucidating the application of the provisions of s.98 and s.101. It is, however, the language of the statute (the Evidence Act) which determines the admissibility of the evidence in question: Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297; R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700. The issues raised in Grounds 7 and 8 are to be considered with that in mind.

274In assessing probative value under the Evidence Act, the approach to be taken is one based upon an assumption that the evidence in the Crown case will be accepted.

275In determining the admissibility of evidence under s.98(2), it is necessary to consider both evidence as to discrete facts as well as the relevant interrelation in or between facts which make up the Crown case.

276Brennan J, in referring to the observations of Lord Hailsham in Boardman (supra), referred to in the analysis of particular facts in Perry v The Queen (1982) 150 CLR 580 at 610:-

""... Lord Hailsham in Boardman referred to the kind of factor which might usefully guide a judge in determining the question: 'the number of instances involved, any interrelation between them, the intervals or similarities of time, circumstances and the details and character of the evidence.""

277In Perry (supra), Brennan J also observed at 610:-

""... Evidence of strikingly similar facts may be received in an appropriate case, though they occurred on only one other occasion, as Reg v Straffen (74) illustrates. But evidence of a series of occurrences exhibiting a more attenuated similarity may be admissible because the frequency of the occurrence of the similar fact enhances the probative force of the evidence, though the necessary probative force would be lacking if the similar fact had occurred but once or on a few occasions only ...""

278In Perry (supra), Wilson J at 604 stated that ""similar facts"" involve questions of degree in each case, as probative value will vary with:-


the nature of the similar fact evidence itself;


the issues;


the other evidence in the case.

279Brennan J in Sutton v R (1984) 152 CLR 528, in relation to evidence which may be admitted as coincidence evidence, identified the following as necessary inquiries:-

(1) Whether the evidence can be said to be relevant evidence.

(2) Whether, having regard to their number, their context, their nature and similarity, including similarities of time and circumstance, the facts said to be similar have significant probative value by reference to their connection with a fact in issue or to a fact in the chain of a fact in issue.

(3) The cogency of evidence of the commission of other alleged offences is to be ascertained by reference to the whole body of proof in the case viewed in the light of experience. See Hoch (supra) at 301 per Brennan and Dawson JJ; Phillips (supra) at [26] and R v Folbigg (2005) 152 A Crim R 35 at 80 per Sully J.

280In R v Zhang (2005) 158 A Crim R 504 at [139], Simpson J, in relation to s.98, identified the following principles:-

""(i) coincidence evidence is not to be admitted if the Court thinks that evidence would not, either by itself, or having regard to other evidence already adduced, or anticipated, have significant probative value;

(ii) probative value is the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (see the Dictionary to the Evidence Act);

(iii) the actual probative value to be assigned to any item of evidence is a question for the tribunal of fact - here, the jury;

(iv) the probative value actually to be assigned to any item of evidence cannot finally be determined until all of the evidence in the case is complete;

(v) the task of a judge in determining whether to admit evidence tendered as coincidence evidence is therefore essentially an evaluative and predictive one. The judge is required, firstly, to determine whether the evidence is capable of rationally affecting the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; secondly, (if that determination is affirmative) to evaluate, in the light of any evidence already adduced, and evidence that is anticipated, the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457) probative value. If the evaluation results in the conclusion that the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value, the evidence is admissible. If the assessment is otherwise, s.98 mandates that the evidence is not to be admitted.""

281In Lockyer (supra) at 459, Hunt CJ at CL noted that one of the primary meanings of the word ""significant"" is ""important"" or ""of consequence"". His Honour stated:-

""... In my opinion, that is the sense in which it is used in s.97. To some extent, it seems to me, the significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence (whether led by the Crown or by the accused) must depend upon the nature of the fact in issue to which it is relevant and the significance (or importance) which that evidence may have in establishing that fact ...""

282The definition in the Evidence Act of ""probative value"" (""could rationally affect"", namely, ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally effect the assessment ..."") focuses on ""capability"" and draws attention to what is ""open"" for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not, by itself, direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is ultimately ""likely"" to conclude. Evidence has ""probative value"" as defined, if it is ""capable"" of affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. Gaudron J emphasised in Adam v R (2001) 207 CLR 96, a ""test"" of ""rationality"" also directs attention to capability, rather than weight. The issue of significant probative value is considered below.

283In relation to the balancing exercise under s.101(2), the Court is required to consider the facts of each case: Ellis (supra) at [95]. As there observed, this requires consideration of the actual prejudice in the specific case which the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh. The issue of prejudicial effect goes to the question of the fairness of the trial, being any prejudicial effect the evidence ""may"" have on both the accused (or either of them).

284In determining the issue, it is necessary to have regard to the evidence in question, the issue or issues to which it is directed and the nature of the evidence. These and other matters need to be considered in determining the degree and the level of any unfairness to the accused.

285In HML v The Queen (2008) 235 CLR 334, Gleeson CJ stated at [12] that prejudice in terms of evaluating similar fact evidence meant the danger of improper use of the evidence - not its legitimate tendency to inculpate.

286In relation to prejudice as referred to in s.101 it has been recognised that some forms of prejudice are amenable to management as, for example, the provision of suitable directions and warnings to juries: HML (supra) per Gleeson CJ at [28].

287On the other hand, if a trial judge concludes that the risk of prejudice is such as to put it beyond reasonably affective management, then the evidence should be excluded.

288Accordingly, in the present case, the issue is whether or not the trial judge was in error in concluding, as he did, that the probative value of the evidence was so significant as to outweigh its prejudicial effect. In other words, will the coincidence evidence have a prejudicial effect that is disproportionate to the probative force of the evidence?

289In undertaking the balancing exercise required by s.101, the learned judge did not articular the precise bases upon which he concluded that the evidence of ""the coincidence witnesses"" substantially outweighed the prejudicial effect that it may have on the applicant. The Crown relied upon observations of this Court in PWD (supra) at [71] for the proposition that the prejudicial effect is to be considered in terms of whether there is the risk of an unfair trial or the possibility that the jury ""will act on the evidence otherwise than by way of its rational effect on the probability of a fact in issue"" (BP (supra) at [109]).

290The Crown submitted (at [64]) that, in view of the preliminary finding on the aspect of concoction, and that that was the issue that formed the basis for the attack upon the probative value of the evidence, it is not surprising that the learned judge reached the conclusion that he did and that the findings were open to him.

291Whilst I accept that there are risks of unfair prejudice arising from the use of tendency and coincidence evidence, I do not consider that those risks are beyond management by the provision of appropriate warnings and directions by the trial judge. It would be expected that counsel for the Crown and the applicant would participate in the formulation of suitable directions with a view to ensuring that the jury's determination is based upon a proper evaluation of the evidence.

292The matters raised in the submissions on behalf of the applicant to which I have earlier referred have warranted close consideration. Having done so, I have concluded that the prejudice that would otherwise flow by the admission of the evidence in one count of the evidence given in others is capable of management by an implementation of the approach to which I have referred

293I have concluded that it has not been demonstrated that the trial judge erred in finding either that the evidence had significant probative value nor in finding that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect.

294I have concluded that Grounds 7 and 8 should be dismissed.

Orders

BJS v REGINA - 2009/192967

SCHEDULE 1 TO JUDGMENT

Analysis of statements to police and possible contamination

296The matters to which I have referred to in the principal judgment that point away from the possibility of contamination are based upon an examination of the statements made by each of the complainant witnesses and the tendency/coincidence witnesses. An analysis based on that examination is set out below and is directed to establishing the extent and nature of any similarities between the accounts and the matters of possible relevance to the submissions made on the subject of possible contamination.

(1) AM - a complainant

297AM commenced at the College in 1984 when he was in Year 7 and was 11 years old. He boarded at the College until the end of 1987 when he completed Year 10.

298AM became aware of publicity in relation to allegations against the applicant in the 12 to 18 months prior to giving his statement to police. He saw or heard various articles and news clippings on television and in print. He also looked at media reports on a couple of occasions and saw the Broken Rites website two or three times and saw various articles about other victims of abuse by Catholic staff. He recalled references to students in prayer groups, chanting and speaking in tongues and was aware of leaflets being handed out around Bathurst regarding allegations against the applicant. He recalled reading an article called ""Old Boys calls school a paedophile paradise"" which said an ex-student received payment after accusing another priest of sexual assault.

299On the issue of possible contamination, it is important to note the details of the account provided by AM in determining whether or not it reflects material that was publicised either in the media or on the internet. In his statement, he referred essentially to one particular occasion, described in his statement as ""Incident 1"".

300The statement, however, goes beyond one incident in that it alleges (paragraph 30) that it was not uncommon for him to sleep in the applicant's private room off the Year 7 dormitory due to having wet his bed. He said he ""would have slept there on various occasions, but I cannot quantify the number of times I did that ..."". He stated that, after having wet the bed in the warmer months of Year 7 in 1984, he went to the applicant's room and got into bed with him.

301In the statement (paragraph [32]), AM then proceeds to refer to a particular alleged incident. On this occasion, he alleged, he remembered the applicant's erect penis pressed up against his lower back area. He said he could not remember how long this went on for and that he probably went to sleep. He stated that he did not recall anything happening again to him when he spent nights in the applicant's bed.

302AM also described prayer meetings. He gave an account alleging that, on occasions when he entered the applicant's room, the applicant greeted him by kissing him on the lips. AM also alleged that, at various times, the applicant placed his hands on students at the prayer sessions, similar to what he had done to him but that he could not remember the applicant kissing the boys like he did with him. He added ""I do not recall any other inappropriate behaviour occurring during the prayer sessions that I attended ..."" (paragraph [53]). His statement does not resonate or reflect the type of extreme or graphic behaviour in the internet material exhibited to the Walsh affidavit.

303He denied having discussed material events with other former students.

(2) PK - a complainant

304PK attended the College from 1984 to 1987 as a boarder and completed his School Certificate before moving to Sydney.

305In 1984, he was in Year 7. His dormitory master and chaplain at that time, he said, was the applicant. 

306PK gave an account of a particular incident in paragraphs [8] to [10] of his statement in which he said he had a one-to-one meeting with the applicant. He described the particular circumstances of that meeting which arose out of a request by PK to the applicant to copy a Madonna album onto a tape. The applicant stated that, on this occasion, the applicant hugged him from the front. He noted, however, that it was not unusual for the applicant to hug students when he was clothed. He said he felt slightly uncomfortable and, on this occasion, he said the applicant appeared wet and had only a towel around his waist or a bathrobe on. He said after passing pleasantries, the applicant walked over to him and hugged him from the front. He said he felt slightly uncomfortable, given his attire at the time. He also alleged that, at this time, the applicant leant down and kissed him on his forehead. He alleged that on the occasion in question, the applicant sat on a chair and moved him onto his lap but slightly away from the applicant's groin area. He gave an account of the applicant allegedly kissing the back of his neck and his hair. He stated that he felt uncomfortable at this point. He alleged that the kissing continued to the back of the neck and moved towards the side of his face. He also alleged that, at this time, the applicant had his hands wrapped around his body and was holding him against his chest. This, he said, would have gone on for a couple of minutes at most. 

307The applicant stated that he manoeuvred himself out of the chair and pushed against the chair and stood up and walked out of the room.

308PK said that, after this incident, he never had another one-on-one meeting with the applicant. He said that he considered their relationship changed slightly after this event.

309PK statement makes reference to attending a few prayer sessions between 1985 and 1987 at which the applicant was present. Whilst reference is made to things such as candles, chanting and speaking in tongues, no account was provided to any particular events occurring which would reflect or suggest contamination from any publicity.

310PK said that the prayer sessions were conducted in the applicant's room but that he rarely attended such meetings as he preferred to do other things. He said in evidence he saw nothing sexually inappropriate at prayer groups or meetings.

311In summary, PK account does not constitute an expansive version that has the hallmarks of media or internet affectation.

312He could not recall looking at websites that dealt with religious members accused of sexual assaults against minors.

(3) GS - a complainant

313GS commenced his schooling at the College in 1985. He was 12 years of age at that time. He gave an account of attending prayer sessions allegedly conducted in the applicant's room. His account included a recollection of him and other students sitting in a circle at the prayer meetings, there being candles burning and speaking in tongues. He was not a witness to any inappropriate behaviour at such sessions.

314GS statement refers to a particular occasion in the middle of 1986. He said it occurred in the applicant's room when he was not feeling well. He described a particular incident occurring when he alleges that he lay on the applicant's bed. He described an incident allegedly involving sexual activity in paragraph [16], [17] and [18]. 

315GS alleged that he was pulled on top of the applicant after he had gone to sleep. The account allegedly involved the applicant finding himself completely naked and the applicant wearing pyjamas. GS alleged that the applicant's penis was erect and the applicant was thrusting his pelvis back and forward whilst he embraced GS with both arms. GS further alleged that on this occasion the applicant ejaculated and he felt the sperm on his groin area. GS alleged that he struggled his way out of the applicant's arms to get out of his bed. He said he got dressed and left the room. He further alleges that the applicant apologised to him. GS stated that he did not tell anyone of this alleged incident.

316The account of the alleged incident and the surrounding circumstances does not, in my opinion, resonate or reflect the particular descriptions contained in the internet material relied upon by the applicant in the present application. His allegations were confined to the one occasion referred to in his statement and does not traverse matters the subject of media and other commentary concerning prayer meetings. GS, in fact, stated that he never witnessed or was subjected to any inappropriate behaviour whilst attending prayer sessions.

317GS saw an article in the newspaper and a news bulletin which contained a picture of the applicant outside the Bathurst Court. He also conducted internet searches and came across a website set up for those people who had been sexually assaulted. He said the website had been set up by a man who had made continual complaints to the Bathurst Police. GS also recalled an article talking specifically about being herded into a prayer room by a priest who was chanting hypnotic spells in tongues.

318Detective Hadley was the first person he had spoken to about his allegations. He was initially horrified to receive the call from Detective Hadley as he had not told anyone as to what allegedly had been done to him when at the College.

319Initially, GS said he closed down the conversation with Detective Hadley after Detective Hadley had made contact with him, but shortly after, phoned him back. He was told that there were witnesses that said that something had happened to him and GS said that that was impossible.

320He initially told Detective Hadley that nothing had happened to him because he was embarrassed and did not want anyone to know.

321In his statement, he said he attended prayer meetings with fellow students whose names he supplied to police. He recalled the applicant and recalled the use of candles and that there was always ""smelly things"" burning in the background during prayer meetings. He recalled that the students would sit in a circle and that the applicant would walk around and touch the students on the head and shoulders. He would speak in some kind of tongue, but he never knew what he was saying. He said the applicant referred to it as a ""laying of hand"" which involved touching the heads of the students.

322He recalled on some occasions students falling asleep whilst the processions were being conducted. He said that he never witnessed or was subjected to any inappropriate behaviour whilst attending the prayer sessions.

323GS did not give an account of any other incident adverse to the applicant. In other words, the statement he made to police focussed upon one specific occasion. He said that after contact had been made by Detective Hadley, he disclosed the incident to his wife, his lawyer and the Director of Public Prosecutions.

(4) DJS - a complainant

324DJS attended the College at the commencement of 1988 when he was in Year 9. 

325His statement does not address prayer meetings. DJS stated that he never visited the applicant in his private room.

326The statement contains general observations about the applicant's alleged conduct towards other students. He said he often saw the applicant cuddling boarding students especially those in Year 7 and also sitting down with them with his hands on or near his legs.

327It refers to an alleged incident referred to in the statement said to have between May and August 1986 when DJS was in Year 9 and was about 14 years of age. The alleged incident is described as having occurred in the applicant's office. The alleged sexual activity that the complainant said occurred on that occasion is described in considerable detail. 

328In his account, he alleges that the applicant said he was going to perform exorcism on him to cast out the devil. DJS said that he said words which he could not understand and he, DJS, claimed that he was extremely upset at this point and was crying. He further alleges that the applicant grabbed him around his upper body with both hands and briefly pulled him towards him. He also alleged that, when he was sitting on the applicant's lap, he felt the applicant's erect penis pushing into his upper left leg. He alleges that the applicant undid the button on the fly area of his pyjamas and placed his right hand inside his pyjamas onto his penis and was rubbing it, the applicant allegedly saying to him ""it's okay"". He said that the exorcism started before this. He said he told his wife and his mother about the incident. In evidence he said he spoke to one student briefly about a similar incident (t.264, t.282) that allegedly involved another student and the applicant. He said that, thereafter, when the applicant approached him, he would walk away.

329The above account differs in a number of respects from the accounts referred to, in particular, in the Daily Telegraph article and the ""Catholic Cover up"" material on the internet. DJS account of the alleged incident is described in a fashion and detail that does not, in my opinion, suggest contamination from having read publicised material.

330DJS contacted police after hearing a radio broadcast to the effect that, if anyone else had information in relation to events at the College to contact police.

331DJS said that the applicant, on occasions, cuddled him in the playground.

(5) DS - a complainant

332DS attended the College at the start of the second term in 1986 and remained at the College until the end of 1989 when he graduated in Year 10. He was a day student.

333In his statement to police, DS referred to three one-hour counselling sessions which the applicant allegedly conducted and which were said to have been held in private. An aspect of the counselling sessions allegedly involved exorcism by the applicant.

334References are made to the lighting of candles, incense burning and music playing and the applicant chanting.

335The description of the counselling sessions provided by the complainant included references to prayers and to alleged activities of the applicant lightly touching parts of his body (paragraph [12]). DS alleged that the applicant massaged his body, touching his arms, sides, thighs and lightly brushing his penis and testicles for a brief moment with his hands. He further alleged that the applicant's hands would then move back up his body to his shoulders and neck. Reference was made to the prayers and the action of the applicant pushing him on the forehead and lowering him backwards onto the floor while stating that he was expelling the ""demons"". He said that he did not subsequently mention the alleged sexual contact that had taken place to anyone.

336DS referred to a second visit approximately one week after the first. He described the atmospherics including music and incense at the prayer sessions on that occasion. He alleged that the applicant came from behind him and pressed the front of his body hard up against his back, his hands on his neck and shoulders and then massaged his way down his body. He alleged that this time the movements were a lot slower and on this occasion his hands rubbed his penis and testicles. He said that this physical contact was allegedly more pronounced than on the previous occasion.

337DS referred to a third occasion in which he alleges that the applicant came up from behind him and pressed the front of his body hard up against his back which was more forceful on the previous two occasions. He claimed that the applicant was talking more on this occasion and that there was music and chanting was in the background. He alleged that he was massaging his neck and shoulders on this occasion, more strongly this time and that his hands allegedly moved down his body again to his thighs, testicles and penis. 

338DS continued that, on this occasion, instead of lowering him to the floor, he alleges that he guided him to the bed and reached across with his left hand on the bed against his right-hand side. DS said that he believed that the applicant was going to kiss him on the lips. He said he jumped up and pushed the applicant back and left. 

339The accounts provided by DS contains a level of detail that does not accord with the publicised material, although, in a general sense, they do contain references to matters concerning prayer meetings that are to be found in such material. A reading of the statement, however, does not, in my opinion, indicate or suggest that the complainant's accounts of the particular incidents described were the result of contamination. The specific details in relation to the alleged incidents do not, accordingly, indicate that published material in the media and otherwise was the source of the accounts described.

340DS said that he was alerted to an article in the Western Advocate by his mother. The article said the applicant had been arrested on sexual assault charges. He then accessed the article on the internet.

(6) AK - a complainant

341AK commenced at the College in the second term of 1988 when he was in Year 8.

342In his statement to police, he referred to night prayer sessions conducted by the applicant in his room.

343AK's statement contains an account of having attended prayer meetings on a number of occasions with the applicant in the second and third terms of 1988. The description of the activities and events were limited to references to the applicant having allegedly brushed up against him during the sessions. There is no description of any graphic sexual activity such as to be found in certain of the ""Catholic Cover up"" material that was exhibited to Mr Walsh's affidavit.

344The statement, however, does refer to a particular incident that allegedly occurred in the third term of 1988. AK alleged that the applicant started to brush against him during the prayer sessions on the outside of his pyjamas and brushed against his buttocks and genitals. He further alleged that the applicant would press up against him with his hand or another part of his body. However, he stated that he never placed his hands inside his pyjamas at the time. He alleged that the pressing against him was always on the outside of his clothing, but that sometimes he would claim that he definitely felt the applicant's hands touching him. He alleged that whilst the applicant pressed up against him at a number of prayer sessions, this did not happen on every occasion.

345AK statement includes reference to a particular occasion, not in the context of a prayer meeting, in which he alleged there was overt sexual activity by the applicant of which he provided a graphic description (paragraphs [47] to [49]).

346On this occasion, AK alleged that he was homesick and saw the applicant in his bedroom. He recalled the applicant trying to console him. He alleges that the applicant pulled down his pyjama pants and exposed his genitals and placed his arms around the back of his body and guided AK onto him as he started to lie backwards on the bed. He alleges that the applicant held him in a tight hug with his arms around his shoulders and armpits and his head was resting on his chest under his chin. AK further alleged that the applicant moved one of his hands near his genitals and he felt him brushing against them with his hand and that he felt the applicant's genitals against his. He recalls the applicant allegedly repositioning his hand on the small of his back and starting to rub his back gently. He stated he could not recall exactly what happened but alleged that his genitals were allegedly against the applicant's exposed genitals. The statement includes reference to AK recollection of features of the room during the alleged incident.

347In my assessment, the detail and the nature of the accounts included in the statement of AK do not reflect the descriptive material exhibited to Mr Walsh's affidavit.

348AK contacted police in February 2009. Approximately six months before he spoke to police he saw a newspaper article which spoke of allegations against the applicant abusing boys at the College.

(7) FD - non-complainant witness

349FD commenced at the College in 1985 and remained there until the end of Year 9 in 1987. 

350He said he attended prayer meetings arranged by the applicant in his room. He referred to various details such as religious music, candles, a scent in the room as well as the applicant allegedly chanting and praying in Latin. He provided a detailed account of what he alleges were occasions involving physical contact. He described the nature of the contact allegedly made by the applicant with him (paragraph [28] and [29]) and the applicant's alleged manner of greeting him which allegedly involved a display of intimacy (paragraph [31]) (kissing on the mouth and ""welcome kisses"" on the cheek on entering the room). 

351FD also included in the statement references to the applicant's alleged conduct towards other students. He referred to a particular occasion during Year 7 in which he alleged that the applicant placed him in the applicant's bed. He stated he could not recall anything else happening on that occasion. The statement does not contain descriptions of graphic or overt sexual activity and does not reflect the intimate detail in material exhibited to Mr Walsh's affidavit or, in particular, that contained in the Daily Telegraph article.

352FD was alerted to allegations against the applicant by Ms Withers. He subsequently heard a long radio broadcast and news bulletin regarding the applicant being charged with inappropriately dealing with students at the school.

353FD stated that he had not visited or viewed any websites that mentioned or outlined allegations against former priests or teachers at the College.

354His account in evidence was that, after having been contacted about the matter, he initially did not have a very good memory of the circumstances in which he dealt with the applicant at the College other than being in the choir with him. It was when he went to the police station and told the police that he did not recall too much that the year books were laid out in relation to the time he was in attendance at the College. He said it was from going through the year books that he actually started to get some memories back which he mentioned to the officer.

(8) LC - non-complainant witness

355LC attended the College in Year 10 in 1988 and was aged 16 years. He started in the fourth term of 1988.

356His statement to police dated 10 September 2008 contains an account of a specific occasion that occurred on a Saturday night in the second term in 1989. He said that, whilst in the dormitory, some boys had jumped on top of him. He flung the bedcovers off and took off to get away from them. He found his way to the applicant's room and knocked on this door. 

357LC then set out an account of particular activity by the applicant (paragraphs [13] to [15]).

358He alleged that the applicant took hold of him and allegedly attempted to kiss him on more than one occasion. He also described the applicant allegedly pulling him down on top of him and kissing him passionately on the mouth. LC also alleged that under the bedcovers he was holding him down and could feel the applicant thrusting up and down against his body using the lower half of his body. At this time he alleged that the applicant was holding him firmly and kissing him. He said that he was unable to pull himself away from the applicant. He alleged that this continued for almost 30 minutes or so. In his statement, LC said that the applicant seemed to him to be disassociated with himself as he was doing the activities described. LC did not described any other sexual activity and recalled the applicant stopping his actions, letting go of him and getting out of the bed. He recalled him allegedly getting a mattress from out of his bed and placing it on the floor near the lounge and told him to sleep on that.

359The account does not contain any other graphic or overt descriptions of sexual activity. LC statement to police does not, in my assessment, suggest an account affected by contamination from the exhibited material.

360LC gave an account of having attended prayer sessions but stated that he did not recall anything out of place occurring.

361LC contacted police after viewing extensive publicity. He saw television reports and his wife brought his attention to an article in the local paper which spoke of the allegations and included an image of the applicant. LC made numerous internet searches and read up on media about the sexual assault charges being brought against the applicant. He also located the accounts of the first person who made allegations. LC recalled reading articles which suggested that victims were herded into prayer rooms by the applicant chanting hypnotic spells in tongues and that boarders were forced to assault each other.

362It is to be noted that LC was older than certain of the other witnesses (then 16 years). The description of the alleged activities of the applicant, whilst clearly being of a sexual nature, were not as specific or as grave as the account, for example, provided by GS.

(9) FVA - non-complainant witness

363FVA commenced at the College in Year 8 in 1985 as a boarding student.

364His statement refers to his attendance at prayer groups in the applicant's room. He described events at those meetings but stated that he did not see anything occur whilst he was in attendance.

365His statement referred specifically to one occasion when he was in the applicant's room. He could not recall the year and could not recall why he was there, but that it was during the daytime. He alleged that the applicant hugged and kissed him. He also alleged that, on that occasion, the applicant led him to his bed and they lay down on the bed. The applicant allegedly made, what was described as, strange noises, like heavy breathing and that the applicant allegedly moved in a thrusting motion. He did not describe any other activity having occurred on that occasion.

366The statement does not, in my assessment, suggest contamination arising from published material such as that exhibited to Mr Walsh's affidavit.

367FVA had become aware that the applicant had been charged with sexually assaulting former students at the College before police approached him. Prior to making his statement to police, he conducted some internet searches in relation to the applicant. He recalled reading an article which talked about allegations of chanting, orgies in prayer sessions, speaking in tongues and laying of hands. He said that this article brought back memories of things he had never thought of since he was a school boy. He also saw the website entitled ""Catholic Cover Up"" and he saw articles about ex-students which contained allegations of abuse by the applicant during prayer groups where chanting was used to hypnotise students.

(10) PW - non-complainant witness

368PW commenced at the College in Year 8 at the beginning of the school year in 1987. He was 13 years of age at that time.

369He said that he attended on the applicant on a number of occasions. These attendances allegedly occurred in the applicant's bedroom. He stated that he also went to some prayer group meetings at night in the applicant's room.

370He described a particular occasion when he attended on the applicant in the applicant's room (paragraph [18]). He alleged that the applicant kissed him. PW alleged that on this occasion, the applicant placed his hands on either side of his face and said ""you know I love you, you can come to me any time"". He then alleged that the applicant kissed him on the lips. He stated he did not know what to do and was in shock.

371His next few visits to the applicant's room, he said, were normal and no adverse event occurred.

372PW gave an account of a further incident when he said he attended upon the applicant in his room. PW alleged that, on this occasion, the applicant kissed him and told him to sit on the bed and then lay on the bed. He alleges that the applicant got onto the bed and lay behind him, curled up around his back. He said ""I don't remember anything else happening"". He said he fell asleep and when he woke up he left the room.

373PW statement (paragraph [21]) alleges that the alleged kissing by the applicant became more frequent. He described the alleged sequence of events as the saying of a prayer and that the applicant would then allegedly place his hands on either side of his face and kiss him on the mouth and would make him sit with his legs either side of him so that he was facing him in a straddled position. He further alleged that the applicant pulled him closer to his body and he realised that the applicant had an erection when so sitting. There was no other description of any overt sexual act and PW stated that he could not particularise any incident ""... as the same thing happened each time"" (paragraph [21]).

374The statement does not contain graphic references to matters referred to in the internet commentary exhibited to Mr Walsh's affidavit. In my assessment, the statements does not reflect contamination based upon the exhibited material.

375PW saw publicity about the applicant being involved in a number of sexual allegations in the late 1980's at the College through national news reports before he made his statement.

(11) SP - non-complainant witness

376SP attended the College as a full-time boarder from 1983 to 1988.

377He referred to having attended prayer meetings at night and that the applicant ran the sessions.

378SP referred to one particular occasion at such a group meeting allegedly sitting on the applicant's knee. Although he alleges that the applicant instigated physical contact with him using his left hand, he stated he did not touch his genitals. He said that he did not return to the applicant's room thereafter.

379The statement does not, in my assessment, reflect or convey contamination from the exhibited material.

380Six to nine months before making his initial statement to police, SP had seen a news story on the television which said that the applicant had been arrested and was charged with indecent assaults on former students at the College.

The Catholic Cover-Up

This extract is a personal recount of the creator of website the Catholic Cover-up, although the story itself is unsigned. The following are relevant extracts:-

""The story outlines the constant 20 year battle between the power and influence of a corrupted Catholic Church and an innocent Victim of circumstances who's only crime was to wake up from hypnoses during a rape at boarding school at the age of 13 in 1986.

Because the Vincentian Fathers (who are still at large) are masters of hypnosis, my memory at different stages of my life became distorted"".


He goes on to describe one method of hypnosis:-

""Mr Haynes told me to forget staring at the light and to never stare at it again.

I don't know what happened that day but I have since learnt that is one technique that is used for mind control"".

...

""[BJS] put his hands on either sides of my body and started to press his fingers into my ribs. 

Then [BJS] started to chant. He was chanting the words ""char char char"" over and over again.

[BJS] asked me to chant with him. After a while he started chanting softer and slower until he finally stopped. 

When he finished he put my hand on his penis and used my hand to masturbate himself. I did not know what was happening when he started moving faster I let go.

[BJS] looked at me and started chanting again and I drifted off to sleep"".

The applicant described a number of scenes similar to this one. 

He also recounted an encounter with a de-identified science teacher in which he went to his house and played ""strip poker"". He went on to state:-

""... [the teacher] said that if I lost the next hand he would give me a headjob. At the time I did not know what a headjob was.

I lost the next hand and [the teacher] started sucking my penis. Then he sat back on his bed and masturbated himself until he came"". 

He also stated that similar acts were committed in the teacher's office at school. 

The author described the night prayer sessions as follows:-

""When we got to [BJS] room we all sat on the floor and waited for [BJS] to start prayers.

[BJS] stood up in front of all of us and started to chant the words 'cha cha cha'.

We all drifted off to sleep when we woke up we were lying on the floor. After that we left [BJS] room and went back to the dormitory"".

On another occasion, the author asserts the following occurrence:-

""I remember another occasion in [BJS] room when I woke up on my knees and I was crying.

I heard [BJS] saying something like 'so your going to cry are you' it wasn't until he said that I realized that he was inside me physically raping me. 

All of the other boys in the room started crying as well"".

The author also describes a situation where between 50 and 100 students attended a large gathering in a hall and were asked to chant in unison. He states that he refused to chant, but was eventually told to and did after some coercion by BJS. He states that he remembers nothing thereafter, but the following day, he thought that the gathering in the hall had been some time ago (the inference being that he had been hypnotised).

Despite a large volume of other material, the above is the relevant portion regarding what could be considered evidence that could contaminate other witnesses. 

In respect of the Police Statement, the detail provided therein is substantively similar to that recounted in the Extract from the Catholic Cover-up. 


AM - He became aware of media some 18 months prior to giving his statement (t.201). Stated that he knew the name of the author of the Catholic cover-up website, but could not confirm that he had been to the website or if he had seen any articles written by the author (Tor Nielsen) (t.202).

It alleged at one point that the teacher sat on the penis of the author, causing him some damage. 

The author states that the school, in assessing ""[his] claim"" instructed a psychologist, Dr Wendy Roberts, who wrote a report. He states that upon reading that report, he ""had a breakdown and got flashbacks about [BJS] is [sic] it not been for the report I would not have remembered about [BJS] at all ..."".

		11 June 2014",2011-11-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758136,Police v Ravshan USMANOV [2011] NSWLC 40,"JudgmentRemarks on Sentence
1Mr Usmanov has entered a plea of guilty to an offence of publishing an indecent article, an offence prosecuted under section 578C of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a period of 12 months together with a fine of up to $11,000.
2The proceedings were first listed before the Court on 19 October 2011 and on that day Mr Usmanov entered a plea of guilty. Accordingly, he will receive a 25% discount on the otherwise appropriate penalty for the utilitarian value of that plea.
Facts
3A short Statement of Facts has been tendered in these sentencing proceedings. Mr Usmanov and the complainant, Ms Bayanmunkh, have known each other since 2008. During that time they have been in a relationship, which has on occasions been intimate. They have also lived together, but in July 2011 the complainant moved from the premises she shared with Mr Usmanov. On 15 October 2011, according to a statement made to police by Mr Usmanov, to get back at the complainant he decided to post six images of her on his Facebook page. 
4The images posted show the complainant while she is nude in certain positions and clearly show her breasts and genitalia.
5At 8.01am, 8.11am and 9.39am, Mr Usmanov sent an email to the complainant saying, ""Some of your photos are now on Facebook"". At 9.45am the complainant's housemate told her that there were some of her photos on Facebook. The complainant immediately went to Mr Usmanov's home where she confronted him and asked him to remove the photos, which he refused to do. She then went to the police. 
6It is not clear when, but the police spoke with Mr Usmanov and he agreed to take the photos down. Later that day at approximately 2.15pm, Mr Usmanov attended Town Hall police station, where he told police he posted the photos because he had been hurt by the complainant and it was the only thing to hurt her. While at the police station Mr Usmanov showed the police his Facebook account, which revealed the photos had been removed.
7Mr Usmanov then left the police station. At approximately 2.50pm that day, Const Smith received an email from the complainant complaining that the photos had been reposted. She had become aware of that because Ms Usmanov had sent a friend request to Tsatsral Gansunkh, a person known to the complainant. At 4.45pm the complainant, Mr Gansunkh and another person went to the police station where under police supervision the photographs were provided to the police.
8Subsequently Mr Usmanov was arrested. He made full admission, saying he posted the photos to get back at the complainant and had thought he had removed them from the site after he had spoken to the police earlier in the day.
Consideration of penalty and assessment of criminality
9The maximum penalty for this offence is a sentence of imprisonment for a period of 12 months together with a fine of up to $11,000. The penalty is indicative of the seriousness the community views this type of offence. 
10Despite an extensive search, no NSW reported decisions could be located that assist with the approach to be taken in a matter such as this where the material has been published on Facebook or the Internet. Nor are there any NSW reported decisions where the material published is indecent but does not constitute child pornography.
11The only decision found which touches upon these issues is from Judge Becroft of the Wellington District Court in New Zealand on 12 November 2010. In the matter of Police v Joshua Ashby, Mr Ashby had posted a nude photograph of his ex girlfriend on Facebook. Not only did he log into her account and upload the image, which showed her to be naked in front of a mirror, he then unblocked her privacy settings and changed her password. The image remained online for a period of 12 hours before the police and Facebook authorities shut down the account. Mr Ashby received a full time sentence of imprisonment for a period of 4 months.
12In his reasons, Judge Becroft was concerned that technology not be used in this way and as such the appropriate starting point should be prison.
13For Mr Usmanov's part, there was clearly some premeditation given the attempts he made to contact the complainant to invite her to look at the Facebook page. The number of images posted, their removal, reposting and the invitation to Mr Gansunkh to join as a friend clearly with the intention to expose the photos posted elevate the seriousness of the offence. It is not known what privacy settings, if any, existed for the Facebook page and how many people, if any, may have been able to access that page while the image was posted. What is clear from the Statement of Facts is that the complainant's housemate saw the images at 9.45am and Mr Gansunkh at 5pm on the same day.
14For the purpose of sentencing I am of the opinion that this matter falls above the half way mark.
15Mr Usmanov appears for sentencing without any prior criminal antecedents. He is 20 years of age.  He arrived in Australia from Uzbekistan in 2007. He has completed an accountancy degree and is currently employed at Maersk Line Australia as a credit controller. Character references tended on his behalf indicate he has expressed his remorse of the offence, appreciating the damage his actions have done to the complainant's reputation.
16It has been submitted on Mr Usmanov's behalf that this matter should be dealt with under the provisions of section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Those submissions being based on his age, lack of antecedents, his contrition and the impact a conviction would have on his future.
17In my view this is not a matter for the application of the provisions of s 10, notwithstanding Mr Usmanov's age and good character. The nature of this offence could not be regarded as trivial. This offence was executed with planning and characterised by a clear intent. From the submissions made, nor could it be said there is any extenuating circumstance which the court should have regard to which would lead to the application of the provisions of s10.
18I am of the view a conviction should be recorded. 
19In relation to this matter I have regard to the purposes of sentencing, and in particular the need to prevent crime by deterring both the offender and the community generally from committing similar crimes. This is a particularly relevant consideration in a matter such as this where new age technology through Facebook gives instant access to the world. Facebook as a social networking site has limited boundaries. Incalculable damage can be done to a person's reputation by the irresponsible posting of information through that medium. With its popularity and potential for real harm, there is a genuine need to ensure the use of this medium to commit offences of this type is deterred.
20While there has not been a victim impact statement given in these proceedings, the harm to the victim is not difficult to contemplate: embarrassment, humiliation and anxiety at not only the viewing of the images by persons who are known to her but also the prospect of viewing by those who are not. It can only be a matter for speculation as to who else may have seen the images, and whether those images have been stored in such a manner which, at a time the complainant least expects, they will again be available for viewing, circulation or distribution.
21Accordingly I am of the view that the only appropriate penalty in relation to this matter is a sentence of imprisonment. Having reached that conclusion, I have to consider how that sentence should be served.
22Given the importance of general deterrence for this type of offending, a suspended sentence is not an appropriate penalty.
23From all the material provided to the court, there are no issues that an ICO could address by way of programs to assist with the rehabilitation of Mr Usmanov, so that is not an appropriate penalty.
24Taking into account Mr Usmanov's age and his lack of antecedents, I am of the view the appropriate penalty is a sentence of imprisonment to be served by Home Detention, subject to the assessment as to suitability.
Decision
25Mr Usmanov, you are convicted. Taking into account the plea of guilty with a discount of 25%, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 6 months.
26The proceedings are adjourned until 19 December 2011 for the purpose of the Home Detention assessment.

Deputy Chief Magistrate J MottleyDowning Centre Local Court
**********
NOTES: On 9 November 2011, the defendant lodged an appeal against sentence in the District Court.On 6 February 2012, the Local Court ordered that the defendant serve the sentence of imprisonment by way of Home Detention following an assessment of suitability.On 15 February 2012, the District Court (per Blanch CJDC) confirmed the defendant's sentence of imprisonment, but quashed the Home Detention Order and ordered that the sentence be suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

		13 April 2012",2011-11-08 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2758147,Keen v Nominal Defendant [2011] NSWDC 173,"REASONS FOR Judgment 
1The plaintiff was injured in a motor accident on 23 December 2008. He commenced these proceedings against the Nominal Defendant on 10 December 2009 , alleging that the accident was caused by the driver of an unidentified vehicle. 

2A year and a half later, on 30 June 2011, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim joining Mr Bullen as a second defendant to the proceedings. 

3The proposed second defendant opposes the plaintiff's motion. He filed a counter motion on 31 August 2011 seeking dismissal of the plaintiff's motion. He says that the plaintiff is not entitled to commence or maintain proceedings against him because the plaintiff did not give notice of any claim against him within 6 months of the motor accident, and has not provided a full and satisfactory explanation for that delay: s 72 and s 73 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (the MAC Act) . 

The issues for determination 
4A claim in respect of injury received in a motor accident must be made within 6 months of the accident: s 72(1) of the MAC Act . If court proceedings are commenced on a late claim, the insurer may apply to the court to have the proceedings dismissed on the ground of delay: s 73(5) of the MAC Act . A claim may, however, be made more than 6 months after the accident if the claimant provides a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay in making the claim: s 73(1) of the MAC Act . 

5The plaintiff made a claim against the Nominal Defendant within the prescribed 6 month time limit by lodging a Personal Injury Claim Form with the Nominal Defendant on 26 February 2009. But the plaintiff did not make a claim against the proposed second defendant, Mr Bullen, until 30 April 2010, that is, some 16 months after the accident. 

6At the hearing of the motions on 27 October 2011, the plaintiff relied upon affidavits made by his lawyers: an affidavit made by Mario Piperides of 30 August 2011 and an affidavit of Zacharia Mwangi made on 31 August 2011, for the explanation as to the delay in making the claim against Mr Bullen. Annexed to Mr Mwangi's affidavit was a statutory declaration made by the plaintiff on 21 October 2010. 

7Neither solicitor was required for cross-examination, and their evidence was unchallenged. The plaintiff, however, was cross-examined on his statutory declaration. 

8The essence of the explanation proffered by this evidence was that it was only when the plaintiff attended a conference with Mr Andrew Campbell of counsel on 8 March 2010 that he became aware that he might have a claim against the proposed second defendant in addition to his claim against the Nominal Defendant. Thereafter, steps were taken to lodge a Personal Injury Claim Form against the third party insurer of the proposed second defendant, and this was lodged within some 7 weeks. 

9It was contended for the plaintiff that this explanation was both full and satisfactory. The proposed second defendant contended that the explanation was neither full nor satisfactory. 
10A reference to a ""full and satisfactory explanation"" is dealt with in s 66(2) of the MAC Act , which provides: 

""In this Chapter, a reference to a full and satisfactory explanation by a claimant for non-compliance with a duty or for delay is a reference to a full account of the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of the claimant, from the date of the accident until the providing of the explanation. The explanation is not a satisfactory explanation unless a reasonable person in the position of the claimant would have failed to have complied with the duty or would have been justified in experiencing the same delay."" 

11Following the hearing on hearing on 27 October 2011, I reserved judgment. Within a few days, however, the plaintiff sought leave to re-open his case. That application came before me on 4 November 2011 when, by consent, a second affidavit made by Mario Piperides on 28 October 2011 was read, without opposition. Mr Piperides was not required for cross-examination, and I was informed that counsel for the proposed second defendant did not wish to make any further submissions on this new evidence. 

12In this second affidavit, Mr Piperides, provided further material by way of explanation for the delay, to which I will refer more fully below. The substance of his affidavit was to the effect that prior to the conference with counsel on 8 March 2011 he was not aware that the proposed second defendant might have been at fault so as to give rise to the need to advise the plaintiff to lodge a claim form against Mr Bullen as well as the Nominal Defendant. Nor did Mr Piperides discuss with the plaintiff, prior to that co nference, a possible claim against the proposed second defendant. 

13The issues for determination may be shortly stated: 


Was the account of the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of the plaintiff, from the date of the accident until the providing of the explanation, a full account? 

Would a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff have been justified in experiencing the same delay? 

14I will turn now to set out the relevant factual background. 


Factual background 
15Following his accident on 23 December 2008, the plaintiff first consulted a solicitor on 11 February 2009, when he had a meeting with Mr Piperides of Benjamin and Robinson. 

16According to Mr Piperides, the plaintiff told him that the accident occurred when he was travelling in his vehicle in a southerly direction along the Bruxner highway in the vicinity of Ravensworth. An unidentified vehicle, which had been travelling in a northerly direction veered and crossed into the plaintiff's lane causing him to take evasive action to avoid an imminent head-on collision. As a result, the plaintiff's vehicle collided with a truck that was also travelling in a southerly direction ""in the merging lane"" adjacent to the lane in which the plaintiff's vehicle had been travelling. The driver of this truck is the proposed second defendant. 

17According to the plaintiff's statutory declaration, he told Mr Piperides the accident was caused by an unidentified vehicle which seemed to cross over into his lane and was coming towards him and as a result caused him to crash into the truck being driven by the proposed second defendant, which was coming out of a side street and merging into his lane. He was advised to make a claim against the Nominal Defendant, and did so. 

18There was nothing in the first affidavit of Mr Piperides, or the statutory declaration of the plaintiff, that explained what advice, if any, was given to the plaintiff about a potential claim against the proposed second defendant, the driver of the truck that the plaintiff's vehicle collided with, by reason of the evasive action taken. The result was that the court was left to speculate about whether the plaintiff was given any advice at all, by his solicitor, about the possibility of joining the truck driver to the proceedings, and if so, what that advice was. 

19It was not until the reading of Mr Piperides' second affidavit that this mystery was explained, when it was revealed that Mr Piperides did not give the plaintiff any advice about a potential claim against the proposed second defendant. Mr Piperides said: 

""When the Plaintiff first contacted me on 11 February 2009 he told me that the accident was caused by an unidentified vehicle travelling in the opposite direction. 

At that stage I was aware that the Plaintiff's vehicle had collided with a truck prior to running off the road.I did not attach further significance to this as the Plaintiff's instructions were that he collided with the truck as he was attempting to swerve to avoid colliding with the oncoming approaching unidentified vehicle. Accordingly steps were taken to proceed against the Nominal Defendant. 

At no stage prior to the Counsel's conference on 8 March 2010 did the Plaintiff and myself have a discussion involving a possible claim against the truck driver. 

At the initial conference with the Plaintiff had I believed that the truck driver was at fault I would have advised the Plaintiff to immediately lodge a claim form against the driver of the truck. 

W hen Counsel conferred with the Plaintiff on 8 March 2010, Counsel had available to him other documents provided by the NSW Police Service which suggested that the truck did not remain within the merging lane. That statement was not available to me at the initial conference with the Plaintiff."" 

20In his supplementary oral evidence given before me at the hearing on 27 October 2010, the plaintiff was asked when he first contemplated he might have a claim against the driver of the truck. He said it was a few months after seeing Mr Piperides, who told him that the possibility of a claim against the truck driver should be looked at. The unchallenged evidence from Mr Piperides was that this did not occur. I prefer the evidence of Mr Piperides. As a solicitor, his recollection is more likely to be accurate, and I accept that if Mr Piperides had become aware, prior to the conference on 8 March 2011, of the suggestion that Mr Bullen's truck had crossed over from the merging lane into the lane in which the plaintiff's vehicle was travelling, more probably than not he would have taken steps to ensure that a claim form was promptly lodged with the third party insurer of the truck, to protect the plaintiff's position. 

21I am satisfied, therefore, that it was not until the plaintiff attended the conference with the barrister retained, Mr Andrew Campbell, on 8 March 2010 that he was told there was a reasonable cause of action against the truck driver ""for turning out of Quarry Road and merging into my lane when it was not safe to do so"": 

""This was the first time that I had considered that the driver of the truck was negligent and I instructed my solicitors to immediately lodge a claim form against the relevant third party insurer for the truck..."" 

The relevant legal principles 
22The full account required by s 66(2) of the MAC Act is not limited to the claimant personally, without regard to those who acted on his behalf, in so far as that conduct was relevant to the delay: Walker v Howard [2009] NSWCA 408 at [72] and [106]. Nor is it limited to actions and it must include the knowledge and belief of the claimant: at [77]. 

23The word ""full"" has been held to be a word that must be given its semantic significance, and it means that the explanation must be set out and it is not sufficient that the court should be asked to draw inferences from correspondence, et cetera, at least where that is not obvious: Ellis v Reko Pty Limited [2010] NSWCA 319 at [19]. The explanation must address acts and omissions relevant to the delay, so as to enable the court to evaluate the reasons for the delay. 


Findings and conclusions 
24The material now before me provides what in my view is a full account of the actions undertaken by the claimant and his solicitors, and informs me as to the knowledge and belief of the claimant prior to the conference with counsel on 8 March 2010. In realistic terms, the plaintiff had no knowledge as to a potential claim against the proposed second defendant. It was his belief that it was the driver of the unidentified vehicle who caused his accident. 

25So far as the solicitors were concerned, the question of possible fault on the part of the truck driver did not occur to them. To be fair to them, it was not until the material obtained from the police became available and was considered in detail by counsel that the possibility became clear to anyone. 

26The reason for the failure to make a claim against the truck driver before the time it was made has now been fully explained. In short, the explanation for the delay is a full explanation. 

27The next question is whether a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff would have been justified in experiencing the same delay. Obviously, if the solicitors advising the plaintiff did not know he might have a claim against the proposed second defendant, and gave him no advice in that regard, the plaintiff was justified in not doing anything before he did. 

28I find, therefore, that the court has been provided with a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay. Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to bring and maintain proceedings against the proposed second defendant. 

29The plaintiff's motion therefore succeeds and t he motion filed for the proposed second defendant is dismissed. 

30The costs of the motion s should not follow the event. 

31Up until the plaintiff's case was re-opened, the explanation for the delay was in my view less than full. It was not until the reading of Mr Piperides' second affidavit that a full explanation was provided. In those circumstances, I consider, in the exercise of my discretion as to costs, that the plaintiff should pay the costs of the proposed second defendant in respect of both motions. 

32I therefore order that the plaintiff be given leave to join Mr Bullen as the second defendant, and to file the proposed Amended Statement of Claim annexed to his motion filed on 30 June 2011. 

33I order the plaintiff to pay the costs of the proposed second defendant in respect of both motions. 

Note: The Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 provide (Rule 36.11) that unless the Court otherwise orders, a judgment or order is taken to be entered when it is recorded in the Court's computerised court record system. Setting aside and variation of judgments or orders is dealt with by Rules 36.15, 36.16, 36.17 and 36.18. Parties should in particular note the time limit of fourteen days in Rule 36.16.

2758148,R v Singh [2011] NSWSC 1371,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: On the morning of 29 December 2009 the badly burnt body of the deceased, Ranjodh Singh, was found beside a road at Willbriggie, near Griffith NSW. He was clad in only a t-shirt and was not wearing shoes. His feet and hands were bound. He had major stab wounds to his neck which were identified as the cause of death.
	
	
	The last persons reported to have seen the deceased alive were Harpreet Singh, the applicant, Gurpreet Singh (""Gurpreet"") and Harpreet Kaur Bhullar (""Bhullar""). They are jointly charged with his murder. The applicant seeks a separate trial from Gurpreet and/or Bhullar.
	
	
	The trial is currently listed to commence at Albury on 20 February 2012 with a four week estimate. Many of the witnesses will require the assistance of an interpreter. Each of the accused speaks English but an interpreter was provided for them in the committal proceedings.
	
	
	In early January 2010 all three accused made statements to police to the effect that on 28 December 2009 they were at a party to celebrate the applicant's birthday at Gurpreet and Bhullar's flat at 6/69 Kookora Street, Griffith. Another couple were also guests at the party, as was the deceased. According to what the accused told police, at around midnight the deceased left the flat very drunk and in an agitated state claiming that he was going to drive to Albury and he had not returned by the time they went to bed. They had not seen or spoken to him since.
	
	
	Although the Crown is unable to appoint specific conduct on the part of any one of the accused in the acts that caused the death of the deceased, it is the Crown case that they agreed that he would be killed and that they were in Bhullar's car when he was driven to the place where his charred body was ultimately found. There was no blood or DNA of the deceased found in Bhullar's car. There was no blood in the flat. No weapon has been recovered. No accelerant has been found. The evidence from autopsy supports the proposition that the deceased was set alight whilst still alive.
	
	
	The case against the applicant is circumstantial. It is based entirely on the evidence of: the sighting of three people in a car matching the car registered to Bhullar within 8km of the vicinity of where the deceased's body was found at 9.10am on 29 December 2009; the same or a similar vehicle being cleaned at a carwash at 3.18am that morning and again later that day; and the tyres on Bhullar's car being replaced the following day. The Crown also relies upon the improbability of the deceased having been killed in such violent circumstances by a stranger and the opportunity the accused had to commit the offence being in his company when he was last seen by the other guests at the party.
	
	
	The same evidence is to be led against Bhullar and Gurpreet. However in their cases the Crown relies upon their admission to Bhullar's sister of their complicity in the murder of the deceased in terms that directly implicate the applicant as the person who insisted that he be killed and his body be disposed of and that he was the killer. She goes further and alleges that the applicant said that she would be killed if she refused and that she was fearful that he would carry out the threat. Despite the fact that Bhullar's sister claimed no memory of the conversation when she gave evidence at the committal hearing, under cross-examination by the prosecutor pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, she confirmed that the conversation with Bhullar, set out in detail in her police statement, was what her sister had told her in Gurpreet's presence. That evidence is of significant probative weight in the Crown case against Bhullar and Gurpreet. It is not admissible against the applicant but it is, self evidently, highly prejudicial not simply by the nomination of him as the killer but because of Bhullar's claim that she and Gurpreet participated in the murder under the threat of themselves being killed if they did not assist..
	
	
	I was informed by the applicant's counsel that senior counsel for the accused Bhullar intends to advance the defence of duress at trial supported by other evidence in the Crown case that the applicant has a reputation for violence, that he has used stand-over methods in the past in securing advantage over others of various kinds, and that he has a criminal record consistent with his reputation. The Crown does not rely upon this evidence as tendency evidence in the applicant's trial.
	
	
	The application for separate trials proceeded on the Crown case statement being an accurate summary of the evidence available to the Crown against the applicant. The material parts of that statement follow.
	
	
	The applicant was living in Wagga with the deceased at the time of his murder. He contracted labourers to local farms in the region many of whom were in Australia on work visas from India. The deceased, Gurpreet and Bhullar were engaged by the applicant as contract workers and became friends in that connection.
	
	
	On 27 December 2009 all three accused and the deceased were seen together at Wagga. Later that day they travelled back to Griffith in a 1995 red Ford Falcon sedan bearing registration plates BB04YX. This vehicle was registered to Bhullar. It had a rear spoiler installed on the back of the vehicle. She received a traffic infringement notice for speeding on the Stuart Highway that afternoon.
	
	
	On 28 December the three accused and the deceased were seen again together at a local bottle shop and purchasing cake making ingredients for the applicant's birthday the following day.
	
	
	On returning to Gurpreet and Bhullar's flat, the applicant, the deceased and Gurpreet started drinking alcohol. Bhullar did not drink. At about 10.30pm two other guests joined the birthday celebrations. .They left at about midnight, shortly after the deceased left. His departure from the flat at that time was confirmed by the two guests. It would appear to be common ground that he was at that time very drunk.
	
	
	At 2.45am on 29 December a motor vehicle described as ""a red Ford Falcon sedan EF model with a rear spoiler on the back"" was seen driving slowly in a l00km zone along a road near a nominated intersection near Griffith. There were three people in the vehicle with one person seated in the rear passenger seat on the left-hand side.
	
	
	Another witness gave evidence that he heard the sounds of a very loud car halfway between where the deceased's body was later located and that same intersection. When tested by police, Bhullar's red Ford Falcon was recorded as emitting noise over the decibel limit.
	
	
	At 3.18am Bhullar's red Ford Falcon entered a commercial carwash at Griffith. Although the available CCTV footage does not positively identify any of the accused, the driver of the vehicle did not leave the vehicle whilst a male said to be the applicant got out of the car on the left-hand side rear passenger door while another male said to be Gurpreet was seen to get out of the front passenger seat. The, person said to be the applicant washed the vehicle with the use of the high-pressure washer for a period of five minutes before getting back into the car.
	
	
	At 3.50am, at a point approximately 8km from the intersection referred to above, a witness saw three small spot fires no more than 30cm high and 15 cm wide. At 9.10am the body of the deceased was located at or near where the spot fires were seen.
	
	
	Between 4am and 5am Gurpreet contacted Bhullar's employer and advised that she was unable to attend work because they had been up at a party all night and she was too tired.
	
	
	A resident of the same block of flats where Bhullar and Gurpreet lived and where the party was held on 28 December gave evidence that at approximately 3am on 29 December she heard a thumping noise followed by a large thud from their flat and that half an hour later she heard a car return to that flat. She gave evidence of hearing no other noises. The Crown case is that this witness is mistaken as to time but that otherwise her evidence is supportive of something happening in the flat after which the three accused left with the deceased in Bhullar's car with the intention of killing him away from the premises and disposing of his body.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 29 December Gurpreet and Bhullar returned to the car wash where they were seen to park in the vacuuming bay. They spent a considerable amount of time inspecting the boot compartment after which they cleaned the boot including wiping around the rubber seals. Gurpreet was seen to remove the mats from the vehicle and vacuum them.
	
	
	That same afternoon Gurpreet sought to purchase four new tyres of the same brand and model as those already installed on the red Ford Falcon. When he inspected the tyres he advised Gurpreet that they did not need replacing, however Gurpreet insisted that they be replaced. The proprietor was unable to supply the same brand and offered another brand.
	
	
	In the late evening of 29 December Gurpreet and Bhullar visited the deceased's aunt and told her that the deceased had left their flat around midnight the previous night and they had not seen him since. It would appear that by this time there was extensive media coverage in the local and national media of the location of the burnt body of the deceased although, at that time his identity was unknown. The media released details of the distinctive ""GVL"" lettering on the front of the t-shirt worn by the deceased appealing to any person who may be able to identify the deceased by his shirt. The applicant notified police that the distinctive t-shirt was his, as a result of which police organised him to provide a statement. He gave a lengthy statement on 1 January 2010.
	
	
	Efforts by the deceased's family to have Gurpreet and Bhullar contact the police and tell them what they knew of his movements were resisted. They maintained what the Crown maintains was a false belief that the deceased would eventually turn up. The deceased's aunt eventually went to the police on 31 December and reported the deceased missing. He was identified soon thereafter.
	
	
	When Gurpreet and Bhullar learnt that the applicant was making a statement to police, they travelled to Wagga and waited outside the police station for him to complete his statement before the three returned to Griffith. Gurpreet and Bhullar also gave statements to police over the next couple of days. Inconsistencies between the three accounts and the information concerning the movements of the red Ford Falcon in the early hours of the morning of 29 December motivated police to impound the car on 3 January 2010.
	
	
	After delivering the car to the police station at the request of police Gurpreet and Bhullar unsuccessfully attempted to purchase bus tickets to travel to Sydney that evening.
	
	
	In the early morning of 4 January. Bhullar contacted her family by telephone in India and told them she had been involved in a motorcar accident and someone had been killed. She was advised by them to leave the country and travel home. It was at this time that Bhullar contacted her sister and made arrangements to meet with her in Sydney.
	
	
	Later that morning Gurpreet and Bhullar purchased one-way plane tickets to Sydney and upon arrival in Sydney purchased one-way tickets to Nepal. An airport alert resulted in their removal from the aircraft and their arrest. They were offered the opportunity to be interviewed which they declined. They were then released from custody.
	
	
	On 5 January 2010 Gurpreet and Bhullar met with Bhullar's sister. On 28 January 2010 she made a statement to police in which she gave the following account of the conversation she had with the accused Bhullar. Gurpreet was present throughout the conversation:
	


[Bhullar] said to me, ""Our phones and passports are with police. On that day we had a party at home. There were other guys drinking. They were [the applicant], the deceased, another man and his wife, two other males and Gurpreet. Gurpreet and the deceased were really drunk. They had no idea what was happening. [The applicant] and the deceased had a fight. They were abusing each other and [the applicant] bashed the deceased. The couple and other males stopped [the applicant] and settled the situation. [The applicant] got up and left. Some time later everyone else left. About half an hour later [the applicant] came back. The deceased, Gurpreet and I were at home. The deceased opened the door. [The applicant] made Gurpreet and the deceased drink more. After that Gurpreet and the deceased were so drunk that they were nearly unconscious. [The applicant] said, ""I'm going to kill him. I'm not gonna let him go"". I said to [the applicant], ""don't do this in our house. If you want to do it then do it somewhere else"". [The applicant] then took [our] mobile phones. [The applicant] said to me, ""If you don't help me, I'll kill you as well"". [The applicant], Gurpreet and the deceased sat in the car. I drove the car. Gurpreet and the deceased were really drunk. They had no idea what was happening. I don't know how [the applicant] killed him and how he burnt him. When [the applicant] came back home, he had a knife on him which he burnt when he came back home. The next day [the applicant] got up and left. (emphasis added)


	
	Between 29 December 2009 and 4 January 2010 there was a large amount of telephone contact between each of the three accused with some lengthy timed calls between 2 January 2010 and the arrest of Gurpreet and Bhullar.
	
	
	The principles to be applied in considering an application for separate trial are well settled. As the applicant's counsel succinctly put it - there is a rule, and an exception to the rule. The onus is on the applicant for a separate trial to establish the grounds for granting the order.
	
	
	Where the Crown case is that the accused were parties to a joint enterprise (as is the case here) the starting point is that they should be tried jointly (Webb & Hay v R [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41). This has particular application in cases when two or more co-accused attempt to place the blame on each other.
	
	
	The present case does not however easily fit the characterisation of a ""cut-throat defence"" since Bhullar intends to raise the defence of duress, with the applicant identified as the source of the threat to kill her if she did not assist, whereas the applicant's case, as I understand it, is that he knows nothing of the fate of the applicant after he left the party drunk (and wearing his t-shirt) and failed to return. Whether Bhullar raises the defence of duress wholly reliant on what she said to her sister coupled with what she otherwise knew of the applicant's reputation for violence (and what she can undoubtedly prove to be his reputation for violence from witnesses to be called in the Crown case and by the tender of the criminal record in her case), or whether she gives evidence and is cross-examined, it would appear, on the material before me, that she has a reasonable prospect of discharging the evidentiary onus of establishing duress. The onus is then on the prosecution to eliminate any reasonable possibility that she joined the criminal enterprise to kill the deceased because of the threat that the applicant would kill her, such threats being continuing and effective up until the time of the killing.
	
	
	Public policy considerations also favour a joint trial of co-accused to avoid a situation where inconsistent verdicts might be returned because separate trials are convened. The economic and efficient use of court time and community resources in the administration of justice, coupled with the avoidance of inconvenience to lay witnesses, is also to be considered. In this case, the applicant concedes that is a factor militating in favour of a joint trial given the expense involved in convening two trials where, save for some exceptions, the same body of evidence will need to be called in each trial with the additional time and expense involved in the use of interpreters and where many of the witnesses may prefer either not to be called, or to find a way of avoiding being called, coming from within the community of largely itinerant workers on working visas from India in the Griffith/Wagga region.
	
	
	While the cost and convenience correlatives carry significant weight on an application for separate trials, in determining whether a separate trial should be ordered, appropriate weight must also be given to ensuring, as far as is possible, that the applicant has a fair trial. An accused will be denied the right of a fair trial (and the administration of justice will be undermined carrying with it the potential of a successful appeal and a retrial) if it can be fairly said that there is a real risk that a positive injustice will result from a joint trial.
	
	
	In R v Middis (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 27 March 1991) Hunt J drew together the various principles to be applied in determining when trials should be separated. Those principles have been cited with approval and applied in a succession of cases, most recently in the Madubuko v R [2011] NSWCCA 135. They are:
	



	
	The evidence against the applicant is significantly weaker than, and different to, that which is admissible against another co-accused with whom he is to be tried;
	
	
	The evidence against the other accused contains material which is highly prejudicial to the applicant, although not admissible against him; and
	
	
	There is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material.
	



	
	On the hearing of the application, and after taking into account the submissions of the applicant's counsel and, in particular, his reliance upon the content of the applicant's criminal record and its likely tender at trial in Bhullar's case, the Crown Prosecutor properly conceded that the first and second prerequisites in Middis have been made out. Argument was then focused on the degree of risk that the admittedly weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material and whether emphatic judicial directions are sufficient to guard against a jury misusing the material.
	
	
	In R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 at [38-40] Adams J considered that two phrases in the statement of the Middis principle needed some further explanation. He said as follows:
	


[39] Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, ""immeasurably"" usually connotes something of such an enormous degree that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant ""significant, though incommensurable"". The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to ""positive injustice"". Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that the inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence.

[40] I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant's case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender's case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case since, if the co-accused's case was weak, or weaker than the applicant's, the prejudicial evidence might well assume even more importance than otherwise. As it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury's consideration of the applicant's case.


	
	In Madubuko, Hodgson JA (Hoeben and Hall JJ agreeing) agreed with the analysis of the principles undertaken by his Honour in the passage extracted above. Hodgson JA said at [32]:
	


In my opinion the primary question is whether there was a significant risk that prejudicial material in the ROI, which was not

admissible against the appellant, could have turned a potential acquittal to a conviction. If that was the case, this could amount to a positive injustice requiring the ordering of separate trials.


	
	In both Pham and Madubuko, of course, the Court was engaged in considering whether a positive injustice resulted from the joint trial of the appellants. Where an application for separate trials is made before trial^ the test of whether a potential acquittal is converted to a conviction by the admission of prejudicial and inadmissible material must necessarily be predictive. In some cases it might only be in the trial itself that the positive injustice to which Adams J referred materialises.
	
	
	The question highlighted on the present application is whether I can predict with reasonable confidence the way in which a joint trial of these three accused is likely to be conducted and that a positive injustice will likely result unless the trials are separated.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown on the hearing of the application (although currently not the Crown Prosecutor at trial) confirmed the intention of the Crown to call Bhullar's sister and the expectation that she would be cross-examined with leave given her partisan presentation in the committal proceedings. The Crown also submitted that the jury would be invited by the Crown to accept the sister's evidence as reliable despite the need for her to be cross-examined, it being unlikely to be fabricated or in any way contaminated by suggestion of any kind and because it was made within a week of the murder. The fact that it was made in circumstances where Gurpreet and Bhullar had unsuccessfully sought to leave the jurisdiction (and where their flight would be led against them as consciousness of guilt) was also said to add to its probative weight in proof of their guilt.
	
	
	In so far as the issue of duress is concerned, it was anticipated that the Crown submission at trial will be that the defence is not made as a matter of law (even if the evidential burden is discharged) given the extent of contact between each of the three accused in the hours and days following the murder and what appears to be their collective effort in producing a false account to police. Importantly, however, the Crown will not submit that Bhullar was misstating the circumstances surrounding the killing when she spoke to her sister, or that she falsely accused the applicant of applying pressure to her to assist in the killing or falsely nominated him as the killer. Rather, the submission will be that even if all that Bhullar told her sister were true, it did not amount to duress as a matter of law.
	
	
	The applicant's counsel confirmed his current intentions not to cross-examine Bhullar's sister at trial. Despite the hugely prejudicial import of the evidence, since it is not lead against his client to ask any questions of her would likely be counterproductive to the trial judge's directions to the jury that the evidence was inadmissible against him and that they are obliged to ignore it as evidence of his guilt. Counsel intends to take the same approach to the evidence Bhullar's counsel intends to lead from various Crown witnesses, including police officers, of the applicant's tendency to violence (including threats to kill others if they did not abide by his wishes). He did not suggest that the tender of the applicant's criminal record can be challenged as inaccurate.
	
	
	Despite the considered approach of the applicant's counsel, there is no doubt that considerable focus will be directed in both the Crown case and the defence case of the co-accused to proving the truth and reliability of inadmissible and highly prejudicial evidence both implicating the applicant in the murder of the deceased in circumstances and proving his bad character where in a separate trial that evidence will not be led.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I am unable to see how even the most emphatic and repeated directions from the trial judge can guard against the risk that a jury may misuse the inadmissible material, or at least be unable to effectively separate the issues they are asked to resolve in the case of the co-accused on the evidence admissible in their cases and the issues that arise on the very different evidence tendered by the Crown to prove the applicant's guilt.
	
	
	I am satisfied the applicant has demonstrated a proper basis for the trial of the applicant to be heard separately from Gurpreet and Bhullar and so order.

2758158,NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION v COOK [2011] NSWSC 1348,"Judgment 

HALL J: 

The proceedings 

1The New South Wales Crime Commission ( ""the Commission"" ) commenced proceedings in this Court under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 ( ""the Act"" ) by way of Summons filed on 18 July 2011. In it, the Commission sought orders under the Act including, in particular, proceeds assessment order under s.27. 

2On 26 August 2011, the Commission sought and was granted leave to file an Amended Summons. The amendments related to orders sought under s.10A (a restraining order) and s.22 (an assets forfeiture order) of the Act as well as the inclusion of an additional schedule, Schedule 3, which included particulars of real property. 

3The order claimed under s.27 by the Commission in the Amended Summons was in terms that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of proceeds allegedly derived from illegal activities of the defendant that took place not more than six years before the making of the application. 

4At the hearing on 26 August 2011, the defendant, Ms Cook, sought and obtained leave to rely upon a Notice of Motion dated that day in which an order was sought in the following terms:- 

""1. That pursuant to s.10B(3) of the Act, the restraining order make provision for meeting the reasonable legal expenses of the Defendant, agreed at $10,000 out of the property specified in Schedule 2 hereto, such sum to be paid to Philip Sim & Associates."" 

Facts 

5A Statement of Facts and Circumstances was filed with the Summons. Annexed to that Statement was a Police Facts Sheet which revealed that on 26 May 2011, the defendant was stopped by police on the Pacific Highway near Nabiac. Her vehicle was searched by police and the following were found:- 

(1) A loaded revolver. 

(2) A small quantity of cannabis leaf. 

(3) Four mobile phones. 

(4) $100,850 in cash (plus $3,200 in the defendant's handbag). 

6The defendant was subsequently charged with offences including an offence of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime. 

7On 19 July 2011, the defendant's solicitor, Mr Philip Sim, entered an appearance on her behalf. 

8On 16 August 2011, Mr Sim wrote to the Commission suggesting a settlement. 

9Mr I Temby QC, who appeared on behalf of the Commission, explained in the present proceedings that the Commission wished to enter into a consent order by which an amount of $10,000 was to be paid out to the defendant or her solicitor by way of reasonable legal expenses pursuant to s.10B(3)(b) of the Act and the balance of the property be forfeited to the State. 

10The question posed in the present proceedings is whether an order for legal expenses can be made by consent under s.10B(3)(b) notwithstanding that s.16A(1) has not been complied with. 

The relevant statutory provisions 

11Section 3 of the Act sets of the principal objects of the Act. They are stated as including:- 

""(a) to provide for the confiscation, without requiring a conviction, of property of a person if the Supreme Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person has engaged in serious crime related activities; and 

(b) to enable the proceeds of serious crime related activities to be recovered as a debt due to the Crown ... 

..."" 

12Section 5 states that, for the purposes of the Act, proceedings on an application for a restraining order or a confiscation order are not criminal proceedings. 

13Part 2 - Restraining Orders - contains provisions that relate to applications for and the determination of applications for restraining orders. An application for a restraining order must be supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating the matters set out in s.10A(5). 

14Section 10B, so far as is relevant to the present proceedings, provides:- 

""10B(1) A restraining order does not apply to an interest in property acquired after the order is made unless the order expressly provides that it does so apply. 

(2) The Supreme Court may, when it makes a restraining order and if it considers that the circumstances so require, order the NSW Trustee and Guardian to take control of some or all of the interests in property that are interests to which the restraining order applies. 

(3) A restraining order may, at the time it is made or at a later time, provide for meeting out of the property, or a specified part of the property, to which the order applies all or any of the following:- 

(a) the reasonable living expenses of any person whose interest in property are subject to the restraining order (including the reasonable living expenses of any dependents); 

(b) subject to s.16A , the reasonable legal expenses of any person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order, being expenses incurred in connection with the application for the restraining order or an application for a confiscation order, or including defending a criminal charge. 

..."" (emphasis added) 

15Section 16A of the Act entitled Restrictions on payment of legal expenses from restrained property imposes restrictions on the power to make provision for legal expenses of a person from restrained property. Section 16A, so far as relevant, is in the following terms:- 

""16A(1) The following restrictions apply to a restraining order making provision for the payment of any legal expenses of a person:- 

(a) no provision is to be made except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied that the person cannot meet the expenses concerned out of the person's unrestrained property, 

(b) no provision is to be made in relation to any particular interest in property if the Supreme Court is satisfied that the interest is illegally acquired property, 

(c) no provision is to be made unless a Statement of Affairs disclosing all the person's interests in property and liabilities and verified on oath by the person has been filed with the Supreme Court, 

(d) no provision is to be made unless the Supreme Court is satisfied that the person has taken all reasonable steps to bring all of the person's interests in property within the jurisdiction of the Court, 

(e) any such provision must specify the particular interest in property out of which the expenses concerned may be met. 

..."" 

16On 16 August 2011, Mr Sim wrote to the Commission proposing a settlement. A copy of the letter was tendered and marked in the present proceedings as Exhibit A. 

17In the letter, Mr Sim wrote:- 

""... 

We refer to matters presently before the Supreme Court brought by the NSW Crime Commission against our client Jenifer Cook. 

With a view to settling this matter without the need for litigation, and the substantial costs that can flow as a result of that litigation, we are instructed to make the following offer in settlement. From the $100,850.00 cash seized by Police, the payment to this firm of $10,000.00 representing the payment of legal costs to our client. These costs will cover the matter commenced by the NSW Crime Commission against our client, and also the legal costs relating to charges brought by the NSW Police. 

The balance is to be forfeited to the State of New South Wales. We have engaged the services of Peter Lander of Counsel to assist in this matter. The funds will form part of legal costs to our client in properly attending to both the civil and criminal proceedings. 

Please advise as to whether you would be agreeable to the above proposal. 

..."" 

Submissions 

18In his written submissions, Mr Temby stated:- 

""13. The consent of the parties establishes all facts necessary to the granting of the relief sought. This Court is not put upon enquiry unless and to the extent the Commission seeks to invoke by way of opposition any particular part of s.16A(1), which it does not do. It is, accordingly, submitted that the order sought can be made by consent."" 

19Mr Temby observed that compliance with the provisions of s.16A would not always be practicable. Alternatively, compliance could give rise to difficulty and expense. In the present case, it was noted the defendant resided in Queensland. 

20In support of his submissions, Mr Temby referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in International Finance Trust Company Limited v NSW Crime Commission (No 2) [2010] NSWCA 46, a case involving the provisions of s.27(2) of the Act. My attention was also drawn to the judgment of Carruthers AJ in New South Wales Crime Commission v MacDonnell [2000] NSWSC 913. I have considered the judgments in both cases. 

21Mr Sim supported the arguments advanced on behalf of the Commission. 

The International Finance Trust case 

22In that case, orders were made by consent by the only parties whose interests were affected, the Commission and a Mr Grimaldi. The appeal in the case raised a question concerning the proper construction of s.27 of the Act . A ""proceeds assessment order"" made under s.27 requires the person to whom it is directed (in that case Mr Grimaldi) to pay to the Treasurer ""an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person that took place not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order"" : s.27(1). 

23A proceeds assessment order is to be made in accordance with the provisions of s.27 and s.28 of the Act. 

24Before considering the issue to be decided in the present proceedings, I turn to consider the basis for the decision in International Finance Trust (supra). It was submitted in that case that s.27(2) provided that a proceeds assessment order must be made if the Court ""finds"" it to be more probable than not that the defendant engaged in relevant crime related activity. It was submitted for the appellants (who were two of a number of defendants) that the requirements for a s.27 order had to be satisfied by evidence adduced in the ordinary way. However, the opposing submission for the Commission was as follows:- 

""... It can be satisfied on the basis of an admission, and such an admission will be conveyed by a party's entering into consent orders. There are two reasons for this. First: the term 'finds' is not confined to findings on evidence and includes, for example, findings based on admission. Secondly, and independently: there is a presumption that the vesting of jurisdiction in the Court carries with it all the normal incidents of the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court: it is a normal incident of the Court's processes that it may proceed to judgment by way of orders made by consent to settle a dispute and the Act should not be construed as preventing parties from resolving disputes arising under the Act by a settlement in the ordinary way."" (Written Submissions for the New South Wales Crime Commission in proceedings 40386 of 2009 dated 22 October 2009 at [14]). 

25It was also submitted on behalf of the Commission that as part of the usual incidents of its proceedings, the Court may, by consent, make orders that reflect an ""agreed liability"" even if the agreed amount is a commercial or other compromise and not strictly referrable to what might be provable in a contested trial. This was the position, it was submitted, with respect to a proceeds assessment order made by consent. In other words, it was contended that such an order can be for an amount agreed upon by the parties for the purpose of settling the proceedings against them: Written Submissions of the Commission at [18]. 

26The appellants in International Finance Trust (supra) sought to impugn the consent orders that had been made by a Deputy Registrar in the Common Law Division. 

27The question that arose on the challenge by the appellants was whether, in the absence of relevant evidence or admissions by Mr Grimaldi, it was correct to say that the Court ""had no jurisdiction"" to make the proceeds assessment order. 

28Basten JA (with whom Allsop P and McClellan CJ at CL agreed), observed:- 

""58. The appellant's submitted that the parties could not consent to orders, absent agreement as to a sufficient factual basis upon which the orders could be made, which in turn required advertence to the relevant legal requirements in subs-s 27(2) and (2B). It was apparent, they argued, from the material placed before the Deputy Registrar that there was no agreement as to matters critical to the making of such orders. The consent of Mr Grimaldi, as the person whose property was the subject of the proposed orders, was not sufficient, the appellants said, to overcome any absence of findings as to the basis upon which the orders might properly be made."" 

29Basten JA, however, observed that the allegations that had been made in relation to the matters that were relevant to s.27(2), if admitted or made good, would satisfy the requirements of s.27(2). In such a case, the Court ""must"" make a proceeds assessment order. 

30Section 27(2B) provides for a restriction on the Court making a proceeds assessment order in an application that relates wholly to external serious crime related activity unless the proviso to that section is satisfied. It was apparent, however, in International Finance Trust (supra) that the offences in question, being offences under the Crimes Act 1900, did not involve ""external serious crime related activity"" as defined in s.4(1) of the Act. 

31Accordingly, Basten JA concluded, at [61], that it was clear that the application did not relate ""wholly to"" external serious crime related activity and s.27(2B) was not engaged. 

Consideration 

Restraining orders 

32The predecessor to s.10B(3)(b) was s.10(5)(b) which was the subject of observations made in New South Wales Crime Commission v Bazi [2009] NSWSC 88 (Hislop J). 

33In that case, orders had been made on the application of the Commission against the defendant under s.10 and s.10(4) of the Act. On a later date, an order was made pursuant to s.22 of the Act forfeiting to and vesting in the Crown the interests in property of Mr Bazi. 

34The defendant filed a Notice of Motion seeking various orders including an order relating to ""the making of provision for reasonable legal expenses pursuant to s.10(5) of the Act"" at [5(a)]. 

35An alternative order was sought for ""provision for reasonable legal expenses pursuant to the ancillary provisions in s.23(4) of the Act "" at [5(b)]. 

36The Commission opposed the order sought by the defendant. Its submissions were directed solely to the question of whether the Court had power to make the order sought. 

37The defendant and his solicitor had each apparently filed affidavits and reference was made to the fact that neither the defendant nor his solicitor were required for cross-examination on their affidavit: Bazi (supra) at [9]. Further, no submissions were made that, if there was power to make the order sought, the order and declaration should not be made. In particular, it was not submitted that the application should be refused on the basis of the restrictions in s.16A. The provisions of s.10(5) were in similar form to those now to be found in s.10B(3)(b). 

38One issue that had to be determined in that case was whether the defendant's interest in property was subject to a restraining order that had been made. A concession had been made on behalf of the plaintiff that confirmed the defendant's interest in the property and which was one that continued to be held pursuant to the restraining order made on 17 January 2006. 

39It was against that background that Hislop J concluded that the Court had power to make an order under s.10(5) of the Act ""... in the circumstances of this case"" . 

40I do not consider that the issue that presently arises in the present case was one that fell for determination by Hislop J in Bazi (supra). 

41In New South Wales Crime Commission v Fleming (1991) 24 NSWLR 116, the Court of Appeal (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Hope AJA) considered the provisions of s.10 and s.17 of the then Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act 1990. Section 10(5) of that Act provided for the making of a provision in a restraining order, for meeting out of the property in question or a specified part (a) the reasonable living expenses of the relevant person and (b) the reasonable legal expenses of the relevant person. In respect of the latter, there was, at the time Fleming (supra) was decided, no imposition of a requirement before making an order for expenses for consideration to be given to the restrictions now to be found in s.16A of the Act. As discussed below, such restrictions were later inserted. 

42Gleeson CJ, however, noted at 120-121 that the Court was required, when considering the subject of living expenses or legal expenses, to address the question of reasonableness having regard to the evident legislative policy behind the provisions. In that respect, the Chief Justice observed:- 

"" The policy behind this is obvious. The property involved is potentially subject to confiscation and forfeiture , and, whilst justice may dictate that the owner should not be deprived of the necessary means of meeting living expenses or legal expenses, that qualification only operates insofar as the expenses in contemplation are reasonable. Finally, except in one important respect which is the occasion of the present appeal, no standard or measure of reasonableness in relation to either living expenses or legal expenses is provided by the Act. The exception to that proposition is that, in the case of legal expenses, there is a provision whereby the resolution of actual or potential disputes as to what is reasonable may be facilitated by resort to a well-established procedure for dealing with disputes of that kind, that is to say, taxation of costs."" (emphasis added) 

43The present jurisdiction and power of the Supreme Court under the Act to make a restraining order is conferred by the provisions of s.10A(5) of the Act, Proceedings for restraining orders . The Court is required by those provisions to make such an order on an application made under that provision if the application is supported by an affidavit that meets the requirements specified in s.10A(5) or s.10A(6). 

44Section 10B, on the other hand, is concerned with the scope or contents and effect of restraining orders. As such, it is not, in my opinion, a jurisdictional provision. It is a facultative provision that confers a discretionary power on the Supreme Court to make provision in a restraining order for either or both of the two kinds of expenses identified in s.10B(3)(a) and (b) - living expenses and legal expenses (see relevant extracts of s.10B(3) set out in paragraph [14] above). 

45Section 10B(2), accordingly, confers a discretionary power upon the Supreme Court to, in effect, exempt out of the ""property"" or a part of the property, legal expenses incurred for the purposes specified in the section. Similar provisions appeared in s.10(5) of the former Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act , New South Wales Crime Commission v Younan (1993) 31 NSWLR 44 at 47. In that case, the Court noted the purposes of that Act, observing (at 49):- 

""What is required in each case is an exercise of the judicial discretion pursuant to the subsection. That discretion will take into account the purposes of the Act ( including the preservation of property allegedly derived in whole or in part from criminal activities ) and correlatively, the reasonable demands of a person for access to that person's own property for legal expenses incurred in defending criminal charges."" (emphasis added) 

46The power to exempt specified ""property"" from the operation of a restraining order under s.10B(3)(b) is not at large. That is evident, inter alia, from the phrase ""subject to s.16A"" appearing in s.10B(3)(b). 

47It is to be noted that, unlike s.10B(3)(b), s.10B(3)(a), which is concerned with ""reasonable living expenses"" , is not subject to restrictive provisions of the type to be found in s.16A. 

48The legislative history of s.16A may be briefly stated. The Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Amendment Act 1997 (No 68), Schedule 1, inserted into s.10(5)(b) of the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Act the phrase ""subject to section 16A"" before the phrase ""the reasonable"" . The provisions of s.10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act included a similar provision (that now appears in s.10B(3)) in s.10(5). 

49Section 16A is structured in terms of the restrictions specified in sub-paragraphs (a) to (e) therein. Each of the sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) commence with the phrase ""no provision is to be made ..."" . In relation to sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), the Court is required to consider the specified matters as indicated by the phrase ""is satisfied"" . The Court must, in other words, act on evidence or other material that makes it possible for the Court to reach the required state of satisfaction in relation to the matters to which sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) refer. Given the possible effect of any exemption upon the achievement of the purposes of the Act, which includes restraint on the disposal of property to abide orders under the Act, the Court has a designated role to be performed in that respect. It must have a proper basis upon which it can be satisfied of those matters. That is, in my opinion, consistent with the underlying rationale underpinning s.16A. 

50Section 27 is different in its terms, function and operation to s.10B(3)(b). It requires the Court to make a proceeds assessment order if the Court ""finds"" the matters to which reference is made in s.27(2). This includes that ""the person"" engaged in: ""(a) a serious crime related activity involving and indictable quantity, or (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more"" . 

51The Court is also required to have regard to the earlier provisions set out in s.27. 

52In International Finance Trust Company (supra), the Court of Appeal held that the preconditions to which s.27 referred could be satisfied by the consent of the parties. Accordingly, a ""person"" may make the necessary admissions in relation to the relevant ""serious criminal related activity"" . 

53However, as a matter of statutory construction, the mere fact that the Commission may reach agreement with a person referred to in s.10B(3)(b) as to legal expenses and consent to an order to give effect to such an agreement, cannot provide the required basis for the Court to reach the necessary state of satisfaction of the matters specified in s.16A or otherwise conclude that that section has been complied with in other respects. 

54The matters to which s.16A(1) are directed are not matters for which a person seeking provision for legal expenses can make any ""admission"" . They differ from matters to which an admission may be made of having engaged in a particular type of criminal activity as in an application for a s.27 proceeds assessment order. 

55Section 16A(1)(c) requires the Supreme Court, on an application made under s.10B, to be satisfied of the existence of discrete factual matters that enable the Court to conclude that the ""restrictions"" specified in s.16A(1) do not apply. Section 16A, in particular, makes it a mandatory requirement that a verified Statement of Affairs, addressing specified matters, is filed. The Court will be required to take into account the disclosed property interests and the liabilities of the person in question before any provision for legal expenses is made. 

56An agreement between the Commission and the relevant person cannot operate to overcome or set at nought the intractable terms of s.16A(1). It would, in my opinion, be open to argument that a consent order for legal expenses of a person referred to in s.10B(3)(b) made in a case where no verified Statement of Affairs as specified in sub-paragraph (d) has been filed would be invalid. 

57In International Finance Trust (supra), the sole question was whether, where the two affected parties consented to the orders, it was necessary for the Court to carry out its own inquiry as to the satisfaction of any statutory preconditions. 

58Basten JA noted in that case that the High Court in Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48; 148 CLR 150 at 164 had stated that a superior court generally has powers to make orders by consent without inquiry. 

59The circumstances in International Finance Trusts Company (supra), however, were such that it was clear that there was an admission as to the relevant matters under s.27(2) and from the record it was apparent that s.27(2B) did not have operation on the facts of that case. However, it is not possible, in my opinion, to conclude that Mr Sim's letter of 16 August 2011 (Exhibit A) or the terms of the proposed consent order contain either admissions or other material that satisfy the preconditions or the exemptions from the restrictions in s.16A(1). 

60It is appropriate at this point to examine the nature of the issue and the analysis of the High Court in Thomson Australian Holdings (supra). 

61There, the then Trade Practices Commission sued a number of persons alleging facts which would have constituted contraventions of s.45 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The defendants were corporations which sold liquor by retail from licensed hotels and from certain persons. It was alleged that the defendants were parties to and gave effect to an arrangement or understanding in restraint of trade or commerce whereby they recommenced to each other prices for the sale of liquor to the public from licensed hotels. 

62The parties to the proceedings agreed on terms of settlement which involved five defendants giving undertakings to the Court in similar terms and to the making against each defendant of consent orders in similar terms. 

63The appellant in that case disputed that s.80 of the Trade Practices Act authorised the grant of an injunction where the injunction is not limited to the contraventions of s.45. 

64The High Court determined that the provisions of the Trade Practices Act did not empower the Federal Court to grant injunctions restraining, or relating to, contraventions of the Trade Practices Act in situations falling outside the boundaries drawn by s.80 of that Act. 

65The Court held that the parties, by consent, could not confer power upon a Court to make orders which the Court lacked power to make. 

66It was stated in Thomson Australian Holdings (supra) at 164:- 

""... In deciding whether consent orders sought are in conformity with legal principle, the Court is entitled to treat the defendant's consent as involving an admission of all facts necessary or appropriate to the granting of the relief sought."" 

67However, this observation is not applicable, in my opinion, to the basis upon which an order may be made under s.10B(3)(b). As earlier discussed, there are, and can be, no ""admissions"" in the proposed consent order for the purpose of the Court determining whether the restrictions under s.16A apply or not. It is not, as earlier indicated, for the parties to determine whether or not the statutory restrictions apply. That is a matter that can only be resolved by a determination by the Supreme Court (as indicated, for example, by the use of the phrase ""is satisfied"" in the abovementioned sub-paragraphs of s.16A(1)). 

68In Thomson Australian Holdings (supra), Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ observed at 163:- 

""... However, we should not wish it to be thought that it was necessary for the appellant to show an absence of jurisdiction or power in order to succeed. The appellant as a party to the proceedings is entitled to argue that any order made by the Court should conform to legal principle. In the ordinary case where a third party in the appellant's situation is not a party to the proceedings, the Court will be justified in making consent orders, if it has jurisdiction and power to do so and the orders are such as to be capable of enforcement. Even in such a case, the Court would be justified in refusing to make the orders if they do not conform to legal principle. And in a case such as the present, when the third party has been joined in the proceedings, the Court should consider and decide whether the orders sought conform to principle ... "" (emphasis added) 

69It is, in my opinion, equally necessary for an order under s.10B(3)(b) to conform with the specified statutory requirements. 

Conclusion 

70I have concluded that, unlike the position with proceeds assessment orders under s.27, an order under s.10B(3)(b) of the Act is not one that can be made by consent of the Commission and another. It requires the Court itself, on a proper basis, to determine that an order under s.16A(1) of the Act meets the exemptions from the legislative requirements. 

71Accordingly, I do not consider that an order may be made by consent pursuant to the proposal set out in Exhibit A without evidence upon which the Court may consider the statutory restrictions. 

72The refusal of relief sought in the defendant's notice of motion would not, of course, preclude a further application being made, properly supported by evidence, establishing the matters to which s.16A is directed. 

73Accordingly, before proceeding to make final orders, I have decided the preferable course is to stand the motion over to a date to be determined in accordance with the paragraph below. 

Order 

74The proceedings are stood over for mention and directions on a date convenient to the parties by arrangement with my Associate.

		11 November 2011",2011-11-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758165,R v Gillard [2011] NSWDC 246,"Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: On 5 March 2003 Judge Shillingford sentenced David John Gillard to an overall sentence of eight years imprisonment with a five year nonparole period for twelve charges of indecent acts with four boys. Those offences had occurred in the Republic of the Philippines. Five days later he was also sentenced, as best I can tell, by a Local Court to a twelve month fixed term for the possession of child pornography. It would appear that sentence ran concurrently with the sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Shillingford.

2The offences against the four Philippine boys occurred during a period May 1999 and April 2001. From my reading of the material before Judge Shillingford it is likely his Honour came to a view the charged offences were not isolated paedophile incidents in The Philippines. 

3In July 2007 the offender was released to parole. There seems little doubt his conduct during and response to parole was exemplary. However, criminal offending from a deeper past caught up with him. In June 2010 he was arrested in respect of his sexually abusive conduct towards two brothers when babysitting them between May 1984 and December 1988. 

4Today he is to be held accountable for two acts of sexual intercourse without consent and one of attempted sexual intercourse without consent upon or against one, SB, then aged between ten and thirteen. There is also a final charge of his having sexual intercourse with BB without his consent knowing that he was not consenting at a time when that boy was then aged twelve.

5I am asked to take into account three further matters that have been placed on two Forms1. The first Form 1 contains admissions of guilt in respect of two offences of committing indecent acts on SB during the same period. The other contains an admission of guilt in respect of an offence of committing an indecent act upon BB during that period. 

6As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this Court committed by this offender harming these victims in their community; The Queen v Gladue [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of what is called the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to this offender, subjective matters they are called. The starting point for such assessment requires the sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the court relating to the offences and to the offender. 

7My fact finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the court a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve the judge from his, in my case, fact finding responsibility, it simply limits the material from which the facts may be found. To the extent if it be the case that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it. 

8An unusual feature of this case is the delay between the offending conduct and the sentencing disposition. That delay which causes an impact will need assessing. The offender's rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly.

9Before any sentence can be made there are other technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality, the role of the Form 1 matters, the length of the parole periods and the non-parole periods and finally of course the ultimate term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of those can be commenced until the primary facts are determined.

10What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined; see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.

FACTS

11Towards the end of 1981 the victims, SB aged seven and BB aged five, moved into Ravensworth Avenue, Airds, residing with their mother CB and their young sister KB. Some time in 1984 the mother met the offender, David Gillard, through a mutual friend who was receiving assistance from the offender. Soon after CB met the offender he offered to look after the boys and their sister on Thursday nights thereby allowing the mother to attend Campbelltown RSL Club to play bingo. 

12Within a short period of time he commenced attending their home arriving between 6.30 and 7pm. He would drive the mother to the Campbelltown RSL with the victims and their sister in the vehicle. She was dropped off there. At this point the boys with their sister would attend Mawson Park with the offender where they would play in the park or attend the Time Zone amusement centre where he would give them money to play the machines. He never gave the sister any money. However, on some occasions the offender would buy lollies for the children at the supermarket. About 9pm on those nights he would take the children or the boys and their sister to their residence whilst the mother stayed at the Campbelltown RSL. It was during this time that the offender would subject the boys to a number of sexual assaults/acts. 

13Sequence 1, sexual assault indecent act with person SB this is one of the Form 1 matters. On Thursday nights between 26 August 1984 and 26 August 1985, the offender attended the victim's home. In accordance with the routine established he took the mother to the Campbelltown RSL, the children to the Campbelltown Mall where he bought them lollies and then on to Time Zone amusement centre. After Time Zone he took the children to their home. At all relevant times the children were in his care. Shortly after they arrived home he said, ""It's bed time"". He put the sister to bed in her room. He told SB, ""I will be back to read you a book"", left the room and returned shortly. 

14He sat on the bed with SB, reading him a book. Upon finishing the book he laid down on the bed next to SB. Both were fully clothed with SB lying with his back to the offender. The offender reached around unzipped the boys pants pulling out and exposing his penis. The boy sat up and the offender pulled out a ten dollar note handing it to his victim. The offender pulled out his own penis and began rubbing and masturbating SB with his left hand and his own penis with his right. The offender let go of SB's penis and grabbed the boy's hand taking it to his own penis. SB immediately pulled his hand away from the offender. The offender pulled out a handkerchief from his pockets and wiped what was described as something white and can only have been ejaculate, from his stomach and penis. He left the bed and gave SB another ten dollar note then left the room.

15The second offence occurred, this is one of the offences I am dealing with from the committal document, it is the first of those offences, again on a Thursday night between August 1984 and August 1985. Again the mother had been taken to the Campbelltown RSL. On this occasion the children were taken to Mawson Park where they played on a merry-go-round and subsequently went to McDonald's where they had dinner before returning to their home. Again the children were in his care. Again he put, it is said, SB into his sister's bed. 

16The boy was lying down on the bed with the offender sitting next to him reading a book. The offender put the book down. At this point he was on the right side of the boy. The offender unzipped the boy's pants, took out and exposed the lad's penis. The offender commenced to masturbate the boy. He then pulled his own pants down and commenced to masturbate himself simultaneously with masturbating the boy. The child put a pillow over his head and then felt something warm on his penis. The child removed the pillow and looked up and saw the offender had his mouth on the child's penis. This caused SB to jump up in shock. The offender immediately pulled his pants up, took a twenty dollar note from the wallet and gave it to the child. He then left the room closing the door behind him.

17The next offence, sequence 3, is the second offence that the offender was committed for. Again it occurred on a Thursday night between 1984 and 1985. The routine was as before with the mother going to the Campbelltown RSL and the children with the offender to the Campbelltown Mall. Again they were bought lollies and taken to the Time Zone. After the Time Zone they were taken home. They were at all relevant times in the care of the offender. SB was aged ten at this time. 

18The offender put the child to bed in his own room. Shortly the offender entered the room closing the door behind him. The boy was lying on his bed and the offender came over and gave him a twenty-dollar note. The offender removed the boy's jeans and underwear. He then removed his own trousers and underwear. He entered the bed with the boy still there and with his right hand began rubbing and masturbating the child. He said to the boy, ""Roll over onto your side"". The child rolled over facing away from the offender and the offender attempted to insert his penis into the child's anus. The child clenched up and the offender stopped. The offender said to the child, ""Turn over and lay on your back"" and the boy did as he was told. The offender commenced to masturbate the child with his left hand and himself with his right. He ejaculated on himself, cleaned himself with a hanky, dressed, gave the child a further ten dollars and left the room.

19From that point on the child was subject to numerous assaults by the offender where he would assault the child and regularly give him money once he had finished assaulting the child. 

20The fourth offence occurs against the same child and this is offence number 3 on the committed offences. Between 1 August 1986 and 1 August 1987 SB was by this time aged twelve. The offender attended their home. It was either a Friday or a Saturday night. He took the children back to his home address in Moorebank. The drive from their home caused them to fear. At his own home there were no other persons present. After a short while SB was put into bed in a room of his own. He fell asleep and during the night he woke with the offender sucking his penis. Upon him waking the offender stopped, left the room and in the morning gave the boy a twenty dollar note. 

21The final offence that is before the Court in respect of SB is the second offence on the Form 1. Between August 1984 and December 1988 in the same circumstances as SB the victim BB suffered similar assaults by the offender. The offender put the boy to bed on his own as he would not let the other brother be in the same room at the same time. The offender sat on the bed next to the boy and started to massage his stomach and then would lower his hand down to the groin area of the child. The offender removed the victim's pants and commenced rubbing and masturbating him. The offender then gave him money, which would be made up of coins and/or notes and said, ""Let's keep this between us."" 

22The next offence, which is called offence number 6, is count 4 on the committal document. It is in respect of BB and it occurs on a Thursday night between August 1984 and December 1988. On at least two occasions the offender entered this child's room. There he removed the pants and underwear of the child and commenced to suck the boy's penis for about five minutes. This is said to happen on two occasions. I am in that sense dealing with that offence as a representative offence of two offences. 

23The other matter is an offence numbered 7 which is the Form 1 offence. By this time BB had commenced high school. He was put to bed by the offender and the offender entered the room and placed his own penis in the hand of the child and said, ""Play with it"". The boy did as he was told for about five minutes but stopped after that. The offender said to the child, ""Why did you stop for?"" The child rolled over hoping the offender would leave and shortly he left.

24On 9 June 2010 the offender attended the Campbelltown Police Station, I understand by arrangement. He was placed under arrest and introduced to the custody manager. A short time later he participated in an electronically recorded interview. He made admissions to being a regular visitor to the family home of these folk during the stated period but at that time denied any sexual involvement with either boy. He was charged with the matters before the Court.
 
OBJECTIVE CRIMINALITY
 
25From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing judge is required to assess what is called objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour undertaken by the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the present cases with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.

26The relevant provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) create offences specifically designed to protect children from offending adults. The purpose of the sections is the protection of young children from a range of unwelcome sexual experiences while their physical, emotional and psychosexual development is patently immature and the power of imbalance between the child on the one hand and the adult grossly favours the adult. Although I am dealing with offences in an absence of consent, in some of the sections consent of the victim is no defence. That is to highlight the importance of the protection of children. The absence of consent of course makes the offences worse. 

27Mr Justice Lee in describing what is called the jurisprudential philosophy behind the sections said this:

""One begins with a proposition that our community views with great concern the sexual molestation of children by adults and that has been acknowledged in the legislature by providing for greater penalties when the victim is under sixteen years of age. That acknowledgement has been in our legislation over a long period of time. Little children are entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from risk from psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life caused by such conduct"".

28These cases against these two boys are cases where there has been serious risk of and damage to the psychological equilibrium of both these boys, confusion and personal difficulties caused in their later lives. His Honour also made this observation highlighting the law's focus upon the power in-balance between adult males and younger children:

""The law has always sought to protect young children against sexual predators, particularly adult men. The law recognises...when it comes to a case of an adult male past middle age tampering with"" - and in his case his Honour was dealing with girls, in the case I am dealing with boys - ""of twelve and thirteen years of age"" - indeed of ten years of age in the case of SB - ""the crimes become crimes of enormity"", R v Zapella unreported NSWCCA 5 November 1991.""

29The sexual encounters that I am dealing with were without the complainants' consent. The children submitted because of the offender's persistence and the tidal wave of power imbalance. The power of an adult put in authority over children illustrated not just the offender's decision to have intercourse but the expectation that this offender entertained that his demands and actions would be met with acceptance and without show of resistance.

3030.These offences are gross invasions of the young children's right to privacy and their right to healthy sexual development. It is clear from the agreed facts that even at their tender age they were still distressed by and unwilling to be involved. They represented breach of trust by the babysitter towards those in his charge.

31Both the victims were closer to ten, indeed SB was ten. Both victims were closer to ten than to sixteen when the sexual offending began. In respect of SB the offences I am dealing with were not the totality of sexual contact. In respect of BB the position is less clear. In his victim impact statement he makes it clear that there was significantly more offending than would appear from the agreed facts. 

32The offender's payments, sometimes before and sometimes after and sometimes both before and after, are to be seen as part of an ongoing grooming process. The money was a reward for participating in the sexual conduct. Clearly a condition of that ongoing contact was an expectation of silence by the boys verbalised on one occasion with SB. 

33There was a realisation by the offender his criminal conduct may have been impacting adversely upon his victims and a decision to continue because he believed no harm would be long term harm. Such a decision was callous. But it also represented a rationalisation by him to justify his behaviour and a refusal to face the reality of real deep seated long term harm upon the psychosexual development of these boys for purposes of his own sexual gratification. 

34It is suggested by the Crown he occupied a ""father"" role towards these boys. While I accept his conduct was a serious breach of trust and made hypocrisy of his kindness to the mother, I reject that his role within the family ever amounted to that of a surrogate father. The evidence discloses the role of a regular babysitter who facilitated the mother's absence from the home. It is only in the last offence against SB that there is any suggestion of the boys leaving the home.

35The Crown submitted the offences were forced upon the children. It is important to identify the nature of force. It is not suggested any threat or physical menace was used or required. The nature of the force was the callous exercise of adult willpower, authority and influence to overcome the bewilderment, apprehension and uncertainty of the child. In fairness to the offender whenever rejection was expressed appears to have desisted. But rejection is a position that can be reached long after an absence of consent. Bewilderment, apprehension and uncertainty are hallmarks of an absence of juvenile consent. Rejection is an expressed and certain declaration of the absence of consent. A belief that a victim may not mind what I do does not constitute consent, but rather a rationalisation devoid of reality permitting a paedophile to swage his conscience while he gratifies his deviant sexual urges.

36Both parties regarded the attempted penetration of SB's anus as the worst of the offending. Certainly had the penetration succeeded there could be little doubt about the intrusion into the body of the boy would have constituted a far more serious offence then the fellatio performed upon him. One measure of criminality associated with attempts is the steps taken and the steps remaining to have completed the relevant offence. In this case the major steps of penetrating the anus still remained to be done. Consequently the duration of the offending conduct was cut short. No doubt the attempt created seriously heightened bewilderment, apprehension, fear, trauma and uncertainty. By contrast several minutes were spent fellating him on each occasion prolonging the alarm and confusion for a young SB.

37In accepting both parties submissions it should not be thought I am minimising the seriousness of the fellatio offences. In the cases involving the boy SB it should be recognised that the course of conduct appears to have run from 1984 to 1987. As earlier noted in the agreed facts it also appears more prolific than the offending against BB, although as I said earlier BB's victim impact statement a different conclusion would have been available.

38While it is not appropriate to seek to punish that offending when dealing with individual offences, that is the non-charged offending when dealing with the individual offences that have been charged, those individual offences do become aggravated because each, but for the first, is committed against a background that each falls into an ongoing course of conduct. The offending can be regarded as predatory in that the offender encouraged and facilitated the absence of the mother so that he could have sole access to the children for extended periods on a regular basis. Part of the power source exploited by the offender to perpetrate these offences was the authority vested in him by the mother as a responsible babysitter.

39These are not offences falling at the low end of the criminality spectrum, nor do they have characteristics that place them at the high end of the spectrum. The full gamut of criminal offending if viewed as a bell curve graded against measures of minimum to maximum penalty would present as a bell curve with the vast bulk of the bell curve to the left of the mid point of a five year penalty. Each of these offences I am dealing with would likely be located among the bulk of these offences falling just slightly to the left of that mid point of five years.

VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT'S

40I have received victim impact statements from each of the gentlemen who were once young boys. The material contained in the victim impact statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to crossexamination. To the extent that opinions are expressed in the statements I recognise they are not opinions of qualified experts. A victim impact statement coming as it does from the primary victim, may if I accept it is reliable provide some unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offences and their effect upon each of the children.

41The functions of statements such as these are firstly to give the victims an opportunity of being heard in the sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of an offender. Secondly, they enable the sentencing proceedings hopefully to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly, they contribute to the offender at least hearing first hand and perhaps gaining an insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon the children, and finally, of course, they constitute a reminder to persons sitting in judicial positions such as myself of the impact that crime can have upon the ordinary men and women who are so frequently its victims.

42The first of the victim impact statements comprises two documents and they relate to SB. This is a form more than any that he has filled out or has had filled out for him. He speaks of the physical bodily harm, being heavy smoking due to anxiety. He speaks of the mental illness or nervous shock as being post-traumatic stress disorder as a victim of sexual abuse, paranoia, anxiety and panic disorder. He has a discharge summary from a mental health service, which constitutes the second part of what he wished to say. This is a letter from doctor who says:

""Mr SB has been a patient of this practice for the past two years. He gives a history of childhood sexual abuse from the age of approximately eleven years inflicted upon him by an adult male. He is now thirty-five years of age and has been adversely affected by this experience. He suffers from severe panic and anxiety disorder and paranoid schizophrenia. He has extreme distrust of authoritarian males and cannot sustain a relationship that has adult males. He has held numerous jobs which he could not sustain as he was unable to deal with men in authority. His chances of maintaining a job to live a normal life are slim. He is now on a disability pension. He is paranoid of anyone encroaching into his space. He ventures out into public places only in the company of his wife who is also his carer. His relationship skills are poor and he is fairly isolated socially. He lacks confidence in himself and hates himself. As an inpatient and outpatient of psychiatric units he has been receiving continuous treatment in the form of counselling and psychotropic medication. This will continue for a large part of his life. He attributes his current state of mind and his life to the adverse events of abuse that robbed him of his childhood.""

43In fairness to the offender I would have to say that in respect of the schizophrenic part of the paranoid schizophrenia, on the material before me I cannot be satisfied that is directly caused, but all of those other matters, the severe panic, the severe disorder and the paranoia, I can accept as coming from the repeated sexual abuse.

44The second is a narrative written by BB. He says:

""I have fully prepared and written this statement myself. I am aware that this statement will be read out in Court and I have no objection to that.

I would like to start by saying that this impact statement will not be lengthy in nature as there are not enough words to describe the impact this crime had upon my life. It is one of those things that unless you have experienced it, lived it, breathed it, nobody will ever fully understand the total impact on the individual and comprehend what it was like back then and what it continues to be like to this day.

As a younger child I was typically trusting, honest, fun and outgoing. My family was my foundation, my rock, it was my safe haven. Our family home wasn't anything flash but it was where I felt safe and loved. I had good relationships with my mother, brother and sister. My father wasn't on the scene, but everything started to change the day I began to be a victim of a crime, a crime that would continue for many years, a crime that would change everything from that moment until this day. 

From the time I was little I had always dreamt of becoming a police officer. I was interested in my schooling and had good grades. I attended school regularly and got on well with my peers. Once again things changed. I began skipping school, I began not caring, my grades fell and I left school when I was fifteen years old and I have not furthered my education since then. Along with this my dreams of becoming a police officer were crushed. 

I also left my family home around the same time when I was fifteen years old. I had to get out. If this man kept coming into my house then I decided I had to get out, I had to try and protect myself from any further hurt. Obviously it was very difficult to be so independent at such a young age and it affected the good relationships I had with my mother and siblings. The day I left home, the day I got out, I thought I was free but I'm never free. 

Prior to leaving home and school whilst the crimes were being committed against me was very difficult, confusing and turbulent time for me both physically and mentally. I could not understand why these things were happening. I just knew it wasn't right and at the time due to my age mostly I didn't know how to put a stop to it. I was only a young boy. 

As I have grown up I now know that everything was sinisterly wrong. I felt dirty all the time. I had nightmares, I began to withdraw. I was scared. I was frightened. I started suffering from anxiety and panic attacks, although I didn't realise the actual name for these symptoms until I was older. I started to lose all trust in everybody. I started to get moody, depressed, another symptom I wasn't aware of until I was a lot older. 

But I can definitely look back and relate these emotions/symptoms as starting around the time of the crimes and worsening as the crimes kept repeating as the years went on. I started questioning my sexuality. I needed people around me all the time so I felt protected from him as a security I guess you could say. I didn't like to be left alone as it made me feel very vulnerable and I couldn't settle. Looking back I think I had the typical fight or flight response and I chose the flight option and I ran and kept running for many years only slowing and learning to settle in my late twenties.

Upon leaving home and school I quickly formed relationships with many girls, as men were not to be trusted. At this stage of my life due to what happened to me I could not comprehend that love and sex were interlinked and this got me into a lot of trouble. I soon found myself welcoming a daughter at the age of seventeen. I wasn't ready but I also wasn't concerned at the time because consequences were not something I even gave a thought to. Not being able to settle until I was off again. In my mind if I didn't stay in one place too long then nobody could hurt me. I had to keep running so that I was safe. Another girl, a few more girls and I was welcoming my son shortly after. I never had relationships in the real sense with these women, as all sense of normality in these situations had been stripped off me. There was sex but never love as that was all I had experienced through the crimes that occurred. We live what we learn and what we are shown.

Shortly after my son was born another daughter was on her way and then another son, all to different mothers as I was still running, still trying to protect myself. All this responsibility but I was still unable to settle. I can see now looking back that in trying to protect myself I was hurting others and doing long-term damage, but at that time I wasn't able to understand this. It wasn't also until my late twenties that I would unpack my belongings where I was living. I kept everything in boxes and lived out of them just in case someone tried to hurt me again or if I suddenly felt threatened. It was quicker and easier to run with all my life packed up in little boxes in front of me.

Due to my lack of understanding of the relationship between love and sex, my life has long-term consequences. I'm doing the best I can now with the children I had with these women. However through my many years of what some would call promiscuous behaviour, I contracted genital herpes. This will also have an impact on me until the day I die, but also on the relationship I now have with my wife. During all these years I also suffered from everything I mentioned earlier, but around this time I also started suffering from flashbacks which felt so real, like I was back there and it was happening all over again. I could smell him. I could feel him. I could hear his breath over me. I have come to accept that I will have to cope with these flashbacks until the day I die. 

My life, now being in my mid thirties, is somewhat more settled. I am married with a child, the first conceived out of love. My wife was the first and only person I had ever told about these crimes prior to walking into my local police station. I had made many earlier attempts to report this but could never bring myself to actually walk through the doors of the police station as I knew this journey would be a very traumatic one. But with the support of my wife I finally did it, and with her help I am now able to settle into a home environment, unpack the boxes of my life and live my live with love, respect and integrity.

Sometimes still it is not easy. I have very little male friends and of those I keep my distance, and these relationships are affected by my refusal to open up and get close to them. My life in general now I go to work, I look after our daughter and my wife's two children from her previous marriage. I talk to my mates mostly over the phone, we don't catch up often. All these years later I never put myself in a situation where I could be alone with one of my mates or any male regardless. I have a complete and utter disgust for gay men and cannot handle being around them, it sickens me. 

I still have periods for up to six months at a time, particularly after nightmares and flashbacks where I go off sex. This has a huge impact on both myself and my wife. I just can't explain it. I don't want to be touched or loved, I just want to be left alone to deal with things my way. I sometimes wake up in the night sweating, my heart rate is increased and I can see and feel him again. I can be out in public and hear somebody shout out the same name as his and I freeze and all the emotions come flooding back and it takes a while to suppress the thoughts and feelings and keep going on. Everything takes time, it will take time forever and I know it will take until my last breath until I am truly free of this man.

I have problems with authority. I still suffer from the relentless emotional strain from it all as does my family and my wife to a degree. I trust nobody with my children and besides whilst I am at work they never leave my sight. In my eyes everybody is a potential abuser. In times I have depended upon alcohol as a means to cope when things get really tough emotionally for me. There is so much more I could write down and explain how this crime affected my life back then, now and in the future But I am going to leave it at that as this has been really painful for me to have to do. I wrote a draft out by hand which sat there for about a month before I asked my wife if she would be able to type it up for me as I wasn't able to do it. 

As it was, this impact statement was nearly late in its submission due to my lack of commitment to it, due to the strain it put upon me. It really does take you right back sitting down here and writing all this out. It's like I'm that young child, I am living at home, I'm attending school, these crimes are happening all over again and I am scared and I am frightened, it's almost too much to bear.

The next few months in particular will be horrendous just having done this, having written it all down and knowing the final court date is approaching fast, then things will probably improve a little for a while and then it will be bad again, then things will probably improve a little again, it is a cycle that will continue for the rest of my life and I will never be completely free.""

SUBJECTIVE MATTERS

45That completes the reading of the victim impact statements. I turn now to the subjective matters relating to this offender.

46I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offences, but I am also sentencing this particular man for them. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by him or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.

BACKGROUND, FAMILY AND RELATIONSHIPS

47David Gillard is now aged sixty-five. He is the eldest of four siblings. All his siblings are sisters. His was a difficult and dislocated upbringing. His mother was an alcoholic with mental health problems. She was committed to Bloomfield Hospital in Orange. His father was a soldier unable to care for the children, no doubt because of his deployment. He was fostered out to his aunt and uncle until aged twelve. By that time the father had re-married. There were tensions between the stepmother and son. He felt bullied by her. He left home and married his current wife in 1966. His first adult sexual experience was with her. Sexual intimacy apparently for him was enjoyable but infrequent. 

48He disclosed sexual abuse of himself by an uncle to Ms Jenny Howell, a forensic psychologist in August 2011. This was something he had hinted at in March of 2003 to Dr Westmore when he complained that he was aged seven or eight when his uncle inappropriately rubbed himself against him on two occasions. He told Anita Duffey, a forensic psychologist also handling his situation in 2003, that whilst with his uncle and aunt they did not sleep together and he shared a bed with his uncle for a few years until his cousin moved out when he was given that person's bed. The offender claims his uncle interfered with him when he was about eight, the uncle rubbing his adult penis against the eight year old. It is likely this constitutes an under-reporting of the sexual activity of the uncle.

49Environmental factors such as described to Ms Duffy can be a very powerful learning experience of deviant adult behaviour and should be fully disclosed to therapists so that the therapists know exactly what background factors need to be addressed. I suspect that has not yet happened.

50The offender and his wife are practising Christians. She is supportive of him. He claims their relationship is stronger and more intimate than was the case prior to 1999 when he went to The Philippines.

EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK EXPERIENCE

51Notwithstanding early dislocation and departure from school, Gillard attained double degrees through distance learning. He completed the old Intermediate Certificate at Cleveland Street High School. Post secondary school he completed the Higher School Certificate. Then a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Psychology and Education from Macquarie University, followed by a Bachelor of Science in Applied Science with a major in Bio-Technology from Charles Sturt University.

52At the time of his marriage he was working in Australia Post where he remained for thirty-two years. He was used there in clerical type duties reaching an AO Grade 5 level. He took a redundancy package in 1998 then aged forty-three if my maths is correct. He worked at Wattyl Paints and later at Fauldings where he was employed at the time of his arrest in July of 2002. He did a number of self-betterment courses during his time in custody. 

GENERAL HEALTH

53The offender has had his share of general health issues. He was malnourished from the age of, I think, five at a time when he was living with his mother. He suffered from boils and sores when later taken to his aunt's. In the 1970s he suffered a pericarditis and was hospitalised for six weeks. There is no residual heart damage, recovery seems to have been full and complete. There was a venous malformation of the frontal lobes of the brain discovered in 1992. This required brain surgery to address the malformation. That resulted in slight cognitive and memory deficits. However the offender was able to return to Australia Post and gradually achieved fulltime employment there.

DRUGS AND ALCOHOL

54Neither of these appears present as any issue for this offender.

PSYCHOSEXUAL HISTORY

55The offender denied any prior sexual offending other than The Philippine offences to Ms Duffy in 2003. That is to say he did not disclose these offences I am dealing with to either Dr Westmore or Ms Duffy. It is likely he minimised the extent of sexual contact between his uncle and he prior to puberty and his attitude to that sexual contact. In those circumstances the assessment of his likelihood of re-offending by those two expert witnesses is likely to have been more favourable than it otherwise should have been.

56Ms Duffy recorded some psychosexual cognitive distortions, justifications and rationalisations placing him in the higher range. Dr Westmore's opinion was that Mr Gillard is likely to maintain a lifelong sexual attraction towards children, specifically prepubescent males although he may have a capacity to contain and control the sexual urges and impulses which arise from his paedophilia. For my own part I note the coincidence between his interest in prepubescent males and his own time of sexual abuse. It is also important however to note his interest in these two boys who were passing through puberty when he was abusing them. That fact appears contrary to the history he gave to Dr Westmore. 

CHARACTER AND CRIMINAL HISTORY

57At the time of this offending the offender had no prior criminal conviction. Had the matters been dealt with in 1989 he would have come to the Court as a person of prior good character. There has been offending since these offences. The only real relevance of that subsequent offending is the insight it gives into his level of contrition for these offences and his prospects of rehabilitation. This inclination to assess negatively his rehabilitation prospects must be checked by his attitude as demonstrated in circumstances of his last incarceration to progress his rehabilitation as best he could without full disclosure of these offences and other matters I have referred to.

58He has committed to the Christian religion, although his offending conduct can only have happened in the light of a substantial suppression of the moral limits put upon Christian behaviour. There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of his desire to improve the lot of the Filipinos when he first volunteered for mission work. Regrettably it would appear his continual attendance in The Philippines was not so idealistically motivated. 

59He has shown courage and determination in achieving the education standards he has attained. He has an excellent work ethic until his last incarceration. He appears to have handled his prior incarceration and indeed his present incarceration with realism and some dignity. He made effective use of the scant rehabilitation opportunities gaol life offers.

ATTITUDE TO THIS OFFENDING CONDUCT

60There was no requirement for him to disclose these past offences. However, the reality is he went further, he denied them initially to Ms Duffy and later to police. Nor did he disclose them to those who were assessing his psychosexual profile. These are all matters that come into play when assessing the depth of his contrition. 

61Having been charged with the offences he has adopted a more pragmatic and realistic attitude. He has readily acknowledged his guilt, accepted full responsibility for his offending and in so doing he has spared his victims the torment and trauma of publicly identifying in detail his disgusting conduct towards them. The other positive measure of his contrition is the effort, and a strong effort it must be acknowledged, into his rehabilitation.

REHABILITATION PROSPECTS

62The offender self assesses his chances of re-offending as extremely low. He acknowledges he cannot guarantee he will not re-offend because of the nature of the offence. But he has put in place a number of strategies to minimise the chances of re-offending. These include:




Improve relationship with his wife. 
Improving self-esteem. 
Mentors who have been informed of his criminal offending and educated as to the telltale signs that may indicate danger to others. 
Computer program that notifies two of his mentors by email of any deviant internet sites the offender may seek to access on the home computer. 
Completion of relevant sexual offender programs in custody and prior to entering custody in 2002. 
Using psychological sessions in custody to maintain gains achieved from past treatment programs. 
Maintaining a high motivation level to contain and minimise his paedophilic urges and impulses. 
Disclosing to his church congregation his past sexual offending and seeking from them their support. 

63Now whether that disclosure included these offences I am uncertain. 

64He also appears to have strong support from his wife and mentors in the community. It would appear he responds to suggestions given by his wife in her mentoring role. He gave an example of moving the computer from a back room in the house to a more public area in the house at his wife's suggestion.

65I would regard his rehabilitation prospects as good. I am fortified in that assessment by the results of Static 99 and 99R tests which put his risk of reoffending as low. That is in a group where only thirteen per cent will reoffend over a fifteen year period.

PLEA STATUS

66.His plea of guilty to these offences was entered at the Local Court level. It is conceded by the Crown he is entitled to a full utilitarian discount of twenty-five per cent on the sentences I otherwise would have set.

CUSTODIAL HISTORY

67He has been in custody since his arrest on these matters on 9 June 2010. The sentences will date from that time.

DELAY

68There has been a delay of more than twenty-three years. Indeed the date of the earlier offences is as great at twenty-seven years. This is not a criticism of the complainants who have felt some sense of paralysis in confronting such an unpleasant aspect of their past. However, during this period of delay the offender has relatively successfully confronted his paedophilic past as a consequence of being forced to confront his Philippine offending conduct during an eight year sentence which was about to finish shortly at the time of his arrest. This sentence was still on foot when he was arrested, albeit he was serving the balance of sentence on parole until his arrest.

TOTALITY

69He is entitled to have taken into account the principle of totality of sentencing when I impose sentences for this offending conduct. Both in terms of totality within the sentences that I am dealing with and totality with the sentence he is currently serving. See R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517, Miller v R, R v Abookahled (CCA 9 May,1991 Unreported) and Wu v R [2011] NSWCCA 102. The cases referred to by Ms Mikhaiel public defender in her useful written submissions.

70The other consequence of delay is that during the passing quarter century has seen significant changes to sentencing practice. Since 1981 the legislation through changes in the definition of sexual intercourse and the inclusion of increased penalties generally and specifically increased penalties in 1986, 1988, 1999, 2003 for matters of statutory aggravation, have brought about a substantially more severe sentencing regime in 2012 for the sexual behaviour being considered here. 

71Further changes were focused on changing longstanding sentencing practices which have still lingered in the mid 1980s. During the currency of those sentences set in the 1980s the nonparole period of a sentence was generally between one-third and onehalf of the head sentence with most non-parole periods favouring the lower end of that spectrum, as a consequence of cases such as Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 (2 July 1974), Deakin v The Queen (1984) 58 ALJR 367 and Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; (1990) 169 CLR 525 (24 May 1990). That regime was replaced with a requirement in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that the non-parole period be set, in the absence of special circumstances, at three-quarters of the head sentence. In more recent times the introduction of standard non-parole periods has also seen sentences for sexual offences generally driven upwards. It is however now a well established principle that I must attempt to sentence according to the pattern of sentencing existing at the time of the offending. That is a pattern of sentencing prevailing in 1984 to 1988. See R v MJR (2002) NSWLR 368, R v Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37, Miller v R, McDonald (1990) 52 A Crim R 349, Matthews v R (1991) 56 A Crim R 23, AJB v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 51.

72There is some difficulty establishing with any specificity the range of sentences imposed by the District Court for offending conduct such as I am dealing with in this case. Cases reaching the Court of Criminal Appeal were usually before that Court on the basis that the sentence was either manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive. In the 1980s there were almost no reporting of District Court decisions. I have taken some guidance from some cases referred to in the Public Defenders Sexual Intercourse Without Consent Tables 1983 to 1991 from the Public Defender's website, including Marwick (31) NSW CCA unreported 17.3.1983, Harris NSW CCA unreported 24.7.1987, Field NSW CCA unreported 18.8.1988, Garman NSW CCA unreported 9.3.1989, Risteveski (1989) 39 A Crim R 11. While the complainant in those cases fell into the age range I am dealing with, only Marwick concerned a male complainant.

DETERRENCE

73Given the substantial delay between offending and sentencing this is not a case where it is appropriate to weigh the sentence on account of general deterrence. Nor in my view is there any need in the circumstances in which this offender finds himself which I have reviewed earlier, for waiting in respect of personal deterrence.

CONCURRENT OR CUMMULATIVE

74The Crown sought partially cumulative sentences. Technically such an approach may have been correct if sentencing in the late 1980s or early 1990s. But this offender returned to custody during a parole period for the Philippine offences. When sentencing this distance from the offending conduct the primary aims of the sentencing exercise are to address what I might call the core purposes of sentencing without undue regard for technical precision. Those core purposes relate to denunciation of criminal conduct, holding an offender accountable by punishment and the requirement that he confirm and ensure his rehabilitation and finally the protection of the community from further offending by him. For this reason all sentences will be concurrent.

SENTENCING

75As I said at the outset there are four sentences before me. Three relate to SB and one relates to BB. You are convicted of all of those offences. There are two Form 1s. One in relation to further offending against SB. I will take that into account when sentencing for the attempted anal intercourse offence. In respect of the second Form 1 I will take that into account when sentencing for the offence against BB.

76The first offence that I am going to sentence you for is the second offence against SB. This is an offence which is said to have occurred between 26 August 1984 and the same date 1985 at Airds and you are being sentenced for attempting to have sexual intercourse with SB without his consent knowing that SB had not consented to your attempted sexual intercourse. I take also into account the matters on the Form 1. But for your plea of guilty I would have set a sentence of four and a half years imprisonment. I have discounted that by twenty-five per cent, resulting in an overall discount of thirteen and a half months. The overall sentence becomes one of forty and a half months. In respect of that offence I set a non-parole period of twenty-one months, that is one year and nine months to commence, on my maths, on 9 June 2010 when you went into custody and to expire, if I am correct, on 8 March 2012, with the rest of the sentence expiring 23 October 2013, I think.

77In respect of the other two offences, but for your plea of guilty I would have set a sentence of four years. That has been reduced by one year to make a total sentence of three years. In respect of each of those the first said to have occurred between those same dates, that is the first year August 1984 to August 1985 and that was fellatio upon SB and the other was also fellatio and that was between August 1986 and August 1987 at Moorebank. In respect of that I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 9 June 2010 and to expire on 8 December 2011 and the balance of term to expire eighteen months later.

78In respect of the offending against BB which is in a much wider time frame, and I am only dealing remember with one offence between 26 August 1984 and 31 December 1988 as I said earlier one offence taking it as representative of two and the Form 1, I would have set a sentence of four years and four months. It is likewise discounted by twenty-five per cent on account of your early plea and it becomes a sentence of three years and three months. In respect of that I also set a non-parole period of one year and nine months to commence from 9 June 2010 and expire on 8 March 2012 and a balance of term of eighteen months to expire on 8 September 2013, if my maths is correct. They are all subject to my mathematics.

79HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown you should make sure that the victims know of the compensation to victims of crimes provisions.

80KO: I'll give them that information. Your Honour some charges were on a s 166 certificate but now they've been taken into account on the Form 1. If your Honour just makes orders that those charges that have been taken into account on the Form 1 be withdrawn and dismissed.

81HIS HONOUR: Yes pursuant to 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the charges, which have been acknowledged on the Form 1s are to be withdrawn by the prosecution.

2758186,R v ELZEYAT [2011] NSWDC 218,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: Ali Elzeyat appears for sentence today on nine offences of armed robbery. In two of those the weapon was a dangerous weapon and in the remaining seven it was an offensive weapon. The maximum penalties for the first two offences are twenty-five years imprisonment and twenty years for the remainder. The number of offences and the maximum penalties indicate that necessarily lengthy periods of imprisonment must be imposed. 

2The offender got into debt. This was because he was a drug user and had been using drugs on credit. Eventually his drug supplier lost patience with him and made demands that the money be repaid. Those demands were accompanied by threats to the offender's family. At this stage the offender had a choice. He had a number of options, all of them unattractive. But he did have choices which did not involve the commission of offences as serious as these. He could have, for example, told his family what had occurred and sought their help. He could have reported the matter to the authorities and sought their assistance. But instead the offender continued to use drugs, obtaining his drugs from another source and in order to pay off the debt he committed with others the serious offences I am about to describe. 

3On 19 April this year the offender and two others, one of whom was a juvenile, attended the Bankstown Relaxation Centre. They rang the doorbell. Inside was a man by the name of Michael Chen who was working there. He opened the door and three men walked inside. One of them, and it may well not have been the offender but it matters little, punched Mr Chen to the left side of his face saying, ""Give me your money"". The young person produced a knife. This offender was armed with a taser. To emphasise that it was dangerous, no doubt, he activated it so that it began making noises. He pointed the taser at Mr Chen and said, ""Give me all your money"". He and the young person then grabbed Mr Chen by his arms and took him to an office, again demanding money. He reached into his pockets and removed $1,240 in cash which were the day's takings. He gave the money to one of the men and they ran away. 

4About an hour later the three offenders went to a motel in Bankstown. They walked into the office where they asked for a room. They were told there were no vacancies. The offender then tried to unlock a side door in the reception area while the young person took a knife from his pocket. He said, ""This is a hold up, give me all your money"", and once more the offender pointed a taser at the victim of the robbery Mr Hiralal, and once more the offender activated the taser so that it made a noise. Demands for money were made which the victim complied with. He said, ""Here is the money, take it"". At this stage his wife entered the room and the offender pointed the taser at her. One of the offender's co-offenders removed the cash tray from the drawer and further cash that was kept under the tray, totalling all of $400. They then ran away. 

5A few days later on Friday 22 April the offender and the young person went to a brothel in Granville. Mr Zhang worked there. He opened the door, told the offenders that they should wait, after which the offender then pushed Mr Zhang and walked into the room. He took out a knife that he had with him and the young person also produced a knife. The offender said, ""Give me the money."" The victim said he did not have any. Further demands were made until the offender said, ""Show me the boss, take me"". The victim took the offenders to another office but there was no one in that room. The offender then said, "" Are you joking with me, playing games with me"" and walked back to the main office. By now another female employee was present. They asked her where the money was kept. The victim said she did not know. He said, ""Let the girl leave the office now, we'll get you the money"" . She was allowed to leave the room but the offenders continued to point their knife blades at Mr Zhang. The offender then grabbed Mr Zhang's shirt and pushed him into another room and the young person punched him to the side of his face. The offender put his hand in the victim's pocket and pushed his knife towards the victim until the blade actually touched his chest. Not surprisingly this caused Mr Zhang to comply. In fear he removed some cash from his pocket and handed it to the offender, but more was demanded. Mr Zhang took out the rest of the money that he had in his pocket, handing over a total of $1,600. The offenders ran away. That offence was committed shortly after midnight on Friday 22 April. 

6Some time later that evening the offender and his co-offender, not the young person this time, went to the Bellevue Five Star Retreat in Carlton. Amber Don worked there as an administration assistant. Ms Don answered the door and the offender and his co-offender walked in. The offender was armed with a knife which he pointed at Ms Don. He said, ""Get me the fucking money, bitch"". The knife of course was bad enough, but the expression used by the offender could only have added to the fear which Ms Don felt. She walked to the money drawer and opened it. The offender said, ""I want five grand"". There was not nearly that much money in the drawer. Ms Don saying, ""I don't have that much money here, you can take everything"". She gave the offender $300 from the drawer. But this was not enough for him. He said, ""I know you have more money, you're lying to me, bitch"" . Ms Don responded by holding up her hands and saying, ""I swear that's all I've got"". The co-offender found another $120 in cash. Ms Don said, "" Sorry, I forgot that was there, that's the girls' money"" and the offender then moved the knife closer to her. She handed the money to him and removed the cash drawer to show the offender that it was empty. She also opened other drawers to show the offenders that there was no other money there as well. The offenders ran away. 

7About fifteen minutes later they were at it again. This time they went to the Allawah Mini Market where Mr Song Huangg was working. The two offenders approached him and the offender produced a knife, pointed it towards Mr Song and said, ""Money, money."" He kicked the counter and moved the knife back and forth. He then jumped over the counter and stood close to the victim holding the knife to his chest. At this stage Mr Huang's wife walked out of the back room and saw the offenders. The co-offender went over towards her and told her to stay away. The offender again said, ""Money, money "" so Mr Huang opened the register. The offender took some notes, so did the co-offender. They were able to get this time $300 in cash before running away. 

8There was something of a break, perhaps in the order of half an hour before the next offence was committed. Once more the offender and his co-offender went to some premises in Railway Street, Lidcombe. A woman by the name of Ping Lee was working there. She walked to the front counter as the offender's arrived. One of the offenders said, ""Fuck, take the money"" and Ms Lee saw that one of them was holding a knife. They took $1,300 from the cash register than ran away. 

9We now move to the following day. At about 5.45pm the three of them, once more reunited, went to a bottle shop in Regents Park. Ricky Nguyen owned that bottle shop. His nephew Minh Nguyen was working there with his uncle that evening. Rick Nguyen approached the offender saying, ""Can I help you"" and saw that the offender was holding a knife. The offender pointed the knife at his nephew Minh Nguyen and said , ""Give me the fucking money"". The young person was also armed with a knife. Minh Nguyen opened the cash register, the offenders took out the entire cash tray and ran away taking $2,000. As they left one of the co-offenders threw a bottle of red wine at the counter. 

10Under an hour later they went to a brothel in Greenacre. A Mr Griggs worked there. When the offenders walked, in this time without the young person, they walked into the office area and said, ""Give me the money."" Mr Griggs said, ""I haven't got any money"". One of the offenders said, ""Come on you must have money, where's your keys?"" Both of the males then produced knives. One of them pointed the knife towards Mr Griggs' stomach and said, ""Get your keys and get the money"". Mr Griggs said, "" I have no money"". He opened the till drawer and said, ""That's all I've got, take it"". The offenders thus took $384. 

11We now move to 29 May, the final offence committed by the offender. At about 3.05am the offender went to Studio 32 brothel in Berry Street, Bankstown, a place he had earlier robbed on 22 April. This time he was with the young offender. The offender entered the brothel and was greeted by Quan Zhang. The offender took out a kitchen knife and said, ""Give me your money"", put the knife against Mr Zhang's stomach, which caused Mr Zhang to remove $1,000 from his pocket which he gave to the offender. Once more they ran away. 

12The following day 30 May the offender was arrested at his residence. The police located $620 cash in the offender's pocket. The adult co-offender was arrested on 24 April and the young person was arrested on 4 June. This offender has been in custody since the date of his arrest. 

13As I have described the offences it is obvious that they were very serious and capable of causing fear and indeed terror in the minds of many of those people who were subject to the threats, both implied and explicit, made by the offender. Recognition of the seriousness of offences such as these was one of the matters which led to the Court of Criminal Appeal, some time ago now, formulating a guideline judgment regarding sentencing for armed robbery offences. It is undeniable that offences such as those I have just described are capable of causing great harm and it is likely that at least some of those who are the victims of these offences have been significantly affected by their experiences. The offences were made more serious by the fact that the offender did not operate alone and also because of the presence on more than one occasion of persons other than the immediate victim of the offence. 

14The offender was eighteen at the time of these offences and is only nineteen now. He is of Lebanese background but was born and raised in Australia. There are five brothers and two sisters in the family. The family is, apart from this offender and one brother, law abiding members of society. The brother immediately older than this offender, Ali, has spent time in custody having been a drug user. He has apparently now been released from gaol, is working and is drug free. The offender did well at school intending to go to perhaps to year 11 and 12 and complete his HSC, but left in year 10 when he was waylaid with drugs. The offender's life went downhill after he commenced using ice when he was about seventeen. He was able to keep a job but other aspects of his life deteriorated, in particular his interest in sport waned when he began to use drugs and his offending commenced. 

15The offender's record has a number of matters on it, including an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence in company, committed when the offender was a juvenile. To say, however, that his offending has escalated through the commission of these offences is something of an understatement. The offender has plans for the future. He has told his family about what has occurred and they remain supportive of him. He expressed his remorse to the author of the pre-sentence report and says that he will not be committing further offences in the future. 

16The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentences I impose upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than they would otherwise have been. 

17I wish to spend some time dealing with the offender's youth. He is, as I have said, nineteen now and was eighteen at the time of the offences. He was obviously very young. I have more than once remarked on the circumstance that although the law requires bright lines, there are no bright lines in terms of an offender's maturity. Had the offender been under eighteen he would have been dealt with under a very different sentencing regime to that which now applies to him. I have to recognise that although I earlier described the offender as having a choice as to whether he would commit these offences, he had to make that choice with the lack of maturity that comes with any eighteen year old. Had the offender been an older man the sentences I would impose would have been much longer indeed. 

18I cannot say that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. They are almost entirely dependant on how he deals with his drug addiction once he is released from custody. It is clear that there is a significant connection between the offender's drug use and offending behaviour and so if he can put his problems with drugs behind him there is a good chance that he will be able to put his offending behaviour behind him. That is one of the reasons that I have decided to make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. Lest it be thought that I have not also taken into account in determining the appropriate head sentences, I should specifically state that I have. 

19Since going into custody the offender has given up drugs and done what he can to access courses and counselling and the like, although he has experienced the common problem faced by those on remand awaiting sentence. The Corrective Services in their wisdom make it hard, if not impossible, to access such courses before sentence. Although the offender says he will not offend again, that of course does not mean that personal deterrence becomes irrelevant. These offences were truly frightening, committed for, on occasions, comparatively small amounts of money. Indeed the total amount gained over all of these nine armed robberies was $8,600. 

20General deterrence is also very important. Part of the problem with armed robbery offences is that they can often escalate into offences involving serious and actual physical harm. The carrying of a knife has always been regarded by the courts as particularly reprehensible, not only because of the fear it engenders in others but because of the real risk that, even accidentally, serious injuries will be inflicted. The capacity for such injuries to be occasioned by offences such as these is obvious. It is fortunate indeed that each of the victims of these offences cooperated as they did. General deterrence does have less weight because of the youth of this offender, but it remains of importance in determining the length of the appropriate sentences. 

21I spoke a little while ago about the use of knives. Of course, two of the offences involved a taser which led to a higher maximum penalty then being applicable. Mr Schaudin made the point, and it is a good one, that in terms of dangerous weapons the taser is towards the bottom of the range. There is clearly some overlap as regards the seriousness and dangerousness of weapons which are described as ""dangerous"" and weapons which are described as ""offensive"". Indeed I suspect that most people would probably prefer to be robbed by an offender armed with a taser than an offender armed with a thirty centimetre long knife. 

22One of the issues which was addressed in submissions because of its importance in affecting the length of the overall term, concerns accumulation and concurrence. There is clearly a limit to what I am about to say but no offender should think that having committed one offence he can commit other offences for free. On the other hand the principle of totality clearly applies, a principle which I am sure some victims of crime have difficulty accepting. As it turns out, the way I have structured the sentences that I am about to announce means that effectively he gets four offences for free because of the way I have grouped the offences. But it is important, with the constraint of the principle of totality in mind, to recognise that each further offence represented further serious offending with further serious harm possibly occasioned to another victim. I fully accept that particularly on a young person the sentence I am about to announce might be perceived as being a lengthy one. Imposing a sentence of this length on someone who is nineteen years of age is not a pleasant experience, but it is one which has to be done. If the offender chooses to decide to pay off a drug debt by repeated offending of this kind he really can have no quarrel with the proposition that he needs to be punished and significantly so for what he has done. 

23The sentences imposed are as follows. For the two offences of 19 April I impose fixed terms of imprisonment of two years to date from 30 May 2011. Those sentences are fixed term because of the sentences I am about to announce. For the offences of 22 April committed on Shwa Zhang and Amber Don the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 30 May 2012 with a head sentence of four years. For the offences of 22 April 2011 committed on Song Huang and Defraga Wong the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 30 May 2013 with a head sentence of four years. For the offences of 23 April 2011 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one and a half years to date from 30 May 2014 with a head sentence of four years. For the offence of 29 May 2011 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of six months to date from 30 May 2015 with a head sentence of three and a half years. That makes an overall term comprising a non-parole period of four and a half years, a period of eligibility for parole three years, making a total sentence of seven and a half years. The offender is thus eligible to be released to parole on 29 November 2015.

2758195,AUIMATAGI v R [2011] NSWCCA 248,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hoeben J 

2ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben J. 

3HOEBEN J: On 21 May 2010 the applicant pleaded guilty before the Penrith Local Court that between 12.10am and 2.20am on 25 November 2009 at Blacktown he did conspire to rob the Quix Mobile Service Station of certain property while being armed with an offensive weapon. 

4The offence of robbery while armed with an offensive weapon is an offence contrary to the provisions of s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The penalty for conspiracy to commit an offence is at large and is a common law offence. It was common ground that the proper approach to sentence on such a charge is to have regard to the maximum penalty prescribed for the substantive offence which in this case is imprisonment for 20 years. 

5The applicant came to be sentenced before English DCJ on 26 November 2010. The applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account a Form 1 matter of possessing the means of disguising the face with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely armed robbery, contrary to s114(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900. 

6The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 24 February 2010 and expiring 23 February 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months expiring 23 November 2013. 

7The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the severity of this sentence upon the following grounds: 

(1) That the court below fell into error in finding on a charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery that being in company was an aggravating factor. 

(2) That the court below was in error in not backdating the commencement of the sentence for the subject offence to 25 November 2009. 

(3) That the court below fell into error on the issue of parity in sentencing, as between the applicant and other co-offenders, named Iose and Faleono. 

(4) That the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

(5) That the Court below erred in failing to vary the non-parole period pursuant to s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 despite finding that there were special circumstances. 

Factual background 

8Those involved in the conspiracy, in addition to the applicant, were Moses Faleono (Faleono) who was sentenced at the same time as the applicant, Poe Tuigamala (Tuigamala), Eddie Isaia (Isaia) and Aotasi Iose (Iose). 

9On 24 November 2009 the applicant, Iose and Faleona went to the movies at Parramatta. After the movie, they met with Isaia. From there the group dispersed and reunited outside the Merrylands train station. At some time after 10pm the group then consisted of the applicant, Iose, Faleona, Tuigamala and Isaia. Iose was called over and asked by the applicant if he wanted to be involved in ""an AR"", which he understood to be an armed robbery, and he agreed. 

10The group then drove to an address in Guildford where they asked the resident, Mr Ahokava, if they could borrow a car. They borrowed a vehicle, registration number AV 70 PG. Iose drove that vehicle in company with Mr Ahokava and the applicant. Faleono drove his own vehicle with Isaia and Tuigamala. The applicant directed Iose to drive to Woolworths Wentworthville. There Iose and Tuigamala purchased a number of pairs of Ansell high flex gloves in a variety of colours. They were recorded on CCTV. 

11The group continued to an address in Seven Hills. That was the home of a person known as Lima. Lima elected to stay at home along with Ahokava because his parents would want to know his whereabouts. At the request of the applicant, Lima supplied clothing for the purpose of disguise. Faleono and Isaia carried a brown basket to the vehicle and placed it in the back of the vehicle. The applicant then claimed to know of an ""ideal location"" to commit the armed robbery. 

12The applicant directed Faleono to drive to Clare Street at Blacktown. The vehicle was driven by Faleona with Iose seated behind the front passenger seat. From a location in Clare Street they could best observe the Quix Service Station. In the opinion of the applicant that was the best location as there was minimal traffic in the area and it would yield a good result. 

13The group engaged in planning the execution of the armed robbery. Iose distributed gloves, a black balaclava and a mask based on the movie ""Scream"". Faleono took the Scream mask and Tuigamala took the balaclava. All persons in vehicle AV 70 PG took a pair of gloves. Iose placed the gloves on his hands. Further conversation ensued as the group watched as customers entered and left the service station. 

14The plan involved Iose walking into the store and falling over to get the attendant to come out from behind the counter, hiding near the icebox until a customer entered the store so the group could then run inside. In discussing the method of entry and the execution of the robbery, the group is said to have ""pressured"" Iose to take the knife and go into the store first. He ultimately declined. 

15On the evening of 24 November 2009 Sergeants Friend and Pilarski were patrolling the Prospect area. While driving west along Clare Street at around 12.05am on 25 November, they saw a white coloured motor vehicle parked parallel to the kerb outside 75 Clare Street. 

16They observed a number of persons in the vehicle. They saw a person described as being of Islander appearance approach the vehicle. That person was the Applicant. They noticed a white coloured cloth around his right hand. There was an exchange between the police and the occupants of the vehicle relating to what they were doing. They informed the police that they were helping someone to move from Guildford to Seven Hills. The police informed the group that they had reasonable suspicions about their intentions and intended to search the motor vehicle. Police located the black balaclava, a number of pairs of Ansell high flex gloves and two knives. One was 30 cms in length and the other had a blade that was 20 cms in length. The occupants of the vehicle were placed under arrest and taken to Blacktown Police Station. 

17Iose was interviewed twice. He admitted to being involved in the planning of the robbery and he told the police who was driving, who purchased the gloves, where they were purchased, who brought the balaclava, who brought the mask and about stopping at someone's house for the purpose of getting a change of clothing which was said to be at the initiative of the applicant. He told the police about the applicant's contribution to the planning, namely that all participants were to enter the service station at the same time so as to bombard the service station attendant, the general whereabouts of the people involved, what times they joined the enterprise and the amount of time spent planning, namely 30 to 40 minutes. 

18When the applicant was interviewed he denied the allegations when they were put to him. When Faleono was interviewed, he stated that he parked where he had because he needed to rest. He said that he had been driving for some time and had a headache. He denied knowledge of the items found in the car. When the allegation that he was involved in the planning of the robbery was put to him, he stated that he did not wish to talk about it. 

Remarks on sentence 

19Her Honour noted that the applicant was 20 years of age at the time of sentence, having been born in November 1990. He was 19 at the time of the offence. The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. At the time of the offence, he was on probation in relation to an earlier offence. 

20The applicant had a bad criminal record. On 17 March 2009 in the Parramatta Children's Court he was convicted of one count of assault with intent to rob, one count of affray and four counts of robbery in company. He received a probation order, a community service order and a suspended sentence in respect of those matters. On 2 February 2010 he was sentenced in the Parramatta Children's Court in respect of two counts of robbery in company. He was called up in respect of these counts when arrested for this offence and sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 months commencing 24 November 2009 and expiring 23 February 2010. 

21The applicant was arrested on 20 December 2008 and held in custody until granted bail on 21 December 2008. He re-entered custody on 24 November 2009 and has remained in custody since then. 

22In relation to his subjective case, her Honour noted that the applicant had been born in New Zealand and came to Australia when he was aged 15. He arrived with his father and stepmother. Before his incarceration he had been living with friends, having been asked to leave the family home because he was unemployed and was not actively seeking employment. 

23The applicant completed his year 10 certificate at TAFE. He has performed casual labouring work in factories in the past. He was unemployed at the time of the offence. He had been abusing alcohol since the age of 15 and admitted to binge drinking. He had been smoking cannabis since the age of 17. 

24His motivation for committing the offence was because ""he just needed money"". Since he has been in custody, he has been participating in drug and alcohol counselling and anger management programs, but has been reported as being disruptive at times. 

25Her Honour noted from the Probation and Parole report that he had ""little insight"" into the impact of his offending behaviour on the potential victims. By the time he came before her Honour, however, he said that he appreciated how serious the offence was. In that regard, her Honour found that he was remorseful and contrite. Because he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, her Honour allowed a 25 percent discount for that plea. Her Honour found that his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable. She opined: 

""It just may well be that his time spent in adult custody has been the wake up call that he needs ..."" 

26In relation to the part played by the applicant, her Honour found: 

""This offender was clearly the instigator of this conspiracy on the night. It was his idea to carry out the armed robbery, he was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a co-offender. It was this offender who instructed the driver where to go. It was this offender who instructed the driver to stop at Woolworths for the purpose of purchasing gloves. It was he who instructed Mr Lima to supply clothing for the purpose of disguise. It was he who chose the Quix Service Station and directed the others where to park in order to observe the comings and goings of the customers at the service station and it was he who was first approached by police and who already had something wrapped around his hands, no doubt to prevent finger prints being left on any surface which may have been touched."" (ROS 10.5) 

27Her Honour used as her start point the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; 106 A Crim R 149. She noted that the judgment related to a young offender with little or no prior criminal antecedents, the use of a weapon capable of inflicting serious injury, a limited degree of planning, a real threat of violence, a vulnerable victim being a service station attendant or the like, a late plea of guilty and a strong Crown case. Her Honour noted that for such persons Henry suggested a head sentence of 4 to 5 years. 

28Her Honour found that there were distinguishing features between the guideline judgment and this offence. On the one hand, her Honour noted that she was considering a conspiracy, where the planned offence was not in fact carried out. On the other hand, the applicant had significant criminal antecedents and was on conditional liberty at the time. In view of his record, her Honour observed that any leniency extended towards him must be tempered. Her Honour found that although there was some degree of planning, it was not particularly sophisticated. 

29In relation to parity, her Honour said: 

""The issue of parity creates some difficulty. Mr Iose received a benefit for assistance given to police. His head sentence, before discount, was one of 4 years imprisonment. Mr Isaia and Mr Tuigamala were dealt with in the Children's Court. Both received custodial penalties. Mr Faleono suffers from a significant brain injury which reduces his moral culpability. Mr Auimatagi was the instigator and the main driving force, he was on conditional liberty at the time and had significant juvenile antecedents and a not particularly impressive past in abiding by orders of the Children's Court. 

Taking all those matters into account, only sentences of custody will satisfy the requirements of general and in respect of Mr Auimatagi special deterrence. The role of Mr Faleono was similar to that of Mr Iose, however, the nature of his intellectual impairment reduces his moral culpability as I have said. That is a matter I have taken into account. Mr Auimatagi's culpability, however, was much greater."" (ROS 12.3) 

30Her Honour made a finding of special circumstances in favour of the applicant because this was his first time in adult custody. 

Grounds of Appeal 1, 4 and 5 

31In relation to Ground 1, the applicant focused on the following statement by her Honour when setting out those matters which distinguished this case from the guideline judgment in Henry: 

""There are distinguishing features between the guideline judgment and this offence of course because this offence is one of conspiracy to commit an offence which was not in fact carried out. It was fortunately foiled by the police. This offence was also an offence committed in company. "" (ROS 11.4) 

32The applicant submitted that this comment revealed error in that her Honour took into account as a matter of aggravation something which was an element of the offence. The applicant submitted that a conspiracy of its nature involved being in company with at least one other person. 

33In relation to manifest excess, the applicant submitted that when one made allowance for the 25 percent discount for the early plea, the start point for the head sentence must have been 5 years. He submitted that such a head sentence was excessive in that it failed to take into account that the offence had not actually occurred, his age, his contrition and remorse and his reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. 

Consideration 

34In relation to Ground of Appeal 1, it is correct that more than one person is needed for a conspiracy to take place. Here, however, the applicant was charged with conspiracy to commit a robbery while armed with an offensive weapon. He was not charged with conspiracy to commit a robbery while in company. In those circumstances, the fact that the robbery (had it proceeded) was to be committed ""in company"", was a matter which could be properly taken into account by her Honour as a matter of aggravation. 

35In R v Sok [2000] NSWCCA 121, RS Hulme J (with whom Dowd J agreed) said: 

""17 But there are also some features of the applicant's offence which do not fall within the seven characteristics adopted in R v Henry and which tend to aggravate her criminality. There were two offenders, not just one. The presence of either company or an offensive weapon distinguishes an offence under s97 from the lesser offence of simple robbery under s94. Other things being equal, the presence of both might reasonably be thought to make an offence worse than one where only one was present. ..."" 

36There is another line of authority which supports her Honour's approach. In Regina v Yildiz [2006] NSWCCA 97, (2006) 160 A Crim R 218 Simpson J (with whom Adams and Hoeben JJ agreed) said: 

"" 37 ... By s21A(2), the fact that an offence is part of a planned or organised criminal activity is a matter that a sentencing court is obliged to take into account as an aggravating feature. But, by the suffix to that subsection, the court is expressly enjoined against taking into account any aggravating feature if it is an element of the offence charged. That injunction has been extended to circumstances that are ""an inherent characteristic"" of the offence charged (see, for example, Elyard v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 43; per Howie J. An example is the disregard for public safety implicit in dangerous driving offences. But this principle does not mean that the degree to which the ""inherent characteristic"" exists in relation to a particular offence may not, where it exceeds the norm, be taken into account as an aggravating factor. ... "" 

37It follows that this was a matter which her Honour could properly take into account as an aggravating feature. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

38In relation to manifest excess, the relevant test was set out by McCallum J (with whom Simpson and Johnson JJ agreed) in R v Hayek [2010] NSWCCA 139 where her Honour said: 

""37 The principles to be applied in determining whether a sentence is manifestly excessive are well known. As noted in the written submissions on behalf of the Crown, the task is not for this Court to decide whether it would have exercised its discretion differently. The applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33], citing Dinsdale (2002) 202 CLR 321 at 325; endorsed in Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16] - [17]."" 

39When one has regard to the applicant's leadership role in the offence, that he was on conditional liberty when he committed the offence and his relatively unimpressive subjective case, that test is not met. This is particularly so when one has regard to his poor criminal record where many chances of rehabilitation were given to him which he did not take up. In those circumstances, one has to give considerable weight to the protection of the community, which in this case makes personal deterrence an important factor. 

40It is clear from that part of her Honour's remarks on sentence, on which the applicant relied for Ground of Appeal 1, that her Honour clearly understood and took into account the difference between a circumstance where the offence has actually occurred and a conspiracy to commit an offence which has been foiled by the police. It cannot be said that her Honour was unaware of or failed to take into account that distinction. 

41This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

42Ground of Appeal 5 was but faintly pressed. There were good reasons for this. Having found special circumstances, her Honour set the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence at 53 percent. Quite clearly, her Honour gave effect to that finding. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground of Appeal 2 

43In relation to the commencement date for his sentence, her Honour said: 

""He did not go into custody on 25 November 2009. He was called up in respect of an earlier robbery in company offence and he was ordered to serve a 3 month non-parole period which expired on 23 February 2010. The Magistrate took into account one day in custody and backdated the sentence to commence therefore on 24 November 2009. 

This offence was committed 6 months after Mr Auimatagi had been extended significant leniency by the Children's Court when he was placed on probation and a suspended control order. It is therefore appropriate that he serve the non-parole period imposed before he commences to serve the sentence to be imposed for this offence. His sentence in respect of this matter will therefore commence on 24 February 2010."" (ROS 13.1) 

44The applicant submitted that there was an internal inconsistency in her Honour's reasoning in that earlier in her remarks on sentence she had said that his juvenile record did not ""aggravate this offence"" but then when considering the commencement date for the sentence, had taken into account his earlier offending. 

Consideration 

45There is no inconsistency in her Honour's approach. In her earlier observation her Honour was commenting generally on the overall effect of his poor criminal record. When dealing specifically with the commencement date of the sentence, her Honour took into account the important fact that on a date only 6 months before the commission of this offence, the applicant had been sentenced for another robbery offence and had received considerable leniency from that sentencing court. This was a relevant consideration and one which her Honour could properly take into account. 

46While it was open to her Honour, had she so chosen, to backdate the commencement date of the applicant's sentence to 24 November 2009 she was not obliged to do so. No sentencing principle required such an approach. In choosing the commencement date for the applicant's sentence her Honour set out reasons which were logical, compelling and relevant. 

47This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground of Appeal 3 

48When putting his submissions as to lack of parity, the applicant accepted that there were difficulties in making that argument. The co-offender, whose sentence was said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, was Iose. He was 18 at the time of the offence and was given a sentence of 1 year and 7 months imprisonment, suspended by way of a s12 bond. 

49The applicant submitted that there was a significant difference between the start point for the head sentence awarded to Iose (4 years) and that awarded to the applicant (5 years). The applicant submitted that even allowing for the greater part played by the applicant in the offence, the disparity in head sentences of 12 months was not justified and that the principle of parity had not been observed. 

Consideration 

50The applicant's submission is not made out. The difference in roles between the applicant and Iose was substantial. In addition, Iose's subjective case was much stronger than that of the applicant. He had no criminal record. In her remarks on sentences (p7, 30.8.2010) when sentencing Iose her Honour said: 

""He was a person of good character and whilst that is a matter referred to in the guideline judgment I find in the unusual circumstances of this case he is entitled to call into account that otherwise good character and that is because he had taken steps to disengage himself by refusing to carry the knife into the premises and by trying to dissuade the others from carrying out the crime."" 

51Despite these important differences, there was only a 12 month difference in the starting points for the sentences passed on each of them. Accordingly, there was no basis for any justified sense of grievance on the part of the applicant and this ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Conclusion 

52The orders which I propose are: 

(i) Leave to appeal be granted. 
(ii) The appeal be dismissed.

		18 November 2011",2011-11-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758197,NLR v R [2011] NSWCCA 246,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agree with the orders proposed by James J and with his Honour's reasons. 

2JAMES J : NLR applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 16 August 2010 by her Honour Judge English for three offences to which he had pleaded guilty. 

3The offences and the sentences imposed were as follows:- 

(1) An offence of aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years for which her Honour imposed a head sentence of three years commencing on 14 October 2009 with a non-parole period of one year nine months 18 days. 

(2) An offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years for which her Honour imposed a head sentence of six years nine months with a non-parole period of four years commencing on 14 April 2010. 

(3) A further offence of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years for which her Honour imposed a head sentence of seven years ten months 15 days with a non-parole period of four years commencing on 14 October 2010. In sentencing the applicant for this offence her Honour took into account an offence of aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years. 

The overall sentence consisted of head sentences totalling eight years ten months 15 days and non-parole periods totalling five years. 

4Aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years is an offence under section 61M(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for ten years. There is a standard non-parole period of eight years. 

5Sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years is an offence under section 66A of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. There is a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

The Facts of the offences 

6The statement of the facts of the offences in her Honour's remarks on sentence were not the subject of any criticism on the hearing of this application and I will now briefly summarise those facts. 

7The applicant was the step-grandfather of the complainants, a girl ""M"" who was the complainant in the first offence of aggravated indecent assault and who was ten years old at the time of the commission of the offence, and her sister ""I"" who was the complainant in the two offences of sexual intercourse and the further offence of aggravated indecent assault and who was seven years old at the time of the commission of the offences. The applicant and his wife, who was the natural grandmother of the two complainants, regularly babysat the two complainants. 

8The offence of aggravated indecent assault against the complainant ""M"" was committed when the applicant stood behind a chair in his home on which ""M"" was sitting, put his hands under the complainant's shirt and squeezed her breasts. The applicant asked ""M"" whether she ""liked it"". The applicant told her not to tell anyone what had happened. On another occasion also the applicant had touched ""M's"" breasts. 

9Both offences of sexual intercourse with the complainant ""I"" were committed while ""I"" was sitting on the applicant's lap in the applicant's home. On each occasion the applicant put his hand down the complainant's pants, touched her vagina and then inserted his finger in the complainant's vagina and moved it around in circles. 

10On the second of these occasions the applicant took hold of the complainant's breasts and squeezed them with both of his hands. This was the offence of aggravated indecent assault which was taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the second offence of sexual intercourse. 

Further parts of the remarks on sentence 

11In her remarks on sentence the sentencing judge, immediately after stating the facts of the offences, said that on 14 October 2009 the applicant had attended a police station and had told a police officer that he had sexually molested a young girl, his wife's granddaughter, who at the time had been seven years old. The applicant was arrested. He then participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he made full admissions of the offences against both complainants. 

12In her remarks on sentence the sentencing judge noted some of the subjective features of the applicant. At the time of being sentenced the applicant was 70 years old. He was retired, having been in regular employment during his working life. He had married the grandmother of the complainants, his second wife, in 2002. He had been divorced from his first wife by whom he had had three children, when he was 61 years old. All of the applicant's first wife, his children by his first wife and his second wife had been supportive of the applicant after his arrest. The applicant had been interviewed by a psychologist, who had found nothing to suggest any personality disorder. 

13The sentencing judge found that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and should be allowed a 25 per cent discount for his pleas of guilty. Her Honour found that the applicant was truly remorseful and was developing some insight into the impact of his offending behaviour on others. Her Honour said that she could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had committed the offences for his own sexual gratification. Her Honour found that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were good and that the likelihood of his re-offending was low. Her Honour made some other remarks about some of the applicant's subjective features to which I will refer when considering the applicant's grounds of appeal against sentence. 

14In her remarks on sentence the sentencing judge said that the offences were objectively very serious and noted that the applicant was not being sentenced for one isolated incident. Her Honour found that the offences involved a complete violation of trust by an adult to whom children were entitled to look for protection. Her Honour noted that general deterrence is of great importance in the sentencing of offenders who commit sexual offences against young children, particularly where the offender is in a position of trust. 

15In her remarks on sentence the sentencing judge referred to the standard non-parole periods set for the offences. She noted that, because the applicant had pleaded guilty, the standard non-parole periods were not directly applicable but remained as a reference or checkpoint. Her Honour found that all the offences fell below the middle of the range for offences of their type. In making this finding her Honour noted that the offences had been committed spontaneously without any planning, were not prolonged, and, apart from the admonition to ""M"" not to tell anyone, had not been accompanied by any threats. 

16Her Honour found special circumstances in favour of the applicant, in his age, his vulnerability within the Correctional system and in the partial accumulation of the sentences her Honour was about to impose. 

Grounds of appeal against sentence 

17The applicant relied on the following grounds of appeal against sentence:- 

GROUND 1  That the sentencing judge erred by taking into account as an aggravating factor that the ""offences took place in the home of the offender ..."" 

GROUND 2  The sentencing judge erred in her application of s 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Act"") and thereby did not consider the applicant's prior good character and absence of a record of previous convictions as mitigating factors. 

GROUND 3  The sentencing judge erred by failing to take adequately into account the applicant's assistance to law enforcement authorities within the meaning of s 21A(3)(m) & s 23 of the Act. 

GROUND 4  That in all the circumstances the penalty imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive. 

18The application for leave to appeal against sentence was brought out of time but at the hearing counsel for the Crown informed the Court that the Crown had no objection to an extension of time being granted and I consider that an extension of time should be granted. 

I will consider the grounds of appeal in turn. 

GROUND 1  The sentencing judge erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor that the ""offences took place in the home of the offender"" 

19This ground of appeal was based on a part of a paragraph in her Honour's remarks on sentence. The full paragraph was:- 

""These offences are objectively very serious indeed. The sexual assault of a step-grandchild by her step-grandfather and the indecent assault of a second step-grandchild by her step-grandfather. A complete violation of trust by an adult to whom the children were entitled to look for protection. The offences took place in the home of the offender, a place the children regularly stayed and a place where they ought to have been safe from violation at the hands of their step-grandfather."" 

20The part of the paragraph relied on by counsel for the applicant was the part reading ""The offences took place in the home of the offender."" It was submitted that in this part of the remarks on sentence her Honour had taken into account as an aggravating factor that the offences had been committed in the home of the applicant and that her Honour had not been entitled to regard this matter as an aggravating factor. 

21Section 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence is that ""the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person"". 

22However, as was submitted by counsel for the applicant, it has been held that s 21A(2)(eb) is not applicable, where the offender was lawfully in the home where the offence was committed and was not an unauthorised intruder; Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [112] per McClellan CJ at CL, the other members of the Court agreeing. See also Oh Hyunwook v R [2010] NSWCCA 148 at [35]-[40]. In the present case, the applicant was clearly lawfully in his own home when the offences were committed. 

23However, I do not consider that, on a fair reading of the whole paragraph of her Honour's remarks, her Honour was treating the fact that the offences took place in the applicant's home as in itself an aggravating factor. In my opinion, in this paragraph of her remarks her Honour was making a general finding that there had been a complete violation of trust by the applicant and the fact that the offences took place in the children's grandparent's home where they regularly stayed and should have been safe was relied on, not as an independent aggravating factor, but as supporting the sentencing judge's finding that there had been a complete violation of trust. 

24I would reject the first ground of appeal. 

GROUND 2  The sentencing judge erred in her application of s 21A (5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and thereby did not consider the applicant's prior good character and absence of a record of previous convictions as mitigating factors . 

25Section 21A(5A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which is referred to in this ground of appeal, is to be read with s 21A(3)(e) and (f) of the Act. Section 21A(3) provides that the mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence include (e) ""the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions"" and (f) ""the offender was a person of good character"". 

26Section 21A(5A) of the Act provides:- 

""In determining the appropriate sentence for a child sexual offence the good character or lack of previous convictions of an offender is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor if the Court is satisfied that the factor concerned was of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence"". 

All of the present offences were child sexual offences within s 21A(5A). 

27There was no reference in the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence to any previous criminal history of the applicant and it was not a matter raised in the proceedings on sentence. In fact, the applicant was not completely free of previous criminal convictions, although it could be said that he did not have any significant record of previous criminal convictions. 

28The sentencing judge did refer to the applicant's character in her remarks on sentence. Her Honour said:- 

""The offender is said to be a person of otherwise good character. That does not entitle him to any degree of leniency. All too often these types of offences are committed by those who are of otherwise good character. It is that good character which enables them to go about this evil practice without fear of detection, confident that if a child does come forward and complain the child will not be believed. The helplessness of children in a family situation such as this is self-evident."" 

29The evidence of the applicant's character which had been placed before the sentencing judge was limited to evidence that the applicant had reached the age of 70 with only a very minor criminal record, had before he retired been in regular employment, had married twice and had raised children. 

30It was submitted by counsel for the applicant on the hearing of this application that what the sentencing judge said in the part of the remarks on sentence which I have quoted did not amount to a finding within s 21A(5A) of the Act. It was submitted that, in order for a sentencing judge to make a finding within s 21A(5A), the sentencing judge is required to make an express statement of the judge's satisfaction that the factor(s) concerned had been of assistance to the particular offender in the commission of the offences for which the offender is being sentenced. Remarks of a general kind applying to offenders generally, such as were made by the sentencing judge, do not amount to findings within s 21A(5A). Consequently, the sentencing judge was required to take into account the applicant's lack of a significant record of previous convictions and his good character and the sentencing judge's statement that the applicant's good character did not entitle him to any degree of leniency was erroneous. 

31I would accept that, in order for s 21A(5A) to apply, with the consequence that an offender's good character or lack of previous convictions is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor, the sentencing judge should make an express statement of the judge's satisfaction that the factor concerned had been of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence. 

32However, in the present case, I consider that any error on the part of the sentencing judge was merely procedural. I am satisfied from a reading of the whole of her Honour's remarks on sentence that, if her Honour had adverted to the need to make an express finding specific to the applicant, her Honour would have made, and would have been entitled to make, such a finding in relation to both sentencing factors. Her Honour would hardly have made the general remarks I have quoted, unless she considered that they were applicable to the applicant. Elsewhere in her remarks on sentence her Honour noted that, after the applicant's offences were discovered, the applicant had been denied access to the complainants and to his own grandchildren. 

33In my opinion, any error on the part of the sentencing judge was merely a procedural error and had no effect on the sentences imposed. 

GROUND 3  The sentencing judge erred by failing to take adequately into account the applicant ' s assistance to law enforcement authorities within the meaning of s 21A(3)(m) & s 23 of the Act. 

34Section 21A(3)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for a offender is ""assistance by the offender to law enforcement authorities (as provided by s 23)"". 

35Section 23(1) of the Act provides:- 

""(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence."" 

36It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the applicant had assisted law enforcement authorities by attending at a police station on 14 October 2009 and participating in an electronically recorded interview in which he made full admissions of the offences against both complainants. Such conduct on the part of the applicant, it was contended, amounted to assistance in the investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the applicant's offences. Accordingly, the applicant should have received a further discount or allowance for this assistance, in addition to the discount of 25 per cent he received for his early pleas of guilty. 

37No submission had been made before the sentencing judge that the applicant should receive a discount or allowance for assistance provided by him (as distinct from a discount for his early pleas of guilty). 

38No submission was made in the proceedings on sentence or before this Court that the applicant was entitled to an allowance in sentencing under the principles in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. It could not be said that the applicant had voluntarily disclosed hitherto unknown guilt of the offences against the complainants. The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence that on 13 October 2009 police had come to the cabin where the applicant, his wife and the complainant ""I"" were temporarily staying and had taken away the complainant ""I"", ""because they said she was under child protection"". The applicant gave further evidence that he had been told by his wife on 13 October 2009 that she had been told by her daughter, the complainants' mother, that allegations had been made of misconduct by the applicant towards his two step-grandchildren. The sentencing judge observed in her remarks on sentence that the applicant had gone to the police station, only after he had become aware of the ""notification"" of his offences. 

39It was submitted by the Crown, in opposing the submission that the applicant should receive a further discount or allowance for assistance, that the applicant had received a full discount for his early pleas of guilty and a further unquantified allowance for remorse and that no further discount or allowance should have been made for any assistance provided by the applicant. 

40I would accept that conduct of the kind relied on as amounting to assistance would be capable of coming within s 23(1) of the Act as being assistance in the investigation of the offences or in proceedings relating to the offences. However, I consider that, when an offender such as the applicant receives a maximum discount of 25 per cent for early pleas of guilty there is little room for a further discount or allowance of any significance for assistance, when the assistance is limited to participating in an interview by police and making admissions about the offender's own offences in respect of which he subsequently receives a maximum discount for early pleas of guilty. It has been held by this Court that, unless there is evidence that an offender will serve his sentence in more onerous conditions as a result of giving assistance, a combined discount for pleas of guilty and assistance should not normally exceed 40 per cent, even where the offender has given very substantial assistance about other offences and offences of other offenders, including undertaking to give, and giving, evidence at the trials of other offenders; R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; Brown v R [2010] NSWCCA 73. 

41As I have already indicated, the sentencing judge expressly referred in her remarks to the applicant going to a police station, participating in an interview and making admissions and I consider that it can be inferred that her Honour did take these matters into account in the sentencing of the applicant. 

42I would reject this ground of appeal. 

GROUND 4  That in all the circumstances the penalty imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive 

43In support of this ground of appeal counsel for the applicant submitted that the offences committed by the applicant were opportunistic and brief and had not been accompanied by violence or threats, that the sentencing judge had declined (perhaps surprisingly) to make a finding that the motive for the offences were sexual gratification and that the sentencing judge had found that the offences were below the middle of the range for offences of this type. Counsel also relied on such subjective features as the applicant's age, his pleas of guilty and the sentencing judge's findings that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were good and that the applicant was not likely to re-offend. 

44Counsel for the Crown submitted that all of the matters relied on by counsel for the applicant had been taken into account by the sentencing judge in her remarks on sentence, that an important fact in the sentencing of the applicant was the abuse of trust by the applicant and that the sentencing judge was not sentencing for a single, isolated offence. The Crown pointed to the high maximum penalties for the offences and to the high standard non-parole periods, which, although not directly applicable, remained as a check or reference point. 

45In my opinion, it cannot be said that any of the sentences exceeded the upper limit of the range of sentences within a proper exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion. I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Conclusion 

46In my opinion, an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal should be granted, leave to appeal against sentence should be granted but the appeal against sentence should be dismissed. 

47JOHNSON J: I agree with James J.

		17 November 2011",2011-11-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758200,Williams v R [2011] NSWCCA 244,"Judgment 

1BEAZLEY JA : I agree with James J. 

2JAMES J : Jay Williams applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him on 9 September 2010 in the District Court by his Honour Judge Knox for three offences, to all of which the applicant had pleaded guilty, namely:- 

1.Robbery being armed with an offensive weapon (""the armed robbery offence"") 

2.Robbery in company (""the robbery in company offence"") 

3.Escape from lawful custody (""the escape offence"") 

3In sentencing the applicant for the armed robbery offence the sentencing judge took into account an offence of breaking and entering with intent to steal and an offence of failing to appear in accordance with a bail undertaking. 

4The sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were:- 

1.For the armed robbery offence, a non-parole period of four and a half years commencing on 1 September 2008 and a balance of the term of two years three months, that is a head sentence of six years nine months. 

2.For the robbery in company offence, a non-parole period of five years four months commencing on 1 March 2009 and a balance of the term of three years eight months, that is a head sentence of nine years. 

3.For the escape offence, a fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing on 1 July 2014, the day after the expiration of the non-parole period of the sentence for the robbery in company offence. 

5The aggregate sentences imposed were total head sentences of nine and a half years and total non-parole periods and a fixed term of six years four months. 

6It had been agreed by the parties at the sentence hearing that the first sentence to be served should commence on 1 September 2008. The applicant had been arrested on 18 July 2008 and charged with the armed robbery offence. He was not granted bail. However, the applicant escaped from custody on 3 May 2009 (the escape offence), committed the robbery in company offence while at large and remained at large until he was arrested on 16 June 2009. 

7Robbery being armed with an offensive weapon and robbery in company are both offences under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. Escaping from lawful custody is an offence under s 310D(a) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. 

8The sentencing judge had first sentenced the applicant for these offences on 25 June 2010. The sentences imposed on 25 June 2010 were the same as the sentences later imposed on 9 September 2010, except that on 25 June 2010 the sentencing judge divided the head sentence of nine years for the robbery in company offence into a non-parole period of six years and a balance of the term of three years, producing some further, consequential, differences. 

9On 9 September 2010 his Honour, purporting to apply s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , on the basis that on 25 June 2010 a penalty had been imposed which was contrary to law in that the overall sentence did not reflect a finding of special circumstances his Honour had made in his sentencing remarks of 25 June 2010, set aside the sentences he had imposed on 25 June 2010 and imposed the sentences I have already stated. 

10The sentencing judge had given the parties notice of his intention to set aside the sentences of 25 June 2010 and to re-sentence the applicant and there was no opposition on 9 September 2010 to his Honour adopting that course. On the hearing of this application neither party submitted that the sentencing judge had not been entitled to proceed as he had on 9 September 2010. The remarks on sentence his Honour had given on 25 June 2010 remained his Honour's principal sentencing remarks. 

The facts of the offences 

11In the proceedings on sentence there was an agreed set of facts and his Honour's statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence was based on the agreed facts. The following is an abbreviated summary of his Honour's statement of the facts of the offences in his sentencing remarks. 

The armed robbery offence 

12On the night of 11 July 2008 the victim, a middle-aged man who was a taxi driver by occupation, went to a block of units where his parents lived for the purpose of visiting his parents. 

13While the victim was outside the building, the applicant ran up behind the victim and punched the victim on the side of the face. Two co-offenders, a man named Davies and a juvenile M, were with the applicant. 

14The blow by the applicant caused the victim to fall to the ground. All three of the offenders repeatedly kicked and punched the victim as he lay on the ground, demanding money from the victim. 

15The applicant dragged the victim into the foyer of the building. The victim attempted to get up and flee. The applicant kicked and punched the victim. The co-offenders kicked the victim, while he was on the ground. 

16Davies then threw a beer bottle at the victim, which struck the victim's head with such force that the bottle smashed on impact. It was this beer bottle thrown by the co-offender Davies which the Crown relied on as being an offensive weapon. 

17All three offenders continued to punch and kick the victim. The victim got up and tried to run away. He was chased by all of the offenders. Davies pushed the victim, who fell against a wall and landed on the ground. While the victim was on the ground the applicant punched the victim in the face and the two co-offenders punched and kicked the victim. All three offenders searched the victim's pockets and removed items of property. 

18The applicant took hold of the victim's jacket, rolled the victim on to his back and kicked the victim twice in the face, rendering him unconscious. The juvenile pushed the applicant away from the victim. 

19Davies kicked the victim again in the face and in the stomach. Davies separated the victim's legs and kicked the victim in the area of his genitals. Davies kicked the victim in the back of the head. 

20The three offenders then left the scene. 

21The attack on the victim by the three offenders had been captured by closed circuit television. 

22The victim remained unconscious for a time, before staggering to his feet and going to his parents' unit. The victim was subsequently taken to hospital. His injuries included bruising, lacerations to the face and ribs and severe swelling to his face. 

The robbery in company offence 

23The victim of this offence was another taxi driver, who was on duty when the offence was committed. The victim was flagged down by the applicant, a co-offender D and another co-offender, being the same juvenile M. The three offenders entered the taxi and the driver was directed by D to drive to Redfern. 

24At a time when the taxi was stationary, the applicant got out of the taxi, approached the driver's door, opened the door, took the key out of the ignition and demanded money from the victim. The victim, who was in fear, took money out of his pocket and gave the applicant $90. The applicant demanded further money and the victim said that he had no further money. 

25The victim activated his emergency button and this caused his telephone to be activated. The applicant demanded that the victim give him his phone and the victim complied. The applicant then twice punched the victim in the face. 

26The applicant felt the victim's clothing, searching for a wallet. The applicant took the victim's watch off his wrist. The applicant opened the glove box of the taxi and found a coin dispenser in which the victim stored coins. It was a metal and plastic container. The applicant lifted up the coin dispenser and swung it down, hitting the victim in the face. The co-offender D told the applicant to calm down. 

27Ultimately, the three offenders left the taxi and the victim drove away. As in the case of the first offence, the entire incident was captured by closed circuit television. The injuries to the victim were a black eye and scratches to his face. 

The escape offence 

28On 3 May 2009 the applicant and three other prisoners were at a recreational oval at the Correctional Centre where they were inmates. They cut through perimeter fencing, climbed a wall and escaped. Two of the escapees were arrested shortly afterwards. The applicant remained at large, until he surrendered to police at a police station on 16 June 2009. 

The sentencing judge's remarks on sentence 

29As I have already noted, the sentencing judge in his remarks stated the facts of the offences. In subsequent parts of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge referred to the following matters. 

30His Honour found that the applicant's role was central in all three offences and that his criminality was above mid-range. 

31His Honour referred to the guideline judgment for armed robbery of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and, in particular, to the common category of case described in Spigelman CJ's judgment (at 380 (162)). His Honour found that most of the factors in the common category of case were ""totally applicable"" and ""provide a minimum platform for my consideration of the appropriate sentence"". 

32His Honour gave consideration to what aggravating factors had been present in the commission of the offences. An aggravating factor for the armed robbery offence was that it had been committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty. An aggravating factor for the robbery in company offence was that it had been committed while the applicant was an escapee. 

33His Honour gave consideration to whether either of the robbery offences had involved gratuitous cruelty but decided that, while there had been a high level of violence, he should not find that there had been gratuitous cruelty. 

34His Honour found that, while the victim of the armed robbery offence was in fact a taxi driver by occupation, he had been merely a member of the public at the time that offence was committed. However, the victim of the robbery in company offence was on duty as a taxi driver at the time the offence was committed and hence was a vulnerable person within s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . 

35The applicant, an Aboriginal, was born on 18 August 1989 so that he was 18 years old at the time of committing the armed robbery offence and 19 years old at the time of committing the other two offences. His youth was a mitigating factor. 

36The applicant had a deprived childhood of a kind unfortunately common in Aboriginal offenders. The sentencing judge accepted the applicant's ""upbringing as being one of chaos, instability and exposure to alcohol and physical abuse from his father"". The sentencing judge referred to Fernando factors ( R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58). His Honour found that the applicant had had a very limited educational and vocational history but had done some courses while in gaol. 

37The applicant had abused drugs and alcohol since he was 16 years old. 

38A psychometric assessment revealed that the applicant had low verbal intelligence. The sentencing judge's impression gained during the sentence hearing, in which the applicant had given evidence, was that the applicant had presented himself as being a fairly quick-thinking individual. 

39The applicant, despite his youth, had an extensive criminal history, including numerous convictions for offences of breaking and entering, convictions for robbery and stealing from the person and a previous conviction for escaping, although from police custody and not Correctional Services custody. His Honour, although referring to Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465, would appear to have regarded the applicant's previous criminal history as merely disentitling him to any leniency. 

40In parts of his remarks on sentence which are relevant to a consideration of some of the applicant's grounds of appeal against sentence, the sentencing judge dealt with questions of parity between the applicant and the applicant's co-offenders on the armed robbery offence and the escape offence. I will consider these parts of his Honour's remarks when I am considering those grounds of appeal against sentence. The applicant's alleged co-offenders on the robbery in company offence, D and M, did not plead guilty and were acquitted at a trial, so that no question of parity arose in relation to that offence. 

41I will consider what the sentencing judge said in his remarks about the applicant's pleas of guilty when considering one of the grounds of appeal against sentence. 

42The sentencing judge declined to make a finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and said that in sentencing the applicant he would not take into account that, as an escapee, he would be likely to have less opportunity while in custody to take part in courses. 

43The sentencing judge considered that there was a need for some accumulation of the sentences for the robbery offences, because the offences involved different victims and had been committed at different times and in different circumstances. 

44The sentencing judge found special circumstances within s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , in that the applicant was ""an urban indigenous offender who has been exposed to repeated acts of violence from an early age as well as alcohol and drug abuse"", in the applicant's youth and in the fact that it was the first time the applicant had been in adult custody. 

The appeal 

45The applicant relied on the following grounds of appeal:- 

Ground 1: His Honour erred by not granting a 25 per cent discount to the applicant for the plea of guilty before committal in accordance with s 17(1)(a) of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008. 

Ground 2: His Honour made a mistake of fact when considering the issue of parity. 

Ground 3: The applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with respect to count 1 as opposed to that imposed upon his co-offender Davies. 

Ground 4: The sentences imposed upon the applicant were manifestly excessive. 

46I will consider these grounds of appeal in turn. 

1. His Honour erred by not granting a 25 per cent discount to the applicant for the plea of guilty before committal in accordance with s 17(1)(a) of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008. 

47This ground of appeal was conceded by the Crown. The sentencing of the applicant was subject to the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008. The applicant had pleaded guilty to all three offences before he was committed for trial and, accordingly, in sentencing the applicant for each offence the sentencing judge was required by s 17(1)(a) of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act to allow a discount of 25 per cent for the applicant's plea of guilty. Unfortunately, the application of the Act to the sentencing of the applicant was not drawn to the sentencing judge's attention in the sentence proceedings. 

48In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge did refer to the applicant's pleas of guilty. His Honour said that the applicant's pleas of guilty had ""relatively limited utilitarian value"", erroneously basing this finding on the strength of the Crown case against the applicant, a factor which was irrelevant to the determination of the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty. See for example Sutton v R [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12] per Howie J. 

49In his remarks the sentencing judge did not specify a precise percentage as being the percentage discount he was allowing for the applicant's pleas of guilty. His Honour said ""I think an appropriate range (for the discount for the pleas of guilty) is of the order of between 15 and 20 per cent"". A discount of somewhere between 15 or 20 per cent is clearly less than 25 per cent and, consequently, as conceded by the Crown, this ground of appeal must be upheld. 

50There are now a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases where the sentencing judge has made the error of not allowing a discount of 25 per cent for a plea of guilty in a sentence subject to the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act . 

51The Court of Criminal Appeal has generally taken the position that the failure to comply with the Act is a material specific error requiring that the sentence imposed by the primary judge be quashed and that the offender be re-sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Do v R [2010] NSWCCA 182; Tran v R [2010] NSWCCA 183; LJ v R [2010] NSWCCA 289; Greer v R [2011] NSWCCA 40. 

52An exception to this general line of cases is Kim Chompeay v R [2011] NSWCCA 96, in which the Court of Criminal Appeal merely made an arithmetical adjustment to the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge, so that there was a full discount of 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty. 

53In the present case the sentencing judge did not precisely identify the amount of the discount he was allowing for the pleas of guilty, making a precise arithmetical adjustment impossible, and, for reasons I will give in considering other grounds of appeal, the sentencing judge made other errors in the process of sentencing the applicant. 

2. His Honour made a mistake of fact when considering the issue of parity. 

54This ground of appeal applies only to the sentence for the armed robbery offence. 

55As already noted, a co-offender in the armed robbery offence was a man named Davies. Davies had been sentenced for the armed robbery offence on 10 September 2009, by another District Court judge Judge Hosking. 

56On 10 September 2009 Davies was also sentenced by Judge Hosking for another offence, not involving the applicant, of assault with intent to take a motor vehicle, taking and driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the person lawfully in possession of it and inflicting actual bodily harm (an offence under s 154C of the Crimes Act ). Davies had pleaded guilty to both offences. 

57In sentencing for each of the two offences Judge Hosking decided that an appropriate starting point before allowing a discount for the plea of guilty, was six years; that a discount of 25 per cent should be allowed for the plea of guilty, reducing the head sentence to four years six months; that he should find that there was special circumstances; that the non-parole period should be two years three months, that is half of the head sentence; and that the sentence for the second offence (the offence under s 154C of the Crimes Act ) should be accumulated by nine months on the sentence for the first offence. The resulting aggregate sentence consisted of head sentences totalling five years three months and non-parole periods totalling three years. 

58A copy of Judge Hosking's remarks on sentence in sentencing Davies became an exhibit in the applicant's sentence proceedings. In his remarks on sentence Judge Knox said ""the sentence imposed in relation to Mr Davies was a non-parole period of three years with additional terms of two years three months. There is some complication in that there was a second offence in relation to a second robbery...therefore, it is difficult to ensure that I am comparing like with like. But again there do seem...to be differences in the personal circumstances of the two offenders"". 

59I do not consider that his Honour's remarks demonstrate a complete and accurate understanding on his Honour's part of the sentencing of the co-offender. The sentence referred to by his Honour of three years with ""additional terms"" of two years three months was the aggregate sentence imposed on Davies and not the sentence for the armed robbery offence, which was the only sentence giving rise to questions of parity. His Honour made no reference to the sentence which had been imposed on Davies for the armed robbery offence. Contrary to his Honour's assertion, there would be no difficulty in comparing the objective seriousness of the conduct of Davies and the conduct of the applicant in committing the armed robbery offence. 

60I would uphold the second ground of appeal. 

3. The applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon him with respect to count 1 as opposed to that imposed upon his co-offender Davies. 

61This ground of appeal is expressly limited to the sentence for count 1, that is the armed robbery offence. 

62In considering the second ground of appeal I referred to the sentence imposed by Judge Hosking on the co-offender Davies for the armed robbery offence and the process by which Judge Hosking arrived at that sentence. 

63The head sentence imposed on the applicant for the armed robbery offence was six years nine months. If the sentencing judge allowed a discount of between 15 and 20 per cent for the applicant's plea of guilty, then the sentencing judge's starting point, before allowing a discount for the plea of guilty, would have been in the vicinity of eight years, as compared with Judge Hosking's starting point in sentencing Davies of six years. The sentencing judge found special circumstances but made the non-parole period of the sentence two-thirds of the head sentence, whereas Judge Hosking made the non-parole period of Davies' sentence half of the head sentence. 

64It was common ground at the hearing of the application that the principles of parity and proportionality discussed by the High Court in Postiglione v The Queen (1995-1996) 189 CLR 295 and especially by Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 301-302 were applicable. 

65There was also a large measure of agreement between the Crown and counsel for the applicant about the points of similarity and the points of difference between the two offenders and their offending. 

66It was accepted by both the Crown and counsel for the applicant that the objective criminality of the applicant and of Davies was similar. It was not correct to say, as the sentencing judge had in his remarks, that the applicant's role was central. Davies had repeatedly kicked and punched the victim and it was Davies who had thrown the beer bottle, which was the only weapon used in the commission of the offence. 

67It was also accepted by both the Crown and counsel for the applicant that important subjective circumstances shared by the applicant and Davies were that they were both Aboriginals who were only 18 years old at the time of committing the offence. 

68The only respects in which it was submitted by the Crown that the applicant differed from Davies, to the disadvantage of the applicant, were:- 

1.the additional offences to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant were more serious than the additional offences taken into account in sentencing Davies 

2.the applicant had a much worse previous criminal history than Davies 

3.the applicant was on bail, that is on conditional liberty, at the time he committed the offence. 

69As regards additional offences to be taken into account, I have already noted that in sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge took into account an offence of breaking and entering with intent to steal and an offence of failing to appear in accordance with a bail undertaking. 

70In sentencing Davies Judge Hosking had taken into account an offence of driving a motor vehicle while a learner driver without a licensed person being seated next to him, which Judge Hosking considered added almost nothing to Davies' criminality, but also a rather more serious offence of driving a motor vehicle with a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. 

71I would accept that the additional offences to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant were somewhat more serious than the additional offences taken into account in sentencing Davies. 

72The applicant clearly had a much more serious criminal history than Davies, who had only a very minor previous criminal history. Davies was not on conditional liberty at the time of committing the offence. 

73It was submitted by the Crown that the differences between the applicant and Davies was such that there should be some difference in the sentences imposed on them for the armed robbery offence but it was conceded by the Crown that the differences between them were not sufficient to justify the degree of difference which existed between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentence which had been imposed on Davies and that the applicant would have a legitimate sense of grievance about the lack of due proportionality between the two sentences. 

74I consider that the Crown's concession was properly made and I would uphold the third ground of appeal. 

4. The sentences imposed upon the applicant were manifestly excessive. 

75I have decided that each of the first three grounds of appeal should be upheld. In these circumstances, I consider that it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant generally. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the Court to consider the fourth ground of appeal. 

Re-sentencing the applicant 

76I have already stated the objective facts of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the applicant. 

The armed robbery offence 

77In re-sentencing the applicant the Court should seek to impose a sentence which is duly proportional to the sentence which was imposed on the co-offender Davies. The only points of distinction between the applicant and Davies which operate to the disadvantage of the applicant are that the additional offences to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant were somewhat more serious, the applicant had a worse criminal history and the applicant was on bail when he committed the offence. 

78To allow for these points of distinction I would adopt a starting point of six years six months and I would then allow the full discount of 25 per cent required by the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act , producing (with some rounding off) a head sentence of four years ten months. 

79I would find special circumstances in the same circumstances identified by the sentencing judge and, as these circumstances are similar to the special circumstances identified by Judge Hosking in sentencing Davies, I would follow Judge Hosking and set a non-parole period in the sentence for this offence of 50 per cent of the head sentence. 

80Accordingly, the head sentence for the armed robbery offence would be four years ten months, with a non-parole period of two years five months and a balance of the term of two years five months. 

The robbery in company offence 

81It has been held that the guideline judgment for armed robbery of R v Henry applies mutatis mutandis to robbery in company R v Murchie (1999) 108 A Crim R 482. 

82The applicant's offence was a serious offence and much more serious than the common category of case of armed robbery described in para [162] of Spigelman CJ's judgment in Henry , for which his Honour considered head sentences should generally fall between four and five years. The applicant's offence was more serious in that the applicant was not an offender with little or no criminal history and there was not limited, but extensive, actual violence in the commission of the offence. Furthermore, at the time of committing the offence the applicant was an escapee, although care has to be exercised in not doubly punishing the applicant for being an escapee, in sentencing him for the robbery in company offence and also for the escape offence. 

83The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of nine years for this offence. If his Honour allowed a discount of between 15 and 20 per cent for the applicant's plea of guilty, then his Honour's starting point in sentencing for this offence would have been more than ten years. 

84Although, as I have said, the offence was serious, I do not consider that this Court in exercising its own sentencing discretion should adopt such a high starting point as the sentencing judge did. I would adopt a starting point of eight years and then allow the full discount of 25 per cent required by the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act , producing a head sentence of six years. 

85I would find special circumstances in the circumstances identified by the sentencing judge. In determining how the head sentence for this offence should be divided between a non-parole period and the balance of the term the Court is not constrained by considerations of proportionality with any sentence for a co-offender. However, it will be necessary to reduce the non-parole period in this sentence so as to preserve an overall ratio of non-parole periods and the fixed term to the head sentences. 

86The sentencing judge accumulated the sentence for the robbery in company offence on the sentence for the armed robbery offence by a period of six months. This degree of accumulation could be regarded as rather lenient, considering that there were two quite separate offences committed many months apart. However, in the absence of any Crown appeal I do not consider that the Court of Criminal Appeal in re-sentencing the applicant should impose a greater degree of accumulation. 

The escape offence 

87In his remarks the sentencing judge said that, if the co-offenders in the escape offence had not been sentenced in the Local Court to terms of imprisonment for as little as three months, he would have sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for at least 12 months for the escape offence. However, the sentencing judge said ""I feel, to some extent, constrained by the sentences imposed by the magistrate, inadequate as they were in my view"" and imposed a sentence of only six months. 

88I would agree with the sentencing judge's views that the sentences imposed in the Local Court on the co-offenders were much too low and that the sentence imposed by his Honour was still very lenient. However, in the absence of any Crown appeal, I do not consider that this Court in re-sentencing the applicant should impose a more severe sentence for the escape offence than the sentencing judge did. 

89I would not, however, make any reduction in the sentence of six months by reason of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act. A sentence of at least eight months (before allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty) was clearly required. 

90Although the sentencing judge would appear to have regarded it as a matter of sentencing discretion, the sentencing judge was required to make the sentence for the escape offence cumulative on the non-parole period of the sentence for the robbery in company offence. Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 57. 

91The total head sentences will be six years six months, consisting of a period of six months from 1 September 2008 to 28 February 2009 solely attributable to part of the sentence for the armed robbery offence and a period of six years commencing on 1 March 2009 attributable to the robbery in company offence and subsuming the remainder of the sentence for the armed robbery offence and the total sentence for the escape offence commencing on the expiration of the non-parole period of the sentence for the robbery in company offence. To maintain an overall ratio of two-thirds between the total non-parole periods and the fixed term and the total head sentences (the ratio adopted by the sentencing judge), it will be necessary to adjust the non-parole period and the balance of the term for the robbery in company sentence. 

Conclusion 

92In my opinion, the following orders should be made. 

Leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Judge Knox on 9 September 2010 granted. 

Appeal against sentence allowed. 

Sentences imposed on 9 September 2010 quashed. 

In lieu thereof, sentence the applicant:- 

1.For the offence of armed robbery to a non-parole period of two years five months commencing on 1 September 2008 and expiring on 31 January 2011 and a balance of the term of two years five months commencing on 1 February 2011 and expiring on 30 June 2013. 

2.For the offence of robbery in company to a non-parole period of three years four months commencing on 1 March 2009 and expiring on 30 June 2012 and a balance of the term of two years eight months commencing on 1 July 2012 and expiring on 28 February 2015. 

3.For the offence of escaping to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing on 1 July 2012 and expiring on 31 December 2012. 

The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 31 December 2012.

		17 November 2011",2011-11-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758201,Regina v Richard Lipton [2011] NSWCCA 247,"Judgment 

1McCOLL JA: Richard Lipton, the respondent, has been charged with two counts of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug pursuant to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He pleaded guilty to both counts on 5 November 2009 and was committed for sentence in the District Court of New South Wales. He appeared for sentence before Finnane DCJ on 23 September 2010. 

2Soon after he was committed for trial the respondent's solicitors asked the Director of Public Prosecutions (the ""DPP"") to produce documents relating to the role of a Ms Melanie Brown in relation to his involvement in the offences to which he had pleaded guilty. After his informal requests were unsuccessful, the respondent's solicitor issued a subpoena seeking production of the documents. The subpoena was set aside on the basis that the respondent had not identified any legitimate forensic purpose warranting an order requiring documents to be produced. A claim of public interest immunity in respect of the documents apparently caught by the terms of the subpoena was not dealt with. 

3When the matter was listed for sentence the respondent filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the proceedings be stayed until, in substance, the DPP disclosed such documents to him. 

4The primary judge acceded to that request: R v Richard Lipton (No 2) [2010] NSWDC 295. He ordered that the sentencing proceedings be stayed until: 

(1)The DPP has sought and obtained from the Officer in Charge all documents pertaining to the relationship between the Police and Ms Melanie Brown; 

(2)The DPP has formed an opinion on whether those documents may be relevant to any matter of sentence of the [respondent]; and 

(3)The DPP has communicated that opinion to the [respondent's] legal adviser. 

5The DPP appeals against his Honour's interlocutory judgment or order pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. He seeks an order vacating the primary judge's orders. The Attorney General of New South Wales was granted leave to intervene. 

6For the reasons that follow I am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed. 

Legislative framework 

7The following sections of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (the ""DPP Act"") are relevant: 

""7 Principal functions 

(1) The principal functions and responsibilities of the Director are: 
(a) to institute and conduct, on behalf of the Crown, prosecutions (whether on indictment or summarily) for indictable offences in the Supreme Court and the District Court, 
(b) to institute and conduct, on behalf of the Crown, appeals in any court in respect of any such prosecution, and 
(c) to conduct, on behalf of the Crown as respondent, any appeal in any court in respect of any such prosecution. ... 

15A Disclosures by investigating police officers 

(1) Police officers investigating alleged indictable offences have a duty to disclose to the Director all relevant information, documents or other things obtained during the investigation that might reasonably be expected to assist the case for the prosecution or the case for the accused person. 
(2) The duty of disclosure continues until one of the following happens: 
(a) the Director decides that the accused person will not be prosecuted for the alleged offence, 
(b) the prosecution is terminated, 
(c) the accused person is convicted or acquitted. 
(3) Police officers investigating alleged indictable offences also have a duty to retain any such documents or other things for so long as the duty to disclose them continues under this section. This subsection does not affect any other legal obligation with respect to the possession of the documents or other things. 
(4) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the duties of police officers under this section, including for or with respect to: 
(a) the recording of any such information, documents or other things, and 
(b) verification of compliance with any such duty. 
(5) The duty imposed by this section is in addition to any other duties of police officers in connection with the investigation and prosecution of offences."" 


8Section 16 of the DPP Act empowers the DPP to give directions referred to in s 16(2) to the Commissioner of Police requiring the latter to refer specified information or kinds of information to the DPP for the purpose of enabling him to consider ""instituting or carrying on a prosecution or proceedings"" of various classes. Section 37 of the DPP Act authorises the Governor to make regulations not inconsistent with the Act. 

9Pursuant to s 13 of the DPP Act, the DPP may, by order in writing, furnish guidelines to the Deputy Directors, the Solicitor and the Crown Prosecutors with respect to the prosecution of offences, including guidelines as to the exercise of specified functions (whether statutory or not). In purported compliance with s 13, the DPP issued Guideline 18 (the ""Disclosure Guidelines"") which relevantly reads: 

"" 18 Disclosure 
[Furnished 20 October 2003; amended 1 June 2007] 
Prosecutors are under a continuing obligation to make full disclosure to the accused in a timely manner of all material known to the prosecutor which can be seen on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution: 
Â· to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; 
Â· to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposes to use; and/or 
Â· to hold out a real as opposed to fanciful prospect of providing a lead to evidence which goes to either of the previous two situations. 

.... 

In all matters prosecuted by the Director, police, in addition to providing the brief of evidence, must notify the Director of the existence of, and where requested disclose, all other documentation, material and other information, including that concerning any proposed witness, which documentation, material or other information might be of relevance to either the prosecution or the defence in relation to the matter and must certify that the Director has been notified of all such documentation, material and other information. (Procedures are in place for such certification to occur.) 

Subject to public interest immunity considerations, such material, if assessed as relevant in the way described above, should be disclosed and, where practicable, made available, to the defence. 
Where a prosecutor receives, directly or indirectly, sensitive documentation, material or information, or material that may possibly be subject to a claim of public interest immunity, the prosecutor should not disclose that documentation, material or information to the defence without first consulting with the police officer-in-charge of the case. The purpose of the consultation is to give that officer the opportunity to raise any concerns as to such disclosure. Accordingly, the officer should be allowed a reasonable opportunity to seek advice if there is any concern or dispute. 

Where there is disagreement between a prosecutor and the police as to what, if any, of the sensitive documentation, material or information should be disclosed and there is no claim of public interest immunity, then in cases being prosecuted by counsel, the matter is to be referred to the Director or a Deputy Director and in cases being prosecuted by lawyers, the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions or a Deputy Solicitor. 

In cases where a claim of public interest immunity is to be pursued or is being pursued, then the question of disclosure will be determined by the outcome of that claim. 

... 

Rare occasions may arise where the overriding interests of justice - for example, a need to protect the integrity of the administration of justice, the identity of an informer (covered by public interest immunity) or to prevent danger to life or personal safety - require the withholding of disclosable information. Such a course should only be taken with the approval of the Director or a Deputy Director. 

... 

Reference should be made to Barristers' Rules 66, 66A and 66B and Solicitors' Rules A66, A66A and A66B (Appendix B). The requirement of Barristers' Rule 66 and Solicitors' Rule A66 to disclose ' the means of finding prospective witnesses ' may be satisfied by making the witnesses available to the opponent where possible, subject to public interest immunity considerations..."" (Emphasis added) 

10On the day s 15A of the DPP Act took effect (19 November 2001), cl 3A was added to the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulation 2000 (the ""2000 Regulation"") by the Director of Public Prosecutions Amendment (Pre-Trial Disclosure) Regulation 2001 (the ""Pre-Trial Disclosure Regulation""). 

11The Pre-Trial Disclosure Regulation was made pursuant to s 15A and s 37 of the DPP Act. Clause 3A prescribed Form 1 as the pro forma Disclosure Certificate to be completed and signed by the police officer for the purposes of s 15A. The 2000 Regulation was repealed in 2005 and replaced by the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulation 2005 (the ""2005 Regulation""), cl 5 of which prescribed the pro forma Disclosure Certificate in the form in force for the purposes of the present proceedings. It did not relevantly differ from that prescribed by the Pre-Trial Disclosure Regulation. The pro forma Disclosure Certificate is as follows: 

""Schedule 1 Disclosure certificate (for prosecutions and advisings)

12Both the Disclosure Guidelines and the pro forma Police Disclosure Certificate were instruments made under the DPP Act. Accordingly, they are to be construed pursuant to the Interpretation Act 1987 and principles of statutory construction not inconsistent with that Act: s 3(1), s 5, Interpretation Act 1987; see also Mallard v R [2005] HCA 68; (2005) 224 CLR 125 (at [63]) per Kirby J; R v Ng [2002] VSCA 108; (2002) VR 257 (at [47] - [56]). 

13Section 15A was inserted into the DPP Act by Sch 2 to the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Pre-Trial Disclosure) Act 2001. In the Second Reading Speech to the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Pre-Trial Disclosure) Bill, the New South Wales Attorney General, the Hon Bob Debus MP, said (New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates , (Hansard), 16 August 2000, at 8288): 

""The purpose of the bill is to introduce a process where courts, on a case-by-case basis, may impose pre-trial disclosure requirements on both the prosecution and the defence to reduce delays and complexities in criminal trials. Pre-trial disclosure in New South Wales is presently subject to ad hoc procedure and practice that diminishes consistency and certainty in case management. The present situation is regulated by a combination of common law rules, legislation, prosecution guidelines, Bar Association and Law Society rules and Supreme Court practice directions. This bill improves upon and formalises these requirements... Schedule 2 amends the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 to formalise the general duty placed on police officers to disclose all relevant information and material obtained during the investigation of an indictable offence to prosecuting authorities ."" (Emphasis added) 

The Attorney General emphasised that the Bill should be read with the draft regulations which were being prepared to ensure they reflected the Government's intention with the reform. 
14The provisions in Sch 1 of the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Pre-Trial Disclosure) Act amended the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to create a regime for pre-trial disclosure in complex criminal trials. There is no suggestion that the respondent's proceedings would have been so characterised. 

15In 2009 the Criminal Procedure Act was further amended by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Case Management) Act 2009 (the ""2009 amendments"") to insert a new Div 3 into Ch 3, Pt 3 entitled ""Case management provisions and other provisions to reduce delays in proceedings"". The purpose of the Division is to reduce delays in proceedings on indictment by requiring certain pre-trial disclosure by the prosecution and the defence and enabling the court to undertake case management where suitable in those proceedings: s 134, Criminal Procedure Act . The Division applies to proceedings in which the indictment was presented on, or filed on or after, the substitution of those provisions on 1 February 2010: cl 63(1), Sch 2, Criminal Procedure Act . The pre-existing case management provisions continued to apply in respect of proceedings in which the indictment was presented or filed before that substitution: cl 63(2), Sch 2, Criminal Procedure Act . 

16Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act applies to proceedings relating to the sentencing of a person by the District Court: s 121, definition of ""criminal proceedings"". However the respondent accepted that the 2009 amendments did not apply, even by analogy, to the respondent's case because of their commencement date. 

17Finally I note that it would appear that any claim for public interest immunity would have to be determined pursuant to s 130 and s 131A of the Evidence Act 1995: see, for example, Attorney General v Kaddour & Turkmani [2001] NSWCCA 456. The Attorney General stated, without demur by either the appellant or respondent, that s 131A was not concerned with disclosure either between the police and the DPP or between the DPP and the accused. 
Statement of the Case 

18The respondent was arrested on 21 May 2009 after a number of drug dealings with an undercover officer (""UCO"") of the New South Wales Police acting under the direction of investigating police attached to the New South Wales Crime Commission. He pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and on 5 November 2009 was committed for sentence in the District Court of New South Wales. 

19Throughout the period during which the respondent conducted the drug dealings with the UCO he was in a personal relationship with Ms Brown. He has instructed his counsel that he had many discussions with her in relation to his drug dealings with the UCO: see Lipton v R [2010] NSWCCA 175 (at [2]). 

20On 16 September 2009, in purported compliance with s 15A of the DPP Act, the NSW Police provided a Disclosure Certificate (the ""Police Disclosure Certificate"") to the DPP for the purposes of the respondent's matter, which included the following: 

""1. Relevant SENSITIVE MATERIAL not contained in the brief to the DPP. 

There IS sensitive information, document or other thing that is not contained in the brief of evidence provided to the DPP which might reasonably be expected to assist in the case for the prosecution or the case for the accused person. 

In this certificate sensitive material means all relevant information, documents or other thing obtained during the investigation that are subject to a bona fide claim of privilege, public interest immunity or statutory immunity."" (Emphasis in original) 

21The Police Disclosure Certificate was not provided to the respondent. 

22On 18 September 2009 the DPP prepared a pre-conference disclosure certificate in accordance with the obligation imposed on him by s 9 of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008. Pursuant to s 9(2) of that Act a copy of the pre-conference disclosure certificate was to be served on the respondent or his legal representative. 

23The pre-conference disclosure certificate referred to the fact a Disclosure Certificate had been served on the DPP by the officer in charge pursuant to cl 5 of the 2005 Regulation. It certified that: 

""In compliance with Guideline 18 of the Prosecution Guidelines ... all material in the possession of the Prosecutor which can be seen on a sensible appraisal by the Prosecutor : 

a. to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case ; 

b. to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence the Prosecution proposes to use, and/or; 

c. to hold out a real (as opposed to a fanciful) prospect of providing a lead to evidence that goes to either of the previous situations; 

has been disclosed excepting material which is subject to a claim of Legal Professional Privilege, Public Interest Immunity, Sexual Assault Communications Privilege or other statutory privilege."" (Emphasis added) 

24Schedule 1 of the pre-conference disclosure certificate, ""Items Served"" was blank under the heading ""Informer Information"". Schedule 2, ""Additional Disclosure of Relevant Information"" stated, in substance, that the prosecution did not rely on the evidence of a witness informer. The pre-conference disclosure certificate did not set out, in terms or otherwise, the first paragraph of the Police Disclosure Certificate. The pre-conference disclosure certificate was tendered before the primary judge. 

25On 9 October 2009, the respondent's solicitor wrote to the DPP drawing attention to references in the Brief of Evidence relating to the role of Ms Brown who, the letter suggested ""was an accomplice regardless of her role as an informant."" He suggested that in order to discharge the obligations of the prosecutor to ensure that all material evidence was disclosed, steps should be taken to require the production of relevant records held by the police in relation to communications with Ms Brown, and Ms Brown's communications with the respondent. On 22 October 2009, the DPP solicitor, Mr Allison, received an email from the Officer in Charge of the investigation stating the Police would not be providing the information sought by the defence and that the Crown Solicitor had been informed. Mr Allison communicated to the respondent's solicitor that there was no further material to be disclosed and there would likely be a public interest immunity issue. 

26On 25 November 2009, the respondent issued a subpoena to the Commissioner of Police and the NSW Crime Commission. The subpoena called for the production of the following: 

""1. All duty books notebooks and diaries then on issue to any officer or investigator involved in the instigation and/or arrest of Richard Alexander LIPTON in the period January 2009 to May 2009. 

2. All statements and reports made in relation to the said matter in relation to Melanie BROWN - referred to in police statements/intercepts as a 'unidentified female'. 

3. All telephone or other electronic recordings of communications as between Richard Alexander LIPTON and Melanie BROWN. 

4. All written or electronic records of communications between any officer of the NSW Police and Melanie BROWN."" 

27By a notice of motion filed in the District Court on 25 February 2010, the Commissioner of Police applied to set aside the subpoena. The Commissioner produced to the Court two folders of documents which it appears came within the terms of the subpoena, but argued that there was no demonstrated legitimate forensic purpose for their production. The Commissioner also submitted that if a legitimate forensic purpose was established, any documents would be protected by a claim of public interest immunity. 

28King DCJ heard the motion. Paragraph one of the subpoena was confined by agreement between the parties. His Honour set aside paragraphs 2 and 4 of the subpoena on the grounds that they lacked a legitimate forensic purpose to require production: R v Lipton [2010] NSWDC 187. The fate of paragraph 3 of the subpoena is not apparent. 
29King DCJ noted that that subpoena appeared to have been issued on the basis that Ms Brown introduced the respondent to the undercover operative and the respondent's suspicion that in so doing she was aware that the person she was introducing him to was, in fact, an undercover police officer: R v Lipton (at [19]). 

30King DCJ summarised the material the respondent relied upon to establish there was a legitimate forensic purpose for the production of documents as follows: 

""12 The material relied on by Mr Hastings QC, counsel for the defendant, is contained in Exhibits 1 and 2. In particular, he points to Exhibit 1, para 8, in which Detective Senior Constable Robb said, in respect of the meeting on 17 April 2009 at Centennial Park: 

'At 12.30pm I observed a Richard Lipton arrive at the Centennial Park restaurant with an unidentified female. At this time Lipton was wearing a white T-shirt, khaki coloured knee length shorts and glasses.' 

13 While the female is further referred to in the course of the observations made by the officer of the meeting, she is not identified by name and remains as 'an unidentified female'. Exhibit 2 is the transcript of that meeting, where again the 'unidentified female', in fact Melanie Brown, takes part in the conversation between the undercover operative and the defendant. Her part in the conversation, according to the transcript, is a very limited one, there being more conversation relating to her in relation to what the parties might eat or drink than in relation to any topic related to the apparent purpose of the conversation: to arrange the supply of prohibited substances to the undercover operative by Mr Lipton. 

14 However, at p 15, she asks the undercover operative, in effect, whether he had received the sample that she had sent. He indicated that someone else had received it, and that he had been told that it was 'good'. However, the conversation apart from the inquiry as to whether he had received the sample was otherwise essentially conducted thereafter between the undercover operative and the defendant. Clearly, Ms Brown was present and a party to the conversation, including the balance of the conversation not referred to but relevant to the prosecution of Mr Lipton in relation to arrangements for the supply of prohibited substances, and an agreement between the undercover operative and the defendant to pursue that object."" 

31His Honour concluded (at [24]) that no evidence had been provided to the Court to support any contention that the respondent was coerced or pressured or enticed into committing the offences or that the matter involved any entrapment by police officers. He characterised the subpoena (at [25]) as a ""fishing expedition to establish whether or not Melanie Brown was a police informant"". 

32The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the respondent's appeal from King DCJ's judgment: Lipton v R . McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hislop J and Barr AJ agreed) referred to the evidence King DCJ had described (at [12] - [14]). He observed (at [13]) that his Honour had: 

""...emphasised the fact that apart from the one occasion to which I have referred there was no other time at which Ms Brown was recorded as being present when arrangements were being made between the applicant and the undercover operative for the sale of drugs. Furthermore, his Honour found that there was no evidence of Ms Brown having coerced, pressured, or enticed the applicant to either commence dealing with the undercover officer or continuing in any way with any of the offences which he had committed. His Honour did accept that if Ms Brown had been acting as an agent of the authorities and she did coerce, pressure or entice the applicant into committing offences he would not otherwise have committed, this would be particularly relevant on sentence."" 

33McClellan CJ at CL dealt with Mr Hasting's submissions as follows: 

""16 In the course of his written submissions on behalf of the applicant, senior counsel said that, although evidence to this effect was not tendered, the applicant 'is, of course, directly aware of his own knowledge of the inducements and enticements made by Ms Brown to him continue to deal with the undercover officer in the face of his reluctance to do so, particularly in relation to the last dealing in which the undercover officer had gone to the applicant to supply a kilogram of cocaine and he can give evidence of those matters.' Quite apart from the applicant's own knowledge his counsel adverted to six matters which were said to be clear indicators in the evidence that Ms Brown was acting in collusion with the police. These were: 

a. The presence and participation of Ms Brown in the meeting in Centennial Park on 17 April 2009 to which I have previously referred; 

b. The continued reference by the police in statements to 'an unidentified female' which the police knew to be Ms Brown; 

c. The telephone conversations of the applicant were intercepted during the investigation and the police would have been aware of numerous conversations between the applicant and Ms Brown concerning the supply of drugs by the applicant to the undercover officer; 

d. The interception also captured numerous SMS messages to similar effect; 

e. Although the involvement of Ms Brown was obvious, she was 'written out' of the brief of evidence served by the prosecution; and 

f. Ms Brown was never arrested or charged in relation to the matters with which the applicant has been charged. 

17 It was submitted that these matters were sufficient to show that it was 'on the cards' that the documents described in the subpoena are likely to contain records of communications between the investigating police and Ms Brown and accordingly the applicant was 'not fishing' for the purpose of ascertaining whether Ms Brown was an informant. Furthermore, it was submitted that as a number of documents had been provided to the Court it was perverse that the Court should rule on the matter before first examining those documents. 

18 The applicant accepts that if Ms Brown had acted on her own initiative that would be the applicant's 'bad luck' and would have minimal relevance to his sentence. However, if Ms Brown had dealt with the applicant as a result of collaborating with investigating police, it was submitted that his case for a reduced sentence would be much stronger, but he requires access to the police documents if he is to effectively make that submission. Accordingly the applicant submitted that his Honour was in error in concluding that there was a lack of evidence to support the submission that there was a legitimate forensic purpose. It was submitted that his Honour had blurred into one general issue the two steps, identified in Saleam and Chidgey , which are involved in assessing the claim for access to the documents, namely the expression of the legitimate forensic purpose, and then, whether it had been shown that it 'was on the cards' that the documents would assist the applicant's case. 

19 To my mind there are difficulties in the applicant's present position. I accept that the conjunction of circumstances put forward by the applicant to which I have referred in [16] raises a suspicion that Ms Brown may have had a relationship with the investigating police. However, the applicant has chosen not to place any evidence before the Court which supports the submission that Ms Brown took any step to coerce, pressure or entice him to deal with the undercover officer. Although that assertion is made by his counsel, before I would be satisfied that the applicant had established that it was 'on the cards' that the documents the subject of objection would assist his case, there would need to be at least some evidence of the influence which Ms Brown may have had in respect of the applicant's actions. 

20 In written submissions on behalf of the respondent senior counsel acknowledged that before the primary judge the resolution of the matter turned upon the question of whether the applicant had demonstrated, beyond mere suspicion or speculation, that it was 'on the cards' that the documents would assist in proving the assumed facts and therefore materially assist his case. It was submitted that the highest the applicant's case rose was a suggestion that Ms Brown may have facilitated the detection and obtaining of evidence to prosecute the applicant but there was no evidence that she had encouraged him to commit the offence. 

21 In my opinion this submission should be accepted. Although the matter is attended with significant suspicion the evidence does not presently suggest that the offence might not have been committed had the police not in some way facilitated it ( Taouk v R (1992) 65 A Crim R 387 at 403)."" 

34McClellan CJ at CL added the following comments: 

""22 Although the application to this Court should be dismissed, it would seem that the resolution of the present application may not be an end to the matter. If the applicant continues to assert that Ms Brown acted so as to coerce, pressure or entice him to deal with the undercover officer, no doubt he can bring evidence of her actions which have had the relevant effect. Depending upon the nature of that evidence, it may be possible to infer from the matters to which I have referred ... together with the fact that a volume of documents has been produced to the Court in answer to the relevant paragraphs of the schedule to the subpoena, that it is 'on the cards' that the documents would materially assist the applicant's case on sentence. However, that would depend upon the issue of a fresh subpoena and, if there is a challenge by the respondent, the evidence tendered in support of the applicant's position."" 

35The respondent did not issue a fresh subpoena. Instead he filed a notice of motion in the District Court on 11 October 2010 seeking the following orders: 
""(1) That the proceedings against [the respondent] be stayed until such time as the Crown discloses to the Defence, materials relating to communications between member of the New South Wales Police Force and Melanie Brown in relation to the investigation into the matters which are the subject of the charges against [the respondent], currently in possession of the New South Wales Police. 

(2) Such other orders as the Court sees fit."" 

Primary judgment 

36The primary judge heard the motion. 

37Mr Allison, a solicitor employed in the Office of the DPP with care, control and management of the respondent's proceedings swore an affidavit in response to the notice of motion. The affidavit set out some background to the respondent's arrest, charging and the provision by the Police to the DPP of evidence relating to the charges and communications with the respondent's solicitor concerning the latter's request to obtain access to the documents. 

38It also referred to the Police Disclosure Certificate as follows: 

""7. Pursuant to s15A of the [DPP] Act, the police forwarded a disclosure certificate to the ODPP...dated 16 September 2009. The disclosure certificate indicated there was relevant sensitive material not contained in the brief of evidence..."" 

39The Police Disclosure Certificate was not attached to Mr Allison's affidavit. It was not referred to in any of Mr Allison's communications with the respondent's solicitor. It does not appear to have been tendered before the primary judge. The DPP made copies of it available to the Court during the hearing of the appeal. He did not suggest the Court should not have regard to its contents. No doubt this was because the contents of the Police Disclosure Certificate were, in substance, before the primary judge. First, the pre-conference disclosure certificate referred to the fact that, in substance, all relevant material had been disclosed to the accused except material subject to a claim for privileges, including public interest immunity. It could be inferred from that reference that cl 1 of the Police Disclosure Certificate had been completed by the deletion of the words "" IS NO"" in the pro forma cl 5 certificate. That inference was confirmed by the statement in paragraph 7 of Mr Allison's affidavit, which repeated the language of the heading to cl 1 of the pro-forma cl 5 certificate. 
40Next, Mr Allison set out his communications with the respondent's solicitor in late 2009. He stated that other than the material served in the brief of evidence, he had never had possession of, or seen, documents relating to the respondent or Ms Brown and that he did not know if such documents were in existence. He further stated: 

""27. I believe that the police are claiming privilege in relation to the material sought by Mr Lipton. 

28. I believe that the police have declined, and continue to decline, to disclose the material sought by Mr Lipton in order to maintain the privilege."" 

41Mr Allison was not cross-examined. 

42The respondent's solicitor, Mr Moustacas, swore an affidavit dated 7 October 2010 for the purposes of the stay proceedings. It set out some background material, including pointing out that in response to the subpoena issued on 25 November 2009 counsel for the Commissioner of Police had produced two folders of documents which he asserted ""came within the terms of the subpoena"" but successfully persuaded King DCJ that the respondent should not have access to them. He attached two letters to the Office of the DPP in identical terms, dated 17 June 2010 and 13 September 2010, drawing attention to this fact and stated: 

""At the hearing before King DCJ, counsel for the police produced to the court two folders of documents coming within the terms of the subpoena, which sought the production of records of communications between police and Melanie Brown. It is clear therefore that there exists a substantial body of documentation which is material to the claim made on behalf of our client that Melanie Brown was acting at the behest of the investigating police when encouraging our client to continue to deal with the UCO. 

... 

Our client should not have been denied access to this material by the obfuscation of the investigating police. We respectfully submit that it was never appropriate for you to simply accept the word of the police as to the discharge of your duty of disclosure, and that it is incumbent upon you to examine the material which you now know exists, in order to confirm that it should be properly disclosed. 

I note that DPP Guideline 18 provides a procedure for the treatment of material which may be the subject of a claim for public interest immunity, culminating in a referral to the Director or a Deputy Director, or the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions, or a Deputy Solicitor. It is not clear that the procedure is appropriate in the light of authorities such as R v Bunting (2002) 84 SASR 378 and R v Petroulias (No 22) (2007) 176 A Crim R 309, which indicates that, where there is a claim of privilege, the prosecution should still exercise independently its duty of disclosure. 

Accordingly, we ask that you properly exercise the duty of disclosure, at least as set down in your Guidelines and advise us of the outcome prior to the sentence hearing."" 

43Mr Allison responded to the second letter on 20 September 2010 advising that the Office of the DPP considered the respondent's ""entitlement to the material was determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal"". 

44Mr Moustacas wrote to Mr Allison again on 22 October 2009 urging him to consider his position, drawing his attention to authorities and reiterating that there was objective evidence that relevant material existed concerning Mr Brown's role in ""introducing our client to the UCO..."". The letter stated: 
""This material relates to a matter of some significance to our client. There is a live issue as to the circumstances in which our client was enticed into dealing with a large commercial quantity of each drug, which he says was at the instigation of Brown who was clearly acting on behalf of the police. There is obviously material in the possession of the police which is relevant to that issue and should be disclosed. 

Accordingly, we ask that there be a proper discharge of the prosecution duty of disclosure with steps being taken to ascertain what material exists and why it cannot be produced, rather than simply adopting a blanket denial by the police."" 

45The primary judge concluded (at [8]) that: 

""8. In answer to the notice of motion, Mr Allison has sworn an affidavit in which he makes it clear that he has not sought any documents from the Police for his inspection. Rather, he has enquired of the officer in charge about what information he has and has been told that there is no information. I would take the answer of the officer in charge to mean that he does not intend to disclose to Mr Allison documents that he has concerning Melanie Brown. Having regard as I do to what occurred in the earlier proceedings, I would draw the inference that the Police regard the documents that undoubtedly exist as being not producible because of the decisions of Judge King and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Mr Allison has taken the view that he has no duty or even right to seek the documents."" 

46His Honour then considered the respondent's submission that the DPP was under an obligation to form his own opinion on the production of documents and could not delegate this duty to a police officer. He set out the Disclosure Guidelines and the form of pro forma Police Disclosure Certificate, then said: 

""13. What is abundantly clear from a consideration of the judgments of Judge King and the Court of Criminal Appeal is that there is material linking Melanie Brown to the offender and to the Police and it should be obvious to the prosecuting authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions that there is material available which is relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case, namely the culpability of the offender and whether this is lessened in any way by the activities of and relationship with Melanie Brown. 

14. It also seems obvious to me that there could be no public interest in suppressing her name since it is publicly known. Part of her role is already known and there is every reason to believe that Police officers have in their possession material that could relate to the relevant issues in the sentencing of the offender."" 

47He referred again to Mr Allison in the following terms: 

""15. What is also clear is that Mr Allison has taken the view that because there has been a claim of public interest immunity by the Police, he has no obligation to inquire further. 
16. In taking this attitude, he is following a practice that has been in existence for as long as I can remember of the Crown taking no interest in public interest immunity claims and leaving it entirely to the Police who are represented in court by the Crown Solicitor and counsel briefed by the Crown Solicitor. 

17. However, in my opinion that practice is wrong and should be abandoned. It is the prosecution that has the duty of disclosure. There may be an additional disclosure requirement imposed on Police officers, but that does not absolve the Director of Public Prosecutions from independently assessing whether or not there is material that should be disclosed. In my opinion, the Director cannot hide behind a certificate given by a Police officer and must, in circumstances where it is clear that Police have in their possession material that could be relevant to assist the accused either in mounting a defence or in mitigating sentence, enquire whether, notwithstanding the certificate, other information exists that might be relevant for disclosure to the accused. I have been referred to a number of authorities and in particular to the following: Grey v the Queen [2001] HCA 65; Mallard v the Queen [2005] HCA 68; Regina v Blackledge [1996] 1 Cr App R 326; Regina v Brown [1994] 1 WLR 1599; Regina v Maguire and others [1992] 2 WLR 767; Regina v Petroulias (no 22) [2007] NSWSC 2007 [sic, 154]. 

18. These authorities all support the proposition that the duty of disclosure is on the Crown. A court cannot order the Crown to do its duty and to insist that the Police disclose information to it, but if the failure to disclose information creates a miscarriage of justice then the court can do something about the miscarriage of justice. "" (Emphasis added) 

48The primary judge considered the authorities in the following terms: 

""19. In the case of Mallard [2005] HCA 68, Police withheld from the prosecution material that might well have assisted the accused. The prosecution itself did not deliberately withhold information from the defence. It relied on the Police to provide all relevant information. Nevertheless, the High Court of Australia set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial. This is but one example of what can happen when the Police are allowed to determine what is relevant and what should be disclosed. 

20. That being so, in my opinion, the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot through an employed solicitor refuse to seek access to the documents that bear on this issue on the basis that it is a matter for the Police and their views are what matters. 

21. Contrary to what Mr Allison wrote, this issue was determined neither by his Honour Judge King nor by the Court of Criminal Appeal since the matter was not raised at all before Mr Hastings raised it with me. 

22. A review of the authorities makes it plain that grave miscarriages of justice can occur when Police officers keep to themselves material relevant to an issue. 

23. I have never understood how this practice has developed. The Crown is one and indivisible in the State of New South Wales. The Director of Public Prosecutions prosecutes all trials in the State of New South Wales. Police have no part in the prosecution process. Police conduct investigations and collect evidence but at no point do they determine whether somebody should be prosecuted. They are entitled to express their opinions to the offices [sic, should be officers] of the Director of Public Prosecutions and they can seek advice from officers of the Director. 

24. There can be no question of public interest immunity as between the Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. If the Director requires the Police to produce documents which the Police are in the opinion should be the subject of a public interest immunity claim, the Director can form an opinion about the correctness of that claim and, as the guidelines make clear, if the public interest in not disclosing information outweighs the public interest in proceeding to trial or continuing proceedings in someway, the Director can abandon the trial or the proceedings. 

25. In my opinion, the Director of Public Prosecutions through his officers is obliged to form opinions as to whether documents exist and evidence exists that might bear upon a real question in proceedings, other than some matter that goes merely to credit. 

26. Once it is clear that relevant material exists, it is the prosecution's duty to obtain that material, inspect it and determine whether that material should be produced to the accused or the offender. If a Police officer is of the belief that the material should not be produced to the accused or the offender, he should nevertheless produce it to the Director of Public Prosecutions and express his opinions as to why the material should not be made available to the accused/offender. 

27. The prosecutor then, as the person responsible for conducting the proceedings should make a decision. If there is a legitimate dispute to be litigated, it should be litigated but by the Director and not by the Police. 

28. In my opinion, the practice that has been followed for many years is wrong in principle and should be discontinued. 

29. In my opinion, the Director of Public Prosecutions, knowing that material may exist that could bear upon legitimate matters concerning the sentence of the offender, has through his solicitor employee, Mr Allison, declined to make any enquiries on the basis that the matter has already been determined by the courts. In my opinion, that has not happened at all and the Director of Public Prosecutions is under an obligation to seek the material that is relevant to this issue, to examine it and to form an opinion. 

30. Of course, it is for the Director to form an opinion as to whether there should be a disclosure. The notice of motion does not ask for the production of any documents, but asks merely that the Director get documents that obviously exist and form an opinion as to whether they should be disclosed. It is a very unusual application since it is made in circumstances where the offender has pleaded guilty to a serious offence. Nevertheless, there appears to be in existence material that may bear upon a very relevant question as to whether the offender was led into committing an offence or offences by Melanie Brown, either acting on her own behalf or acting as an agent for the Police. The only sanction I can impose, if the Director declines to seek any documents from the Police to enable him to form his view on these issues, is to grant a stay of proceedings and to consider granting bail."" (Emphasis added) 

49His Honour ordered (at [31]) a stay of proceedings until the DPP had sought and obtained the documents and formed an opinion as to their relevance to the sentence of the offender, had formed an opinion on whether those documents may be relevant to any matter of sentence of the respondent and had communicated that opinion to the respondent's legal adviser. 

50As is apparent, the primary judge's orders did not grant the relief sought in the notice of motion, which was for disclosure of the materials relating to communications between the Police and Ms Brown, in the Police's possession, in relation to the investigation into the matters which are the subject of the charges against the respondent. It appears from paragraph [30] of his Honour's reasons that he thought the notice of motion merely asked the DPP to get the documents and form an opinion as to whether they should be disclosed. His Honour's misconception of the nature of the application clearly influenced his view in staying the proceedings. Neither the DPP nor the Attorney General suggested this misconception was material. 

DPP/Attorney General's submissions 

51Although the primary judge did not expressly refer to it, all parties and the Attorney General accepted that s 15A of the DPP Act was critical to the question of the police obligation, if any, to disclose, in the sense of physically produce to the DPP, any information which fell within the terms of the respondent's notice of motion. 

52Both the DPP and the Attorney General submitted that the primary judge's findings and conclusions were tainted by error in a number of material respects, which were substantially the same. I shall summarise their submissions as if made collectively, even if one was not made by both. 

53First, they argued that the primary judge erred in construing s 15A of the DPP Act as obliging the Police to disclose, as in physically produce, all relevant material to the DPP. They contended his Honour failed to consider the operation of the legislative regime surrounding disclosure of material to the DPP. They submitted that s 15A of the DPP Act required the Police to disclose the existence of the material, but not the material itself. They argued that a contrary interpretation of the provision would be inconsistent with the form contemplated of the Disclosure Certificate prescribed by the 2005 Regulation and the Disclosure Guidelines. They contended that the fact that both documents contemplated the Police disclosing the fact they held ""sensitive relevant material"" but that it was subject to a public interest immunity claim, was consistent with the practice where material the subject of a public interest immunity claim was withheld from the prosecution by the Police and the claim was dealt with by the courts. They argued that that practice was consistent with the fact that it was for the court, not the prosecutor, to determine a claim of public interest immunity. 

54Secondly, taking up the last point, both criticised his Honour's statement (at [23]) that ""[t]he Crown is one and indivisible in the State of New South Wales"" to the extent that it appeared to underpin his Honour's conclusions (at [23]) that, in effect, the Police were subordinate to the DPP insofar as determining what evidence could be used in a prosecution and (at [24]) that ""there can be no question of public interest immunity as between the Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions"" and that it was for the DPP to form an opinion about the correctness of any public interest immunity claim. They emphasised the separation between the functions of the Police and the DPP. They submitted that the agencies that provided the DPP with information for the purposes of a prosecution were independent third parties with investigative functions whose interests necessarily differed and diverged from the DPP's. They pointed to s 7 - s 10 of the DPP Act as demonstrating that the DPP was a creature of statute with specified prosecutorial functions exercised on behalf of the Crown. They argued that that statutory structure demonstrated that there was no support for the proposition that a prosecutor had any duty or power to see that a claim to public interest immunity was ventilated before a court: see Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) v County Court of Victoria (1997) 98 A Crim R 270 (at 279). 

55Thirdly, the DPP and the Attorney General submitted that, in any event, the primary judge's fundamental error was to assume that there was material in existence linking Ms Brown to the Police in circumstances where King DCJ and the Court of Criminal Appeal had been unable to reach that conclusion. They also complained that his Honour erred in concluding that such material was relevant to the respondent's culpability for the offences to which he had pleaded guilty. They contended that the respondent had not advanced the state of the evidence from that before King DCJ (and the Court of Criminal Appeal) on the question whether there was a legitimate forensic purpose to require the production of any further documents. 

56Fourthly, they complained that the primary judge erred (at [8]) in that there was no evidence to support the inference that the Police had taken the view that ""the documents that undoubtedly exist [are] not producible because of the decisions of Judge King and the Court of Criminal Appeal"". Even if there had been a basis for that inference, they contended that that would have been a proper stance for the Police to have taken bearing in mind that both decisions established that the respondent had not demonstrated a legitimate forensic purpose to require the production of any documents pursuant to the subpoena considered in that case. 

57Fifthly, they complained that his Honour erred (at [14]) in concluding that ""that there could be no public interest in suppressing [Ms Brown's] name since it is publicly known"" insofar as that finding appeared to found his conclusion that any claim for public interest immunity was confined to protecting disclosure of her name. 

58Sixthly, they challenged the primary judge's assertion (at [15]) that ""Mr Allison has taken the view that because there has been a claim of public interest immunity by the Police, he has no obligation to inquire further"" and (at [17]) that the DPP hid behind the Police Disclosure Certificate. They submitted that Mr Allison's affidavit demonstrated that he was active in making enquires of the Police for the purposes of determining whether or not it was intended that any further material be produced. They contended that Mr Allison had been entitled to rely upon the Police Disclosure Certificate statement that there was relevant material, but that it was subject to a public interest immunity claim. In such circumstances they contended it would be a sterile and unnecessary exercise for the DPP to exercise his power under s 16 of the DPP Act (assuming that provision enabled him so to do) to ask the Police to provide the information: Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) v County Court of Victoria (at 281) per Ashley J. 

59Seventhly, they submitted that the primary judge's orders had the effect of seeking to force the DPP to act outside the confines of his statutory functions. This was because the orders necessarily contemplated that the DPP would make the decision as to whether there was a public interest immunity claim independently of the Police decision. This, they argued, was not part of the Director's function and, further, would usurp the function of a court of competent jurisdiction in determining a claim for public interest immunity. Furthermore, they submitted that the exercise of the discretion to order a stay of proceedings was inappropriate when the public interest immunity issue had not been resolved. 

60The effect of these errors, they contended, was that there was no basis for the primary judge's ultimate conclusion (at [29]) that ""the Director of Public Prosecutions is under an obligation to seek the material that is relevant to this issue, to examine it"" and (at [30]) ""to form an opinion as to whether there should be a disclosure"". 

61Finally, they submitted that there could be no miscarriage of justice supporting the conclusion that a stay should have been granted in circumstances where the respondent could, and should, have taken the route of issuing a further subpoena to the Police requiring the production of documents to enable any resolution of the public interest immunity claim to be determined by a court. This was a factor, they argued, the primary judge should have taken into consideration in exercising his discretion. They also pointed to the fact that the Disclosure Guidelines contemplated that in the event that a claim for public interest immunity resulted in material not being able to be disclosed, then the matter was then referred to the DPP or the Deputy DPP to consider a number of issues, including whether or not in those circumstances the prosecution ought to proceed. 

Respondent's submissions 

62The respondent submitted that s 7 of the DPP Act made the DPP responsible for conducting prosecutions. He referred to the duty imposed on the prosecution at common law to disclose relevant material of which he was aware. He contended that that duty was not ousted by any provisions of the DPP Act, the 2005 Regulation or the Disclosure Guidelines. 

63Secondly, he submitted that the reference to ""disclose"" in s 15A of the DPP Act should be read as meaning to ""produce"" and that the function of the Director in s 16(2) of ""carrying on"" proceedings included the duty to decide whether proceedings may be carried on in the sense of being ""continued"". He argued that s 16 demonstrated that the prosecutor's duty of disclosure was not restricted to documents in his possession but that he had overriding authority when it came to the conduct of prosecutions and access to material. 

64Thirdly, the respondent referred to the Statement of Facts prepared by the DPP to be handed to the sentencing judge which, he submitted (without contradiction by the appellant) made no reference to the circumstances in which he was introduced to the UCO or Ms Brown. He argued that if Ms Brown acted on the instructions of the Police in creating a situation in which the respondent could commit an offence by introducing him to the UCO, that would be relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences to which he had pleaded guilty, the standard non-parole period for which is fifteen years imprisonment. 

65In that light, the respondent contended that the DPP's failure to obtain all documents from the Police meant he had failed to discharge his common law duty of disclosure properly, resulting in an abuse of process and a miscarriage of justice such that it was proper for the primary judge to stay the sentencing proceedings. He submitted that the primary judge was correct to find that there could be no question of public interest immunity as between the Police and the DPP. 

66Fourthly, the respondent argued that, in any event, the public interest immunity issue was a red herring which diverted attention from the real issue as to what the DPP should do in circumstances where he had not seen all relevant documents. 

67Finally, the respondent submitted that if the DPP concluded that a claim of public interest immunity may preclude production of material relevant to his sentencing, the DPP may need to consider what action should be taken to protect his interests, including the appointment of a special counsel to make submissions in relation to documents or information to which the respondent was not privy or discontinuing the proceedings: see R v H; R v C [2004] UKHL 3; [2004] 2 AC 134 (at [22], [36]); State of New South Wales v Public Transport Ticketing [2011] NSWCA 60 (at [19] - [35]) per Allsop P (Hodgson JA and Sackville AJA agreeing). 

Consideration 

68It is uncontroversial that evidence of police entrapment is a mitigating factor relevant to sentencing proceedings: R v Taouk (1992) 65 A Crim R 387 (at 396 ff) per Badgery-Parker J (Clarke JA and Abadee J agreeing). After a careful analysis of authority, his Honour concluded that the effect evidence of entrapment would have in the sentencing context was: 

""... that even where the conduct of the police was regarded by the court as within the bounds of acceptable police procedures, nevertheless if there was a possibility that the offence might not have been committed had the police not in some way facilitated it, that might be regarded as a matter which diminished the culpability of the offender . In my view, the point at which, if at all, the court will intervene to mark its disapproval of conduct by police which goes beyond that which the community regards as acceptable is the point where an application is made to exclude evidence obtained by improper means. Such considerations have, in my view, little to do with sentencing where the fundamental task of the court is always to evaluate the criminality involved. The sentencing process is concerned with the level of culpability of the offender who, whether as a result of police incitement, inducement or encouragement or otherwise embarks upon criminal conduct . See also Dugan [1984] 2 NSWLR 554 where this Court rejected the submission that in a case where conduct by police facilitated but did not incite the commission of a crime, the sentence should be reduced to mark the court's disapproval of the police conduct."" (Emphasis added) 

69It is also uncontroversial that in order to gain access to documents held by the Police by issuing a subpoena the respondent would have to establish that the documents were sought for a legitimate forensic purpose and secondly, that ""it is on the cards"" that the documents will materially assist his case: Lipton v R (at [14]) per McClellan CJ at CL referring to R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 342 (at [11]) and Attorney General (NSW) v Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65; (2008) 182 A Crim R 536 (at [64]). 

70In Attorney General (NSW) v Chidgey (at [65] - [67]) Beazley JA (with whom James and Kirby JJ agreed) explained the genesis of the expression ""on the cards"" in a passage which bears repetition: 

""65 The genesis of the expression 'on the cards' is to be found in the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Alister v R [1983] HCA 45; (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414. In Alister , the High Court was concerned with a subpoena issued to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in the course of a criminal trial for conspiracy to murder and attempt to murder. The police (acting upon information provided by an informant) had been able to foil the conspiracy, which involved an intention to murder by exploding a bomb near the intended victim's home. The case was notorious - the accused members of Ananda Marga had been suspected of placing a bomb outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, in an attempt to kill the Prime Minister of India. The subpoena had required ASIO to produce all files and documents relating to the informant in respect of ASIO's investigation of Ananda Marga. The Attorney General for the Commonwealth objected to the production on security-based public interest grounds. 

66 Gibbs CJ, at 414, noted that the applicants who had sought the production of the documents were not able to state whether or not the documents existed, or if they did, whether they were likely to assist the applicant's case. His Honour observed, however, that it was not unreasonable to believe that documents were in existence and that 'one would guess that any reports ... would be adverse to the applicants'. His Honour referred to the conflicting position in England as to the circumstances in which a court would inspect documents in a case where public interest immunity was claimed. It is necessary to set out that passage in full, in order to understand the context in which his Honour introduced the terms 'on the cards'. He said: 

'Just as in the balancing process the scales must swing in favour of discovery if the documents are necessary to support the defence of an accused person whose liberty is at stake in a criminal trial, so, in considering whether to inspect documents for the purpose of deciding whether they should be disclosed, the court must attach special weight to the fact that the documents may support the defence of an accused person in criminal proceedings. Although a mere 'fishing' expedition can never be allowed, it may be enough that it appears to be 'on the cards' that the documents will materially assist the defence .' (Emphasis added) (Citations omitted) 

67 It is both important and instructive to understand the manner in which Gibbs CJ saw this test operating at a practical level. He said, as a continuation of the passage just quoted: 

'If, for example, it were known that an important witness for the Crown had given a report on the case to ASIO it would not be right to refuse disclosure simply because there were no grounds for thinking that the report could assist the accused. To refuse discovery only for that reason would leave the accused with a legitimate sense of grievance, since he would not be able to test the evidence of the witness by comparing it with the report, and would be likely to give rise to the reproach that justice had not been seen to be done.' "" 
71As her Honour pointed out (at [68]), Gibbs CJ's approach in Alister v R [1983] HCA 45; (1984) 154 CLR 404 has been consistently applied in this State. 
Staying criminal proceedings 

72A stay of criminal proceedings can only be justified when there is ""a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences' "": Jago v District Court (NSW) [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23 (at 34) per Mason CJ. There is no definitive category of extreme cases in which a permanent stay of criminal proceedings will be ordered: Dupas v R [2010] HCA 20; (2010) 241 CLR 237. 

73The question of whether criminal proceedings should be permanently stayed on abuse of process grounds falls to be determined by a weighing process involving a subjective balancing of a variety of factors and considerations, including the requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and in the conviction of those guilty of crime, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice: Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; (1993) 177 CLR 378 (at 395 - 396); Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 (at [172]) per Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreeing). The touchstone in every case is fairness: Petroulias v R [2007] NSWCCA 154; (2007) 176 A Crim R 302 (at [17]) per Ipp JA (with whom Latham and Fullerton JJ agreed). 

74The decision to grant a stay is a discretionary one which may only be set aside on appeal if there is an error of the nature of that referred to in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 (at 504 - 505), that is to say, if it is clearly wrong, where the judicial officer has acted upon a wrong principle, or taken extraneous or irrelevant matters into account or failed to give weight, or sufficient weight, to relevant considerations, or made a mistake as to the facts: Petroulias v R (at [11]). 

The prosecution's duty to act fairly 
75A Crown Prosecutor is bound, or under a duty, to call all available material witnesses. This is not a duty owed by the prosecutor to the accused which is imposed by some rule of law. Rather it forms part of a description of the functions of a Crown Prosecutor. It is an aspect of the general obligation imposed upon a Crown Prosecutor to act fairly in the discharge of the function which he or she performs in a criminal trial which is ultimately to assist in the attainment of justice between the Crown and the accused: Whitehorn v R [1983] HCA 42; (1983) 152 CLR 657 (at 674, 675) per Dawson J. 

76In Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 Hayne J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed) described the nature of criminal trials and the prosecutor's role in the following terms (footnotes omitted): 

""[71] A criminal trial in Australia is an accusatorial and adversarial process. In that process, prosecuting counsel has a role that is bounded by long-established duties and responsibilities. Those duties and responsibilities are summarised when it is said that '[t]he duty of prosecuting counsel is not to obtain a conviction at all costs but to act as a minister of justice'. In the Supreme Court of Canada, Rand J described the role of the prosecutor as being: 

'...not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime. Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly. The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings . [Emphasis added.] 

A central, even the central, element in that role is 'ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused' . 

[72] The prosecution case is to be presented in the context of an adversarial process in which each side 'is free to decide the ground on which it or he will contest the issue, the evidence which it or he will call, and what questions whether in chief or in cross-examination shall be asked'. But again, there are boundaries to that process. The choices that have been described are to be made 'subject to the rules of evidence, fairness and admissibility'. As Dawson J said in Whitehorn v R : 

'A trial does not involve the pursuit of truth by any means. The adversary system is the means adopted and the judge's role in that system is to hold the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations .' [Emphasis added.] 

It is not for the judge to attempt to remedy the deficiencies of a party's case. As was pointed out in Whitehorn , and earlier in Richardson , the judge will frequently lack the knowledge and the information that would be necessary to make a decision about whether and how any deficiency would be remedied. But it is for the judge to 'hold the balance between the contending parties'. It is for the judge to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly."" (Emphasis in original) 

77In R v Reardon (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 197; (2004) 60 NSWLR 454 (at [46] ff) Hodgson JA set out, in reasons not essential to his judgment, a number of propositions dealing with the Crown's duty of disclosure: 

""[46] It has been said that the inequality of resources as between the Crown and the accused 'is ameliorated by the obligation on the part of the prosecution to make available all material which may prove helpful to the defence': McIlkenny (1991) 93 Cr App R 287 at 312. The content of that obligation has been considered in a number of English cases. 

[47] In R v Ward [1993] 2 All ER 577, the Court of Appeal asserted that, if in a criminal case the prosecution wished to claim public interest immunity for documents helpful to the defence, the prosecution is in law obliged to give notice to the defence of the asserted right so that if necessary the Court can be asked to rule on the legitimacy of this claim. This view was upheld and elaborated by the Court of Appeal in R v Davis [1993] 2 All ER 643, where it was qualified to the extent that it was said that in certain exceptional case an ex parte application could be made by the prosecution to the Court to rule on the question of public interest immunity. 

[48] In R v Keane [1994] 2 All ER 478, the Court of Appeal held that, subject to the question of public interest, the prosecution must disclose documents which are material; and it said that documents are material if they can be seen, on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution, (a) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case, (b) to raise or possibly raise a new issue the existence of which is not apparent from the prosecution case, or (c) to hold out a real (as opposed to a fanciful) prospect of providing a lead on evidence going to either (a) or (b). This view was approved by the House of Lords in R v Brown (Winston) [1998] AC 367 at 376-7, with the comment that 'an issue in the case' must be given a broad interpretation. Category (c) makes it clear that the duty is not limited to matters that would be admissible in evidence. 

[49] However, in Brown it was also held that the duty did not extend to disclosing material relevant only to the credibility of defence (as opposed to prosecution) witnesses. 

[50] In R v Mills [1998] AC 382, it was held that the duty extended to disclosure of statements taken by the prosecution authorities from witnesses not called by the prosecution, and not merely to the disclosure of the identity of such witnesses. 

[51] The obligation of disclosure has been considered by the High Court of Australia in Grey v R [2001] 75 ALJR 1708, but in circumstances where the Crown conceded that disclosure should have been made, it was not necessary for the Court to say anything about the content of the obligation. This question is adverted to only in footnote 20 to para [30] of the judgment of Kirby J. In the dissenting judgment of Simpson J in this Court ((2000) 111 A Crim R 314), which was upheld by the High Court, reference is made to prosecution guidelines and Bar Rules rather than to the principles stated in the English cases. 

[52] There has been some discussion of the English cases in other States of Australia. R v Mills was distinguished in R v Reci (1997) 70 SASR 78, and its statement of principle was not adopted. However, in other respects the few Australian cases that have commented on the English cases have not suggested they are not applicable in Australia: see in particular R v Garofalo [1999] 2 VR 625 at [58]-[63], Easterday v R [2003] WASCA 69 at [194], [390]. 

[53] It was stated by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Cannon v Tahche (2002) 5 VR 317 that a prosecutor's duty of disclosure is ethical in nature and is a discretionary responsibility exercisable according to the circumstances as the prosecutor perceives them to be; and that it is a duty owed to the court and not one enforceable at law at the instance of the accused. However, this was said in rejecting a claim for damages for misfeasance in public office; and the Court acknowledged (at [58]) that a breach of that duty may amount to a material procedural irregularity producing a miscarriage of justice and a setting aside of a conviction. Accordingly, this case does not amount to any dissent from the English cases. 

[54] It is not necessary in the present case to determine whether all the principles stated in the English cases should be adopted here; but in my opinion, the principles stated in Keane and Brown should be taken as applying in New South Wales. 

[55] I note that we were referred to an argument against a wide interpretation of the Crown's duty of disclosure to the effect that such disclosure may induce an accused to tailor a false but convenient defence. In relation to that argument, I agree with the following passage from the judgment of Sopinka J of the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Stinchcombe 68 CCCA (3d) 1, at 7-8, quoted with approval by Lord Hutton in Mills , at 403: 
'Refusal to disclose is also justified on the ground that the material will be used to enable the defence to tailor its evidence to conform with information in the Crown's possession. For example, a witness may change his or her testimony to conform with a previous statement given to the police or counsel for the Crown. I am not impressed with this submission. All forms of discovery are subject to this criticism. There is surely nothing wrong in a witness refreshing his or her memory from a previous statement or document. The witness may even change his or her evidence as a result. This may rob the cross-examiner of a substantial advantage but fairness to the witness may require that a trap not be laid by allowing the witness to testify without the benefit of seeing contradictory writings which the prosecutor holds close to the vest. The principle has been accepted that the search for truth is advanced rather than retarded by disclosure of all relevant material.' 

In my opinion, this argument does not justify a narrow approach to the duty of disclosure."" 

As is apparent, the first paragraph of the Disclosure Guidelines is modelled on R v Keane [1994] 2 All ER 478; [1994] 1 WLR 746. 

78Neither Barr nor Simpson JJ, who sat with Hodgson JA in Reardon (No 2), expressly agreed with his Honour's proposal (at [54]) that ""the principles stated in Keane and Brown should be taken as applying in New South Wales"". Simpson J (with whom Grove and Shaw JJ agreed) subsequently approved his Honour's statement as correctly encapsulating, for NSW, the prosecution's duty of disclosure: R v Spiteri [2004] NSWCCA 321; (2004) 61 NSWLR 369 (at [20]). 

79Hodgson JA's statement of the relevant principles concerning the Crown's duty of disclosure was also approved in Cornwell v R [2010] NSWCCA 59 (at [210]) (per McClellan CJ at CL, Johnson J agreeing). Simpson J also referred (at [297]) with approval to his Honour's statement, then added: 

""298 A prosecuting authority will be expected voluntarily to disclose material in its possession that, 'on a sensible appraisal', can be seen to come within any of the three identified categories; it will be expected to produce, on request by an accused, or subpoena issued by the court, such material, if a legitimate forensic purpose' for requiring its production is demonstrated: Saleam v R (1989) 16 NSWLR 14. It is hardly necessary to say that if, 'on a sensible appraisal', material the subject of request or subpoena, not previously recognised as coming within any of the three categories, can be seen to do so, a 'legitimate forensic purpose' will have been demonstrated."" 

80Failure by the prosecution (which includes the police) to disclose all relevant evidence to an accused may, in some circumstances, require the quashing of a verdict of guilty: Grey v R [2001] HCA 65; (2001) 75 ALJR 1708; Mallard v R (at [17]) per Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ. This is because a breach by the prosecutor of the duty to act fairly, with due regard to the interests of the accused, might amount to a material procedural irregularity in the trial producing a miscarriage of justice: Cannon v Tahche [2002] VSCA 84; (2002) 5 VR 317 (at [58]) per Winneke P, Charles and Chernov JJA. There is nothing, in my view, in either the DPP Act or the Disclosure Guidelines which would render inapplicable the common law principles concerning prosecutorial disclosure: cf Mallard v R (at [63]) per Kirby J. 

81The obligation to disclose includes, in an appropriate case, an obligation to make enquiries: AJ v R [2011] VSCA 215 (at [22]) per Weinberg and Bongiorno JJA (Buchanan JA agreeing). 

82As the Disclosure Guidelines make clear, the obligation to disclose is a continuing one. It clearly encompasses disclosing material relevant to sentencing proceedings. 

The duty of disclosure and public interest immunity 

83Much time was spent in argument on the question whether the primary judge's orders impermissibly impinged upon what was said to be, in effect, the conventional practice for dealing with public interest immunity claims. 

84Public interest immunity is a doctrine of substantive law. It represents a fundamental immunity. It allows for the withholding of documents in a variety of circumstances where disclosure of the documents would harm the public interest. The balancing process applied in determining whether a claim for public interest immunity should be upheld requires that the public interest in confidentiality must be weighed against the public interest in disclosure: Whealy J in R v Baladjam (No 31 ) [2008] NSWSC 1453 (at [29]) applying Jacobsen v Rogers [1995] HCA 6; (1995) 182 CLR 572 (at 588 - 589). Section 130 of the Evidence Act invokes the same two stage process of analysis as the common law: State of New South Wales v Public Transport Ticketing (at [42] - [43]) per Allsop P (Hodgson JA and Sackville AJA agreeing). 

85Public interest immunity is not a privilege, which may be waived by the Crown or by any party: Air Canada v Secretary of State for Trade (No 2) [1983] 2 AC 394 (at 436) per Lord Fraser; Cross on Evidence , LexisNexis, (at [27005]). A judge (or any litigant or witness) may raise the question whether a claim for public interest immunity should be made in relation to documents even if no objection on that basis is taken: Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43; (1978) 142 CLR 1 (at 44) per Gibbs ACJ; (at 58 - 59) per Stephen J. 

86However there is a substantial body of law which supports the proposition that where the prosecution is aware of material which would, or would possibly, be relevant to an accused's defence but is subject to a claim of public interest immunity, that fact should be disclosed to the accused. 

87In R v Ward [1993] 2 All ER 577; [1993] 1 WLR 619, to which Hodgson JA referred in Reardon (No 2) (at [47]), the Court of Appeal (Glidewell, Nolan and Steyn LJJ) held (at 632) that the prosecution's duty at common law to disclose to the defence all relevant material required the police to disclose to the prosecution all witness statements and the prosecution to supply copies of such witness statements to the defence or to allow them to inspect the statements and make copies unless there were good reasons for not doing so. It also held that if the prosecution in a criminal case wished to claim public interest immunity for documents which would be helpful to the defence they were obliged to give notice thereof to the defence so that if necessary the court could be asked to rule on the matter. The Court accepted that it would be incompatible with a defendant's absolute right to a fair trial to allow the prosecution, who occupy an adversarial position in criminal proceedings, to be judge in their own cause on the asserted claim to immunity. Their Honours said (at 633): 

""Policy considerations therefore powerfully reinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence. If, in a wholly exceptional case, the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court, the result must inevitably be that the prosecution will have to be abandoned."" 

88Their Honours also held (at 633) that nothing in the Attorney General's guidelines for the disclosure of ""unused"" material to the defence in cases to be heard on indictment (see Practice Note (criminal evidence: unused material) [1982] 1 All ER 734) ""could derogate in any way from the[se] legal rules"". 

89In R v Davis [1993] 2 All ER 643; [1993] WLR 613, to which Hodgson JA referred in Reardon (No 2) (at [47]), the Court of Appeal (as Hodgson JA said), upheld and elaborated on R v Ward . In particular, the Court of Appeal (Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ, Owen and Curtis JJ) said (at 648): 
""The effect of R v Ward is to give the court the role of monitoring the views of the prosecution as to what material should or should not be disclosed and it is for the court to decide. Thus, the procedure described as unsatisfactory in R v Ward , of the prosecution being judge in their own cause, has been superseded by requiring the application to the court. This clearly gives greater protection to the defence than existed hitherto - indeed as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue. Although ideally one would wish the defence to have notice of all such applications, and to have sufficient information to make at least some representations, we recognise that, in a small minority of cases, the public interest prevents that being possible."" 

90In R v Keane , to which Hodgson JA referred in Reardon (No 2) (at [48]), in addition to the matters his Honour noted, the Court of Appeal (Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ, Auld and Mitchell JJ) emphasised (at 483) that ""ex parte applications are contrary to the general principle of open justice in criminal trials"" and should not be adopted, save on the application of the Crown and only for the specific purpose of enabling the court to discharge its function in testing a claim that public interest immunity or sensitivity justifies non-disclosure of material in the possession of the Crown. 

91As Hodgson JA pointed out ( Reardon (No 2) (at [52])) the few Australian cases that have commented on the English cases have not suggested they are not applicable in Australia. Of those cases, Easterday v R [2003] WASCA 69; (2003) 143 A Crim R 154 (at [194] ff, [390]), in particular, contains an extensive discussion by Steytler J (with whom Scott and Roberts-Smith JJ agreed) of the Crown's obligation of disclosure in the context of ensuring the right of an accused to a fair trial and the consequences of non-disclosure by the Crown. 

92In R v Solomon [2005] SASC 265; (2005) 92 SASR 331 the accused complained on appeal, following his conviction by a jury of five counts of taking part in the sale of cocaine contrary to s 32(1)(d) of the Controlled Substances Act 1984 (SA), that incomplete disclosure by the prosecution led to a situation in which it came out before the jury that there was additional surveillance material about him and also led to his counsel asking questions in cross-examination of a police officer, which it was suggested, would not have been asked had complete disclosure been made. 

93It emerged that the prosecutor had not been told by the police officers responsible for the investigation of the offences of the full extent of the surveillance of the accused and of others with whom he had contact. The consequence was that although a request was made to the Director for disclosure of all surveillance material, complete disclosure had not been made. Production of the material relevant to these issues had been sought by subpoena and again a claim of public interest immunity had been upheld: R v Solomon (at [104], [106], [111]). 

94Doyle CJ (with whom Duggan and Sulan JJ agreed) said, in a passage not essential to his reasons: 

""112 It is not clear that the police breached their duty of disclosure. But I would have thought that, without undermining the claim of public interest immunity, a means could and should have been found of informing the defence that the question should not have been asked."" 

95His Honour concluded (at [115]) that there was no risk of a miscarriage of justice having arisen from what occurred, but added: 

""116 What happened in this case illustrates the importance of the police complying with their duty to ensure that the Director of Public Prosecutions is in a position to make appropriate disclosure to the legal representatives of the accused . It is not appropriate for the investigating officers, or their superiors, to make a decision that potentially relevant and disclosable material will not be disclosed, because there are or may be grounds for resisting that disclosure. That is a decision that should be made by the Director . If the Director makes that decision, the Director can then consider whether anything, and if so what, should be done to inform the legal representatives of the accused that there is material that is being withheld. What happened in this case illustrates the dangers associated with a failure by the police to provide the Director with all the information which should be provided. Almost at the end of the case counsel asked questions, based on the assumption of full disclosure, that could have led to answers causing a miscarriage of justice, and the need for the whole case to be heard again. The interests of justice, and the public interest in the efficient disposition of cases before the court, combine to require careful attention by the police to their duty to inform the Director adequately of all material that might have to be disclosed, leaving it to the Director to decide whether there are good grounds for withholding any material, and what should be done in that event ."" (Emphasis added) 

96In 2005 the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1991 (SA) was amended to insert s 10A, subsection (a) of which is in substantially the same terms as s 15A of the DPP Act. Section 10A(3), however, expressly provides that the duty of disclosure under s 10A(1) ""extends to material that would be exempt from production in court because it is protected by privilege or for any other reason"". The amendment followed a long process of criminal-justice process reform explained in the second reading speech to the Statutes Amendment (Criminal Procedure) Act Bill which effected the amendment: South Australia House of Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 20 September 2005 (at 3465 ff). It is unnecessary to recount that history. In short, the amendment was effected independently of Doyle CJ's reasons in R v Solomon . 

97The practice Doyle CJ recommended in R v Solomon appears to have been adopted in South Australia: see R v Andrews [2010] SASCFC 5; (2010) 107 SASR 471 per Gray J (with whom Vanstone J agreed). In that case, Gray J referred with approval (at [19]), inter alia, to R v Reardon (No 2) , R v Spiteri and Easterday v R as explaining the ambit of the prosecutor's duty of disclosure at common law. His Honour discussed the South Australian practice as follows: 

""[21] Where a claim of public interest immunity is asserted in relation to evidential material in the possession of the prosecution which falls prima facie to be disclosed, it is, the court was informed, the practice in this State for the Director of Public Prosecutions and not the police to determine whether such claim should be asserted. Upon the Director determining it to be appropriate to assert a claim of public interest immunity, it remains the duty of the court, not the privilege of the Executive, to determine whether evidential material should be produced or may be withheld in the public interest. 
[22] Where the Director does claim public interest immunity in relation to evidential material which would otherwise fall to be disclosed as a consequence of the prosecutor's duty, the court was informed that the practice in this State is for the Director to advise the defence of the existence of the material and its general nature without compromising confidentiality, and of the asserted right to withhold the material. If issue is taken, the matter may be the subject of determination by a court upon the return of a subpoena or other application. 

[23] Where a claim of public interest immunity is contested, the basis upon which the claim is made is usually supported by affidavit evidence setting out the grounds for the claim. The affidavit will not be disclosed if to do so will undermine the claim. Generally so much of it is disclosed as can be revealed without compromising the claim."" 

98The submissions made on behalf of the DPP/Attorney General that the stay order of the primary judge has the effect of forcing the DPP to usurp the role of the court in determining public interest immunity claims finds some support in Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) v County Court of Victoria . In that case, the accused sought a stay of proceedings on the basis that the DPP did not propose to call a witness, ""Carlo"" (presumably a pseudonym), at the trial. It is apparent that the stay was granted at a pre-trial stage. The Prosecutor conceded that ""Carlo"" was a relevant witness who would be called by the Crown in the ordinary course of events and conceded that not to call him may result in a degree of unfairness to the defendant. The Prosecutor had said that ""Carlo"" was not to be called. The Police would not disclose his name, status (undercover policeman or informer); nor had any proof of his evidence been provided to the Prosecutor. The Police had informed the DPP that the witness's identity would not be revealed as to do so would subject him to danger. 

99The trial judge concluded (at 274) that it would be ""manifestly unjust to allow the trial to proceed in a way in which it is proposed by the prosecutor"" remarking that ""[i]n this State, the conduct of criminal trials in a fair and proper manner is a responsibility of the DPP [whose] ... duty ... is to ensure that this takes place"". The trial judge granted a stay until a further order. He contemplated (at 273) that the order would be lifted if, and when, the DPP ensured that all relevant evidence was placed before the Court, or ""any necessary application"" was made to the Court to dispense with such a requirement. 

100The DPP sought an order in the nature of mandamus directing the County Court to continue the trial. Ashley J considered (at 278 ff) the ambit of the duty of the Crown to call all available witnesses. He observed that the authorities showed that the duty of a prosecutor to call relevant evidence was ""one in respect of which he, and no-one else, must make any necessary decision"", subject to trial or appellate remedial action. However he concluded (at 278 - 279) that: 

""...this is no warrant for saying that a prosecutor must - at the risk of a trial being, in substance, permanently stayed - obtain the name of and/or a statement from a possible witness; at least if the possible witness is a person whose identity is unknown to the prosecutor, and in respect of whose identity and whose statement (if any) a claim to public interest immunity - by reason of the person being either an undercover police officer or a police informer - has to the knowledge of the Prosecutor been foreshadowed...As a corollary, there is no warrant for saying that a prosecutor must seek information in connection with a foreshadowed claim to public interest immunity, and, if and when the information is provided, informally adjudicate upon the same before deciding what witnesses are to be called - failing which procedure the trial may be stayed. Any claim to public interest immunity is made to and is adjudicated upon by the court. 

It may be agreed that a prosecutor, confronted with a foreshadowed claim for public interest immunity, should consider whether evidence is available - absent evidence to which the likely claim relates - which gives reasonable prospect of a conviction being secured; evidence which may be led compatibly with the prosecutor's duty of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused . Such consideration might lead to a decision not to continue with the prosecution. But it does not involve either an attempt to ascertain the likely content of evidence the subject of a foreshadowed claim to public interest immunity; or obtaining information pertinent to and informally adjudicated upon the merits of such a claim. The distinction between the prosecutor, on the one hand, and the person or authority which possesses information concerning an undercover policeman or police informer is a real one. The cases dealing with the consequences of a prosecutor not calling a witness have characteristically dealt with 'available' witnesses. Contrast the situation in (eg) Meissner where Carruthers J said (at 89) that the trial judge had 'appropriately observed that this was not a case where the Crown refused to call those persons but one in which the Crown was unable to call them'. The distinction is the more evident when it is considered that, most often, a claim to public interest immunity is made, not by the prosecutor, but by a third party - characteristically the Chief Commissioner of Police - in response to a subpoena whose purpose is to secure disclosure of the identity or statement or notes of an undercover police officer or police informer."" (Emphasis added) 

101His Honour also concluded (at 279) that ""there is no support at all for the proposition that a prosecutor has at common law any duty or power to see that a claim to public interest immunity is ventilated before the court"". His Honour could not understand by what mechanism it was said that the Director or the prosecutor could place such a claim before the court, it being ""characteristic of such claims that they are raised not by the Crown, but by a third party, most often represented, in answer to some step taken by the accused person."" His Honour concluded, accordingly, that the stay should not have been granted. He did contemplate (at 281), however, that the issue of public interest immunity would nevertheless arise in the course of the trial and be considered by the trial judge. 

102It does not appear that Ashley J was referred to the English authorities considered in R v Reardon (No 2) . In my view Ashley J's reasons are inconsistent with the weight of authority to which I have referred concerning the duty of the police and prosecution to ensure a fair trial. 

Conclusion 

103The meaning of s 15A of the DPP Act is to be determined by reference to its context in the DPP Act as a whole, the existing state of the law when it was enacted and the mischief to which it was addressed: AB v State of Western Australia; AH v State of Western Australia [2011] HCA 42; (2011) 281 ALR 694 (at [10]) per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ. 

104In my view s 15A of the DPP Act obliged the Police to disclose, in the sense of produce, to the DPP the material concerning Ms Brown. This is apparent from the language of s 15A and contextual material. 
105First, the ordinary meaning of the word ""disclose"" is to ""to cause to appear; allow to be seen; make known; reveal: to disclose a plot"" and ""to uncover; lay open to view"": Macquarie Dictionary Online . It is apparent from the s 15A obligation to disclose to the Director ""all relevant information etc...that might reasonably be expected to assist the case for the prosecution or the case for the accused person"", that the actual information which can be so described is to be provided so the prosecution may sensibly appraise whether such information should be disclosed to the accused. 

106Section 7 of the DPP Act confirms the primary role the DPP plays in conducting prosecutions for indictable offences: see also Libke v The Queen (above at [76]). The DPP cannot effectively discharge that role unless he has actual access to all information relevant to an issue in the case. Section 15A was, in my view, enacted to facilitate his discharge of his role. Mere advice that the police hold relevant information without the DPP knowing what that information is undermines his ability to discharge his duty to act fairly, inter alia, towards the accused. As much is apparent from Mr Allison's affidavit which demonstrated that the DPP's ability to discharge his statutory duty was substantially constrained by the police refusal to provide to him ""relevant sensitive information"", referred to in the Police Disclosure Certificate. 

107Secondly, s 15A is couched in the language conventionally used to describe the prosecution's duty of disclosure to an accused. As is apparent from the foregoing discussion, subject to any public interest immunity, that duty obliges the prosecution to make available, in the sense of disclose the contents of, all material which may prove helpful to the defence: R v Reardon (No 2) (at [46]). An anterior common law duty to disclose such material to the prosecution is imposed on the police as was explained in R v Solomon (at [116]); see also R v Ward . The second reading speech made it clear that s 15A was intended to reflect the common law obligation of police disclosure. It is unnecessary, having regard to that conclusion, to determine the scope of s 16 of the DPP Act. 

108Contrary to the DPP/Attorney General's submission, neither the terms of the pro-forma Police Disclosure Certificate (which it will be recalled was made under the 2005 Regulation) or the Disclosure Guidelines can govern the construction of the DPP Act: Wallaby Grip Ltd v QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd; Stewart v QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd [2010] HCA 9; (2010) 240 CLR 444 at [21] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ; see also Chief Commissioner of State Revenue v Hayson Group of Companies Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 233; (2006) 68 NSWLR 254 (at [36] - [38]) per Basten JA (Hodgson and Tobias JJA agreeing). 

109Further, in my view, the pro forma Police Disclosure Certificate is invalid to the extent that it departs from the language of s 15A and purports to enable the Police to withhold relevant material from the DPP. Section 37 of the DPP Act (the regulation-making power) does not authorise the making of regulations which extend the scope or general operation of, or are inconsistent with, or depart from or vary the plan which the legislature has adopted to attain its ends in the DPP Act: Shanahan v Scott [1957] HCA 4; (1957) 96 CLR 245 (at 250). Nor does s 13 of the DPP Act authorise the DPP to furnish guidelines inconsistent with the DPP Act: see generally Foster v Aloni [1951] VLR 481. 

110The Police could, if they wished when producing the material, inform the DPP that they wished to claim public interest immunity for it, but the DPP is obliged to form his own view about whether the material is relevant to an issue in the case and so advise the respondent including, where applicable, advising him of any claim of public interest immunity. The question of the indivisibility of the Crown, onto which the DPP/Attorney General claimed the primary judge's order entrenched, is irrelevant in circumstances where s 15A required the Police to disclose the actual material to the DPP. 

111I do not understand the primary judge's orders to have had the effect of forcing the DPP to act outside the confines of his statutory functions. Those functions include determining what evidence is relevant both to the Crown and the defence case and, where appropriate, whether such evidence might be subject to a claim of public interest immunity. Nothing in the primary judge's order precluded the DPP during his independent consideration, from taking the Police view on that issue into account. However he had to determine the force of any such view after inspecting the documents. Whatever view he did form was clearly not determinative. Any final decision could only be made by a court upon proper application. In any event, the vice of the DPP determining whether evidence might be subject to a claim of public interest immunity is not apparent. The DPP undertakes that task in South Australia at least: R v Andrews ; see also R v Ward ; R v Davies ; R v Solomon. 

112I return to the complaints about the primary judge's exercise of his discretion. In my view the DPP/Attorney General have not demonstrated any error in the sense referred to in House v The King which would warrant interference with his Honour's orders. 

113First, I do not accept that the primary judge made a fundamental error in inferring there was material in existence that linked Ms Brown and the Police investigation. 

114I would take into account in this respect the manner in which Gibbs CJ in Alister v R (at 414) explained the operation of the ""on the cards"" test. His Honour emphasised that ""the scales must swing in favour of discovery if the documents are necessary to support the defence of an accused person whose liberty is at stake in a criminal trial ..."". He contemplated that discovery should not be refused ""simply because there were no grounds for thinking that [a] report could assist the accused"" because to do so would leave the latter with ""a legitimate sense of grievance"". I accept that Gibbs CJ's propositions were based on the premise that it would be sufficient to activate the operation of these propositions if it was ""not unreasonable to believe the documents were in existence"" and that ""one would guess that ... [they] would be adverse to the applicants"": Chidgey (at [66]) per Beazley JA. For the reasons that follow, such an inference was available in this case. 

115The notice of motion sought a stay until material relating to Ms Brown was disclosed. As I have explained, the combined effect of the tender of the pre-conference disclosure certificate and paragraph 7 of Mr Allison's affidavit was that the substance of the Police Disclosure Certificate was before the primary judge. It was a reasonable inference from those materials and the terms of the pro-forma Disclosure Certificate that the police accepted the ""relevant sensitive material ..."" to which Mr Allison referred ""might reasonably be expected to assist in the case for the prosecution or the case for the accused person"". That demonstrated sufficiently in my view that it was ""on the cards"" (assuming that test to be applicable for the purposes of the respondent's notice of motion) that the Police hold information relevant to Ms Brown and that it is at least ""possibly relevant"" ( R v Keane ) to an issue in the respondent's case, albeit that it might be subject to a privilege claim. 

116The factual position differs from that with which King DCJ and the Court of Criminal Appeal dealt. It will be recalled that McClellan CJ at CL was of the view (at [19]) that the ""conjunction of circumstances"" he had outlined (at [16]) ""raise[d] a suspicion that Ms Brown may have had a relationship with the investigating police"", however absent evidence from the respondent concerning Ms Brown's role formed the view that he had not ""established that it was 'on the cards' that the documents the subject of objection would assist his case"". It was not, in my view, in the different factual matrix of this case, incumbent upon the respondent to give evidence of the sort to which McClellan CJ at CL referred. Here the Court is aware that the Police have acknowledged they hold material which ""might reasonably be expected to assist in the case for the prosecution or the case for the accused person"". Prima facie (subject to any privilege claim), the respondent should have access to that material to determine its utility in the sentence proceedings. To determine otherwise would leave him with a legitimate sense of grievance: cf Alister v R (at 415 - 416). 

117Further, Mr Moustacas's letter of 22 October 2009 expressly referred to the respondent claiming he ""was enticed into dealing with a large commercial quantity of each drug ... at the instigation of Brown who was clearly acting on behalf of the police"". That letter appears to have been admitted without objection before the primary judge. It accordingly has somewhat more evidentiary weight that the mere statement in counsel's submissions in the subpoena proceedings: Lipton v R (at [16]). 

118Secondly, the respondent's complaints concerning Mr Allison's failure to enquire of the Police were sound. His omission in this respect was based on the misconception that s 15A of the DPP Act required the Police to disclose the existence of material relevant to the respondent's case, but not the material itself. Rather, as I have explained, Mr Allison should not have been put in the position of having to inquire of the Police. The Police were not entitled to withhold that information. 

119In my view the primary judge did not err in concluding that a stay was necessary to allay a potential miscarriage of justice. Mallard v R confirms that there may be a miscarriage of justice whether it is the police or the DPP who fail to disclose material relevant to an issue in criminal proceedings to the accused. The plurality was not concerned with whether the Western Australian DPP had had possession of the non-disclosed material. It was sufficient to establish a miscarriage of justice that the investigating police had had it prior to (and during) the trial and it had not been disclosed to the accused: Mallard v R (at [16]). Further, both the plurality ( Mallard v R (at [17])) and Kirby J (at [66]) referred with approval to Grey v R in which it was held (at [23]) that there was no reason why the defence in a criminal trial should be obliged to fossick for information to which it was entitled. That was, prima facie, the effect the attitude of the Police and the DPP was having in this case. 

120Finally, I would observe that the primary judge did not grant a permanent stay of the proceedings, merely one conditioned on the DPP obtaining the material referred to in the Police Disclosure Certificate, forming the views referred to in his order and communicating that advice to the respondent. It was a matter for the respondent then to determine how to proceed. It was appropriate for his Honour to grant a conditional stay in those circumstances to ensure fairness to the respondent, to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice and to avoid a potential miscarriage of justice. 

Orders 

121I would dismiss the appeal. 

122RS HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the Reasons for Judgment of McColl JA. I agree with the order proposed by her Honour, with her Honour's account of the history of the proceedings leading to the present appeal and with that part of her Honour's Reasons as follows the sub-heading ""Conclusion"". 

123Section 15A(1) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 provides, inter alia, 

""Police Officers investigating alleged indictable offences have a duty to disclose to the Director all relevant information, documents or other things obtained during the investigation..."" 

124While I can accept that it is possible to disclose a document, that is its existence, without revealing all the detail of its contents, I do not see how it is possible to disclose ""all relevant information"" without revealing the content of that information, including the content of any documents. And while it may be that from time to time there is information that the police, with perfectly proper motives, do not wish to disclose, at least in detail, to the DPP (and the DPP may wish not to see), Parliament has dictated what must occur. If the result is inconvenient, it is a matter for Parliament to change. 

125There is nothing in the remaining parts of McColl JA's reasons with which I disagree. However I have refrained from endorsing them because I regard the matters with which I have expressed agreement as sufficient to dispose of the appeal and thus have not found it necessary to repeat the very considerable amount of work her Honour must have engaged in to write those remaining parts. 

126HISLOP J: I agree with McColl JA.

2758204,Shepherd v R [2011] NSWCCA 245,"Judgment 

1THE COURT : On 26 April 2006, Glenn Kenneth Shepherd was arraigned in the Supreme Court at Dubbo on an indictment containing one count alleging that on 21 November 2003 at Cobar in the State of New South Wales he did murder Gabrielle Best (the deceased). 

2The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge. The trial commenced before Hoeben J and a jury of 12 on 26 April 2006. After a hearing lasting 10 days, on 10 May 2006 the jury found the appellant guilty as charged. On 11 August 2006 the trial judge sentenced the appellant to a total term of imprisonment of 20 years consisting of a non-parole period of 15 years commencing on 23 November 2003 and expiring on 22 November 2018, with a balance of term of five years to commence on 23 November 2018 and to expire on 22 November 2023. 

3On 2 June 2006, a notice of intention to appeal was filed on behalf of the appellant. The Registrar granted extensions to that notice which expired on various dates, the last being 9 July 2007. On 3 December 2010, a notice of application for leave to appeal was filed which contained two grounds of appeal. On 16 December 2010, a notice of application for extension of time for the filing of that notice was itself filed, supported by an affidavit of the appellant's solicitor sworn on 3 December 2010 seeking to explain the delay over a period in excess of four years in prosecuting the appeal. 

4Although the Crown drew attention to some unsatisfactory aspects of the solicitor's explanation for the delay, it did not oppose the granting of an extension of time given the grounds of appeal and the Crown's approach to those grounds. In these circumstances, the Court would grant the appellant an extension of time up to and including 3 December 2010 for the filing of his notice of application for leave to appeal. 

5The appeal is confined to conviction. No challenge is made with respect to sentence. 

The Evidence at Trial 

6The appellant expressly accepted, and the Crown did not contend to the contrary, that the background evidence was appropriately summarised by the trial judge in his remarks on sentence ( R v Shepherd [2006] NSWSC 799) in the following terms: 

""4 The offender was born on 26 April 1971 and the deceased, Gabrielle Best, was born on 2 April 1965. Both grew up in Cobar New South Wales. The offender had previously been married and as a result is the father of two girls born in 1994 and 1996. They live with their mother in Sydney. The deceased was the mother of two boys, Gerard (Jed) born 11 December 1990 and Samuel born 1996. In 1999 the deceased and the offender formed a relationship. At that time the deceased lived at 18 Harcourt Street, Cobar. The offender had his own place. After a short period of time the offender moved into 18 Harcourt Street with the deceased. In early 2001 the family relocated to Sydney where they lived at Kemps Creek. In April 2001 a son, Jean Paul, was born. In October/November 2002 the family moved to Pacific Street in Toowoon Bay on the Central Coast. The youngest child, Sebastian, was born in November 2002. 

5 Whereas the offender had been in steady employment in Cobar he found obtaining and holding steady employment in Sydney to be difficult. He worked as a subcontractor unloading shipping containers for about 18 months. He also worked as a builder's labourer for six months and sold Foxtel on a door-to-door basis for six months. Apart from some casual labouring work he appears to have been unemployed for periods while the family was living on the Central Coast. 

6 The family experienced quite serious financial problems while living on the Central Coast. This placed the relationship under strain. At one time there appears to have been a fairly violent argument where there was some pushing and shoving between the offender and the deceased. There were frequent loud arguments during 2003, usually about money matters. 

7 There was evidence of conversations between the deceased and friends who visited her at Toowoon Bay during 2003. The deceased said that the offender would not let her work. She said that during an argument when she confronted the offender about spending money she had saved for an air conditioner he responded that she would never have enough money to leave him. The deceased said that unless things improved, she would leave the offender by Christmas (2003), although there is no evidence that she ever communicated this intention to the offender. 

8 There was also evidence that apart from the financial problems, the deceased indicated that she was happy and that she and the offender had a 'zing' thing between them. 

9 The financial problems became so great that the only option was for the deceased and the offender to move back to Cobar and live in the deceased's house at 18 Harcourt Street. To do this they borrowed money from the deceased's brother, John Best. They also borrowed money to buy air conditioners for the house. The offender's brother, Scott Shepherd, helped them make the move back to Cobar. The family arrived in Cobar on Sunday, 16 November 2003. 

10 There was evidence that the deceased was very happy to be back in Cobar. After their arrival some tensions were observed between the deceased and the offender by the deceased's brother, Michael Best. There was a suggestion that the deceased and the offender were sleeping separately. Friction was observed between the offender and the deceased when the child, Samuel, found some money which had been hidden by the deceased and handed it to the offender. There was also friction over the offender dragging a cupboard across the floor in the house and damaging the floor when doing so. 

11 On Thursday, 20 November 2003 the deceased applied for a job at the RSL. The offender also made inquiries concerning a job on that day. The offender and the deceased decided to go to the Occidental Hotel in Cobar on that Thursday night. The offender went to the hotel first while the deceased put the four boys to bed. By about 9pm they were both at the hotel. 

12 The evidence concerning the behaviour of the offender and the deceased at the hotel was all one way. Both seemed to be in high spirits and told people that they were happy to be back in Cobar. There was evidence of displays of affection between them. Both were drinking beer. The offender was described by some witnesses as being very drunk. One witness said she had never seen him quite so drunk before. 

13 The deceased and the offender were last seen at 2am, after having left the hotel. They spoke to people in the street as they left the hotel and then crossed the road where they were seen standing near the RSL Club. There was some good-natured horseplay observed between the offender and the deceased."" 

7There was evidence from Mr Andre Wegner that he had heard male and female voices shouting and some banging. However, he could not say whether the voices came from the deceased's house or from a park (which was not unlikely as hotel patrons tended to leave the hotel and walk through the park). Reference to his evidence will be made in a little more detail later in these reasons. 

8The critical events of the morning of 21 November 2003 and the days following were also summarised by the trial judge in his remarks on sentence in the following terms which, again, were not in contest for the purposes of the appeal: 

""21 Just before 8am on 21 November 2003 Jed Best, then aged 12, went to the back of 18 Harcourt Street to go to the toilet. He found the deceased lying on the floor with pools of blood on the floor and blood all over her. He went inside and woke the offender who lay apparently asleep in their bed. In the house at the time were Jed's brother, Sam, then aged seven and the couple's children, Jean Paul aged two and a half and Sebastian aged one. 

22 The offender followed Jed to the back of the house and saw the deceased. Instead of responding to the boy's requests to call an ambulance or go to get Leonie (the deceased's sister who lived nearby), he told Jed to wait while he was trying to think. By this time the other children were moving around and the offender sent Jed with the children to Leonie Patterson's house at 14 Harcourt Street. 

23 Shortly afterwards Ms Patterson came to 18 Harcourt Street and entered the front door. The offender appeared and she demanded to see the deceased asking him where she was and what he had done to her. She asked whether there was a need for an ambulance to which the offender responded by shrugging and holding out his hands. He told her to go home to the children and ring the police. The offender turned and walked down the hallway. As he did so Ms Patterson noticed the handle of a knife sticking out the back of his shorts. 

24 Ms Patterson contacted the police. The police arrived followed by two ambulances at about 8.20am. Ambulance officers confirmed that the deceased was dead. 

25 As the police arrived, the offender left the house and climbed the back fence. He ran barefooted through the yard of a nearby house and through a quarry area at the rear of a council depot. He hid for a day in an old open-cut mine. He cut his wrists and neck with a knife which was subsequently found there. 

26 At 5am on Saturday, 22 November 2003 the offender walked to 5 Mitchell Street and entered an empty, unfurnished house where he stayed until 10.20am on Sunday, 23 November. In that house he made a hole in the ceiling and attached a rope with a noose through the hole and the manhole. He wrote a note on a notepad which said 'I have done the worst thing ever'. 

27 At 10.25am on Sunday, 23 November he arrived at his mother's house in Elizabeth Crescent just around the corner from Mitchell Street. His mother Pauline and his brother Scott were present. There was some conversation. His mother asked him where he had been and he said 'hiding'. The offender asked if the deceased was dead and told them that he could not even remember leaving the Occidental Hotel. He told his mother and his brother that he and the deceased had been getting on well and he could not recall any argument. The police were called and he was arrested. 

28 Scott Shepherd heard the accused say in relation to his children ' How can they love me I killed their mother' . This was included in his first statement. In a subsequent statement he amended this to ' How can they love me if I've killed their mother' . Scott Shepherd's evidence at trial was in accordance with the second statement. He was cross-examined by the Crown pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act on this issue. Having seen and heard him give that evidence I find that what the offender told Scott Shepherd was that which was recorded in the first statement. 

29 The offender did not give evidence at trial or in the sentence proceedings. At trial he relied upon his ERISP which was conducted by the police on 23 November. The offender said he could not remember leaving the hotel and said that he had had a lot to drink. The offender told the police in the ERISP and in a video taped walk-through at 18 Harcourt Street, that he could not believe it when he saw the deceased in the laundry and was trying to think what had happened. He said that he grabbed a knife from the drawer in the kitchen and then spoke to Leonie Patterson at the front door. He looked back in the laundry and freaked out and ran from the scene carrying the knife with the intention of killing himself. He hid at the open-cut mine where within the first few minutes he inflicted some minor cuts with the knife on his neck and wrist. At the house he made a noose as a last option. 

30 When asked in the ERISP if he had killed Gabrielle Best he said: 'No I did not'. However, in earlier answers he said that he tried to take his own life because he was scared seeing what was in the laundry and not remembering. He said he had no idea who killed her. When asked whether he had struck her, his reply was: 'Not that I remember, no.' When asked if he killed her he said: 'Not as far as I remember'. When asked about why he had harmed himself he said it was because of the bad thing that had happened and because he didn't know. He said 'What if it was me?'. One specific answer given by the offender in the ERISP (Q.245) was: 

'A. Just waking up, not being able to remember what had happened and going out the back and seeing Gabrielle like she was, to drink and black out, it's a pretty awful feeling to wake up with and for that.' 

... 

32 While in gaol, the offender sent a card to his mother which contained a poem which he had written and which he wished to be read by his children. Included in the poem was the line 'One big night out, what a terrible cost.' 

33 The deceased was found to have a blood alcohol reading of .14. The evidence suggests that the deceased had less to drink than the offender and that she was less affected by alcohol than he was when they left the hotel. I am satisfied that the offender was well affected by alcohol at the time when the offence occurred and that his level of affectation was significantly higher than that of the deceased. That is not only consistent with his fragmentary recollection of the night, but also with observations made of him at the hotel before he left and shortly after he left the hotel.""

The Events Giving Rise to the Appeal 

9The events giving rise to the appeal are sourced in that part of [28] of the trial judge's summary of the events of the morning of 21 November 2003 which has been emphasised (at [8] above). Scott Shepherd was the brother of the appellant. On 24 November 2003, two days after the murder, Scott Shepherd signed a police statement which set out the terms of a conversation he had had with the appellant the previous day. Paragraph 8 of that statement contained the following: 

""While we were sitting at the table, Glenn asked about his kids and I told him, 'They're your kids. They love you.' Glenn said, 'How could they love me? I killed their mother.'"" 

10Reference to this statement attributed to the appellant is referred to in this judgment as ""the first representation"" . 

11In a subsequent police statement made on 23 June 2005 Scott Shepherd stated the following in paragraph 5: 

""In relation to my statement I would like to make the following alteration. In paragraph 8 on page 2 I discussed a conversation that took place between Glenn, my mother and myself. During this conversation I indicated that Glenn made the comment, 'How could they love me? I killed their mother.' This was a mistake and Glenn actually said, 'How could they love me if I've killed their mother'."" 

12Scott Shepherd gave evidence in committal proceedings which took place on 9 November 2004 and in a previous aborted trial of the appellant before Barr J on 8 July 2005 in terms consistent with the version in his statement of 23 June 2005 and in which he denied that the version contained in his statement of 24 November 2003 was a correct account of the conversation he had had with the appellant. 

13In opening to the jury in the present trial, the Crown made specific reference to the terms of both versions given by Scott Shepherd of his conversation with the appellant on 23 November 2003. Nothing was said that indicated whether the evidence being referred to was not, or could not, be used as an admission. 

14There was an earlier trial of the appellant before Barr J and a jury in July 2005. For reasons which are not presently relevant, the jury was discharged before verdict. It appears that, on the application of the Crown, Barr J granted leave under s.38 of the Evidence Act 1995 for the Crown to cross-examine Scott Shepherd in view of his changed account of the words said to have been uttered by the appellant on 23 November 2003. 

15The Crown made a similar application to Hoeben J on 1 May 2006. Although reference was made to the fact that Barr J had granted leave under s.38 at the earlier trial, it does not appear that any judgment of his Honour on this point was placed before Hoeben J. Nor was any such judgment provided to this Court. Thus we do not know whether any reference was made before Barr J to the decision of the High Court in Lee v The Queen [1998] HCA 60; 195 CLR 94. That decision was not mentioned before Hoeben J. Short submissions were made by the Crown and by trial counsel for the appellant which referred to ss.38 and 192 of the Act without any real elaboration. Defence counsel informed his Honour that he formally opposed the s.38 application and invited his Honour to have regard to s.192 considerations. 

16It should be observed that the same very experienced criminal trial counsel (now senior counsel) represented the appellant at the trials before Barr J and Hoeben J. Different senior counsel has appeared for the appellant before this Court. 

17No application was made at the trial for the exclusion of the evidence of the first representation. Nor was any application made that this evidence should not be treated as evidence of the truth of the fact asserted, or that it be subject to a limited use order under s.136 of the Act. 

18In an interlocutory judgment of 1 May 2006, the trial judge granted leave to the Crown to cross-examine Scott Shepherd pursuant to s.38 of the Act . In [12] of his reasons, his Honour observed that the evidence of the first representation was important as on one view it constituted an admission and that the Crown was entitled to test the apparent change in Scott Shepherd's evidence given his relationship to the appellant. Accordingly, he granted leave to the Crown to cross examine Scott Shepherd on his prior inconsistent statement of 24 November 2003 which contained what was accepted by both parties as an admission of guilt. 

19It is unnecessary to examine the details of Scott Shepherd's cross- examination with respect to the first representation or to recite the evidence of the police officer who had prepared Scott Shepherd's statement of 24 November 2003 containing that representation. What is presently relevant is that in final address to the jury the Crown explicitly and repeatedly relied on the first representation as an admission of guilt by the appellant to his brother. 

20At [131] of his summing up, the trial judge informed the jury that the Crown had identified eight circumstances which it said constituted admissions by the appellant of conduct which indicated a consciousness of guilt that he was the person who brought about the death of the deceased. The first of those eight matters was the admission by the appellant to his brother on 23 November 2003. At [132], his Honour referred to the submission of the Crown that that admission, together with a notebook entry in which the appellant is recorded as having said "" I have done the worst thing ever "", constituted clear, unequivocal admissions of guilt by the appellant that he in fact was the person who brought about her death. 

21In final address, trial counsel for the appellant sought to deal with the first representation by suggesting that if the words attributed to the appellant had been used, then they were not a genuine admission of guilt but rather indicative of a temporary acceptance by the appellant that he might have killed the deceased. Nevertheless it was acknowledged by the Crown on the hearing of the present appeal that a substantial part of the Crown's final address to the jury was based on the first representation being a clear and unequivocal admission of guilt, as was the appellant's handwritten note. 
 
The Grounds of Appeal 

22The following two grounds of appeal were relied upon by the appellant: 

""1. The learned trial Judge erred in granting leave to the Crown to cross-examine the witness, Scott Shepherd, in order to adduce evidence of the prior representation of Scott Shepherd that the appellant made a representation to him in the terms 'How can they love me, I killed their mother'. 

2. In the alternative to ground 1, the learned trial Judge erred in permitting the Crown to adduce evidence of the prior representation of Scott Shepherd that the appellant made a representation to him in the terms 'How can they love me, I killed their mother', as evidence of the truth of the statement."" 

Application of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 

23Submissions were made to this Court for the appellant that Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 has no application to the present appeal. Rule 4 provides: 

"" 4 Exclusion of certain matters as grounds for appeal etc 

No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal."" 


24The Crown in its written submissions on the appeal contended that as the bases for the objection at trial to the application of the Crown to cross examine Mr Shepherd pursuant to s.38 did not include the basis now relied upon in the appeal, namely, that the evidence could not be admitted having regard to s.60 and the decision of the High Court in Lee , it accordingly followed that Rule 4 applied and that the leave of the Court was required for the appellant to argue Ground of Appeal 2: Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60; 160 A Crim R 195 at 209-210 [78]. 

25On the other hand, the appellant submitted that Rule 4 has no application to the present case as the decision to grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine Mr Shepherd was a decision not as to the admissibility of evidence but as to how evidence could be adduced to which Rule 4 has no application. 

26In our view, the breadth of Rule 4 is such that the appellant requires the leave of the Court to rely upon Ground of Appeal 2: Vickers at 208-210 [66]-[78]; Klein v R [2007] NSWCCA 206; 172 A Crim R 290 at 298 [27], 301 [45]-[46]. The draftsperson of the grounds of appeal identified, in the first ground, a challenge to the trial judge's decision to grant leave to the Crown under s.38 to cross-examine Scott Shepherd. Rule 4 does not apply to that ground. 

27However, the Ground of Appeal 2 is based upon a separate premise, including alleged error in permitting the Crown to adduce evidence of the first representation as evidence of the truth of the statement. Objection was not taken at trial to the admission of this evidence; nor was any direction sought confining the use of the evidence. In our view, the appellant requires leave under Rule 4 to rely upon this ground of appeal. 

28In the circumstances of the present appeal, the Crown does not advance any substantial argument against the grant of leave under Rule 4. However, it remains a matter for the Court as to whether leave ought be granted. 

29The question whether error in the trial process is demonstrated must be considered in the light of the fact that no application was made to the trial judge (in the form of submissions made to the Court), giving rise to an erroneous decision by his Honour in the course of the trial. What is submitted here is that the Crown Prosecutor, experienced trial defence counsel and the trial judge did not advert to the particular issue now agitated before this Court. 

30This Court has held that s.137 of the Act does not impose an obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence to which no objection has been taken at trial by defence counsel: R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645 at 652 [28]-[30]. We consider that this Court should be careful in the assessment of submissions made by reference to provisions of the Act which are said to apply, when no argument to that effect was made to the trial Judge (in particular by experienced counsel). 

31It is therefore for the appellant to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has resulted in order to justify this Court granting leave under Rule 4 to permit Ground of Appeal 2 to be advanced: R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 at 352-353 [20]-[24]. 

Whether the First Representation was Wrongly Treated as Evidence of the Truth of the Fact it Asserted 

32As we have indicated, the first representation was admitted into evidence by the trial judge pursuant to a grant of leave to the Crown, over the objection of the appellant, to cross examine Mr Shepherd on the first representation pursuant to s.38 of the Act. That representation, as recorded in Mr Shepherd's police statement of 24 November 2003, was an out of court representation by him that the appellant had made an out of court representation to him. As such the first representation was hearsay evidence. This evidence was governed by s.59 of the Act which was in the following terms: 

""(1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation. 

(2) Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an asserted fact. 

(3) Subsection (1) does not apply to evidence of a representation contained in a certificate or other document given or made under regulations made under an Act other than this Act to the extent to which the regulations provide that the certificate or other document has evidentiary effect."" 

33Section 60 provides an exception to s.59 which, at the time of trial, was in the following terms: 

""The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation."" 

34The Crown conceded that there was a difficulty in the present case in that although s.60 applied as an exception to the hearsay rule for the purpose of the Crown's cross- examination of Mr Shepherd with respect to his credit, it was not admissible to prove that the representation was true and thus was an admission by the appellant that he had killed the deceased. That concession was contained in the following paragraphs of the Crown written submissions on the appeal: 

""28 The previous representation by Scott Shepherd (viz. that the Applicant had said to him, 'How can they love me, I killed their mother') could not be relied on by the Crown to prove the truth of the admission by the Applicant, viz. that he had killed the Deceased. 

29 The Crown could not rely upon the previous representation as evidence of the truth of the confession allegedly made to him by the Applicant because sections 59 and 60(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) do not (and did not at the time of the trial) operate to permit the previous representation to be lead as evidence of the truth of the admission allegedly made to him by the Applicant. Rather, the evidence of the previous representation was only admissible as a prior inconsistent statement of the witness (Scott Shepherd) and was relevant only to the credibility of that witness: Lee v The Queen [1998] HCA 60; (1998) 195 CLR 594 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow J, Kirby J, Hayne J and Callinan J at [17]-[31], [40]-[41]; Regina v Vickers [2006] NSWCCA 60; (2006) 160 A Crim R 195 per Simpson J at [59]-[63] with whom James J and Hall J [agreed]."" 

35The appellant submitted that the present case was on all fours with the decision in Lee . Relevantly, in that case the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said at 601-602 [28]-[30]: 

""28 The nature of what Mr Calin said in his statements to the police was such that evidence of those statements was evidence both of representations made by Mr Calin to the police (about what Mr Calin had seen and heard) and of representations made to Mr Calin by the appellant (about what the appellant had done). By virtue of s 59, the evidence was not admissible to prove the existence either of the facts which Mr Calin intended to assert to the police or of the facts which the appellant intended to assert to Mr Calin. Section 60 operated only upon the former representations; it had nothing to say to the representations made by the appellant to Mr Calin. It was only the representations made by Mr Calin to the police that were relevant for a purpose referred to in s 60: the purpose being to prove that Mr Calin had made a prior inconsistent statement and that his credibility was thus affected. The hearsay rule was rendered inapplicable to Mr Calin's representations, but not to the representations allegedly made by the appellant. And, of course, the representations allegedly made by the appellant were not admissible under the confession exceptions to the hearsay rule created by s 81 because the evidence of these confessional statements was not first hand. 

29 To put the matter another way, s 60 does not convert evidence of what was said, out of court, into evidence of some fact that the person speaking out of court did not intend to assert. And yet that is what was done here. Evidence by a police officer that Mr Calin had said, out of court, that the appellant had said that he had done a job was treated as evidence that the appellant in fact had done a job - a fact which Mr Calin had never intended to assert. (Of course, it would be different if Mr Calin had said in evidence in court that the appellant had said he had done a job. Then the representation made out of court would be the appellant's, not Mr Calin's.) 

30 It follows that evidence that Mr Calin had earlier reported that the appellant had confessed was not evidence of the truth of that confession. It should not have been received at the trial of the appellant, as it was, as evidence establishing that the appellant had committed the offence."" 

36The hearing of the present appeal proceeded upon the basis of a Crown concession that error of the type in Lee had been demonstrated, with the focus of attention moving to the application of the proviso. We will proceed to determine the appeal upon that basis. 

37However, the impact of Lee must be considered in the context of the facts of this case. The factual scenarios of different cases may lead to different outcomes: R v AA and Ors (No.1) [2009] NSWSC 1414 at [14]-[21]. 

38Here, Scott Shepherd admitted he had made and signed a statement to police. That statement contained the first representation. By the time he came to give evidence at the trials before Barr J and then Hoeben J, Scott Shepherd had made a minor but significant amendment to the first representation by the insertion of the word ""if"" . He gave evidence before Hoeben J and the jury that the appellant had spoken to him and had made the critical statement, with the insertion of the word ""if"" . 

39A possible issue for the jury was whether the appellant spoke the first version (an unequivocal confession) or the slightly different second version (a more equivocal but still damaging statement). This was not a case where the first version was an admission but the second version was incapable of being an admission. Certainly, the first version was a stronger and more damaging admission than the second, but the second version was capable of being adverse to his interest in the outcome of the proceeding: see definition of ""admission"" in the Dictionary to the Act. 

40Further, here there is an earlier admission made by the appellant (the suicide note), which was relevant to an assessment of what he had said later to his brother. It may be that the first representation was admissible, at least to an assessment by the jury of the consistency (or otherwise) of the appellant's repeated claim in his ERISP that he could not recall what had happened on the evening in question (a non-hearsay purpose). 

41However, none of these matters were argued either before Hoeben J, or this Court. The hearing before us proceeded upon the basis of acceptance by the Crown that error had been demonstrated in accordance with Ground of Appeal 2. 

42The first representation was admitted into evidence and was relied upon by the Crown as an admission by the appellant that he had killed the deceased. Furthermore, it was accepted by the trial judge in his summing up as capable of constituting such an admission, such a direction being accepted by the Crown as being contrary to Lee at 604 [41]. Accordingly, the first representation was tendered to the jury by the Crown as an admission or confession of guilt by the appellant and was treated as capable of constituting such a confession or admission by the trial judge in his summing up. 

43In these circumstances, the Court should proceed upon the basis that error occurred at trial, albeit in circumstances where the trial judge was not called upon to make a ruling concerning the issues ventilated in this Court. The appellant should have leave under Rule 4 to rely upon Ground of Appeal 2. The Crown conceded that this ground had been made out, so that the Court should turn now to the question of the proviso. 

The Proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 

44Relevantly, s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides as follows: 

""The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion ... that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice ... provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred ."" (Emphasis added) 

45The Crown has conceded that Scott Shepherd's evidence of an admission by the appellant that he killed the deceased was wrongly admitted and that, given the emphasis that was placed upon the admission by the Crown in final address and not dispelled by the primary judge in his summing up, there was not only a wrong decision on a question of law, being the use to which the first representation could legitimately be put, but also as a consequence there was a miscarriage of justice which, prima facie, justified the allowance of the appeal. However, the Crown submitted that, putting to one side the admission contained in the first representation, the Court should dismiss the appeal upon the ground that the Crown's direct and circumstantial case was so strong that no substantial miscarriage has actually occurred. 

46The application of the proviso was authoritatively discussed by the High Court in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 particularly at 314 [35]-[36] and 315 - 317 [39]-[45]. The approach taken in Weiss has been adopted and applied in a long list of cases in both this Court and the High Court including the following: DJS v R [2010] NSWCCA 200; RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209; Kessing v R [2008] NSWCCA 310; 73 NSWLR 22; Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358; AK v The State of WA [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438; Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18; 236 CLR 293; Swansson v R [2007] NSWCCA 67; 69 NSWLR 406; Aslett v R [2006] NSWCCA 49; 168 A Crim R 263; Vickers at 215 [107]-[108]; Cornwell v R [2006] NSWCCA 116; 160 A Crim R 243; Taleb v R [2006] NSWCCA 119; Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190; 162 A Crim R 233. 

47The statutory task of this Court in applying the proviso was articulated by the High Court in Weiss (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ) in the following terms at 316-317 [41]-[42]: 

""41 That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where those natural limitations require the appellate court to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In such a case the proviso would not apply, and apart from some exceptional cases, where a verdict of acquittal might be entered, it would be necessary to order a new trial. But recognising that there will be cases where the proviso does not apply does not exonerate the appellate court from examining the record for itself. 

42 It is neither right nor useful to attempt to lay down absolute rules or singular tests that are to be applied by an appellate court where it examines the record for itself, beyond the three fundamental propositions mentioned earlier. (The appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; the task is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks; the standard of proof is the criminal standard.) It is not right to attempt to formulate other rules or tests in so far as they distract attention from the statutory test. It is not useful to attempt that task because to do so would likely fail to take proper account of the very wide diversity of circumstances in which the proviso falls for consideration. 

43 There are, however, some matters to which particular attention should be drawn. First, the appellate court's task must be undertaken on the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict. The court is not 'to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out'. But there are cases in which it would be possible to conclude that the error made at trial would, or at least should, have had no significance in determining the verdict that was returned by the trial jury. The fact that the jury did return a guilty verdict cannot be discarded from the appellate court's assessment of the whole record of trial. Secondly, it is necessary always to keep two matters at the forefront of consideration: the accusatorial character of criminal trials such as the present and that the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. 

44 Next, the permissive language of the proviso ('the Court ... may , notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal ... ') is important. So, too, is the way in which the condition for the exercise of that power is expressed ('if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred'). No single universally applicable description of what constitutes 'no substantial miscarriage of justice' can be given. But one negative proposition may safely be offered. It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. 

45 Likewise, no single universally applicable criterion can be formulated which identifies cases in which it would be proper for an appellate court not to dismiss the appeal, even though persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt. What can be said, however, is that there may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt. Cases where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness at trial may provide examples of cases of that kind."" 

48The ""natural limitations"" referred to by the High Court at 316 [41] of Weiss is a reference to the following passage in the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at 125-126 [23]: 

""The foregoing procedure shapes the requirements, and limitations, of such an appeal. On the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to 'give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance'. On the other, it must, of necessity, observe the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. These limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the 'feeling' of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole."" 

49In the present case, there is relatively little room for the "" natural limitations "" to which reference is made above as the Crown's direct and circumstantial case did not, to any relevant degree, depend upon the credibility of any relevant witness. Nevertheless, there is still the "" feeling "" of the case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share with those present at the trial. 

50In Weiss at 317 [43] the High Court drew attention to the fact that the appellate court's task must be undertaken on the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict. In the present case, both the appellant and the Crown accepted that the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict could play no part in this Court's assessment of the strength of the Crown case based upon the admissible evidence. That it is appropriate in some cases to ignore the guilty verdict of the jury was recognised by the High Court in Cesan at 395 [128] - [129] where Hayne, Crennan and Keifel JJ made the following observations: 

""128 In Weiss , the court pointed out that, in considering the application of the proviso, an appellate court's task 'must be undertaken on the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict'. But in undertaking that task an appellate court must be conscious of the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record of the trial. 

129 In many cases where the proviso is to be considered, the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict will indicate rejection of any explanation proffered by the accused in evidence. In the present cases, however, the relevant hypothesis is that the jury did not pay attention to all of the evidence led at trial. In particular, the jury was distracted when one of the two accused persons was giving his evidence. In those circumstances, it is not possible, in these cases, to place any weight upon the fact that the jury returned its verdicts of guilty."" 

51In the present case, it was accepted, and in our view properly so, that the jury must have at least been influenced by the evidence of the first representation which was wrongly admitted. It certainly could not be said that it had no or minimal significance in determining the verdict that the jury returned. Given the reliance placed upon the admission by the Crown in its final address, the contrary is, in our opinion, the case. In those circumstances, we agree with the appellant and the Crown that no weight can be placed upon the fact that the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 

52It is therefore necessary to consider the admissible evidence relied upon by the Crown in order to determine whether that evidence persuades us of the appellant's guilt of the charge of murder beyond reasonable doubt. To an assessment of that evidence we now turn. 

The Crown's Case on Appeal 

53The Crown case relied upon circumstantial evidence and direct evidence, including evidence of admissions by words and conduct. Regard is required to be had to the totality of the evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of the direct evidence of witnesses and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events. In exercising this function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]. 

54The Crown accepted that it bore the onus of establishing to this Court's satisfaction that the admissible evidence proved at the trial was sufficient to persuade us beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant murdered the deceased: Cesan at 391 [112], 393 [122]; Doja v R [2009] NSWCCA 303; 198 A Crim R 349 at 372 [133]. In its written submissions on the appeal, the Crown relied on the following evidence which it described as "" very potent "": 

""a. evidence given by friends and relatives that the relationship between the Applicant and the Deceased had for some time before the offence been punctuated by interpersonal disharmony between the couple precipitated by financial stresses and the apparently heavy reliance of the Applicant upon the financial and other contributions of the Deceased, that the Deceased had professed a desire to separate from the Applicant and had indicated her intention to do so if their circumstances did not improve by the Christmas of 2003; 

b. evidence of the child 'Jed' of the tumultuous nature of the relationship including that the Applicant had hit the Deceased during an argument at Toowoon Bay at the beginning of 2003; 

c. evidence that the Applicant had been with the Deceased when they both left the Occidental Hotel and he was roused from his bed by the child 'Jed' who had just discovered the body of the Deceased; 

d. evidence of Mr Wegner (a neighbour two properties west along the street from the residence of the Applicant and the Deceased) that he had heard a loud argument between a man and a woman with sounds of banging and crashing in the early hours of a morning during November 2003 which he believes was the morning of the death of the Deceased, the sounds appeared to be coming from the East but he could not tell if it was from a house or the nearby park; 

e. the evidence of 'Jed' that he saw that the Applicant had blood on his finger and a stain that looked like rubbed blood and was about the size of a 20 cent piece on his shirt when he roused the Applicant from his bed and they went together out to the laundry where the body of the Deceased was situated;

No Substantial Factual Controversy at Trial 

55Leaving to one side for the moment the evidence given by Scott Shepherd (discussed below), as earlier indicated, there was no dispute of any significance in relation to factual matters that depended upon the credibility of witnesses. 

56In other words, this was not a case where important factual matters had to be decided based on conflicting evidence given at the trial. 

57As also indicated above, in this case the ""natural limitations"" that may exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record are not such as to require this Court, as an appellate court, to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In those circumstances, this is an appeal which requires us to make our own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether it has been proved beyond reasonable double that the appellant is guilty of the murder of the deceased. 

58Given the nature of the error in the admission of the evidence of the first statement made by Scott Shepherd, as earlier indicated it is not possible to place any weight upon the fact that the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Accordingly, it follows that the question as to whether the proviso should or should not be applied rests wholly upon the evidence led at trial and this Court's own independent assessment of it, which assessment is to be made without any significance being attached to the jury's verdict. 
 
An Assessment of the Evidence 

59Considered below are aspects of the evidence which, in our view, are of particular significance to the discharge of this Court's function in the present appeal. 

60The appellant and Ms Best had been in a relationship for a number of years. The evidence demonstrated a number of stressors (including financial stressors) which had operated upon the relationship over time. There had been tensions in the relationship, with evidence of the use of force by the appellant against Ms Best on an earlier occasion. There had been some volatility in the relationship, marked by concerns expressed by Ms Best concerning the appellant's use of funds. However, the evidence did not disclose an abusive relationship marked by recurring acts of domestic violence. 

61The couple and their family had returned to Cobar on 16 November 2003, a situation which pleased Ms Best. There is evidence of Ms Best informing a friend earlier in 2003 that, unless things improved, she may leave the appellant at the end of the year. There is no evidence that Ms Best communicated this view to the appellant. Of course, there is no account in evidence as to what may have been said between the appellant and Ms Best after they left the Occidental Hotel in Cobar at about 2.00 am on 21 November 2003. 

62There is no obligation upon the Crown to prove motive, which is not an element of the crime of murder. However, the presence or absence of motive, or the nature of any motive, may bear upon a determination as to whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant killed Ms Best: De Gruchy v The Queen [2002] HCA 33; 211 CLR 85 at 92-93 [28]-[32]; R v Vjestica [2008] VSCA 47; 182 A Crim R 350 at 382-383 [112]-[115]. 

63The evidence reveals that the appellant and Ms Best left the Occidental Hotel at about 2.00 am, and that Ms Best was found lying on the laundry floor at about 8.00 am on 21 November 2003. Staying in the house at 18 Harcourt Street Cobar that evening were the appellant, Ms Best and at least two children (including the child, Jed). There is evidence referred to at [7] above from Mr Andre Wegner that he heard raised voices of a man and a woman followed by some ""banging and crashing"" . However, Mr Wegner did not make a statement containing this account until 2005, and there was scope for some uncertainty as to the precise location from which these sounds emanated. Nevertheless, Mr Wegner's evidence formed part of the body of evidence which the Court is required to consider. 

64Pertinent to the present enquiry is consideration of evidence which may point to the presence of a third party, such as an intruder or burglar, who may have carried out the fatal attack upon Ms Best. Mr William Cahill lived in Linsley Street, Cobar which intersects with Harcourt Street. Mr Cahill said that he had had three break-ins at his house in the preceding 12 months. Mr Cahill had two dogs which were barking on the morning of 21 November 2003 when, as will be seen, the appellant came through his yard on the way to a disused coalmine. Mr Cahill was asked if he heard dogs barking the previous night, and he replied ""Not that I took any notice of, no"" . Mr Cahill's evidence points to break-ins in the area prior to 21 November 2003. However, the absence of evidence of barking dogs during the relevant night does not assist a defence hypothesis that an intruder may have entered 18 Harcourt Street and inflicted the fatal injuries. On the other hand, the dogs apparently only barked when an intruder entered the Cahill property. If such a person killed Ms Best, it does not follow that he would have left the area via Mr Cahill's land. 

65When Jed roused the appellant at about 8.00 am on 21 November 2003, and called him to the laundry area where Ms Best was lying, the appellant commenced a course of conduct which progressively and cumulatively operated in a most incriminating manner towards him. In approaching the evidence in this respect, it is necessary to keep in mind that different persons may react in different ways to difficult circumstances. What follows should not be taken as the application of a type of reasonable person test as a means of measuring the responses of the appellant. That said, it is necessary to have regard to the evidence and to utilise commonsense in assessing what followed. 

66The response of Jed, urging a call to the police or the ambulance authorities, was met by the appellant with a type of delayed response. If the appellant had not killed Ms Best, then he was being confronted with a shocking and devastating scenario in which his partner had been attacked by another person. The appellant's response was to delay the calling of the authorities. 

67Thereafter, when the police were called, the appellant did not remain on the premises. It was the appellant's account that, upon the arrival of other persons, questions were asked of him as to whether he had attacked Ms Best. According to his ERISP answers, the appellant became frightened and left the premises, heading towards a disused coalmine. He had a kitchen knife in his possession. 

68It is reasonable to assess the evidence up to this point bearing in mind the appellant's later denial that he had killed Ms Best, but could not remember what had happened after their return from the Occidental Hotel at 2.00 am that day. The claimed lack of recollection of the appellant was said to flow from his state of intoxication. There is no evidence that the appellant suffered from any medical or psychiatric condition which impeded his memory. 

The C onsciousness of Guilt Evidence 

69Before examining the appellant's post-offence conduct in detail, it is as well to set out the principles that determine the basis for the admissibility of evidence of such conduct and for determining whether such conduct demonstrates a consciousness of the criminal conduct in question amounting to an implied admission of guilt. 

70Lies and post-conduct are a species of circumstantial evidence. It has been held that an inference of guilt may be drawn from the concatenation of circumstances including post-offence conduct. The process of reasoning from ""strands in a cable"" of circumstantial evidence discussed in Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573 was applied in Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193. Whether a statement, proved to be false, is capable of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt of relevant wrongful conduct amounting to an implied admission of guilt will depend upon ""the terms of the statement, the circumstances in which it is made, the nature of the offence charged and other evidence in the case"" : R v Rich (Ruling No. 11) [2009] VSC 11 (Lasry J) at [40]. 

71As with other forms of circumstantial evidence of guilt, a tribunal of fact may accept the evidence of lies and other post-offence conduct and act upon it without being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence establishes guilt (that is to say, without being satisfied that there is no other explanation for the lies and post-offence conduct which was reasonably open on the facts). 

72In Edwards at 210 Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, in this respect, stated: 

""The jury do not have to conclude that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt in order to accept that a lie told by him [or post-offence conduct] exhibits a consciousness of guilt. One may accept that evidence without applying any particular standard of proof and conclude that, when they consider it together with the other evidence, the accused is or is not guilty beyond reasonable doubt."" 

73R v Ciantar [2006] VSCA 263; 16 VR 26 is another case which illustrates how a lie, allegedly told from a consciousness of guilt, when constituting ""a strand in the cable"" , is a matter to be considered with all of the other accumulation of evidence. 

74The ""controls"" which ""customarily apply to the use of evidence of consciousness of guilt"" were described in Edwards in the following terms ( Ciantar at 48-49 [70]-[72]): 

""Post-offence conduct is not to be left to the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt unless it has first been precisely identified together with the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that by engaging in the conduct, the accused demonstrated a consciousness of having committed the offence which is charged. 

The judge must also be satisfied that the post-offence conduct, when taken in conjunction with the circumstances and events so identified, is capable of demonstrating such a consciousness of guilt. 

So, if an innocent explanation of post-offence conduct is so inherently likely that a jury could not properly regard the conduct as evidence of guilt, or if the post-offence conduct is intractably neutral, the judge should refuse to leave the conduct to the jury as evidence capable of demonstrating such a consciousness of guilt, the post-offence conduct should be left to the jury to determine whether it has that effect. Similarly, where evidence of consciousness of guilt, which although by itself is equally consistent with consciousness of guilt of an included offence or another count on the presentment or another offence disclosed by the evidence, is capable in conjunction with other evidence of sustaining an inference of consciousness of guilt of the charged offence, it must be left to the jury to determine whether it demonstrates consciousness of guilt of the charged offence."" 

75Accordingly, in determining the application of the proviso in the circumstances of the present case, it is necessary to bear in mind the principles that govern the admissibility of evidence of post-offence conduct and the application of those principles to the evidence in this case. 

76Whether or not a particular aspect of the appellant's post-offence conduct can be considered as capable of demonstrating a consciousness of relevant wrongful conduct amounting to an implied admission of guilt will depend upon: 

(1) The nature of the conduct; 

(2) The circumstances in which the conduct occurred; 

(3) The nature of the offence charged; 

(4) Other evidence in the case which would include any explanation provided by the appellant during the course of his ERISP and the subsequent walk-around the crime scene: R v Rich (Ruling No 11) [2009] VSC 11 at [42] per Lasry J. 

The Evidence as to the Appellant ' s Immediate Reactions to the Death of the Deceased 

77After the appellant went to the laundry soon after being woken by Jed, the latter said to the appellant ""ring the police"" . The offender responded ""No, not yet"" . 

78After the appellant went into the laundry, Jed said something about ringing an ambulance and the appellant said ""Not yet, I'm trying to think"" . He went back into the laundry. Jed then said ""Shall I go and get Leonie?"" . The appellant replied to the effect ""Not yet, I am trying to think"" . 

79After the appellant said to Jed, ""Wait, I'm just thinking"" followed by Jed asking ""Can I go get Leonie?"" , Jed said that the appellant said ""Not just yet"" . Jed said that a couple of minutes later he said to the appellant ""Can I go to Leonie?"" . The appellant, Jed said, then relied ""Okay"" . The appellant added, ""Take the kids"" . 

80Jed's recollection was it was that about 8 to 10 minutes after finding the deceased before he went up to Leonie Patterson's house. Soon after the appellant fled the crime scene. 

81Following Leonie Patterson's call to Cobar Police Station, police arrived at about 8.05 am. They walked down the driveway of 18 Harcourt Street, Cobar to the rear of the house. The neighbour, William Cahill, was in the yard of the premises at the rear of 18 Harcourt Street when he said to Constable Waters ""He has just jumped over the fence and ran through my place as you boys have arrived"" . 

82Mr Cahill said that this had occurred at about 8.15 am on 21 November 2003 when he heard his dogs starting to bark and saw somebody walking across his back lawn. 

The Appellant Pockets a Knife Intent on Self-Inflicted Harm - Why? 

83During the course of the walk-around with police on 23 November 2003, the appellant said that, on hearing Leonie Patterson calling out, he took a knife and put it in the back pocket of his shorts. However, in his ERISP answers it is noted that he took the knife before any challenging questions were raised by Ms Patterson. 

84In the ERISP, he was questioned about the knife as follows: 

""Q76. I've been told that when Leonie got there, when you turned round to walk back towards the rear of the house, you had a knife down the back of your pants. Do you remember that? A. I do. 

Q77. Can you tell me about that? A. Like, I said, I couldn't remember what had happened and I just wanted, I just wanted to, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen and I was just gunna take my own life. 

Q78. Can you tell me what point, at what time you got the knife? A. It was after I'd sent the boys up to Leonie's place . 

Q79. And where did you get the knife from? A. It was in the kitchen. 

Q80. Can you tell me where the knife is now? A. Yes, I can. It's at the open-cut. 

... 

Q83. Did you try and harm yourself with the knife? A. I did. It wasn't particularly sharp but. 

Q84. And where did you try and harm yourself on your body? A. Down the neck here and across there."" (Emphasis added) 

85In the ERISP, the appellant was asked as to why he tried to take his life (Q 205-206): 

""Q205. You said earlier that the cuts on your neck are from the knife that Detective Bryant just mentioned? A. Yeah. 

Q206. Can you tell me why you tried to take your life? A. Just scared I guess. Not having, having that window of not remembering and seeing what was in the laundry. I mean, I couldn't imagine --"" (Emphasis added) 

86Later in the ERISP, he was asked (Q 248-254): 

""Q248. Why did you try and take your life? What was the reason for taking the knife from the house? A. I was scared that it, I just didn't know what had happened . 

Q249. Alright. You're saying you didn't know what happened, well, why did you take the knife from the house? What did you intend to do with the knife? A. Intended to harm myself . 

Q250. And what was the reason for harming yourself? A. Just a bad thing that happened and I just didn't know. 

Q251. You didn't know what? A. What happened. 

Q252. Alright. So you didn't, you say you didn't know what happened? But why would you think of hurting yourself because you didn't know what happened? A. What if it was me? 

Q253. What if it was you that did what, though? A. Did that to Gabrielle . 

Q254. So, what do you mean by that? A. Just waking up, not being able to remember what had happened and going out the back and seeing Gabrielle like she was, to drink and black out, it's a pretty awful feeling to wake up with and for that - 

..."" (Emphasis added) 

87In the ERISP at Q 300-301, he was asked: 

""Q300. Was it at Gorilla Rock where you tried to harm yourself? A. The first time, yeah. 

Q301. And how long after you left Harcourt Street to where you tried to harm yourself with the knife, what time period do you think had elapsed? A. Three or 4 minutes."" 

88Later in the ERISP at Q 316-318, the appellant was asked: 

""Q316. And is it correct that you say in relation to trying to harm yourself, that you did that because you thought you may have killed Gabrielle? A. I didn't know. 

Q317. You didn't know. But I think you said you thought you may had [sic] done it, which is why you tried to harm yourself when I asked you why did you try to do it, why did you try to hurt yourself, what were you thinking? A. Mm. 

Q318. Is that right? A. I guess so, yeah ."" (Emphasis added) 

89In relation to the above evidence, the question naturally arising is as to why, so soon after the appellant saw the deceased's body in the laundry, he would take a knife with the apparent intention of using it to kill himself? 

90It is sufficient at this point to observe that the appellant's taking of the knife and his later self-infliction of cuts to his body may support an inference that the appellant was acting out of a consciousness of guilt. Alternatively, at least it may be said to impliedly suggest a state of mind in the appellant which entertained the possibility that he had, in fact, been the perpetrator of the attack on the deceased. The question of what could possibly have created such a line of thought in him is discussed below. 

The Appellant's Response to Leonie Patterson 

91Ms Patterson stated that when she attended at 18 Harcourt Street on 24 November 2003, she said to the appellant, ""Where's Gabby?"" . He said ""Just go back with the kids"" . She said that she then said ""Where's Gabby. I want to see Gabby"" and the appellant was just standing there looking at her. 

92When asked as to whether the appellant did anything or made any gesture, Ms Patterson's evidence was: 

""He said, 'Go back to the kids'. Again I said, 'What have you done? Have you hurt her?' and he just lifted his hands out like that. 

Q. You have indicated you have your elbows about your waist and your forearms bent upward with your palms out, is that right? A. Yes, yes."" 

93Ms Patterson said that at the time he was wearing a ""grey, greenie coloured, darky t-shirt and shorts"" . The T-shirt had a stain on it. She said the mark on the T-shirt looked like a smear. The shorts worn by him were described as ""footie shorts"" . 

94Ms Patterson said that she then said to the appellant, ""Have you hurt her?"" and also ""Should I call an ambulance?"" . The appellant replied, ""Call the police"" . Ms Patterson said she again said, ""Should I call an ambulance?"" and the appellant responded, ""Call the police"" . 

95Ms Patterson said the appellant then just turned around and walked off and she noticed he had a knife sticking out the back of his pants. She then said she ran back home and rang Cobar Police. 
 
The Appellant Flees From the Crime Scene 

96In his ERISP, the appellant said Leonie Patterson came to the front door and started yelling, ""What have you done, what have you done to her?"" (Q 71). The appellant said that he told her to ring the police. He said that she again said, ""What have you done to her, Glen?"" and he said to ring the police. She left to go, apparently, to ring the police. The appellant said, ""... and I walked back in and had another look and I just freaked out and I run over, jumped the back fence ..."" (Q 71). After that, he said he then ""Just hid"" (Q 72). 

97The appellant was asked (Q 74), ""Can you tell me why you ran?"" . The appellant replied, ""I just freaked out, I couldn't remember how I got home and Leonie was saying, what have I done. I just freaked"" . 

98Similar comments to those made above in relation to the knife and its use apply also here in relation to the appellant's conduct in fleeing the crime scene and hiding from police. Thus in a consideration of the evidence and, in particular, as to the inferences that may be drawn from it, it is necessary to consider the position of the appellant in the situation in which he found himself following the sighting of the deceased's body in the laundry. 

99The evidence does not demonstrate that upon seeing his slain partner, the appellant reacted overtly in terms of words and/or signs of grief or anguish or outrage. The sight of his partner, the mother of his two children, lying dead, one might think, would instinctively give rise to some form of demonstrable reaction. 

100Instead, the actions of the appellant constituted by his hesitancy in calling the police, his action in taking the knife and in fleeing and hiding for almost two days, exhibited a sense of self-pre-occupation or a self focus, rather than a sense of the surviving parent displaying the need to stay and support his children (and the deceased's other children). The evidence, in other words, reflects the appellant acting in a way which has the appearance of him shielding himself or avoiding accusation or investigation for fear of it connecting him with the crime. 

101In these circumstances, the question arises as to whether or not the evidence discloses a plausible basis for explaining what appears to have been the appellant's self focussed or avoidant conduct. 

102His explanation to police was put upon the basis that, having become intoxicated the previous evening, he was unable to recall events from the time he left the hotel at about 2.00 am. By reason of that fact, he said he was not in a position to say what had happened to his wife or whether or not he, himself, was implicated in her death. 

103The question then becomes whether the explanation given by the appellant to police is a rational one. Is the mere fact of an inability in a person to recall particular events, as a matter of rationality, likely to prompt or lead him or her to start thinking in terms that he/she may have been the perpetrator of a crime in a case such as the present? Is it likely to have led the person to commence thinking in terms of suicide? In other words, is the fact of the asserted loss of memory itself a rational or plausible explanation or basis for a person thinking along those lines? In evaluating that question and to take a hypothetical example, in a case where a husband had recently made angry threats against the life of his partner, it may be plausible that the injury or death of the partner following soon thereafter might cause the hypothetical husband (who has no relevant memory) to commence to think as to whether or not he had acted out his anger and have attacked his partner. 

104The question for consideration in the present case is whether the mere lapse of memory (accepting for the moment the appellant's account in that respect as being truthful), is sufficient of itself to rationally explain why he would have entertained the possibility that he had been the perpetrator of the crime? For it to constitute a rational explanation, it may well be thought that the appellant would need to have evidence of more than a mere loss of memory by virtue of intoxication before he started to entertain the possibility that he killed his partner and before deciding to flee with the intention of taking his own life. 

The Appellant's Preparatory Suicidal Conduct at 5 Mitchell Street 

105The appellant's evidence was that he hid at Gorilla Rock until about 5.00 am on the Saturday morning and then went from there to 5 Mitchell Street, a vacant house. He remained at those premises until the next morning when he went to his mother's place. 

106On the walk-around the house, the appellant was asked by police about the rope with the noose in it (at 5 Mitchell Street): 

""Q. And can you tell me what you intended to do with that? A. That was the last option, I suppose . 

Q. And what do you mean by the last option? A. To hang myself. 

Q. Can you tell me why you were considering hanging yourself? A. Why? I already went through this on the tape. 

Q. Yeah, but obviously you've tried to harm yourself with the knife? A. Ah hmm. 

Q. Alright. And then you've come here and it would appear that you've set up some sort of rope -- A. Ah hmm. 

Q.-- in the ceiling to hang yourself. But from what I understand is, you say that you didn't kill Gabrielle -- A. Right 

Q.-- but you don't know what happened? A. Ah hmm."" (Emphasis added) 



107The police investigations revealed the following: 

(1) A blue nylon rope was hanging from the hallway ceiling. It was tied through a hole in the ceiling adjacent to the manhole opening. A metal bar had been used to create the hole in the ceiling plaster. 

(2) A small yellow covered notebook and a ballpoint pen were located on the shelf of a built-in wardrobe of a bedroom adjacent to where the rope was located. Inside the notebook the appellant had written, ""I have done the worst thing ever"" . 

108The significance of the circumstances in both (1) and (2) above are to be considered. Both the actions involved in putting the nylon rope in place with the apparent intention of the appellant taking his life and the suicide note reflect the appellant's then state of mind. What did the appellant mean when he wrote ""I have done the worst thing ever"" ? In the submissions of the appellant to this Court it was argued that as the note was written as a suicide note it was intended that it would be read after the appellant had ended his life. The words, ""the worst thing ever"" , should be taken to refer to the act of him taking his own life. 

109However, after careful consideration, we are not satisfied that that is the appropriate or proper interpretation of the appellant's handwritten words. The use of the past tense ""I have done the worst thing ever"" in its most natural meaning, carries the sense of a reference to something that had occurred prior to writing the note rather than something, namely, suicide, that was intended to occur after the note was written. Additionally, the note carries the implication that the ""worst thing"" done by the appellant was the explanation or the preparatory reason for the drastic act of (intended) suicide. 

110On this latter construction, the evidence indicates that from the time the appellant picked up the knife at 18 Harcourt Street until he wrote the suicide note, the appellant's state of mind was at least consistent with a consciousness of guilt. The only factual matter offered by the appellant by way of explanation was his claimed loss of memory. There was no other fact put forward by him in the ERISP to explain why, within minutes of seeing the deceased's body, the appellant would embark upon imminent suicide, commencing with his action of taking the knife. 

111The immediacy of his actions leading to suicide (assuming he committed suicide), he would have had to appreciate, would leave no time or opportunity for police to track down his wife's killer (assuming the crime had been carried out by an unknown third party). That fact, in itself, raises a serious question as to the plausibility of the appellant's explanation given in the ERISP and of his denials that he committed the crime. 

112Insofar as the words ""I have done the worst thing ever"" are taken to refer to something done by the appellant, then clearly, in the context in which it was written, it is capable of constituting an admission upon the assumption that the phrase ""... the worst thing ever"" is taken as referring to the commission of the offence which in our view is the case. The words in question plainly are capable of reflecting the appellant's state of mind linked to what is expressed to be ""... the worst thing ever"" . 

113The handwritten note was not the subject of challenge, nor were its terms qualified in a way that affected the second version of the conversation said to have taken place between the appellant and Scott Shepherd. The solemn circumstances in which the note was written by the appellant, and its clear content, are not consistent with a lack of memory on the part of the appellant as to whether he had caused the injuries to the deceased from which she died. As to the submission made by the appellant in this Court that the ""worst thing ever"" in the note may be taken as a reference to the appellant's intended suicide, and not the killing of the deceased, no such argument was directed to the jury. In any event, such a construction is, as indicated above, fanciful in the circumstances of this case. If the appellant had committed suicide, his act would have been there for all to see. The note explains the reason for the appellant's intended suicide (the killing of his partner). In our view, the statement contained in the note is unequivocal and it constitutes a clear admission of guilt on the part of the appellant. 

The Appellant's Statement to His Brother 

114After a time, the appellant left the premises in Mitchell Street and travelled to his mother's address in Cobar. At about 10.15 am on Sunday, 23 November 2003, he walked up the driveway of his mother's house. By this time, the appellant had been at large in the Cobar area for more than two days. He spoke to his mother and to his brother, Scott, after the latter arrived. 

115For present purposes, it may be taken that the appellant said to his brother ""How could they love me if I killed their mother"" . Even on this version, the appellant is not denying that he killed the deceased. When regard is had to the suggestion of memory difficulties with respect to this horrific incident, the evidence of Scott Shepherd does not assist the appellant and, in fact, provides some support for the Crown. 

Other Evidentiary Matters 

116The evidence does not permit any conclusion as to what happened after the appellant and the deceased returned to 18 Harcourt Street in the early hours of 21 November 2003 except that, within the following hours, Ms Best was savagely attacked in the laundry area in the backyard of the house. That both of them had been intoxicated to a significant extent may have set the scene for an argument leading to an enraged state on the part of the appellant, during which he attacked the deceased. We express this view in a somewhat indirect way because there is no direct evidence that this occurred. Nevertheless, the circumstantial evidence, and the appellant's admission in the note, point strongly to him being the assailant and with this being the context in which the attack occurred. 

117The evidence points to a domestic iron and a hammer (both located in the laundry) being the weapons used in the attack upon the deceased. The evidence of Dr Duflou supports that conclusion. That relatively mundane domestic items such as these may be used in this way sheds light upon the circumstances of the attack. 

118If the appellant was not the assailant, then an unknown intruder must have carried out the attack. There is no suggestion that the children in the house played any part in the crime. In assessing whether there is a reasonable hypothesis that a third-party assailant was involved, it is appropriate to consider the circumstances of the attack. 

119If the deceased disturbed an intruder in the vicinity of the laundry during the night, then resistance by the intruder might be theoretically possible. However, what the evidence reveals is that the iron was used as a weapon to strike the head of the deceased until it broke, with the hammer then being used as a type of follow-up weapon. 

120The forensic evidence revealed the appellant's and Ms Best's DNA on the handles of the iron and hammer. No DNA was detected pointing to any other person. The evidence revealed that this was not decisive or conclusive on the point. However, it is part of the evidence to be assessed in determining the question of the appellant's guilt. 

121Further, it is appropriate to keep in mind that these two weapons were used in the attack upon the deceased. In assessing the existence of a reasonable hypothesis in the form of a third-party assailant, it might be thought unlikely that the consecutive use of items such as these as weapons would arise. On the other hand, in the context of an enraged domestic attack by the appellant upon his partner, this scenario has some attraction. 

The Deceased's Bank Keycards 

122There is evidence that Ms Best had two keycards with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. One of these keycards was retained by the keycard machine in Cobar, and was found by a bank employee on the morning of Monday, 24 November 2003 when she extracted it (and other cards) and cut them up. The cut-up card was retained and ultimately produced as an exhibit at the trial. 

123There was, as earlier stated, some evidence that there had been break-ins in the area of recent date, but the appellant's primary case that a third party must have been involved related to the fact that a number of items, including the deceased's wallet, were found on an outdoor table at the Cobar house which appeared to have come from a small yellow bag belonging to her which was also on the table. 

124The evidence established that there were two keycards in relation to the one account of the deceased and each would have had the same PIN number. The evidence suggested that the appellant knew the PIN number as he had been seen to withdraw $60 from an ATM at the Grand Hotel at about 5.00 or 5.30 pm on the afternoon of 20 November. The money appears to have been withdrawn by him from the deceased's account, this being established by the evidence of the Manager of the Cobar branch of the Bank. Other evidence, the appellant submitted, was given which suggested that, earlier on 20 November, he had asked for and was given the deceased's keycard. The inference to be drawn from this evidence, so he submitted, was that the appellant knew the PIN number for the deceased's account. Furthermore, it was not necessary for the appellant to have tipped out the contents of the small yellow bag in order to obtain the deceased's keycard as a second keycard was found in the pocket of the shorts which had been discarded at the scene. It was therefore likely, so it was contended, that someone other than the appellant attempted to use the deceased's card some time after her death but without knowledge of the correct PIN number. 

125The Crown's response to these submissions was that the unsuccessful attempt to gain access to the deceased's account was consistent with a person such as the appellant who expected that he could accurately recall the PIN, taking the keycard but later not being able to recall it because of the combination of his inebriated state and/or some emotional turmoil and/or panic he was experiencing when attempting to access the account. While it was true that there was a keycard to the deceased's account in the pocket of the board shorts found in the courtyard, the Crown submitted that the appellant might have decided not to retain that keycard given its association with the offence for fear that it might link him with the offence forensically by his use of a keycard usually kept by the deceased. Further, or in the alternative, it was submitted that the appellant might have deliberately but unsuccessfully used the deceased's keycard after her death in order to provide some evidence to suggest that she was robbed and murdered by an intruder who would have not known her correct PIN. 

126The Crown therefore submitted that the circumstances concerning the two keycards and the unsuccessful attempt to access the account of the deceased were not inimical to the appellant's guilt. 

127In assessing the existence of a reasonable hypothesis of a third-party assailant, it is necessary to consider this evidence. The defence argument is that if this card had been retained in the machine before 2.00 am on Friday 21 November 2003, it would have been found by the bank employee on the morning of that day. Thus, it is argued that the keycard must have been inserted in the machine after Ms Best's death. The evidence revealed that the keycard machine would retain a card if the PIN number had been entered incorrectly on three occasions. Accordingly, the defence submission is that a person (a stranger) must have attempted unsuccessfully to utilise the keycard, wrongly inserting PIN numbers, on three occasions some time after the deceased was murdered and after the bank employee cleared the ATM of retained cards on the Friday morning, but prior to her clearing the ATM on the following Monday morning. 

128However in our opinion, it is difficult to envisage that a stranger would hold any realistic expectation of being able to utilise the keycard when, on the evidence, that person had no knowledge as to the correct PIN number and could not have had any basis for believing that he/she could work out the necessary combination of four digits to activate the ATM machine. Furthermore, it is more likely that such a person would have attempted to use the ATM soon after killing the deceased and, therefore, prior to the bank employee clearing the ATM of retained cards on the Friday morning. 

129Two further matters should be mentioned as bearing upon this aspect of the evidence. Firstly, there is evidence that the appellant, at times, had utilised the deceased's keycard, sometimes in circumstances giving rise to disputes with her. Secondly, it must be kept in mind that the appellant was at large in the Cobar area from after 8.00 am on Friday, 21 November 2003 until the morning of Sunday, 23 November 2003. There was, at least, an opportunity for him to use the keycard at the relevant machine in that period, albeit unsuccessfully. In circumstances where it can well be contemplated that the appellant was in an agitated state, it does not take much to contemplate a scenario where he wrongly entered the PIN number on sufficient occasions to have had the card retained in the machine. 

130This aspect is an important part of the body of evidence to be considered. Accordingly, in our view, the raising of the third party scenario does not materially assist the appellant, nor does it undermine the Crown case against him in all the circumstances. 

Some Other Features of the Evidence - Intoxication and a Swiss Army Knife 

131There is clear evidence that the appellant and the deceased had been consuming significant quantities of alcohol before their return to the premises at 18 Harcourt Street. A blood-alcohol level of .14 was detected in a sample of the deceased's blood taken at autopsy. There was no opportunity to assess the appellant's blood-alcohol level given his departure from the premises and his remaining at large for two days following the death of his partner. Nevertheless, the evidence reveals that the appellant was able to walk from the Occidental Hotel back to 18 Harcourt Street, despite whatever quantity of alcohol he had consumed. 

132The only evidence of memory difficulties on his part are those emanating from some (but not all) of his ERISP answers. The evidence leaves clearly open the ability of the appellant to move about in and near the premises at 18 Harcourt Street (or elsewhere) in the period between the death of his partner and the time when Jed spoke to him some time later. The evidence does not suggest that the appellant was less mobile, or less capable of acts such as washing himself, because of his level of intoxication. 

133A Swiss-Army type knife was located by police on the ground in the backyard of 18 Harcourt Street after the death of the deceased. A fingerprint was observed on the knife, which was not matched with any person whose fingerprints were on the national database. The appellant submitted that this knife points to the presence of a third party on the premises and that it therefore supports a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. 

134In our opinion, the presence of this knife on the ground is of limited use in the context of this case. It is not as though the appellant and his partner had been living at 18 Harcourt Street continuously for a lengthy period of time with this knife suddenly appearing in otherwise unexplained circumstances in the backyard. 

135The appellant and the deceased had moved back to that address on 16 November 2003, only four days prior to the events under consideration. There is no evidence as to how long the knife had been on the ground in the backyard. There is no evidence that the knife had played any part whatsoever in events surrounding the death of the deceased. The evidence rises no higher than the location of this item, bearing an unidentified fingerprint, on the ground in the backyard. We do not consider that this aspect undermines the Crown case in any material way. 

The DNA Evidence 

136The DNA evidence falls into three categories. First, that found on a pair of ""NOW "" brand board shorts; second, that found on the T-shirt the appellant was wearing when he went to bed that evening; and, third, that found on the claw hammer and steam iron, each of which was used to fracture the deceased's skull. 

(1) The Results of Preliminary Screening and DNA Profiling 

137The evidence based on the DNA analysis undertaken by Ms Beilby of the Division of Analytical Laboratories constituted an important part of the Crown circumstantial evidence case. 

138The presence of blood was detected on a number of items initially by preliminary or screening tests for blood and the return of positive results on swabs taken from them. These included: 

(1) In particular, positive swabs were taken from Item 7 (the T-shirt) and on Item 2 (a pair of ""NOW"" brand board shorts). 

(2) Swabs were taken from Item 1 (a claw hammer) which was positive and the DNA from it was matched with the deceased. 

(3) Similarly the swab from Item 12 (the steam iron body) matched the deceased. 

(4) Item 13 (a swab from the steam iron base) also resulted in the swab that indicated that the DNA matched the deceased. 

(a) The hammer handle 

139Item 14 was a swab taken from the hammer handle. The DNA of that swab revealed DNA material with more than one contributor to the DNA. The deceased was a major component of the DNA and the appellant, the minor component. There was no blood detected on the handle of the hammer. The DNA obtained from the handle of the hammer could have been raised from skin cells. 

140Item 15 was a swab taken from the handle of the steam iron which gave a DNA result, which indicated that there was more than one contributor. The deceased could have been the major contributor to the DNA and the appellant the minor contributor. 

(b) The doona 

141Items 16 and 17 represented swabs taken from sections of the doona taken from the bed in which the appellant had slept. Five pieces of the doona taken for analysis returned a preliminary positive test and were subjected to DNA testing. In respect of four of the five pieces, the DNA originated from more than one individual. The major component of the DNA was consistent with that of the appellant. The minor contributor of the DNA was too weak for interpretation. 

(c) The appellant's hands 

142In respect of the swabs taken from the fingers of the left and right hands from the appellant, the preliminary or screening test for blood was positive on the swabs. On further testing, a partial DNA profile was obtained which was consistent with that originating from the appellant based on samples recovered from fingers of the right hand. 

(d) The shorts 

143In respect of Item 2 (the board shorts), there were two areas tested on the front of the shorts. DNA detected originated from the deceased. There were two samples taken, one from the right front thigh area and the other from the left front leg down towards the bottom seam. The preliminary or screening tests were positive for blood in those two sample areas. On DNA testing performed, the DNA material was consistent with it having originated from the deceased. 

(e) The T-shirt 

144In respect of the T-shirt (Item 7), the preliminary or screening test for blood was positive on three swabs. 

145In respect of the sample taken from the centre front of the T-shirt, DNA analysis established more than one person's DNA. The major component, Ms Beilby stated, could have come from the appellant and the minor could have come from the deceased. The front centre area was the first area tested. Ms Beilby stated that normally in testing, the major contributor is blood. The minor contributor, she stated could also be blood. 

146The second area tested on the T-shirt was on the left sleeve. Again, examination revealed that there was more than one contributor to the DNA. The deceased, in respect of that sample, was the major contributor to the DNA and the appellant could have been the minor contributor. Ms Beilby emphasised that there is more DNA in blood than in skin cells. Ms Beilby stated that blood gives a stronger reading generally than skin cells in terms of the height of the peak shown on the DNA graph. 
 
(2) Analysis 

147The three significant items subjected to preliminary screening and DNA analysis were: 

(1) The appellant's T-shirt. 

(2) The appellant's board shirts. 

(3) The claw hammer and steam iron. 

148In respect of the DNA evidence on the above items, the following observations may be made: 

(a) The appellant's T-shirt 

149The T-shirt from which the samples were taken was worn by the appellant when he went to bed some time after 2.00 am on 21 November 2003. He was also wearing it at the time of his arrest on 23 November 2003. 

150In respect of the sample taken from the centre front of the T-shirt, the DNA of the appellant was the major component and that of the deceased was the minor component. So far as the DNA material taken from the front of the T-shirt, Ms Beilby stated that she could not say that the sample contained the deceased's blood, although she did add that the reading was quite strong so that it could have been her blood. Of the two areas from which samples were taken, the centre front area of the T-shirt and the left sleeve, the DNA material found on the left sleeve was the more significant of the two. The analysis of the left sleeve established that the DNA of the deceased on the left sleeve was the major component and that of the appellant as the minor component. One of the significant aspects of the DNA sample taken from the left sleeve is the fact, as earlier noted, that normally the major contributor is derived from the presence of blood, whereas a minor contributor could either be from blood but could also be taken from skin cells. On this basis, the major component of the sample taken from the left sleeve is likely to have been derived from the blood of the deceased and not from skin cells. Ms Beilby's evidence was that the female DNA taken from the left sleeve, consistent with the DNA of the deceased, was ""much stronger"" . 

151In cross-examination, it was suggested to Ms Beilby that she could not say positively that it was the deceased's blood on the sleeve, a proposition which she did not accept: 

""Q. In relation to the sleeve, you could say positively that it was her blood on the sleeve, is that right, from looking at the graph? A. It was certainly very strong, yes. In fact it had to be diluted."" 

152Ms Beilby acknowledged that the DNA material consistent with the profile of the appellant could have come from his blood but there could have been an alternative source of DNA (eg, skin cells). However, her evidence that skin cells could not be ruled out, in the context of her evidence, was a reference by Ms Beilby to the DNA material that was consistent with the appellant's DNA on the sleeve having come from skin cells although she added ""... It would be very strong if it was skin cells but I can't rule out that possibility"" . 

153A close examination of the evidence of Ms Beilby establishes, in our opinion, that the DNA material found on the sleeve of the T-shirt was derived from the blood of the deceased and not from her skin cells. We do not consider that Ms Beilby qualified her evidence in this respect by stating that she could not rule out the possibility that the deceased's DNA was not from her blood but from her skin cells. 
 
154On this point, Ms Beilby was asked in cross-examination: 

""Q. Mr Shepherd's profile was the stronger profile, is that right, in one of the areas. A. Yes. 

Q. In the other area it was - - A. In the other area - - 

Q. The sleeve? A. The female was much stronger, yes. 

Q. And that was the area on the sleeve, is that right? A. Yes, that's right. 

Q. So on the sleeve was there a profile of each of Ms Best and Mr Shepherd? A. Yes. 

Q. But Ms Best was the stronger profile on the sleeve, is that right? A. Yes, that's right. 

Q. In relation to the sleeve, you could say positively that it was her blood on the sleeve, is that right, from looking at the graph? A. It was certainly very strong, yes. In fact it had to be diluted."" 

155The cross-examination from that point onwards turned to the question of the appellant's DNA and as to whether it was derived from his blood or some other source of DNA. It was in that respect that she said that she could not rule out the possibility that the DNA had come from skin cells. That comment was not directed to the DNA material of the deceased located on the sleeve of the T-shirt. 

156A degree of confusion in this respect came into the cross-examination on the subject of the appellant's DNA on the sleeve. It was in that context that trial counsel for the appellant referred to both the appellant and the deceased: 

""Q. But you would lean more likely to the fact that it was his blood and her blood on the sleeve, more of her blood than his, is that right, in that case? A. That's right. Without, with the proviso that I could not rule out that it could be just a lot of skin cells. 

Q. But in the front of the chest, the blood from the front of the shirt, the body of the shirt itself? A. Yes. 

Q. Ms Best was a minor contributor to that, is that right? A. That's right. 

Q. And Mr Shepherd was the major contributor? A. Yes. 

..."" 

157These latter questions and answers, when read in context and in the light of Ms Beilby's other evidence, confirmed her evidence that it was blood and not skin cells that was the source of the deceased's DNA on the sleeve of the T-shirt. 

158Accordingly, on this basis, the expert evidence established that the deceased's blood was located on the sleeve of the T-shirt. The issue then became whether the blood was deposited there during the attack or subsequently after the discovery of the deceased's body and after the appellant entered the laundry. We consider this issue at [187] below. 

159Upon consideration, we do not accept the submission made on behalf of the appellant that it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that any DNA of the deceased on the T-shirt was from her blood. Ms Beilby's evidence, as we have stated, was to the contrary. A proper reading of her evidence went, in our opinion, well beyond stating that it was ""only a possibility"" that the DNA material was the deceased's blood on the sleeve. 

(b) The board shorts 

160Police investigators located the pair of ""NOW"" brand cream-coloured board shorts in the centre of the courtyard. There were traces of smeared blood over the front of the right thigh area and the front of the left leg area. The stains were in the nature of smears. Screening of the board shorts returned positive results for blood being that of the deceased. 

161The board shorts found in the courtyard were near a pair of underpants and sandals. There was no blood found on the sandals and there was no evidence as to when the appellant removed the shorts or the underpants which, it was accepted, belonged to him. 

162The only direct evidence that the appellant touched the deceased was in answers given by him during the course of the ERISP. Jed stated that he did not see what the appellant did when he entered the laundry after he (Jed) had sounded the alert. He saw the appellant go in and come out of the laundry but did not say that he saw him kneel or lean over the deceased's body. The evidence on this aspect is further referred to at [177] below. 

163The proposition advanced by the appellant was that any blood stains on the board shorts could have resulted from the appellant kneeling over or leaning over the deceased's body in the laundry after Jed had alerted him to its presence. 

164The answers of the appellant in the ERISP, therefore, constitute the only form of evidence of the appellant coming in close contact with the deceased by moving her hair away from her face. The defence submission was that by these means it was possible that the appellant, in the course of moving the deceased's hair, resulted in blood coming onto his hands which he then wiped on the front of his board shorts. 

(c) The claw hammer and the steam iron 

165The evidence indicated that the presence of DNA material from both the deceased and the appellant on the handle of the hammer and iron may be explicable by virtue of the fact that the claw hammer and the steam iron were household items that could have been handled by both. It is the absence of any DNA material of any third party that is at least potentially a negative fact of significance. It is, accordingly, important to examine the expert evidence given by Ms Beilby insofar as this aspect of the matter is concerned. 

166Ms Beilby was not cross-examined directly on the basis or bases upon which the absence of the DNA of any other person on the handle of the hammer or the iron could be explained, assuming that there was a third person who was involved in the attack on the deceased. 

167Ms Beilby was, at one point, asked a number of questions concerning the means by which DNA may be transferred from one person to another or to another item. In that respect, she was asked: 

Q. Yes, and you only need an amount you can't see, a microscopic amount, for a DNA transfer to take place and be there when the testing is done? A. That's right. But again it depends upon the individual. Some people seem to give up their DNA fairly easily. 

Q. Because they shed more skin cells than others? A. That is the thought behind it. And others can touch things for quite some period of time and never leave their DNA. 

Q. Sometimes people perspire more than others? A. It could be. If we are talking about hands touching, it depends on how often the hands are washed."" 

168The above cross-examination was not directed to the issue of the absence of any DNA of a third person from the handle of the hammer or the iron, but nonetheless was relied upon as evidence that meant one could not rule out the possibility that the abovementioned items were used by a third person in the murder of the deceased without the perpetrator leaving his or her DNA on the handle of either item. 

169The submission made on behalf of the appellant in this latter respect is one to be accorded due weight in terms of the possibilities. However, it should not, in our assessment, be accorded the same weight if the evidence of the expert (Ms Beilby) had been specifically directed in cross-examination to the issue concerning the handle of the hammer and the iron and she had addressed the absence of ""foreign"" DNA in that context. It was not so directed. 

(3) Some Open or Unresolved Questions 

170Trial defence counsel, and counsel for the appellant in this Court, made submissions by reference to the forensic evidence, including bloodstains and DNA evidence. The presence or absence of bloodstains on the appellant's clothing worn by him and that located on the ground in the vicinity of the deceased, requires consideration in an assessment whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the appellant to the requisite standard. Submissions were made that, if the appellant was the assailant, then greater quantities of blood would have been detected on clothing or on him. The Crown response was that there were opportunities for the appellant to wash blood from himself. 

171In assessing the evidence on this aspect, it should be kept in mind that the scene of the crime was a backyard on the edge of the township of Cobar. The Crown contention that there were opportunities for the appellant to wash, at places other than those presenting within the immediate household, should be assessed in this light. The argument can cut both ways. On the one hand, it could be said that there were limited washing facilities at 18 Harcourt Street, and that forensic examination did not disclose that blood had been washed in those areas. On the other hand, these could not be said to be the only points at which washing could occur in the area. 

172In assessing this question, we keep in mind the fact that the presence or absence of blood may be of limited use in the circumstances of the particular case. This is not an area where a level of scientific precision and certainty can be deployed to point towards, or away from, guilt. It is necessary to assess the evidence on this aspect together with all the other evidence. 

173It seems clear, and does not appear to have been disputed, that the deceased's body was moved by the assailant after she was assaulted and that, after the body came to rest, she was further assaulted. It was the Crown case that it was the appellant who moved the deceased's body. It was the unchallenged evidence of Sergeant Salmon, the Dubbo crime scene examiner, that the assailant would have had blood covering his hands. Sergeant Carnell, the Queanbeyan crime scene examiner, gave evidence to the same effect. There were no footprints, whether barefoot or shod, found in the laundry. The Crown submitted that obvious care had been taken by whoever moved the deceased not to step in the copious quantities of blood which were then upon the laundry floor. 

174As we have observed, the Crown conceded that whoever moved the deceased would have had a substantial amount of blood on his hands. When the child Jed awakened the appellant on the Friday morning having discovered his mother in the laundry, he noticed a bit of blood on the tip of the ring finger of the appellant's left hand. However, when the appellant's hands were tested for blood after his arrest, no blood was found. On the other hand, blood was found on a doona of the bed which the appellant had occupied, but testing determined that the blood was that of the appellant and not the deceased. If the blood on the appellant's ring finger was in fact blood and was that of the deceased, it is difficult to see how it would not have come off on the bedclothes whilst the appellant was asleep. But there was no evidence of any of the deceased's blood on the bedclothes of the bed on which the appellant had slept. Jed's evidence then raises these and other questions for consideration. 

175As we have indicated, the board shorts were found in the courtyard together with a pair of underpants and sandals. Both the shorts and the underpants were determined to belong to the appellant as they had his DNA upon them. It was the Crown case at trial, repeated on the appeal, that although there was no evidence as to when the appellant removed his shorts, underpants and sandals and left them outside the laundry, he must have removed those articles in preparation for returning to the laundry in order to move the deceased after he had killed her. 

176In his ERISP the appellant, at Q & A 232, stated that when he saw the deceased in the laundry after being awakened by Jed, he "" knelt down and pushed the hair away from her face a little "". When asked at Q 240 and Q 241 whether he had moved the deceased's body at all, he replied: "" No. Only had time to lean down. I moved her hair away ..."". 

177Jed, who was 12 years old at the time of the murder, and who had awakened the appellant after discovering his mother's body, said in evidence that the appellant went into the laundry/toilet and then came back out. When asked if the appellant touched his mother while she was lying on the floor, he said: "" I'm not sure, 'cause I didn't see him "". In cross-examination he said that when the appellant entered the laundry he, Jed, remained away from the door and could only see the appellant's back. He agreed that he went in and then came out. He did not say that he saw the appellant kneel or lean down over the deceased's body nor was he asked any questions which would have enabled him to confirm or deny such actions by the appellant. 

178We mention these matters for, as noted above, it was suggested on behalf of the appellant that the bloodstains on the board shorts could have occurred when the appellant knelt or lent over the deceased's body. The Crown submitted that Jed had denied seeing the appellant so acting but we do not believe his evidence supported that proposition. 

179It was not put to Jed in chief that he had not seen the appellant kneel or lean over the body and not suggested to him in cross-examination that he had. Accordingly, the possibility remains that he did and that in moving the deceased's hair away from her face he got some of her blood on his hands which he may have wiped on the front of his board shorts. Such an explanation would be consistent with the appellant's innocence about the presence of blood on his board shorts. 

180Although the evidence established that the T-shirt the appellant was wearing when he was arrested was the same T-shirt as that which he was wearing when he was awoken by Jed on the Friday morning, there was no satisfactory evidence as to whether the board shorts found in the courtyard were those which the appellant had been wearing when he was at the hotel. The only evidence pertaining to that topic was given by Mr Jason Lawrence who said that when he saw the appellant at the Grand Hotel at around 5.00-5.30 pm on Thursday 20 November 2003 he was wearing "" blue shirt, blue shorts, cargo shorts, whatever "". He agreed he had not paid much attention to what the appellant was wearing. None of the witnesses who saw the appellant at the Occidental Hotel that night were questioned at trial as to what the appellant had been wearing. 

181One difficulty facing the Crown case on this issue is that at most the evidence establishes that on the night in question the appellant was wearing blue cargo shorts whereas those which were found by the police in the courtyard and which had blood smears on them were described as cream-coloured board shorts (although we note that they appear to be light blue in the photographs of them in Exhibit E but this may simply be a product of the film used for the purpose). We have taken into account the emphasis placed by the Crown upon the deceased's blood being found upon the cream-coloured shorts, but that there was no evidence that those shorts were those being worn by the appellant on the night in question. The evidence contains a gap in this respect and, on one view of it, involves an inconsistency between the colour of the shorts which Mr Lawrence observed the appellant to be wearing early on the evening in question and the colour of those found by the police the next day. We note that the appellant accepted that the clothes he had on in bed when he was awoken on the Friday morning by Jed were also the clothes in which he was arrested three days later. 

182In its supplementary written submissions, the Crown submitted that there was no reasonable possibility that at the time he was awakened by Jed the appellant was wearing the shorts which were later found in the courtyard by the police or that those shorts were stained with blood when he entered the laundry after Jed had discovered his mother's body. It was submitted that the circumstance of the clothing being found with the blood of the deceased on them in close proximity to the laundry and the appellant's acknowledgement to the police that the clothes he was arrested in were the same clothes he was wearing when in bed, was consistent with the appellant having killed the deceased, washed all blood off himself at some suitable and nearby location in circumstances that precluded later discovery of where that occurred, changed his clothes and then retired to bed. 

183It can be accepted that the shorts the appellant was wearing at the time he was awakened by Jed and later arrested were not the shorts found by the police in the courtyard outside the laundry. However, given the evidence of Mr Jason Lawrence that he observed the appellant wearing a pair of blue cargo shorts earlier on the evening before the murder, there is no reliable evidence that the shorts found in the courtyard were those which the appellant was wearing when he left the Occidental Hotel at about 2.00 am on the night of the murder. 

184The Crown contended that the appellant must have thoroughly washed his hands to remove any trace of the deceased's blood before he went to bed on the night in question. Testing of the bathtub and otherwise in the bathroom of the house failed to locate the presence of blood. Further, dirt in the laundry tub suggested that it had not been recently used and presumptive tests for blood on the laundry taps were negative. The tap assembly outside the laundry was submitted to a biologist for examination and no blood was found. There is therefore no evidence to suggest that the appellant had washed off the deceased's blood at the scene. It was submitted by the appellant that this was difficult to reconcile with the Crown case. If the appellant had, after killing the deceased, got into bed with bloodied hands, then why is there no evidence of the deceased's blood on the bedclothes? 

185We have already made reference to the evidence of Jed who said that he saw blood on the appellant's ring finger when he followed him out to the laundry after he had been awakened. Blood was detected on the appellant's hands by the police after his arrest and found to be his own blood. It is possible that the blood seen by Jed on his hands on the morning in question was that of the deceased. However, the appellant submitted that it was improbable that the appellant managed to wash off almost all of the deceased's blood to the point that he had left none on his bedclothes but left behind a clearly visible amount of blood on his ring finger as seen by Jed. 

186The Crown's response to these submissions was that the deceased's residence at Cobar was one of a number of premises in a residential area with a quarry or mine to which the appellant had later fled some little distance away and at which the police later found water which had pooled due to rain. It was then submitted that there were, therefore, a number of alternative sources of water (apart from those at the Cobar residence) that the appellant could have used to wash off all traces of the blood of the deceased, albeit that none of those alternatives was later identified by the police as such a possible source. 

187The blood smears found on the shorts and the T-shirt could well have come from the appellant's hands brushing against his shorts and shirt. The fact that the sandals had no blood on them may be explained by the possibility that the appellant was not wearing them at the time of the assault. Given that there was none of the deceased's blood found on the bedclothes in which the appellant had slept, it must follow that, if he was the assailant, at some place he must have washed his hands before retiring to bed. There was no evidence that he did so in the laundry or at the tap outside the laundry. So he must have gone elsewhere. The fact that he left the shorts in the yard and kept the T-shirt on and did not dispose of them may be explained by the fact that at the time he was severely intoxicated and, therefore, was not thinking as clearly as he might otherwise have thought had he been sober and had had the presence of mind to hide his trail. For instance, he may have removed his shorts but inadvertently left them where they fell. His state of inebriation, although not sufficient to affect his mobility, may have been sufficient to cause him to be somewhat careless when removing himself from the scene and shedding his clothing. After all, he did not remove his T-shirt that was found to have blood of the deceased upon it. It is still somewhat of a mystery as to where he washed his hands but it is perfectly feasible that he was more concerned about washing his hands before he went off to bed than removing any blood-smeared clothing. 

188All of the above matters are, of course, part of the factual matrix of the case and are to be given full consideration along with the other evidence that went to make up the Crown case. 

Summation 

189In Hillier at 637 [46], Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ observed: 

""The case against Mr Hillier was a circumstantial case. It has often been said that a jury cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances. ... It is of critical importance to recognise, however, that in considering a circumstantial case, all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence."" 

190Their Honours also observed at 638 [48]: 

""Often enough, in a circumstantial case, there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. But neither a trial, nor on appeal, is a circumstantial case to be considered piecemeal ..."" 

191In the abovementioned paragraph, their Honours then cited dicta of Gibbs CJ and Mason J in Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521 at 535. Their Honours (at 639 [49]) observed in the circumstances of Hillier that there was evidence (such as the evidence of unidentified DNA on a pyjama top) which was consistent with Mr Hillier's innocence. Their Honours observed: 

""... But the question for the Court of Appeal was whether, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty."" 

192In considering the whole of the evidence, there are a number of matters that emerge. They include the following: 

(1) Whilst the evidence established that both the appellant and the deceased were well affected by alcohol when they left the hotel, the evidence does not go so far as to establish that the appellant was ""blind drunk"" or unable to function or find his way home. 

(2) It is in accordance with ordinary human experience that a well intoxicated person may retain capacity and ability to think and act, albeit with limitations. 

(3) The first representation made by the appellant to his brother, Scott Shepherd, was not inadmissible for all purposes. In particular, notwithstanding the principle in Lee , the evidence as to the first statement made by the appellant to Scott Shepherd would have been admissible (subject to discretionary exclusion) for a non-hearsay purpose. 

(4) The non-hearsay purpose associated with the first representation, if taken as evidence pointing against a complete loss of memory as the appellant asserted in the ERISP, goes to a fundamental issue supporting the defence, namely, an alleged inability to recall anything of significance after the deceased and he left the hotel. 

(5) The appellant's post-offence conduct, in our opinion, is consistent with a consciousness of guilt. His conduct includes the making of the suicide note which, on its proper construction, in our opinion contains an unequivocal admission of guilt. 

(6) There is, in our assessment, no plausible explanation for the appellant's extreme post-offence conduct directed to taking his own life. An inability to remember events after the appellant left the hotel could reasonably have caused him concern and anxiety having regard to the fate of the deceased. It, however, by itself does not provide a rational explanation for the appellant entertaining the idea that he may have been responsible for his wife's death to the point of deciding to take his own life. 

(7) No other fact was identified by the appellant in the ERISP which would provide such a rational explanation. 

(8) The DNA evidence, apart from the deceased's blood on the sleeve of the T-shirt, cannot be considered as unequivocal evidence implicating the appellant. However, nor does the DNA evidence provide an evidentiary basis for the possibility that an unknown person was the perpetrator of the crime. 

(9) The absence of an acceptable explanation as to how the appellant could have washed any of the deceased's blood that may have contacted his hands or as to the disposal of blood-stained clothing are matters to be taken into account in determining whether the evidence as a whole established the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 

(10) The relationship evidence does establish that there existed significant financial stressors that had led to the decision by the deceased and the appellant to move back to Cobar. The financial pressures remained a factor in that relationship up to the date of the deceased's death. 

193We return to the question to be considered by the Court. Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt, by reference to admissible evidence used permissibly, that the appellant is guilty of the murder of the deceased? As juries are told, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt every fact raised in the Crown case. Nor is it necessary for the Crown to answer every question which may be posed with respect to the Crown case. 

194The appellant's state of mind, as earlier noted, can be established in terms of timing as having occurred at least as and from the time that he picked up the knife and placed it in the pocket of his shorts. That state of mind clearly continued until he decided to come out of hiding and walked to his mother's house. 

195When Leonie Patterson directed specific questions to the appellant, his state of mind (the contemplation of suicide) had already been formed. Further, there were no words spoken by the appellant to Leonie Patterson in answer to her questions even to tell her that he had found the deceased dead in the laundry. No information as to the dreadful fate that had befallen the deceased was volunteered by the appellant in anything said by him to Ms Patterson. Again, the question arises as to whether the failure to state such an obvious fact is indicative of consciousness of guilt. 

196A further matter to be taken into account is that in the ERISP, the answers given by the appellant do not suggest that he ""freaked out"" because he thought that persons, including in particular, Leonie Patterson may have thought that he had been the perpetrator of the crime nor his fear that he would be accused of having committed the crime. Many of his answers recorded in the ERISP were simply to the effect that he ""freaked out"" or was ""scared"" because he did not know what had happened. 

197There is difficulty in concluding, as a rational explanation, that a person who had no reason to believe that he had committed the crime would take the extreme step of committing suicide based on a bare possibility that by some means and for no reason he had committed homicide. Why would the appellant consider the possibility of him having killed his wife when there was no apparent reason for him doing so? It is not in accordance with human experience that a person in the position of the appellant would commence to think he killed his partner when there was no identifiable reason to contemplate the possibility. 

198In this respect, ""the conduct"" of the appellant embraces a number of matters. The matters established in evidence convey a discernible common thread between the relevant aspects of the appellant's conduct following the death of his wife. They include: 

(1) The conduct of the appellant demonstrating reticence or reluctance to immediately call the police as suggested by Jed (the then 12 year old son of the deceased). 

(2) The appellant's conduct in taking a knife and placing it in his pocket before talking to Leonie Patterson, the deceased's sister. 

(3) The appellant's conduct when challenged by Leonie Patterson. 

(4) The appellant's conduct in running from the premises at 18 Harcourt Street before the police arrived. 

(5) The appellant's conduct in hiding in the old open-cut mine. 

(6) The appellant's actions in cutting his wrists and neck with a knife at the open-cut mine where the knife was subsequently found by police. 

(7) The appellant's conduct in hiding out in the premises at 5 Mitchell Street (the empty, unfurnished house) where he stayed until 10.20 am on Sunday 23 November 2003. In particular, his conduct at that house in making a hole in the ceiling and attaching a rope with a noose through a hole in the manhole. 

(8) The appellant's conduct at 5 Mitchell Street in writing a note on a notepad which said ""I have done the worst thing ever"" . 

(9) The appellant's responses during the course of the ERISP by which, as a matter of implication, he admitted to the possibility that he had been responsible for the death of the deceased, although maintaining throughout that he had no memory of events after leaving the New Occidental Hotel in Cobar at 2.00 am on Friday 21 November 2003. In other responses, he denied killing the deceased. 

(10) The appellant's conduct in writing and sending a card to his mother which contained a poem which he wished to be read by his children and which included the line, ""One big night out, what a terrible cost"" . 

199In summary, the Crown case, to a significant extent, relied first upon the proposition that the appellant's conduct, identified above, was evidence of consciousness of guilt and, secondly, upon the proposition that the ""suicide note"" (point (8) above) contained within it an admission that he had acted to bring about the death of the deceased, the statement being ""I have done the worst thing ever"" . 

200Apart from the question of whether the evidence was capable of constituting an admission that the appellant had killed the deceased, there is a question as to whether other evidence in which he stated that he had no memory of events accompanied by statements to the effect that he was not able to deny that he had been the perpetrator of the crime, contained an implication that he was at least admitting to the possibility that he was the perpetrator of the crime. 

201The evidence referred to at [192] is to be evaluated against the absence of any evidence of expressions of horror or outrage by the appellant upon discovery of the deceased's body. As against that, there is to be taken into account and assessed the possibility that the appellant was stunned or so taken aback by what he saw that he fell into a silent state. 

202In determining whether for the purpose of s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred, an essential part of the Court's task turns on the question as to whether the evidence as to the conduct of the appellant (in the respects referred to in [198] above) was sufficiently cogent, taken in context with the other evidence in the Crown case, to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed the offence charged. In other words, whilst there are, as discussed above, some unanswered questions, the issue is whether the conduct of the appellant is compelling, in the sense that it is, in the context of a circumstantial evidence case, evidence of such significant probative value as to satisfy the requisite standard. 

Conclusion 

203In our view, the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellant for the murder of the deceased. There is a strong circumstantial case against the appellant, supported by a clear admission of guilt in the suicide note. Having regard to the totality of the evidence, the appellant's claim of having no memory of events is not plausible. 

204To the extent that it has been submitted that there is a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence based on the possible involvement of a third party as the assailant, or aspects of the evidence which raise questions as to whether the appellant was the assailant, we express our positive satisfaction that the Crown has proved the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 

205In reaching this view, we have considered the evidence bearing upon the second real issue in the trial - if it is proved that the appellant struck the blows to the deceased, did he do so with intent to kill or intent to cause grievous bodily harm? We have considered the evidence concerning the appellant's intoxication in this respect. That evidence includes the evidence of persons who were drinking with him and the deceased at the hotel, the appellant's conversations and movements, the observations of him walking away from the hotel at about 2.00 am and his own account in the ERISP of what he did, said and saw at the hotel before he left to head home with his partner. We are satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant had the requisite intent when he struck the deceased. Like Hoeben J in his remarks on sentence, we are satisfied to the criminal standard that the appellant acted with intent to cause grievous bodily harm: R v Shepherd [2006] NSWSC 799 at [50]-[55]. The number of blows struck to the head with two separate weapons, albeit with the use of moderate force, clearly establishes this level of intention. 

206Applying the test in Weiss , we are satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. The evidence properly admitted at trial proves beyond reasonable doubt the appellant's guilt. Having expressed this view, the Crown has established that the proviso to s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act should be applied, with the consequence that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 

207Although we would grant an extension of time for the appellant to appeal against conviction, and grant leave under Rule 4 for him to rely upon Ground of Appeal 2, we would dismiss the appeal. 

208For the foregoing reasons, we make the following orders: 

(1) Extend time for the filing of a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal up to and including 3 December 2010; 

(2) To the extent necessary, grant leave to the appellant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 to argue Ground of Appeal 2; 

(3) Appeal dismissed.

2758227,R v Agius; R v Abibadra; R v Jandagi; R v Zerafa [2011] NSWSC 1388,"Judgment 

1The four accused are charged with two counts of conspiracy: the first, to defraud the Commonwealth; the second to dishonestly cause a loss to the Commonwealth. The circumstances in which they are charged with two offences (which despite slight difference in language, are essentially the same) are set out in Agius v R, Abibadra v R, Jandagi v R, Zerafa v R [2011] NSWSC 367; on appeal, [2011] NSWCCA 119. 

2On the indictment it is alleged that the first offence was committed between about 1 January 1997 and about 23 May 2001, and the second between about 24 May 2001 and about 10 April 2008. I was told during the course of interlocutory matters that it is expected that the end date of the second charge will be altered to 24 October 2006. 

3The trial is expected to commence on 5 March 2012, with an estimated duration of in excess of three months. A very large amount of documentary material proposed to be tendered in the Crown case has been served, together with extensive witness statements. The parties have engaged in discussion and negotiation concerning the evidence, but, in respect of some matters, objections have been notified on behalf of the accused but have not been the subject of agreement. Accordingly, the parties have, pursuant to s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), sought pre-trial rulings. This judgment is concerned with those evidentiary matters. 

4Although I have some familiarity with the general nature of the Crown case, I have not to date been provided with the material in its entirety. Such rulings as I have given, and am about to give, have been made in that context: accordingly, I made it clear that, in general, these rulings will be available for reconsideration as the evidence emerges, and as the picture becomes clearer. What follows are my views on the admissibility of certain items of evidence in the light of my present understanding of the Crown case, and represent the rulings I propose to make in the absence of altered circumstances. 

5Of course, it is always possible that witnesses will give evidence not precisely in accordance with their statements and that, too, should it occur, may call for reconsideration. 

6Before I turn to the issues for present determination, it is necessary to set out, as briefly as possible, the background as contended for by the Crown. I emphasise that what follows is an account of the Crown case as I understand it, and does not and cannot represent any findings of fact. 

Background 

7At relevant times three of the accused, Ms Carol Abibadra, Ms Deborah Jandagi, and Mr Kevin Zerafa, were accountants who worked, either as employees or partners, in a firm of accountants (Owen T Daniel & Co - hereafter ""OTD""), the principal of which was Mr Owen Trevor Daniel. Mr Daniel, who is named in the indictment as an alleged co-conspirator, is dead. It will be convenient to refer to Ms Abibadra, Ms Jandagi and Mr Zerafa collectively as ""the OTD accused"". 

8Mr Agius is resident in Vanuatu, and is involved in a number of companies registered in that country. He was an acquaintance, or associate, of Mr Daniel. 

9An arrangement (""the Scheme"") was devised by Mr Agius, or at least promoted by him, pursuant to which client companies of OTD were invited to ""minimise"" (""evade"") tax. The arrangement involved companies controlled by Mr Agius invoicing the OTD client companies for ""consultancy services"", the invoices being paid by the OTD client companies, and recorded and claimed for taxation purposes, as deductible expenses. No consultancy services were, or were intended to be, provided. The invoices were false. The claims for deduction were fraudulent. The Scheme involved money paid by the OTD client companies being returned to them (subject to a deduction for ""management""), but entered in their records as loans. Again, this was false. The ""loans"" were never intended to be repaid, and represented a return of the funds provided in so-called payment of the false invoices. (There were many more steps involved in the Scheme than is contained in the above sketch, which merely purports to establish an outline of the Scheme. Nor was it always the case that the false deductible expenses were attributed to consultancy services; on at least one occasion, a fabricated insurance policy was created.) 

10As I presently understand the Crown case, it is that Mr Agius maintained overall supervision and management of the scheme - and his companies collected the ""management fees"". 

11The evidence to be adduced by the Crown falls into a number of categories. It includes a large amount of documentary material, being financial and banking records identifying the chains of payments, and email and other communications. It will also include oral evidence from various directors or executives of the OTD client companies (many, if not all or most, of whom have been charged, pleaded guilty, and sentenced). 

12Against that background I deal now with those documents to which specific objection has been taken. Many more objections were notified than those which follow. The parties have sensibly resolved many issues among themselves; others were resolved in the course of argument; in some cases, I delivered ex tempore rulings. The following items are those that remained, after argument, for determination. The company name which heads each of the following items is the name of the OTD client company to which the evidence relates. 

1. Australian Safety Specialists Pty Limited (""ASS""). 

13The principals of ASS were David Waller and Philip Waller. They began participating in the Scheme in about April 1998. 

14The single document in relation to ASS to which objection is now taken on behalf of Mr Agius (but not on behalf of the OTD accused) is the print of a chain of four emails of 6 and 7 October 2004, between an employee of OTD (Ms Georgina Kalache, who has not provided a statement, but who the Crown anticipates calling as a witness), Ms Jandagi and Mr Zerafa. Each email bears the subject line: 

""Returned your call Debbie: Ken Matwejev on [mobile phone number] ... he would like to talk to you"". 

In the second email of this chain, sent by Ms Jandagi to Mr Zerafa and Ms Kalache, Ms Jandagi refers to a client (unnamed, but it may be assumed to have been Mr Matwejev) asking about setting up an offshore company, and proposes a meeting with ""Robert"". (There is no dispute that ""Robert"" is Mr Agius.) 

In the next email, Mr Zerafa asks Ms Kalache to ""keep a list of clients which want to see Robert next time he is here."" He provided three names of individuals and one of a company to be included on the list. Against that are handwritten eight or nine names, one of which is crossed out. It is not known who handwrote the names, or when. One of the names is ""Phil Waller"", another is ""Toni Hili"". Mr Hili was also, on the Crown case, involved in companies that participated in the scheme, and was prosecuted. Other names are of individuals who do not feature in the Crown case. That, as I understand it, was the basis of the objection taken on behalf of Mr Agius. The objection was expressed in the following way, as recorded in the transcript of argument: 

""We don't know whose writing it is? More importantly, there are an assembly of names about which we know very little. There is a reference to an appointment. Unless one assumes that everything Mr Agius said and did was criminally inclined or pursuant to a conspiracy, one has to look at the documents assuming, with respect, his innocence. The Crown seems to be turning this on its head. For all we know, there is no evidence to the contrary, these visits were or the visits contemplated here were for entirely innocent purposes."" 

The objection was characterised as one of relevance. 

15I am satisfied that the document is relevant and has probative value, and that the inclusion of the names of individuals that are not expected to feature in the evidence is unlikely to cause any prejudice. Certainly the reference to Mr Waller and Mr Hili is of significance. If it were to appear that the inclusion of other names was the occasion of prejudice, consideration could be given to excising those names, although that suggestion was not embraced by senior counsel. 

16I will admit this document. 

2. Gladesville Bridge Marina Pty Limited 

17The directors of Gladesville Bridge Marina were Mr Philip and Ms Eva Southcombe. Mr and Ms Southcombe became involved in the Scheme in about March 1998. The documents to which objection is taken on behalf of all accused are copies of two newspaper articles, published on, respectively, 15 February 2003, under the heading ""Tax Office Eyes Dodgy Vanuatu Tax Schemes"", and 13 June 2005, under the heading ""Big End of Town Caught in Tax Raids"". 

18The first article commences: 

""Australian authorities are targeting a swag of tax avoidance schemes operating in Vanuatu, the Tax Commissioner, Michael Carmody, revealed yesterday, as Labor accused the Federal Government of inaction in the face of a proliferation of offshore tax havens"". 

It went on to say: 

""In Vanuatu's case, about half of the $295 million that left Australia last financial year for the South Pacific island state came from small business taxpayers. 

About 2,000 Australian residents were involved in the schemes, Mr Carmody said. This is an area where we have some concerns with promoters of schemes,' he said. One of the Vanuatu scams was a so-called debit-credit card scheme."" 

19The second article had a subheading: 

""$300 m offshore schemes exposed"" 

This article referred to ""raids"" on multiple homes and offices in four states of Australia, some in Sydney. It then quoted the then Minister for Justice describing the offshore operations the subject of the ""raids"" as ""a massive attempt to evade tax"". The Minister was then quoted as saying: 

""The Crime Commission said in some cases deductions were claimed for payment for fictitious expenses and services, while in others, income derived overseas was not accounted for in Australia. The Tax Office said the income was secretly returned to Australia disguised as a loan, an inheritance, a gift, or through credit and debit cards."" 

Later in the article, it was claimed that two of the ""Sydneysiders"" involved in the investigation were: 

"" ... a prominent lawyer and an accountant. The lawyer works at a large law firm and the accountant has his own practice."" 

20The objections to these articles are said to be based on ""relevance, hearsay and unfair prejudice"". The last is a reference to s 137 of the Evidence Act . 

21It is clear that each article contains some material that is significantly prejudicial to the accused. It is equally clear that, on their own, they could not remotely be considered to be admissible. 

22However, the Crown contends that they become admissible when regard is had to other evidence. It does not suggest that they ought to be accepted as evidence of the truth of what is asserted therein. The other evidence that, on the Crown case, makes them admissible is the evidence of Ms Eva Southcombe. In her statement Ms Southcombe states that she saw the first article and was concerned that it might be a reference to the Scheme in which she was involved. She telephoned Ms Jandagi, who assured her that the article had nothing to do with Mr Agius or his company. 

23When Ms Southcombe saw the second article, she was again concerned that it referred to the Scheme in which she and her husband were involved. She emailed the article to Mr Agius (apparently without comment). He replied on the same day in the following terms: 

""Thanks Eva 
I believe you are doing the right thing paying back the loan. 
Kind regards 
Rob"" 

Ms Southcombe also says that she subsequently had a conversation with Mr Agius in which he said: 

"" ... this has got nothing to do with us. What we are doing is not related to this at all. You certainly don't need to worry about it."" 

24The Crown submits that the articles are made admissible by the responses of Ms Jandagi and Mr Agius, when the articles were brought to their attention. 

25I accept that, in that context, they have some probative value, although the weight they can or will carry I am not in a position at this stage to ascertain. I also accept, as I pointed out in argument, that the articles are capable of conveying significant prejudice. It would be possible to ameliorate that prejudice by agreement between the parties to a form of words that would explain to the jury that Ms Southcombe raised with Ms Jandagi and with Mr Agius the existence of newspaper articles concerning tax avoidance or evasion schemes in Vanuatu (and elsewhere), in such a form as to enable the jury to understand the responses made in each case. While senior counsel for the OTD accused was willing to entertain that suggestion, senior counsel for Mr Agius was not. It is not a compromise that I can impose upon an unwilling party, and it is, therefore, necessary to rule on the objection. 

26I am satisfied that in the overall context of the Crown case, the responses are of sufficient importance to warrant their admission, and that they can only be explained by the jury being made aware of what was the subject of the communication in each case by Ms Southcombe. I am also satisfied that the jury will be able to be directed and to understand that the articles are not evidence of the truth of what is contained in them, but that they are merely admitted to enable them to consider the responses made. In the circumstances I will admit those articles. It remains open to the parties to agree on a means of explaining the responses that does not involve the tender of the articles themselves. 

27I add, for completeness, that the Crown tendered a further article, dated 18 June 2005, under the headline ""Top Names in Tax Haven Client Lists"". While that article also is apparently about tax avoidance (or evasion) and an investigation of the kind that led to the present proceedings, it appears to be remote from the issues now under consideration. Further, although Ms Southcombe said that she emailed that article, too, to Mr Agius, there is no evidence of any response by him. I accordingly rejected the third article. 

3. Hunter Civil and Hire Limited (""HCH"") 

28HCH was formed in August or September 1999 in circumstances that need not be explored or explained. Mr Geoffrey Daley was, at one point the sole director, and later one of three directors. HCH became involved with OTD and was introduced to the scheme in July 2000. Mr Zerafa was the accountant who managed its affairs. 

29In 2001 an associated company (Hydro-Magda Pty Limited) purported to take out a ""key man"" insurance policy with a company called Southern Hemisphere Insurances Limited, registered in Vanuatu. Although a ""Certificate of Cover"" was issued, there was in fact no policy, and three payments, each of $200,000, were returned to Hydro-Magda. 

30The only document to which objection is taken is a letter dated 25 June 2002, on the letterhead of Southern Hemisphere Insurances Limited, addressed to Hydro-Magda, purporting to confirm receipt of ""the delayed payment"" of $200,000 as the first premium instalment. 

31The handwritten notation on the letter reads: 

"" Paid 
Then (?) Policy Cancelled"" 

32The objection is that the source of the handwriting cannot be identified and the circumstances, and the time, in which it came to be placed on the document are unknown. 

33The notation is substantially in accordance with the evidence anticipated to be led from Mr Daley. The Crown submits that the letter, including the handwritten notation, is admissible because it can be established that it was among documents seized from the offices of OTD, and it is therefore admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule ( Evidence Act s 59) pursuant to s 69 as a business record. 

34In my opinion, in the absence of any indication as to the circumstances in which, and by whom, the notation was inserted, the provisions of s 69 are not met. Fundamental to s 69 is that the representation made or recorded in the business record is made or recorded for the purposes of the business. 

35Moreover, subs (2) provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to a relevant document if the representation was made by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the fact asserted, or on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by such a person. In my opinion those conditions are not met and the notation is not admissible. 



4. Evidence derived from telecommunication intercepts . 

36The evidence here in question is recordings and transcripts taken of conversations between Mr Agius and other individuals (not the OTD accused) in 2007. As I have indicated, the Crown proposes to amend the draft indictment by specifying, as the end date of the conspiracy, 24 October 2006. This was the date on which search warrants were executed on the offices of OTD. 

37Accordingly, objection is taken on behalf of the OTD accused. The Crown presses the evidence on the basis that it is admissible, pursuant to s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act as evidence disclosing the existence, nature and scope of the conspiracy alleged. 

38Section 87(1)(c) appears under the heading ""Submissions made with Authority"" and is in the following terms: 

""87(1) For the purpose of determining whether a previous representation made by a person is also taken to be an admission by a party, the court is to admit the representation if it is reasonably open to find that: 
(a) ...; or 
(b) ..., or 
(c) the representation was made by the person in furtherance of a common purpose (whether lawful or not) that the person had with the party or one or more persons including the party."" 

39The provision is said to be a statutory enactment of the common law ""co-conspirator's rule"": see Ahern v The Queen [1988] HCA 39; 165 CLR 87 at 94-95, 100, 104; R v Chai (1992) 27 NSWLR 153 at 191; R v Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 465-6, all cited in Regina (C'weath) v Baladjam [No 19] [2008] NSWSC 1441 per Whealy J (as his Honour then was). 

40The Crown proposes to use this section to admit various representations made by Mr Agius as admissions by one or more of the OTD accused. To apply it specifically to the circumstances, the provision could be restated as follows: 

""For the purpose of determining whether a previous representation made by [Mr Agius] is also taken to be an admission by [one or more of the OTD accused] the court is to admit the representation if it is reasonably open to find that: 

... 

(c) the representation was made by [Mr Agius] in furtherance of a common purpose (whether lawful or not) that [Mr Agius] had with [one or more of the OTD accused] or one or more persons including [one or more of the OTD accused]."" 

41I have concluded that reliance on Baladjam by the Crown is misconceived. In Baladjam , Whealy J had under consideration the question of the admissibility of evidence of individuals said to have been party to the same conspiracy, although not on trial in the same proceedings. The question was whether representations made by them could be admitted against those who were on trial. What distinguishes that case from this is that those representations were made in the course of the conspiracy and during its alleged currency. Whealy J held that, in those circumstances, it was not necessary that the representation be found to have been made in furtherance of the common purpose. 

42That is not this case. All of the representations attributed to Mr Agius derived from the telephone intercepts are representations that post date, by a considerable time, the end date of the alleged conspiracy. They could not be held to have been made ""in furtherance of a common purpose"" that Mr Agius had with any of the OTD accused. 

43That evidence will not be admitted against the OTD accused. 





5. Evidence of conduct of any accused after 23 May 2001 in relation to count 1 in the indictment. 

44As I have indicated above, count 1 alleges conspiracy to defraud between 1 January 1997 and 23 May 2001; count 2 will allege conspiracy dishonestly to cause loss or a risk of loss to the Commonwealth between 24 May 2001 and 24 October 2006. 

45The proposition advanced on behalf of all accused in this respect is that, the offence alleged in count 1 having come to an end on 23 May 2001, any evidence of their conduct subsequent to that date is not admissible to substantiate that count. 

46The argument harks back to the argument that was resolved against all accused in the Court of Criminal Appeal decision to which I have earlier referred, Agius & Ors v R [2001] NSWCCA 119. (Special leave to appeal refused by the High Court on 15 June 2011, [2011] HCA Trans 171.) 

47The circumstances can be briefly recapitulated. The Crown alleges that all accused took part in a single conspiracy, that commenced on or about 1 January 1997 and came to an end on or about 24 October 2006. The only reason that two counts are prosecuted is that, on 24 May 2001, the legislation governing conduct of the kind alleged changed. Prior to that date the relevant provisions were s 86(1) and s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). From that date, the relevant legislation was s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code 1995. The same conduct was criminalised by two different, but consecutive, statutes. It is a necessary consequence of the outcome of the previous proceedings that all of the evidence relevant to one count will be admissible in relation to the other count. 

48Although the argument as to admissibility was put in relation to all accused, the oral argument focussed upon the position of Mr Zerafa. It was submitted that evidence of conduct or events after 2001 could not fairly be used against him because of his age. He was born in 1975 and was 22 years of age at the date of the commencement of what is alleged to have been the conspiracy; evidence of conduct that occurred four or five years later could not be used to throw light upon his conduct or state of mind at that young age. 

49Despite my urging, there was no identification of any particular piece of evidence that could be shown to operate unfairly against Mr Zerafa in this way. 

50Even if the point ultimately turned out to be a good one (about which I have grave reservations) it is, I have concluded, premature to decide it. It was not submitted that any of the evidence would be inadmissible in the trial that will take place. The argument concerns what use the jury will be permitted to make of any particular aspect of the evidence. That is a matter much better determined when the evidence is complete and the entire mosaic can be seen. If there is any evidence that would operate unfairly against Mr Zerafa, or against any other accused, for the reason given (or for any other reason) appropriate directions will be given to the jury. 

51The more general point, that the evidence in respect of the two charges ought to be delineated by reference to the date of the conduct the subject of the evidence, cannot be accepted. As I have said, what is alleged is a single conspiracy, and there is no reason to make the delineation proposed.

2758237,Chevalley v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 357,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: 

Background 

The applicants, Grahame Anthony Chevalley (""Mr Chevalley"") and Hilton Ross Grugeon (""Mr Grugeon"") were directors of Hunter Quarries Pty Ltd (""the company""). The company owned and operated a quarry, Karuah Quarry, at which material for use in the construction industry was extracted. The company also owned the fixed plant equipment of the quarry including two off-road dump trucks. On 14 June 2005, one of the trucks went over an embankment at the quarry. As a result the driver of the truck, a Mr Darren Smith, was killed. Mr Smith was an employee of the company. 

2As a result of the incident the company was charged and pleaded guilty to an offence under s 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (""the Act""). Another director of the company, Mr Richard Badior, also pleaded guilty to charges under s 8(1) and s 26 of the Act. 

3On 5 June 2007, the first respondent made an application for an order that Mr Chevalley failed to ensure the health and safety at work of the company's employees, particularly Mr Smith, contrary to s 8(1) of the Act. The application stated that Mr Chevalley was taken to have contravened s 8(1) by virtue of s 26(1) of the Act. 

4On 7 June 2007, Staunton J made an order in proceedings IRC 956 of 2007 ordering Mr Chevalley to appear to answer the charges. 

5On 5 June 2007, a similar order was sought against Mr Grugeon and on 7 June 2007, Staunton J made a similar order in proceedings IRC 957 of 2007. 

6By notices of motion dated 12 February 2010 filed in the Industrial Court, each of Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon sought orders that the proceedings brought against them be dismissed or permanently stayed. As a consequence, a number of questions of law were referred by Backman J to the Full Bench of the Industrial Court under s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and s 196 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996. By notice of motion dated 30 March 2010, Mr Chevalley sought to add an additional question on the constitutional validity of s 26 of the Act, which Backman J ordered be added to the previous list as Question 7. The questions finally referred to the Full Bench were as follows (footnotes omitted): 

""1. Does the Court, in consequence of an application made during defended proceedings for offences charged pursuant to the Occupational Health & Safety Act 2000 (NSW), have jurisdiction to determine each of the following questions? 

If the answer to the first question is yes: 

2. Are the charges stated in the Applications for an Order in Matter Numbers 956 and 957 of 2007 so lacking in identification of the essential elements of the offence that they do not attract the jurisdiction of the Court? 

3. Are the charges stated in the Applications in Matter Numbers 956 and 957 of 2007 invalid, null or void because: 

(a) the Prosecutor has failed to plead or specify the essential ingredients or elements of an offence against ss 8(1) and 26 of the Occupational Health & Safety Act 2000 (NSW)? and/or: 

(b) the Prosecutor has failed to specify the essential factual particulars of an offence against ss 8(1) and 26 of the Occupational Health & Safety Act 2000 (NSW)? 

4. If the answer to question 3(a) and/or (b) is yes, did the Court make valid Orders requiring the attendance of each of the defendants in Matter Numbers 956 and 957 of 2007? 

5. If the answer to questions 2 and/or 3(a) and/or (b) is yes and/or the answer to question 4 is no, does the Court have jurisdiction: 

(a) to quash the Orders; 

(b) to strike-out or dismiss the proceedings; 

(c) in the circumstances of the present cases, to stay permanently the proceedings; 

(d) to make a declaration that the defendants have no further obligation to attend the Court? 

6. Does the Court have jurisdiction to hear and determine any application by the Prosecutor to amend the charges to amend any defect. 

7. Is s 26 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) invalid because it violates the principles that underlie Chapter III of the Commonwealth Constitution?"" 

7The Full Bench answered Question 1 in the affirmative but answered Questions 2 and 3 in the negative. As a consequence Questions 4, 5 and 6 did not arise. The Full Bench answered Question 7 in the negative. 

8The Full Bench also rejected the submission made by Mr Chevalley that s 26 of the Act was constitutionally invalid. 

9By a summons filed on 15 October 2010, Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon sought orders removing the records of the Full Bench of the Industrial Court (""the Full Bench"") in respect of proceedings IRC 956 of 2007 and IRC 957 of 2007 (""the proceedings"") into this Court; an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the orders made by the Industrial Court in the proceedings on 7 June 2007 and 9 October 2008 (the latter being an amendment of the order against Mr Grugeon originally made on 7 June 2007), and an order in the nature of prohibition restraining the respondents from taking any further steps in the proceedings. 

10As they emerged, the grounds on which relief was sought may be summarised as follows: 

(a) The application for orders that the applicants appear to answer charges were bad in law by reason of the failure to particularise the steps which the applicants should have taken by way of due diligence to prevent the contravention of s 8(1) of the Act by the company. 

(b) Related to the first ground the charges were bad as they failed to particularise any act or omission of the applicants which constituted the offence. 

(c) Section 26 of the Act was invalid because ""it violated the principles that underlie Chapter III of the Constitution "". 

11The applicants also sought to amend their summons to claim that s 105 of the Act, which at the time conferred jurisdiction to hear the proceedings on the Industrial Relations Commission in Court Session (""the Industrial Court""), was invalid as the insertion of s 146C into the Industrial Relations Act had the effect of fundamentally impairing the independence of the members of the Industrial Relations Commission, including its judicial members in the Industrial Court, as a consequence of which the Commission could not be ""a repository for the exercise of judicial determination of criminal culpability consistently with the national integrated system for which Ch III of the Constitution of the Commonwealth provides"". Leave to amend the summons was refused for the reasons set out subsequently in this judgment. 

The charges and further procedural history 

12The charges against each of Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon are in similar form. They alleged a contravention of s 8(1) of the Act arising by operation of s 26(1). The charges contained particulars of the contravention by the company. No complaint is made about those particulars. The charge against Mr Chevalley, however, only provided the following particulars relating to the offence alleged to have been committed by him: 

""A. At all relevant times the Defendant was a Director of the corporation; and 

B. At all relevant times the Defendant was concerned in the management of the corporation, as the Managing Director of the corporation."" 

13The particulars of the charge against Mr Grugeon were identical except in his case it was alleged he was ""concerned in the management of the corporation, inter alia as chairman of the Board of Directors of the corporation"", rather than its Managing Director. 

14On 7 October 2008, the trial in respect of the charges against Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon, together with the trial of the charges against the company and Mr Badior, commenced. On the third day of the trial the company and Mr Badior pleaded guilty to the charges against them, although they did not admit all the facts alleged by the prosecutor as relevant to sentencing. It was agreed by the company, Mr Badior and the prosecutor that the trial judge, Backman J, would determine the matters in dispute whilst Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon agreed that they would be bound by the factual findings of her Honour. The proceedings against Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon were adjourned until 15 February 2010. 

15During the course of the hearing of the summons the court was supplied with a document setting out the facts agreed by the parties. A copy of this document is attached to this judgment. Further, in her judgment on the sentencing hearing, Backman J made a number of further factual findings (see [2009] NSWIRComm 179 at [222]). 

16Neither party placed any particular reliance on these factual findings. The respondents did not contend that these findings obviated the need to supply the particulars sought by Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon if they were otherwise entitled to them. Similarly, Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon did not accept that the agreed facts or Backman J's further factual findings affected one way or the other their entitlement to the particulars sought. 

The legislation 

17It is convenient to set out the relevant provisions of the Act (as they were at the relevant time): 
"" 8 Duties of employers 

(1) Employees 

An employer must ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all the employees of the employer. 

That duty extends (without limitation) to the following: 

(a) ensuring that any premises controlled by the employer where the employees work (and the means of access to or exit from the premises) are safe and without risks to health, 

(b) ensuring that any plant or substance provided for use by the employees at work is safe and without risks to health when properly used, 

(c) ensuring that systems of work and the working environment of the employees are safe and without risks to health, 

(d) providing such information, instruction, training and supervision as may be necessary to ensure the employees' health and safety at work, 

(e) providing adequate facilities for the welfare of the employees at work. 

... 

12 Penalty for offence against this Division 

A person who contravenes, whether by act or omission, a provision of this Division is guilty of an offence against that provision and is liable to the following maximum penalty: 

(a) in the case of a corporation (being a previous offender) - 7,500 penalty units, or 

(b) in the case of a corporation (not being a previous offender) - 5,000 penalty units, or 

(c) in the case of an individual (being a previous offender) - 750 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both, or 

(d) in the case of an individual (not being a previous offender) - 500 penalty units. 

... 

26 Offences by corporations - liability of directors and managers 

(1) If a corporation contravenes, whether by act or omission, any provision of this Act or the regulations, each director of the corporation, and each person concerned in the management of the corporation, is taken to have contravened the same provision unless the director or person satisfies the court that: 

(a) he or she was not in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation in relation to its contravention of the provision, or 

(b) he or she, being in such a position, used all due diligence to prevent the contravention by the corporation. 

(2) A person may be proceeded against and convicted under a provision pursuant to subsection (1) whether or not the corporation has been proceeded against or been convicted under that provision. 

(3) Nothing in subsection (1) prejudices or affects any liability imposed by a provision of this Act or the regulations on any corporation by which an offence against the provision is actually committed. 

(4) In the case of a corporation that is a local council, a member of the council (in his or her capacity as such a member) is not to be regarded as a director or person concerned in the management of the council for the purposes of this section. 

... 

28 Defence 

It is a defence to any proceedings against a person for an offence against a provision of this Act or the regulations if the person proves that: 

(a) it was not reasonably practicable for the person to comply with the provision, or 

(b) the commission of the offence was due to causes over which the person had no control and against the happening of which it was impracticable for the person to make provision."" 

The construction of the legislation 

18As has been said by the High Court on a number of occasions, the first step in assessing the constitutional validity of a given law is one of construction of the relevant legislation: Gyspy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v Commissioner of Police [2008] HCA 4; (2008) 234 CLR 532 at [11]; Hogan v Hinch [2011] HCA 4; (2011) 85 ALJR 398 at [5]. Further, in the present case each of the alternative submissions made by the applicants depends to a large extent on the construction given to s 26 of the Act and its associated sections. 

The applicants ' submission on the construction issues 

19In his written submissions, Mr Chevalley addressed the construction issue only to a limited extent. He submitted that s 26 deprived the directors of a ""real and reasonable chance to place the real facts before the Court for determination of the issue"" of the director's guilt (citing Williamson v Ah On (1926) 39 CLR 95 at 117). He submitted that the defences provided for under s 28 were not available to the directors. In support of his argument that s 26 was invalid he submitted that once the question of whether a person was validly appointed a director or was concerned in management was answered, the legislature did the rest of the work leaving to the courts only the power to determine the penalty. He submitted that the case law demonstrated that s 26(1)(a) and s 26(1)(b) have no real work to do. 

20On the hearing of the appeal, counsel for Mr Chevalley contended for a somewhat different interpretation submitting that a due diligence defence in s 26 involved a consideration of what was reasonable in the circumstances. He accepted that if his construction was correct, much of his argument relating to the constitutional validity of the section fell away, but submitted that the expression ""all due diligence"" had been interpreted by the Industrial Court to mean ""in effect to do everything to ensure"", thereby rendering the defence illusory. He submitted that the conviction rate in prosecutions brought in reliance on s 26 was 97 percent, a submission which I did not consider particularly helpful. 

21Counsel for Mr Grugeon adopted a different approach. His primary submission was that s 12 of the Act created the relevant offence. That section, he submitted, required an act or omission by the contravening person. In the present case the charge did not specify any act or omission on the part of Mr Grugeon. It followed that the charge was bad in law as without the omission being properly identified, the defences in s 26 could not properly be relied upon and they would be rendered nugatory. He submitted that to the extent the requirement of an act or omission in s 12 conflicted with s 26, any conflict should be resolved in favour of the accused and that s 26 should not be read as meaning that the corporation's breach is ipso facto also the director's breach or that a director is taken to be guilty without any specific act or omission on his or her part. He submitted that culpability or a crime absent any act or omission on the part of the person is not a crime known to law. 

22Each of the applicants submitted that the better view was that a defence under s 28 was not available to a director who was sought to be made liable by virtue of s 26 of the Act. However, counsel for Mr Grugeon acknowledged that to the extent the company's contravention was an issue in the proceedings against the director, reliance could be placed on s 28 in resisting the allegations of contravention by the employer company. Further, counsel for Mr Grugeon said that even in circumstances where the employer corporation previously pleaded guilty to the relevant offences, the prosecution still had to prove contravention by that corporation beyond reasonable doubt. Counsel for Mr Chevalley by contrast submitted that contravention by the employer corporation could be proven in those circumstances by the tender of a certificate of conviction under s 178(1) of the Evidence Act 1995. 

The respondents ' submissions 

23The first respondent, in his written submissions, described s 26 as an example of an offence where a person is deemed to be liable as a principal for a contravention because of that individual's role and status in the management of the body corporate, unless he or she establishes one of the facts identified in s 26(1)(a) or s 26(1)(b) of the Act. 

24The first respondent in common with the applicants also submitted that where no prosecution of the corporation has taken place, the defendant director may invoke the s 28 defence to demonstrate that the corporation has not contravened the Act. In his written submissions he acknowledged that this proposition may be inconsistent with a judgment of the Full Bench of the Industrial Court in Morrison v Powercoal Pty Limited [2004] NSWIRComm 297 at [159]. However, in circumstances where the corporation has previously pleaded guilty to the offence he seemed to submit that the contravention could be established by the tender of a certificate of conviction. 

25The first respondent also submitted that an act or omission for the purpose of s 12 was the act or omission of the employer. 

26So far as s 28 of the Act was otherwise concerned, the first respondent submitted that it had no application to a charge against a director (other than as described in par [24] above), as the director did not answer the description of a person charged for an offence under a provision of the Act. In that regard he relied on Morrison v Powercoal Pty Limited supra at [163]. 

27The third respondent made no submissions on the construction issue. 

Consideration 

28The first most critical issue of construction is the scope of the defences provided for by s 26. In my opinion, the defences in s 26 are not illusory either as a matter of construction nor as interpreted by the Industrial Court. 

29Section 26(1)(a) raises the issue of whether as a matter of fact the director or person concerned in management who has been charged was in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation in relation to the contravention. The answer to that question will depend both on the particular contravention and the particular position held by the defendant. The subsection assumes that in some cases both directors and particular persons concerned with management will not be in a position to influence the corporation in relation to the contravention. Each case will depend on its own facts, but it is self-evident that in relation to some contraventions the ability to influence the corporation will depend on the particular position held, for example, a works manager or a chief executive officer compared to a chief financial officer or a non-executive director. 

30Second, s 26(1)(b) requires in my opinion, that the charged director or person concerned in management demonstrates that he or she has carried out the due diligence appropriate to a person in his or her position to prevent the contravention. Thus, where the contravention arose as a result of systemic failure some officers may well be liable for the failure to undertake due diligence to ensure that a proper system was in place to prevent such a failure. By contrast, such a person may not be liable in the case of an isolated instance caused by a failure to follow an appropriate workplace system. If the charged person had taken all reasonable steps appropriate to his or her position to ensure the system was in place and would not be breached, he or she would not be liable. The question will, of course, depend on the facts established in each particular case. 

31Further, contrary to the assertion of counsel for Mr Chevalley, the Industrial Court has not construed s 26 in such a way as to render the defence illusory. 

32In Kumar v Ritchie [2006] NSWIRComm 323 and Inspector Aldred v Herbert [2007] NSWIRComm 170, the Industrial Court adopted an interpretation of s 26 which provided some support for the contention of Mr Chevalley that the defence was illusory. In those cases the Industrial Court held that in considering the position of directors for the purpose of s 26(1)(a) the Court was entitled to assume that their influence extended to all detailed matters concerning the operation of the business in question. However, this approach was rejected in subsequent cases. 

33In Inspector James v Sunny Ngai [2007] NSWIRComm 203, Mr Ngai was successful in establishing a defence under s 26(1)(a). Contrary to the submissions of counsel for Mr Chevalley, this success did not depend solely on the ""technicality"" that a person other than Mr Ngai was the governing director. Rather, the Industrial Court found that having regard to the particular powers and responsibilities assigned to Mr Ngai and a fellow director who was also charged, a Ms Ly, they were not in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation in relation to the contravention. During the course of his judgment Staff J made the following comments: 

""[127] In my view, the defence available in s 26 is designed to avoid a situation of persons being punished simply by reason of holding the office of director. In order for a director to be liable, it is necessary to establish that the director was complicit in the contravention. The evidence establishes that in respect of the practical position, the defendants, because of the limited powers, duties, responsibilities and defined roles provided to them by the Governing Director, were not in a position to influence the Corporation's contravention and were not complicit in the Corporation's contravention. Similarly, from a theoretical perspective, in light of the Articles of Association, these defendants were not in a position to influence the contravention by the Corporation. 

[128] The section provides for punishment for an offence to which the person is deemed to be a party because the person is not able to establish the matters of exculpation in s 26(1)(a) or s 26(1)(b). Whether a person was not able to influence (to the requisite degree), the relevant conduct of the corporation will depend on a range of matters, both legal and factual."" 

34His Honour rejected the approach of Backman J in Inspector Aldred v Herbert supra, saying: 

""[131] In my view, to the extent that her Honour (at [54]) approached the availability of the defence simply by reference to the facts that directors are at the top of the corporation hierarchy to make decisions on matters of operations policy and management, and without examining whether the directors were in a position to influence the relevant conduct of the corporation, her Honour adopted too narrow a view of the availability of the defence under s 26(1)(a)."" 

35In relation to the application of the defence to the facts before him, Staff J concluded: 

""[137] The evidence is that the defendants were fully aware of the limitations imposed upon them by Mr Henry Ngai and I find no basis for concluding that the defendants were in any position to do anything even if they had made enquiries in respect of the guarding of machines. Ms Ly, in particular, had no knowledge about safety or training and did not have any experience at all in relation to safety issues. Furthermore, Ms Ly was overseas for a substantial period of time prior to the incident, which clearly limited, in any event, her ability to influence the operations of the Corporation in respect of occupational health and safety, or any matters outside her area of responsibility. In my view, the issue is not one of ignorance, nor wilful blindness, as submitted by Mr Docking, but rather that the defendants had neither the powers nor the authority to deal with safety matters. The defendants have established, on the balance of probabilities, that their powers and duties were excluded by the Articles of Association and by the direction and conduct of Mr Henry Ngai. At all relevant times, Mr Henry Ngai was acting within the scope of the powers bestowed upon him as Governing Director and by complying with his authority and directions, the defendants conducted themselves within the constraints imposed upon them by the Articles."" 

36A similar approach was adopted by Marks J in Inspector James v Ryan [2009] NSWIRComm 215. In that case the defendant was successful as the prosecutor failed to establish that he was a director. However, Marks J went on to consider the application of s 26(1)(a) on the assumption that his primary conclusion was incorrect (see [2009] NSWIRComm 215 at [155]). 

37Marks J described the operation of s 26 in the following terms: 

""[157] It is clear from its provisions that the purpose of s 26(1) is to extend criminal culpability to persons who were relevantly involved in the contravention by a corporation of the Act. The nature and extent of that involvement in the context of the purpose of the section can only be gauged by considering the prima facie application of the section in the context of the exculpatory matters described in (a) and (b). That is, given the manner in which s 26(1) is framed, it cannot, in my opinion, be concluded that anyone who is a director or anyone who is concerned in the management of the corporation will ipso facto be taken to have contravened the same provision of the Act. To conclude otherwise would render the defences contained within s 26(1)(a) and (b) of no effect. 

[158] The point can be made by describing the circumstances in which s 26(1) applies in another way. I shall commence by confining this description to the circumstances of a director. The alternative way of describing the offence is that if a corporation has contravened any provision of the Act, a director of the corporation who was in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation in relation to the contravention and who did not use all due diligence to prevent that contravention is taken to have contravened the same provision. The onus of establishing that the director was not in such a position or used all due diligence falls on the director. The provisions of the section can be so described and extrapolated to apply to someone concerned in the management of the corporation. 

[159] The recasting of the provision in this way, which, hopefully, retains faithfully the manner in which s 26(1) applies, demonstrates that the intent and purpose of the provision is focussed on the position of the director in terms of influence over the conduct of the corporation in relation to the contravention and the use of all due diligence to prevent that contravention by the director. This in turn focuses attention on the individual circumstances of the director. I should add for completeness that the recasting of the section in this way assumes an exact co-relationship between a director who was and a director who was not in a position to influence the corporation. The assumption is that there cannot be any logical state of affairs that would fall outside the area covered by the negation of the proposition of being in a position to influence and being in such a position. 

[160] In analysing and considering the provisions of s 26(1), I also take into account the following matters: 

1. A director is taken to have committed the same offence as that committed by the corporation by reason of his or her office as a director. That is, it is the defendant's position as a director per se that attracts the prima facie declaration of guilt. It follows that in examining any particular set of circumstances involving an allegation of breach brought against a person in his or her capacity as a director, that the focus of attention should be on the defendant's position as a director and not any other position which might be occupied by the defendant that would fall outside his or her duties, responsibilities and obligations as a director. 

2. In considering the provisions of the defence under s 26(1)(a), the Court is required to consider, firstly, the position of the defendant, secondly, whether that position enabled the defendant to influence the conduct of the corporation and thirdly, the contravention of the Act itself because the conduct of the corporation must be one that is 'in relation to' the contravention. 

3. The applicability of the defence must assume that the defendant would be in such a position despite being a director. That is, there is an express assumption contained within the provision that the defence can be raised outside of, and is not constrained by reason of, the duties, obligations and responsibilities that attach by reason of the fact that the defendant holds the office of a director. 

4. The manner in which sub-sections (a) and (b) are framed must reflect an acknowledgement that not all directors will be in a position to influence all of the conduct of the corporation solely because they hold the office of director. 

5. Therefore, it is necessary in applying the provisions of s 26(1) to examine what it is that may be considered beyond the mere position per se of a director, that is the fact that the defendant holds the office of director. 

6. Some clue in this regard is provided by the provisions of s 26(1)(a) and (b) when read as a whole. The meaning of whether someone is 'in a position' of the kind referred in the provision is given by the Oxford English Dictionary Online Edition in the following terms: 

8.a fig 'a relation in which a person stands with respect to another or others; a person's circumstances, condition or situation, esp as affecting his or her influence, role, or power to act; spec (freq in social position) status, rank, standing.' 

The adoption of this meaning dictates that it is necessary to consider the individual circumstances or situation of the defendant as a director in determining whether or not the defendant was in a relevant position to influence the corporation. 

7. Both defences, that is those contained within sub-sections (a) and (b), are directed to the particular contravention. This must involve a consideration of the circumstances by which the state of affairs which constitute the breach occurred. The necessity to consider the circumstances of the particular breach militates against accepting any prima facie culpability by reason only of the fact that a defendant holds the office of director in the corporation."" 

38His Honour then expressly rejected the interpretation of s 26(1)(a) by the trial judge in Inspector Kumar v Ritchie supra and in Inspector Aldred v Herbert supra. (See [2009] NSWIRComm 215 at [179], [191].) 

39His ultimate conclusion was as follows: 

""[214] Significantly, I conclude, on the evidence, that the defendant, as a matter of fact, had no active role to play in the occupational health and safety activities within the Dekorform business and had, as a matter of fact, no responsibilities in connection with the implementation of the occupational health and safety strategies and programs of that business. Nor did anything happen that could reasonably have alerted the defendant to any state of affairs that called for any reaction or action on his part. 

... 

[216] It follows that, as a matter of fact and law, I find that the defendant was not in a position to influence the conduct of Dekorform in relation to the particular contravention of the Act, which I have found occurred on 3 July 2006. This conduct covered the state of the equipment, and the failure to maintain it, the failure to ensure that it was not operated in an unsafe manner and to ensure that there were in place relevant systems and the provision of information, instruction, training and supervision and the carrying out of a risk assessment. These were matters that were outside the responsibilities, duties and obligations of the defendant as a matter of fact, assuming that he were relevantly a director of Dekorform on that date for the purpose of s 26(1) of the Act. Indeed, if the defendant did have any such duties, obligations or responsibilities as a matter of fact they would have accrued to him in his capacity as an executive of Alesco. For reasons which I have already advanced, I do not conclude that, as a matter of law, the defendant had such duties, responsibilities and obligations as would preclude him from relying on the defence available to him under s 26(1)(a)."" 

40Although the decision of Marks J was overturned on appeal, see Inspector James v Ryan (No 3) [2010] NSWIRComm 127, the Full Bench made no criticism of the approach taken by Marks J to the s 26 defence. 

41The approach of Staff J in Inspector James v Ngai supra and Marks J in Inspector James v Ryan supra, was endorsed by the Full Bench of the Industrial Court in Liang v Inspector David Farmer [2010] NSWIRComm 156; (2010) 199 IR 116 at [36], [37]. 

42Further, so far as s 26(1)(b) is concerned the Industrial Court has not approached the question of all due diligence on the basis submitted by Mr Chevalley namely that ""by definition a director will not have shown all due diligence if a corporate contravention has taken place"". An example is Inspector Hayes v Santos and Lorenzo [2009] NSWIRComm 163. In that case Boland J conducted a detailed analysis of the due diligence said to be undertaken by the defendant directors and found that: 

""[179] For all their commendable commitment to safety, their comprehensive policies and their reiteration of the prohibition on the use of hooks to lift steel plates, a flaw in the defendants' approach was to rely on supervisors who were not qualified to perform dogging work or to give instructions in relation to the carrying out of such work. It was very clearly the case that reliance was placed on Mr Alvarez to supervise and give instructions to Mr Hair but the defendants failed to ensure that Mr Alvarez was qualified to do so."" 

43In that case the defendants had a system of recording qualifications, and recorded that Mr Alvarez was so qualified, when in fact he was not, indicating that the defendants had accepted his assertions of qualification without ever sighting evidence of them. This obligation was found to rest with the directors by Boland J, not by virtue of the simple fact that they were directors but because the company's organisational chart and the evidence of the directors revealed that one of them was specifically responsible for workshop personnel and site work, the other for providing ""a system with relevant procedures and instructions in the areas of occupational health and safety"" (at [31]). The s 26(1)(b) defence failed not because the onus was impossible to discharge, but because in the circumstances of the defendant directors' specific positions and responsibilities they had not used all due diligence to prevent the contravention by the corporation. 

44I have dealt with these cases in some detail because they demonstrate an approach consistent with that which I have indicated as the correct approach in pars [29] and [30] above. The defences in these circumstances are not illusory. 

45Turning to the issues raised by s 12 of the Act, the relevant question is what is the act or omission which imposed liability to penalties on the directors under s 12. As I indicated earlier (at [21]) counsel for Mr Grugeon contended that the relevant act or omission had to be that of the director; an absence of particulars of which meant the charge was bad in law. 

46In my opinion, this submission is incorrect. Section 26(1) provides that when a corporation by act or omission contravenes any provision of the Act, the director or person concerned in management is taken to have contravened the same provision unless one of the defences in s 26(1)(a) or s 26(1)(b) is made out. The effect of the section is that the director is taken to have contravened the same provision. Although the legislation does not say that the director or person concerned in management is taken to have committed the same act or omission as the corporation, the expression, ""taken to have contravened the same provision"" means, in the context of which it appears, liability for the same act or omission which constituted the contravention. It follows that in proceedings against the director or persons concerned in management in reliance on s 26, the relevant act or omission is the act or omission for which the corporation is liable. 

47Such a construction, in my opinion, gives effect to what was intended by the legislature in enacting s 26 of the Act and enables the provision which is said to have been contravened (in this case s 8) and the penalty provision s 12 to operate harmoniously with s 26: See Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69]-[70]. 

48It follows that there was no requirement imposed solely by s 12 to particularise acts or omissions of the directors in the charges. 

49Section 28 of the Act raises a number of issues of construction. The first is whether where, as envisaged in s 26(2), a director is prosecuted in circumstances where there has been no conviction against the corporation, the person charged can rely on s 28 of the Act in resisting the allegation that the corporation contravened the Act. Each of the parties agreed that the person charged in these circumstances could invoke s 28 in resisting the allegation that the corporation contravened the Act. However, the first respondent suggested that this was inconsistent with what was said by the Full Bench of the Industrial Court in Morrison v Powercoal supra at [163]-[165]. 

50I do not believe that the Full Bench in those paragraphs was dealing with the question of the availability of s 28 as a defence to the allegation that the corporation contravened the Act in circumstances where no conviction had been recorded against the corporation. Rather, it was directing its attention to the situation where the corporation had in fact been convicted. That interpretation of the judgment is consistent with the view taken of it in Powercoal Pty Limited v Industrial Relations Commission [2005] NSWCA 345; (2005) 64 NSWLR 406 at [121]-[124]. In these circumstances, in my opinion, where the corporation has not been convicted, it is open to the director charged to raise the defences under s 28 to resist the proposition that the corporation had in fact contravened the Act. There is not the slightest reason to put the director in a worse position than the corporation would have been had it been charged with the offence. 

51A more difficult question is the extent to which a director can dispute the fact that the company contravened the provision either generally or in reliance on s 28 when the company had previously been convicted of the contravention. Put another way, is it sufficient for the prosecution to prove the contravention by the corporation by simply tendering a certificate of conviction under s 178 of the Evidence Act ? 

52As I have stated above, the Full Bench of the Industrial Court in Morrison v Powercoal Pty Limited supra, stated that in proceedings against the director which occurred after the corporation had pleaded guilty, the director was not entitled to contest the contravention by the company stating that it would be incongruous to permit the re-examination of the s 53 defences (the predecessor provisions to s 28) where its unavailability had already been found in relation to the corporation. In Powercoal Pty Ltd v Industrial Relations Commission supra, this Court left open the question of whether this conclusion was correct (see [2005] NSWCCA 345 at [120]-[123]). 

53Although the issue had not been previously considered by the Industrial Court, there were two previous decisions of the Full Bench relevant to the issue which were not cited to that Court in Morrison v Powercoal Pty Limited supra. In WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Lane) v Australian Winch & Haulage Co Pty Ltd [2000] NSWIRComm 214, the Full Bench held that in a proceeding under s 50 of the Act (the predecessor to s 26) the fact of a contravention could not be proved merely by the tender of a certificate of conviction under s 178. It stated its conclusion as follows: 

""[59] However, in our view the essential element of an offence under s 50 is the contravention of the Act by the corporation not the conviction of the corporation: s 50(1). An offence under s 50 does not require that a corporation has been proceeded against or convicted: s 50(2). As such, the conviction of the corporate defendant is not a fact in issue in proceedings under s 50 and therefore the certificate of conviction could not be tendered under s 178 of the Evidence Act ; s 91(1) operates to preclude it."" 

54The reasoning in that case was approved by a subsequent decision of the Full Bench in T & M Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sequeira [2006] NSWIRComm 25. The issue in that case was whether the director on an appeal from an adverse decision of the primary judge could raise the issue of whether the corporation contravened the Act in circumstances where the corporation had not appealed from its conviction. The Full Bench said that it was open to the director to raise this issue. In the course of its judgment it made the following comments: 

""[27] One of the essential elements of an offence under s 26(1) is the contravention by a corporation of any provision of the Act or regulations - in this case, the contravention by the Company of s 92. For the purpose of s 26(1), this is simply a matter to be proved beyond reasonable doubt: sub-section (2) makes it clear that there may be a conviction under s 26(1), whether or not the corporation has been proceeded against or convicted. Sub-section (3) also emphasises the extent to which s 26(1) operates independently of any relevant criminal proceedings involving the corporation. 

[28] Although the syntax of sub-section (3) is somewhat awkward, it does suggest the following scenarios: it appears that a director may be found guilty of an offence under s 26(1), and yet, in separate criminal proceedings, the corporation may be acquitted of the underlying offence. On the other hand, it is conceivable that, notwithstanding a conviction against a corporation, the director may be acquitted in separate proceedings on the basis that one of the essential elements - the contravention by the corporation - has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Although such cases would be highly unusual (and extremely unlikely to occur in practice), it seems to us that sub-section (3) admits these possibilities. This reinforces our preliminary view that in appellate proceedings against a conviction under s 26(1), the contravention by the corporation is open to challenge on the ordinary principles governing appeals - as is any essential element - regardless of the status of the corporation or any proceedings against it. 

[29] Contrary to the respondent's submissions, WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Lane) v Australian Winch & Haulage Co Pty Ltd (2000) 102 IR 40 does not stand in the way of this preliminary view. If anything, it supports it. In determining whether a certificate of conviction was admissible pursuant to s 178 of the Evidence Act 1995, the Full Bench held that the fact of a conviction of a corporation is not a fact in issue in separate proceedings against a director or manager of the corporation under s 50 of the 1983 Act (which is equivalent to s 26 of the 2000 Act for the purpose of this discussion). Rather, the essential element of the offence was the contravention of the Act by the corporation not the conviction of the corporation."" 

55It seems to me in these circumstances that even where the corporation has been convicted, the prosecutor in a separate case against the director is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt the contravention alleged for which the defendant is said to be liable by virtue of s 26. It follows, in my opinion, that the directors would be entitled to challenge the detailed facts, challenge the contravention and in so doing rely on s 28 as a basis for rebutting the allegation that the corporation contravened the Act. 

56A certificate of conviction takes its evidentiary force from s 178 of the Evidence Act . Under the common law and the Evidence Act 1989 a conviction did not even provide prima facie evidence of the facts on which it was based: Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd [1943] KB 587; and see J Heydon, Cross on Evidence (8 th Australian Ed, LexisNexis) at 265ff. Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act now change that position in particular respects in probate matters and civil proceedings. 

57Section 178 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms: 

"" 178 Convictions, acquittals and other judicial proceedings 

(1) This section applies to the following facts: 

(a) the conviction or acquittal before or by an applicable court of a person charged with an offence, 

(b) the sentencing of a person to any punishment or pecuniary penalty by an applicable court, 

(c) an order by an applicable court, 

(d) the pendency or existence at any time before an applicable court of a civil or criminal proceeding. 

(2) Evidence of a fact to which this section applies may be given by a certificate signed by a judge, a magistrate or registrar or other proper officer of the applicable court: 

(a) showing the fact, or purporting to contain particulars, of the record, indictment, conviction, acquittal, sentence, order or proceeding in question, and 

(b) stating the time and place of the conviction, acquittal, sentence, order or proceeding, and 

(c) stating the title of the applicable court. 

(3) A certificate given under this section showing a conviction, acquittal, sentence or order is also evidence of the particular offence or matter in respect of which the conviction, acquittal, sentence or order was had, passed or made, if stated in the certificate. 

(4) A certificate given under this section showing the pendency or existence of a proceeding is also evidence of the particular nature and occasion, or ground and cause, of the proceeding, if stated in the certificate. 

(5) A certificate given under this section purporting to contain particulars of a record, indictment, conviction, acquittal, sentence, order or proceeding is also evidence of the matters stated in the certificate. 

(6) In this section: 

acquittal includes the dismissal of the charge in question by an applicable court. 

applicable court means an Australian court or a foreign court. 

Note. Section 91 excludes evidence of certain judgments and convictions."" 

58Given the terms of s 178(1)(a) as one of the facts to which the section applies, s 178(2) and (3) provide for proof of a conviction of a particular offence identified in the relevant certificate. I would not read s 178(3) as providing for evidence that the offence was committed. Thus, in this case, the certificate would not be evidence of the contravention, but rather of the conviction of the offence in question (which fact is not relevant). Whether or not s 178 has a wider meaning was not the subject of argument. It need not be decided, because whatever its width, it does not provide for proof of the facts relevant to the commission of the offence in the face of the Evidence Act s 91(1); and s 26 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act should be construed so as to require the proof of the facts underlying the contravention such that the offence is proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

59Were it otherwise, the constitutional question posed by s 26 may have more significance. 

60Further, with respect to the Full Bench there seems to me to be nothing incongruous in the prosecution being required to prove in the case against the director one of the essential elements of the offence. To the extent that incongruity provides any yardstick in this context, it would be equally if not more incongruous that the prosecution was dispensed from proving one of the essential elements of the offence. 

61The remaining construction issue is whether a director who is unable to make out one of the defences in s 26(1)(a) or (b) can rely on s 28 in his or her own defence. In my opinion, s 28 does not extend to provide the director or person concerned with management with such a defence. This is for two reasons. First, the use of the expression ""unless the director or person satisfies the court"" in s 26 tends to suggest that once a contravention by the corporation is found, the only defences are those contained in s 26(1)(a) or (b). Secondly, and more importantly, the defence in s 28 does not seem to relate to a claim against a director. The defence in s 28(a), namely that it was not reasonably practicable for the person to comply with the provision, does not seem apposite to a claim against a director where the touchstone for liability is a claim against the corporation. As I indicated, the director can, however, rely on s 28 in resisting the allegation of contravention by the corporation. 

62The defence in s 28(b) so far as it relates to a director adds nothing to the defence in s 26. If a director was not in a position to influence the corporation in relation to the contravention or had performed all due diligence then it would follow that the contravention was due to causes over which he or she had no control and against the happening of which it was impractical for the person to make provision. Conversely, if the defendant was in a position to influence the corporation in relation to the contravention and had not performed all due diligence then the defence under s 28(b) could not be made out. 

63For these reasons s 28 is not available to a director or persons concerned in management in addition to the s 26 defences. 

64I have dealt with these issues in some detail because they are critical to the question of the constitutional validity of s 26 and relevant to the attack on the charges for want of particularity. 

The constitutional validity of s 26 

65It was primarily Mr Chevalley who challenged the validity of s 26, although the challenge was supported by Mr Grugeon. The reference to the applicants' submissions should be understood in that context. 

The applicants ' submissions 

66The applicants contended that s 26 was repugnant in a fundamental degree to the judicial process. They contended that this was so not because it reversed the onus of proof but because of what was described as the cumulative and restrictive effect on the judicial function in that it unacceptably limited the capacity of the defendant to rebut the criminal charges by countervailing and better evidence. The applicants contended that the substantive effect of s 26 was that the director had no real or reasonable chance to place the real facts before the Court. 

67The applicants further submitted that Chapter III of the Constitution forbids attempts by state parliaments to impose on courts functions which would interfere with the traditional judicial process and that s 26 infringed that principle by removing the capacity of the courts to consider whether the directors had the actus rea and mens rea associated with the offence. The applicants submitted that the legislation as interpreted meant that directors will be deemed guilty because s 26(1)(a) and (b) leave the courts with no work to do. The first applicant in that context relied heavily on the submission that the defences were illusory, a submission which I have demonstrated is incorrect. 

The respondents ' submissions 

68The first respondent emphasised that the reversal of the onus of proof in a provision providing for a criminal offence did not of itself render the provision invalid. It submitted that the legislation was no different in effect to that held valid by the High Court in Hookham v The Queen [1994] HCA 52; (1994) 181 CLR 450. He submitted that s 26 does not directly presume guilt and pointed to the fact that a number of factual and legal issues were left open for determination by the court in considering a charge based on s 26. As a consequence he submitted that the requirements of s 26 do not remove the court's capacity to engage in a curial determination of the acts on which liability depends. 

69The submissions of the third respondent were broadly similar, emphasising the fact that the reversal of the onus of proof did not invalidate the provision and rejecting the proposition that the defences under s 26 were illusory. 

Consideration 

70In Baker v R [2004] HCA 45; (2004) 223 CLR 513, the plurality (at [22]) cited with approval the following passage from the joint judgment of five members of the High Court in HA Bachrach Pty Ltd v Queensland [1998] HCA 54; (1998) 195 CLR 547 to the following effect: 

""It will be apparent that the Queensland Supreme Court (including the Court of Appeal) is not a federal court created by the Parliament within the meaning of s 71 of the Constitution, and that the litigation pending in the Court of Appeal did not involve the exercise by it of federal jurisdiction invested pursuant to a law made by the Parliament under s 77(iii) of the Constitution. Hence the reliance by the plaintiff upon the decision with respect to the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) . 

However, Kable took as a starting point the principles applicable to courts created by the Parliament under s 71 and to the exercise by them of the judicial power of the Commonwealth under Ch III. If the law in question here had been a law of the Commonwealth and it would not have offended those principles, then an occasion for the application of Kable does not arise. The submissions for the first and third defendants and for the interveners correctly proceeded on that footing."" 

71Consistent with that approach it is convenient to consider whether the law would have been valid had it been a law of the Commonwealth conferring jurisdiction on a court created by Parliament under s 71 of the Constitution. 

72In Nicholas v The Queen [1998] HCA 9; (1998) 193 CLR 173, Gummow J stated (at [146]) that the legislative powers of the Commonwealth do not extend to the making of a law which authorises or requires a court to exercise judicial power in a manner which is inconsistent with its nature. (See also APLA Limited v Legal Services Commission of New South Wales [2005] HCA 44; (2005) 224 CLR 322 at [247]; Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration [1992] HCA 64; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 21.) 

73In R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte Tasmanian Breweries Pty Ltd (1970) 123 CLR 361, Kitto J described the nature of the judicial power in the following terms at 374-375: 

""Thus a judicial power involves, as a general rule, a decision settling for the future, as between defined persons or classes of persons, a question as to the existence of a right or obligation, so that an exercise of the power creates a new charter by reference to which that question is in future to be decided as between those persons or classes of persons. In other words, the process to be followed must generally be an inquiry concerning the law as it is and the facts as they are, followed by an application of the law as determined to the facts as determined; and the end to be reached must be an act which, so long as it stands, entitles and obliges the persons between whom it intervenes, to observance of the rights and obligations that the application of law to facts has shown to exist. It is right, I think, to conclude from the cases on the subject that a power which does not involve such a process and lead to such an end needs to possess some special compelling feature if its inclusion in the category of judicial power is to be justified."" 

74More recently in Bass v Permanent Trustee Co [1999] HCA 9; (1999) 198 CLR 334, the majority (at [56]) described judicial power as the application of relevant law to facts as found in proceedings conducted in accordance with the judicial process and that this requires that the parties be given an opportunity to present their evidence and to challenge the evidence led against them. (See also Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v Commissioner of Police supra at [175]; International Finance Trust Co Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission [2009] HCA 49; (2009) 240 CLR 319 at [88].) 

75As I indicated above the applicants submitted that s 26 had the effect of conferring on a court a function repugnant to or incompatible with the institutional integrity of the court, in that it required the court in proceedings against the director or person concerned in management to presume guilt and limit its function to the imposition of a penalty. If in fact the legislation had that effect it would be invalid as requiring the court to exercise judicial power in a manner inconsistent with its nature: See Chu Kheng Lim supra at 27; Nicholas v The Queen supra at [16], [19], [74]; International Finance Trust Co Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission supra at [4], [97]-[98]; South Australia v Totani [2010] HCA 39; (2010) 242 CLR 1 at [4], [69], [426]-[428]; Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v Commissioner of Police supra at [39]; Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; (1996) 189 CLR 51 at 107. 

76In considering this issue, as the applicants correctly conceded it is clear that the fact that Parliament in enacting s 26 imposed the burden of proving the defences in s 26(1)(a) and (b) of the Act on the defendant does not render the section invalid: Nicholas v The Queen supra at [23]-[24], [153]-[156]; Hookham v The Queen supra at 458-459; Commissioner of Taxation v Price [2006] QCA 108; (2006) 2 Qd R 316 at [42]-[43]. 

77I have dealt with the construction of s 26 and its related sections above. It follows from what I have said that the following matters are left for determination by the court should the defendant choose to put them in issue. 

(a) Whether the corporation contravened a relevant provision of the Act. 

(b) Whether a defence under s 28 was available to the corporation. 

(c) Whether the defendant was a director or person concerned in the management of the company. 

(d) Whether the defendant was in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation in relation to the contravention. 

(e) Whether the defendant used all due diligence to prevent the contravention by the corporation. 

78In these circumstances it is incorrect to say that the effect of the legislation is to require the court to presume the guilt of the defendant and to deprive it of the power to adjudicate on such guilt. As Spigelman CJ pointed out in Powercoal Pty Limited v Industrial Commission of New South Wales supra at [109]-[111], the provisions are similar to those considered in Hookham v The Queen supra; they are designed to achieve the object of the Act by punishing persons complicit in the contravention. Having regard to the fact that the jurisdiction conferred on the court includes the determination of the question of whether there was a contravention and of matters relevant to complicity, the legislation does not require a court to exercise judicial power in a manner inconsistent with its nature. 

79It follows that s 26 of the Act is not invalid. 

The challenge to the charges based on absence of particularity 

80As I indicated earlier (at [10]) the applicants allege that the charges against them were bad because they failed to particularise the steps they should have taken by way of due diligence to prevent the contravention by the company. Each of the applicants relied on the decision of the High Court in Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531. Counsel for the Mr Grugeon also submitted that s 12 of the Act created the offence and that the section required an act or omission of the director to be specified. As it was not, the charge was bad in law. 

The argument based on s 12 of the Act 

81I have concluded earlier in this judgment that the relevant act or omission in a claim against a director in reliance on s 26 of the Act is the act or omission of the corporation (see at [46]-[47] above). It follows that the argument that the charge is bad because s 12 requires specification of an act or omission of the charged director is incorrect. 

The applicants ' submission based on Kirk 

82Each applicant submitted that consistent with Kirk the director was entitled to be informed by the prosecution of the due diligence he was required to undertake. They pointed to the different roles of management, executive directors and non-executive directors and the fact that different persons had different responsibilities within the company. They gave an example of the prejudice which could be suffered in circumstances where it was first suggested to a director in cross-examination that he or she could have done something which he or she had not had the opportunity to previously consider and submitted that the prejudice would be overcome if particulars were given. 

The respondents ' submissions 

83The first respondent submitted that Kirk did not require the particulars sought as distinct from particulars of the contravention by the corporation. He submitted that there was no need to particularise what due diligence should be undertaken, that being a matter within the knowledge of the director. In Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales supra, the High Court held that in a prosecution under s 15 of the Act (then equivalent to s 8) it was incumbent on the prosecutor to identify the acts or omissions said to constitute the alleged contravention. It held that the decision of the Industrial Court to the contrary was a result of an erroneous construction of s 15 and led the Court to a jurisdictional error as the Court had no power to convict and sentence the defendant because no particular act or omission was identified as constituting the offence. 

84In Kirk the plurality pointed out (at [15]) that it was the relevant act or omission which gave rise to the offence. They stated (at [16]) that the necessity to identify the act or omission of the employer said to constitute the offence was even more apparent when regard was had to the defence in s 53 (the equivalent to s 28). They stated the position as follows: 

""[27] The acts or omissions the subject of the charges here in question had to be identified if Mr Kirk and the Kirk company were to be able to rely upon a defence under s 53. The defendant in Johnson v Miller was placed in a similar position. The statute in question provided that a licensee of licensed premises would be liable to a penalty if a person was present on the premises during certain prohibited hours, unless the licensee could establish one of the justifications or excuses relating to that person's presence provided for in the statute. Dixon J observed that each of the justifications depended upon some feature pertaining to the person found in, or seen leaving, the premises and that no licensee could succeed in bringing the case within any of the grounds of excuse unless the person or persons were identified and their presence on a distinct occasion alleged. 

[28] The statements of the offences as particularised do not identify what measures the Kirk company could have taken but did not take. They do not identify an act or omission which constitutes a contravention of ss 15(1) and 16(1). The first particular of the s 15(1) offence suggests that the Kirk company had some systems relating to the operation of the ATV in place, but that they were not sufficient. It does not identify the deficiency in the system or the measures which should have been taken to address it. The second particular does not identify what information, instruction or training was necessary to be given to Mr Palmer or the other employee of the Kirk company. The particulars of the s 16(1) offence say nothing about what should have been done to avoid exposing the contractors to risk to their health and safety from the use of the ATV. Needless to say, the appellants could not have known what measures they were required to prove were not reasonably practicable."" 

And: 

[33] The propositions listed by his Honour appear to assume that the employer's obligation, to guarantee against risks in the workplace, remains in existence at all times and that the question of an employer's liability is to be determined by reference to it. There is no discussion of how the defences under s 53 can co-exist with that obligation. The only reference to the defences in the authorities referred to by his Honour is to the terms of s 53 and an acknowledgement that measures which may have been taken may be relevant to them. Since it was considered unnecessary for the prosecutor to identify those measures, it would appear to follow that the employer would be required to establish that there were no reasonably practicable measures, of any kind, which could have been addressed to the type of risk. If there was something further that could be done, the causal connection with the risk would remain and the employer would be guilty of an offence. The provisions of the OH&S Act relating to offence and defence were not intended to operate in this way. 

[34] Walton J referred to earlier case law that the duty imposed upon an employer 'is to be construed as meaning to guarantee, secure or make certain' and that the duty is directed at obviating 'risks' to safety at the workplace. References to guarantees, and emphasis upon general classes of risks which are to be eliminated, tend to distract attention from the requirements of an offence against ss 15 and 16. The approach taken by the Industrial Court fails to distinguish between the content of the employer's duty, which is generally stated, and the fact of a contravention in a particular case. It is that fact, the act or omission of the employer, which constitutes the offence. Of course it is necessary for an employer to identify risks present in the workplace and to address them, in order to fulfil the obligations imposed by ss 15 and 16. It is also necessary for the prosecutor to identify the measures which should have been taken. If a risk was or is present, the question is - what action on the part of the employer was or is required to address it? The answer to that question is the matter properly the subject of the charge."" 

85Their conclusion on this issue was set out at [37]-[38]: 

""[37] It is not necessary to further consider the correctness of these findings. For present purposes it is sufficient to observe that his Honour's reasons disclose a wrong understanding of what constituted an offence against ss 15 and 16 and how the defence under s 53(a) was to be applied in proceedings for such an offence. His Honour did not appreciate that no act or omission on the part of the Kirk company had been charged. To the contrary, his Honour accepted the proposition that the prosecutor is not required to demonstrate that particular measures should have been taken to prevent the risk identified. 

[38] A consequence of the matter proceeding to conviction on the charges as stated, absent the identification of measures the Kirk company should have taken, was that it was denied the opportunity to properly put a defence under s 53(a). Instead, the Kirk company was required to show why it was not reasonably practicable to eliminate possible risks associated with the use, or possible use, of the ATV. The guarantee against risk, seen as provided by s 15, was treated as continuing, despite a defence under s 53(a) being raised. The operation of that defence was treated as largely confined to an issue of reasonable foreseeability."" 

86In the present case the applicants have received particulars of the acts and omissions by the corporations said to constitute its contravention. 

87The question of the need to particularise those acts of due diligence which a director was required to undertake to avail him or herself of the defence under s 26(1)(b) was not considered by the Court in Kirk. However, in my opinion, it does not follow from the reasoning of the plurality in that case that the prosecutor is required to particularise the due diligence which should have been undertaken if the defendant was to have the benefit of the defence under s 26(1)(b). 

88This is for two reasons. First, as I pointed out above, the relevant act or omission which gives rise to the offence is not the failure to exercise due diligence, but rather the act or omission of the corporation. Section 26(1)(b), like s 26(1)(a), is not an element of the offence; the subsections are defences. A director can demonstrate that he or she was not complicit in the act or omission which constituted the offer. 

89Second, once the director is aware of the acts or omissions constituting the contravention by the corporation, the director will have sufficient information to mount a defence under s 26(1)(b) if it is available. The director would be aware of the procedures which the corporation had in place to prevent the relevant act or omission occurring. He or she would be aware of the steps that he or she had taken by way of due diligence to ensure such procedures were adequate and that as a matter of fact they were implemented. In these circumstances it does not seem to me that it is incumbent on the prosecutor to inform the defendant of what was required to constitute a defence under s 26(1)(b). 

90That is not to say that if the prosecution proposes to contend that some particular conduct of the directors was required to satisfy s 26(1)(b) it should not inform the defendant of this fact. Failure to do so may lead to the defendant being denied procedural fairness at the trial and to a conviction being quashed on that ground. However, it does not follow that the charges are required to anticipate the defence and particularise what the prosecutor claims will be necessary for the defence to succeed. 

91It follows that this ground of attack on the charge is not made out. 

The application for leave to amend 

92As I indicated the applicants sought leave to file an amended summons claiming that s 105 of the Act, which conferred jurisdiction on the Industrial Court to hear the proceedings, was invalid following the insertion of s 146C in the Industrial Relations Act. That section required the Industrial Relations Commission to give effect to certain aspects of government policy on public sector employment. It was said this fundamentally impaired the independence of members of the Commission, in particular its judicial members in the Industrial Court, as a result of which the Commission could not be a repository for the exercise of judicial determination of criminal culpability. 

93During the course of the hearing the applicants accepted that if s 146C had the effect contended for, rather than provisions such as s 105 of the Act conferring judicial power on the Court, it would be invalid. In these circumstances, the issue sought to be raised by the applicants would have no effect on the outcome of the proceedings. Further, the notice under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) did not raise the question of the validity of s 146C. In these circumstances, the Court refused leave. 

Conclusion 

94It follows that each summons should be dismissed. The applicants should pay the costs of the first respondent in this Court, and of the second respondent on a submitting basis. There should be no order as to the costs of the Attorney General (the third respondent). 

95ALLSOP P: I agree with Bathurst CJ. 

96BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Bathurst CJ. 

97BASTEN JA : The issues and the procedural background to this matter have been set out by the Chief Justice and need not be repeated here. Subject to what follows, I agree with his Honour's reasons and with the orders he proposes. 

Procedural issues 
98The applicants sought to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). To that end, they sought an order ""removing the records of the Full Bench"" of the Industrial Court into this Court. Given the terms of s 69, that order was otiose; however, the request might have focused attention on the nature of the proceedings in the Court below. If the records of the Full Bench were in issue, what was sought to be challenged were the answers given by the Full Court to the seven questions identified at [6] above. Those questions had been referred to the Full Bench by an order of Backman J made (in relation to the first six questions) on 8 March 2010 and (in relation to the seventh question) on 31 March 2010. However, the relief sought in this Court was not directed to the jurisdiction of the Full Bench to answer the questions, nor the answers given to those questions, but to the validity of two procedural steps taken in the course of the proceedings before a single judge of the Industrial Court. 

99Proceedings were commenced on 5 June 2007 by Mr Morrison, the prosecutor, filing applications in respect of each applicant for an order that he appear before the Industrial Court to answer the charge set out in the application. Such orders were made, ex parte, on 7 June 2007 by Staunton J. 

100On 9 October 2008 (16 months after the first order) an amended application for orders was made in respect of each applicant. Orders were, presumably, made on that day by a judge of the Court, although no copy of the orders appears in the application book in this Court. How the amendments came about was not explored. However, the Full Bench described the procedural history in its judgment, Morrison v Chevalley [2010] NSWIRComm 116, as follows: 

""[3] On 7 June 2007, Staunton J made orders exparte in respect of each of the four defendants requiring each to appear before the Court on 27 July 2007 to answer the offence charged in each Application for Order filed on 5 June 2007. 

[4] Mr Chevalley and Mr Grugeon entered pleas of not guilty before Staunton J on 15 February 2008. Hunter Quarries and Mr Badior subsequently entered pleas of not guilty. 

[5] On 7 October 2008, the trials in respect of all four defendants commenced before Backman J; by consent, all matters were heard together. During the course of that and the following day the prosecutor opened the prosecution case and tendered five volumes of documentary evidence without objection. 

[6] On 9 October 2008 the prosecutor, following discussion between counsel and without objection, sought and obtained orders from Backman J, substituting Amended Applications for Order in all four matters. ... Following the amendment, Hunter Quarries and Mr Badior entered a plea of guilty to the amended charges, though not accepting the truth of all the facts alleged by the prosecutor against them."" 

101That situation invited attention to a number of issues. First, it would, if the applicants made good their substantive challenges, have raised questions as to the utility of the relief sought setting aside either or both of the orders to appear. Secondly, if the charges could validly be amended, it would have been necessary to consider whether or not a conditional injunction would have been appropriate, rather than an order prohibiting any further steps in the proceedings. Thirdly, if the real complaint was a failure to particularise, again, conditional relief might arguably have been sufficient. Fourthly, in circumstances where the Full Bench had, by consent, been invited to answer questions, there would have been an issue as to why this Court, in the exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction, should give relief not sought in the Court below. (The answers to the questions would no doubt have guided the trial judge in disposing of a motion to strike out or permanently stay the proceedings.) In the event, none of these questions need be answered. 

102There are further issues. It may have been assumed from the outcome of the proceedings in the High Court in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531, that this Court's jurisdiction can be invoked in relation to any stage of the proceedings in the Industrial Court, without regard to the challenges raised in that Court or the relief sought there. It also appears to have been assumed that the protection provided by s 179 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) in respect of decisions of the Commission, other than decisions of the Full Bench made without jurisdiction, is ineffective, thus rendering an appeal to the Full Bench an optional diversion. Again, these questions need not be addressed in this case. 

103Finally, in respect of procedural issues, the first question referred to the Full Bench was whether that Court had power to determine the questions asked of it. It answered that question in the affirmative and there has been no challenge to that answer. The real complaint in this Court is that the Full Bench answered questions 2, 3 and 7 erroneously, although the answers were not appellable. 

Validity of provision creating offence 
104There were, in substance, two primary issues to be determined in this Court. The first was whether the charges prepared by the prosecutor were defective in terms of their pleading. The second concerned the validity of s 26 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW), which, in combination with s 8(1) of that Act, constituted the legal basis for the charges. Logically, the latter question should be considered first. The answer to that question does not depend upon how the charges were formulated in the present case, nor the approach adopted by the Industrial Court in other cases, nor the conviction rate in the Industrial Court; rather, it depends upon the proper construction of the section within the statutory scheme and correct identification of the constitutional provision which, when applied to the section properly construed, would result in invalidity. 

105It is important to identify the constitutional principle against which the legislation is to be tested. In that regard, it is important to bear in mind that statutory invalidity invokes a constraint on legislative power and that the legislative power in question is that of the State, not the Commonwealth. The provision creates a statutory offence, the subject matter of which lies within the constitutional limits of the State legislature. At the heart of the applicants' argument is the proposition that the offence is defined in terms which permit conviction without the proper exercise of judicial power. The Constitution prevents a State legislature conferring a power on a State court incompatible with the status of that court as a potential recipient of federal judicial power. So understood (in broad terms, which require some refinement) the argument turned not solely on the terms of s 26, but the operation of s 105 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act , which conferred jurisdiction in respect of proceedings for an offence, including an offence under s 26, in the following terms: 

"" 105 Summary procedure for offences 

(1) Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations are to be dealt with summarily: 

(a) before a Local Court constituted by a magistrate sitting alone, or 
(b) before the Industrial Relations Commission in Court Session."" 

106It is not in doubt that the principle of the separation of powers, as revealed in the Constitution, imposes greater restraints on the Commonwealth Parliament with respect to the exercise of federal judicial power than it imposes on State legislatures in respect of their own courts, even if potential recipients of federal judicial power. Accordingly, it is permissible to consider whether State legislation would contravene the relevant constitutional principle, had it been enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament as jurisdiction conferred on federal courts with the consequence that, if it passed that test, it must also clear the lower hurdle in respect of State legislation: H A Bachrach Pty Ltd v State of Queensland [1998] HCA 54; 195 CLR 547 at [14]. However, there are risks in adopting such an approach. First, it is apt to lead to an erosion of the basic distinction between the two situations. Secondly, it distracts attention from the characteristics and jurisdiction of the State court in question. Thus, s 105, for example, did not confer any jurisdiction on the Supreme Court. The essential characteristics of the Supreme Court are protected from interference by the State legislature because, in part, such courts are expressly identified in the Constitution as part of the ""unitary national system of law"" identified by Deane J in Breavington v Godleman [1988] HCA 40; 169 CLR 41 at 121 speaking of the general law, though not of course statutory law, and adopted in respect of the institutional structure of judicial power in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51. 

107The argument for the applicants in the present case bore some similarity to that relied upon in Baker v The Queen [2004] HCA 45; 223 CLR 513. That case involved the operation of s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) (since repealed) which permitted the Supreme Court to transform a life sentence into a minimum term and an additional term, the latter being a period during which the prisoner would be eligible for release on parole. However, where a person had been subject to a recommendation by the sentencing judge that he or she should never be released, additional statutory hurdles were placed in the way of both an order under s 13A and release on parole. Section 13A(3A) required the applicant to demonstrate ""special reasons"", a requirement ""said to be devoid of content, and illusory"": at [11] (Gleeson CJ). The Chef Justice continued: 

""On that premise, in its application to people the subject of non-release recommendations, s 13A involved the Supreme Court in a charade. The legislature was using the forms of judicial procedure to mask the reality of the legislative decree, which was that these people were never to be released. On that premise, as a matter of principle, the case would be very close to Kable . It is the premise that is in contest."" 

108The Chief Justice had earlier identified the principle in Kable as involving conferral of a power inconsistent with the exercise by the Supreme Court of federal judicial power. That principle was explained in the following terms: 
""[5] The kind of inconsistency relied upon is that identified in Kable .... The principle for which that case stands as authority is that, since the Constitution established an integrated Australian court system, and contemplates the exercise of federal jurisdiction by State Supreme Courts, State legislation which purports to confer upon such a court a function which substantially impairs its institutional integrity, and which is therefore incompatible with its role as a repository of federal jurisdiction, is invalid. 

[6] The strength of that principle lies in its constitutional legitimacy. It was not an invention of a method by which judges may wash their hands of the responsibility of applying laws of which they disapprove. In some of the judgments in Kable , references were made to public confidence in the courts. Confidence is not something that exists in the abstract. It is related to some quality or qualities which one person believes to exist in another. The most basic quality of courts in which the public should have confidence is that they will administer justice according to law. As Brennan CJ said in Nicholas v The Queen : 

'It is the faithful adherence of the courts to the laws enacted by the Parliament, however undesirable the courts may think them to be, which is the guarantee of public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process and the protection of the courts' repute as the administrator of criminal justice.'"" 

109In the passage immediately before that quoted by Gleeson CJ in Baker , Brennan CJ had said in Nicholas v The Queen [1998] HCA 9; 193 CLR 173 at [37]: 
""To hold that a court's opinion as to the effect of a law on the public perception of the court is a criterion of the constitutional validity of the law, would be to assert an uncontrolled and uncontrollable power of judicial veto over the exercise of legislative power. It would elevate the court's opinion about its own repute about to the level of a constitutional imperative"". 

110As explained in Baker by McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [40], the argument required that the phrase ""special reasons"" constituted a criterion devoid of meaning. That was necessary in order to establish the ""charade"". Their Honours rejected that submission at [41]: 

""The qualification to s 13A(3A) may be attended by difficult questions of construction. Whether or not that is so, it is a qualification to which meaning not only can, but must, be given in the context of the facts advanced in any particular case as warranting the description 'special reasons'. The fact that reasons identified as 'special' may (indeed almost certainly would) be relevant to the exercise of the power of determination does not strip the expression 'special reasons' of meaning."" 

111In the present case, as in Baker , the real question raised by the applicants was whether the statutory scheme embodied in s 26 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act rendered the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court ""a charade"", wherein judicial procedure was used as a mask for a legislative decree. That was so, the applicants submitted, because s 26 deemed each director of a company to have committed the offence committed by the company, the defences ostensibly provided in paragraphs (a) and (b), being illusory and devoid of practical content. 

112The criteria to be found in s 26(1)(a) and (b) do not come close, in terms of vagueness and uncertainty, to a phrase such as ""special reasons"". No doubt these provisions may involve questions of construction, but they adopt relatively certain criteria. For example, the concept of ""influence"" in paragraph (a) may involve matters of degree, varying from insignificant to controlling. The Court may need to determine whether the relevant influence must be at least material and not insignificant. The context in which the influence is relevant is the contravention by the corporation. The contravention will need to be specified, and there may be questions as to when, prior to the contravention, the influence could have been effective. The section can thus be seen to give rise to questions of legal construction and questions requiring the determination of factual matters involving evaluative assessment. A criterion is not, for those reasons, devoid of content. Similarly, paragraph (b) envisages that the director was not necessarily in a position to control the action of the corporation in the relevant respect but, being in a position of influence, could yet exercise due diligence to prevent the contravention. The fact that a contravention occurs does not deny the possibility that due diligence was exercised. 

113The applicants accepted that the reversal of the onus of proof did not render the proceedings incompatible with the exercise of judicial power. That concession was inevitable: see the examples of such laws being upheld noted by Gummow J in Nicholas at [152]. That being accepted, the suggestion that the exercise was in someway a charade, seeking to cloak a legislative decree of guilt with the false appearance of a judicial determination, cannot be sustained. 

Challenge to pleading of charges 
114Although the applicants relied upon principles explained by the High Court in Kirk , counsel acknowledged that success for the applicants in the present case would require an extension of Kirk . In broad terms, Kirk required that a charge for a contravention of the statutory obligations of health and safety specify that which the employer did, or omitted to do. For an employer to be able to invoke a defence under s 53 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (NSW) (the equivalent of s 26 of the current Act) by establishing that it was ""not reasonably practicable"" to comply with the provision of the Act or that the commission of the offence was due to causes over which the employer had no control and against which it was impracticable to make provision, it was necessary to know what steps were said to have been required (or avoided): 239 CLR 531 at [15]-[18] and [28]; see also Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority (NSW) [2006] NSWCA 172; 66 NSWLR 151 at [100]-[102]. As the High Court explained at [14]: 

""A statement of an offence must identify the act or omission said to constitute a contravention of s 15 or s 16. It may be expected that in many instances the specification of the measure which should have been or should be taken will itself identify the risk which is being addressed. The identification of a risk to the health, safety and welfare of employees and other persons in the workplace is a necessary step by an employer in discharging the employer's obligations. ... Sections 15 and 16 are contravened where there has been a failure, on the part of the employer, to take particular measures to prevent an identifiable risk eventuating. That is the relevant act or omission which gives rise to the offence."" 

115The applicants sought to go a step further: they contended that, in the case of a director, it was necessary for the prosecutor to specify with precision what the director, as opposed to the company, ought to have done (in the case of an omission) and did not do. 

116There is an air of artificiality surrounding the submission. To adopt a simplified hypothetical based on the present case, let it be assumed that the driver lost control of the truck because of a failure of the braking system. That in turn was caused by a loss of brake fluid which should have been identified had a pre-start check been carried out. The act or omission of the company was failing to require the driver to carry out a pre-start check. 

117Section 12 provides that a person who contravenes, whether by act or omission, a relevant provision is guilty of an offence. In the example, the contravention was a failure to ensure the safety of the driver of the truck. The act or omission of the employer was a failure to require the driver to undertake a pre-start check. Each of those elements must be pleaded by the prosecutor. The employer could then determine whether it had a defence under s 28. If the site manager had taken the driver through the pre-start check, had given clear and firm directions to the driver to undertake the check when commencing work each day, set schedules which provided time for the check to be undertaken, and observed from time to time that the instructions were followed, a defence might be made out. A contravention by the employer would then depend on failure by the manager to have taken one of the necessary steps. In that case, a director might wish to establish that: 

(a) no material risk had arisen; 
(b) but, if it had, the company had taken all reasonably practicable steps to guard against it; 
(c) but, if the case failed at the earlier stages, he or she, as a director, had not been in a position to influence the conduct of the corporation or, if in such a position, had acted with due diligence in seeking to prevent the contravention. 

118In order to be able to defend the charge at the first two stages, Kirk requires that the prosecution plead the elements which would permit that course. In a practical sense, the director may not be able to raise a defence under s 28, until it be known in what respect the company failed in its defence. That, however, does not involve a pleading question in respect of the charge: rather it depends upon the defences pleaded by the company and their success or failure. Thus, in the example given above, the company may have been found to contravene the Act because the manager directed the driver to carry out the pre-start check on a weekly basis, rather than a daily basis, in contravention of the company's safety manual. On the assumption that the director and the company have no conflict of interest, and in the interests of avoiding inconsistent verdicts, one may expect the charges against the company and against the director to be heard concurrently. Nevertheless, procedural fairness may require that the director's defence be adjourned until after a judgment has been given in respect of the charge against the company. The director will then be bound by the outcome in that matter, in respect of that element of the charge against the director personally, but will be able to reserve his or her defence until the outcome is known. 

119The example given is entirely hypothetical and based on assumptions which will not arise in every case. Its purpose is to demonstrate that procedural fairness in respect of a director will not impose pleading requirements on the prosecutor beyond those engaged by the need to plead: 

(a) each element of the charge against the corporation, and 
(b) the status of the defendant as a director or as a person concerned in the management of the corporation and, if necessary, the facts necessary to establish that status, for the purposes of s 26(1). 

120The hypothetical example is not dependent upon whether the corporation is in fact charged. Nor is it necessary for present purposes to address the significance of a conviction in separate proceedings. 

Conclusions 
121I agree with the reasons given by the Chief Justice for refusing leave to amend the summons: at [92]-[93] above. 

122For the reasons given by the Chief Justice, and for the further reasons set out above, I agree that the summons should be dismissed. The applicants should pay the costs of the first respondent in this Court, and of the second respondent on a submitting basis. There should be no order as to the costs of the Attorney General (the third respondent). 

123SACKVILLE AJA: Subject to one matter, I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and with his Honour's reasons. 

124The qualification is that I prefer to express no view as to whether a director who is unable to make out a defence under either s 26(1)(a) or s 26(1)(b) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 can nonetheless rely on the defences available under s 28. It is not necessary to resolve this issue for the purposes of the present case and, although raised in the course of argument, was not the subject of fully considered submissions. In my opinion, the issue should be decided in a case where the facts make it necessary to do so.

3HOEBEN J: 
Offences and sentence 
On 4 June 2010 the applicant and his co-offender, Mark Baker, pleaded guilty before Judge Coolahan to an indictment containing two counts: 

Count 1 - On 17 November 2009 at Belmont in the State of New South Wales in company of each other did enter the dwelling house at 1/9 Thompson Street with intent therein to intimidate Mark Crossley contrary to s111(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years). 

Count 2 - On 17 November 2009 at Belmont did steal a number of DVDs, a DVD player, a digital set top box, a number of LP records, a record player, a Nokia mobile phone, foodstuffs and a cask of wine, the property of Mark Crossley in the dwelling house at 1/9 Thompson Street, contrary to s148 of the Crimes Act 1900 (maximum penalty imprisonment for 7 years). 

4When dealing with count 1, his Honour was asked to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of common assault on Mark Crossley on 17 November 2009 contrary to s61 of the Crimes Act 1900 and an offence of intimidation of Mark Crossley on 30 April 2010, contrary to s13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. With respect to Baker, only the assault matter was included on a Form 1. 

5On 13 October 2010 the applicant was sentenced by Judge Coolahan as follows: 

Count 2 - A fixed term of imprisonment for 15 months commencing 5 June 2010 and expiring 4 September 2011. 

Count 1 - A term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 5 September 2010 and expiring 4 September 2012 with a balance of term of 9 months expiring 4 June 2013. 

The applicant's aggregate sentence for counts 1 and 2 was imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 moths. 

6Before imposing the above sentences, his Honour dismissed an all ground appeal by the applicant against a conviction for an offence of intimidation. As no complaint was made about the original sentence of a fixed term of 8 months imprisonment, his Honour confirmed that sentence but changed the commencement date to 5 December 2009 and the expiry date to 4 August 2010. 

7The applicant has appealed against the severity of the sentence on the following grounds: 

1. That the sentencing judge did err in failing to have regard to the fact that the matters on the Form 1 could have been dealt with in the Local Court and subject to a lower maximum penalty. 

2. That the sentencing judge did err in failing to find special circumstances to justify a variation of the statutory ratio. 

3. (This ground of appeal was not pursued) 

4.That the applicant has a justified sense of grievance in respect of the comparative sentences of the applicant and the co-offender. 

5. That the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

Factual background 

8The applicant and the victim had known each other for over 16 years, having met in Maitland Gaol. For a period of time in May 2009 the applicant and his wife lived at the victim's house. At the time of the offences on the indictment, the victim had a dislocated knee, which required a period of recuperation and him using crutches. 

9At 4pm on 17 November 2009 the victim was at home watching TV when the applicant and Baker entered the room. The victim said ""Not now man, I'm broken"" referring to his knee injury and crutches. The applicant said ""This is the dog I was telling you about"". The applicant grabbed the victim at the back of his head and pressed their foreheads together. The victim described the applicant's face as being full of rage. The applicant said words to the effect of ""You're a dog, I should f---- shoot you. I should f---- stab you."" 

10In relation to the common assault offence on the Form 1, Baker and the applicant grabbed the victim and both began to slap him around the head and face. The applicant and Baker then left. 

11After about a minute, the offenders returned. The victim was very frightened by this time. He pushed his way past the offenders, made it to the front door and then hobbled up the street. As soon as he was in a public place, the victim began to yell ""Get off my property just leave. I don't want you here, just leave"". This alerted the neighbours and the police were called. 

12In relation to count 2, while the victim was away from his house the offenders ransacked it and removed the items which are set out in count 2. 

13On 20 November 2009 the applicant attended Belmont Police Station and was arrested. He took part in an electronically recorded interview, in which he denied involvement in the incident and nominated his wife, Claire, and cousin, Mark Baker, as alibi witnesses. 

14In relation to the second matter on the applicant's Form 1, at around 9am on 30 April 2010 the victim was waiting at a bus stop on the Pacific Highway at Belmont South. He saw the applicant driving his white Toyota Camry along the opposite side of the road. The applicant then made a u-turn, travelled along the breakdown lane and pulled up beside the bus stop where the victim was standing. The applicant began shouting and pointing at the victim who could not understand the words due to traffic noise, but observed the applicant's manner as being threatening and extremely aggressive and menacing. The victim felt scared and intimidated. These events were witnessed by a person who was also waiting for a bus. 

Remarks on sentence 

15His Honour regarded the offences as serious in that count 1 was in the nature of a home invasion. His Honour also had regard to the fact that the victim was disabled and that there were two offenders. He assessed the level of seriousness at just below the mid level, because the offence was of relatively short duration. His Honour did note, however, that there was some degree of premeditation, that the applicant was the instigator and that he was the one who first entered the victim's premises. In relation to count 2, his Honour assessed that offence as somewhere below the mid level of seriousness. He did not think any planning was involved in that offence. 

16In relation to subjective matters, his Honour noted that the applicant was born in March 1966 and was aged 44 at the time of sentence. His Honour noted that the applicant had first come before the Children's Court in 1982. Thereafter there had been offences for entering enclosed lands, assaulting police, driving offences and smoking and possession of Indian hemp. In 1988 he was placed on a recognisance for assaulting a female and was fined for assault and resisting arrest. In 1989 he was dealt with in the Local Court for a number of matters including trespass, counts of assault and resist police, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, offensive behaviour and resisting arrest. In 1991 he was imprisoned for assault. 

17In 1993 he was fined for trespass, imprisoned for breaches of an apprehended domestic violence order, he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and later that year, was imprisoned for assault and again breaching an apprehended violence order. He was fined for offensive conduct and there were some serious driving matters. In 1995 he was imprisoned for a breach of a recognisance and disqualified from driving. In 1996 he was imprisoned for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and fined for remaining upon enclosed lands. In that and the following years he was fined for the possession of prohibited drugs. 

18In 2000 he was imprisoned for resisting police, contravening an apprehended domestic violence order and two counts of assault. In 2002 he was imprisoned for a number of counts of assaulting police and resisting police, as well as contravening apprehended domestic violence orders. He was imprisoned for common assault. In 2003 he was imprisoned for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In 2004 he was imprisoned for four counts of common assault, one count of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order and one count of malicious damage. 

19His Honour concluded this review of the applicant's criminal history as follows: 

""I have not attempted to include all matters on his criminal history in the above review. That history does contain other matters, particularly serious driving offences. He also has matters on his non-fingerprint history. These include an order for community service in 2008 for two counts of intimidating a police officer and a fine in 2009 for passing a valueless cheque."" (ROS 8.4) 

20His Honour remarked that although the pre-sentence report indicated that the applicant had completed a number of anger management programs while in prison, these had been of little assistance to him. His Honour also reviewed a psychological report obtained on behalf of the applicant. The author thought that the applicant was of below average intelligence. Having administered certain psychological tests, the following diagnosis was provided: 

""Mr Papworth experiences temper and aggressive behaviour and this has been a long standing problem for him. Such behaviours are likely to play a prominent role in the clinical picture. These behaviours represent a potential treatment complication and should receive careful attention and treatment planning. He has at no time sought psychological treatment. It does seem that periods of incarceration have not served as a deterrent and it may be that he's acting on impulse, use of drugs and alcohol, as well as poor ability to control his emotions, have contributed to his ongoing offending behaviour. 

Mr Papworth may benefit from sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at anger management. He could assess this through Medicare or Community Health. Before this, however, he should attend a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation program of a long duration such as the three to six month residential program at the WHOS therapeutic community in Cessnock or the residential care program at Niagara Lodge, Central Coast Recovery Association."" 

21The difficulty which his Honour had with the psychological report was that it depended very much upon the reliability of what the psychologist was told by the applicant. The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He told the Court that between 2004 and the occasion of these offences he had tried to turn his life around but had suffered business setbacks and his wife had experienced a breakdown. He thought the victim had contributed to his business setbacks. In relation to his wife's breakdown, he said that she had become very depressed at which time she had poured petrol over herself and suffered serious burns. He said that she needed ongoing assistance. He admitted to having a drug and alcohol problem. His Honour found the applicant to be most unconvincing as a witness, particularly when giving evidence about his motives for going to the victim's house. 

22The applicant's wife gave evidence as to her disabilities following the petrol incident. She said that the business setbacks suffered by the applicant had led to them both using amphetamines and drinking heavily. As a result of her injuries, she could not look after herself and needed assistance. This assistance had been provided by Baker while the applicant was in custody. She stressed that the applicant had changed his ways since 2004. 

23His Honour did not believe much of what the applicant's wife said. He concluded that ""She will go to any lengths to protect Papworth"". (ROS 13.1) 

24His Honour acknowledged that there was a gap in the applicant's criminal history between his release from prison in 2004 and these offences, although there were matters on his non-fingerprint record which indicated the contrary. His Honour was unable to detect any signs of remorse on the applicant's part. His Honour rejected the proposition that the applicant's psychological problems and his below average intellect and the nature of the offence should ameliorate the application of general deterrence. 

25His Honour found that there was some premeditation involved in relation to count 1 in that the applicant had said to Baker ""This is the dog I was telling you about"". His Honour was not able to say to what extent the offence was premeditated. In relation to count 2, his Honour accepted that the offence was spontaneous and unpremeditated. 

26In relation to parity, his Honour summarised the prosecutor's submissions as follows: 

""The learned Crown Prosecutor said that this was not a case calling for parity of sentence. He submitted that there were objective and subjective factors which differentiated the offenders' cases. The offender Papworth has an additional matter on a Form 1 which in itself was a serious offence committed while he was on bail for the matters on the indictment. There is also a marked difference in the criminal histories of both offenders."" 

No submissions were made on behalf of the applicant that the parity principle should apply. 

27On the basis of what the applicant had said to Baker when he first saw the victim, his Honour found that the applicant was the initiator of the visit to the victim's home. His Honour rejected the submission that the applicant's sentence should be reduced because of hardship. On that issue his Honour said: 

""As the evidence stands, I can find no basis for such a finding. I have observed Mrs Papworth in the witness box on two occasions and in the body of the court. While she has an arm in bandages and whilst I accept that she did suffer very significant burns, the degree of restriction and the need for future care is really unknown. I am unable to accept her evidence in this regard and no medical evidence has been presented on the issue."" (ROS 22.1) 

28His Honour had difficulty in identifying any mitigating factors in relation to the applicant except for his plea of guilty for which his Honour allowed a discount of 15 percent. In relation to totality, his Honour said: 

""In relation to Papworth, those sentences should be largely accumulated on the sentence in the appeal matter, that being an entirely separate offence. However, in formulating the sentences and in their structure, I have taken into account the principle of totality."" (ROS 21.4) 

29In relation to special circumstances, his Honour said: 

""I cannot find any basis for a finding of special circumstances in the case of Papworth except to account for partial accumulation of the sentences which I intend to impose in relation to these matters so that the relevant statutory ratio might be preserved. However, I do not take into account the sentence in the appeal matter for that purpose as that was a fixed term sentence. 

In the case of Baker, I think that there should be a finding of special circumstances because I am satisfied that he does have prospects of rehabilitation and I am also satisfied that he would benefit from a longer than normal period of supervision on his release to give him the best chance of getting his life back on track."" (ROS 21.5) 

30His Honour had this to say about the Form 1 matters: 

""In relation to the Form 1 matters, so far as the two counts of common assault are concerned I do not think that they should make a significant difference to sentence because it seems to me that, by and large, they form part and parcel of count 1 on the indictment. However in the case of Papworth, so far as the offence of intimidation is concerned, as I said earlier, to my mind that is a serious offence. The facts disclose it to be so and it was committed whilst he was on bail for the counts on the indictment. More than lip service must be paid to that offence when sentencing him in relation to count 1."" (ROS 22.3) 

Appeal 
Ground 1: That the sentencing judge did err in failing to have regard to the fact that the matters on the Form 1 could have been dealt with in the Local Court and subject to a lower maximum penalty. 

31The applicant submitted that the two Form 1 matters could have been dealt with in the Local Court. In the case of the assault offence, the maximum penalty in the Local Court was imprisonment for 12 months and for the intimidation offence, the maximum penalty was 2 years. By reference to such decisions as R v Palmer [2007] NSWCCA 308 the applicant submitted that when sentencing for such offences it was relevant that the offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court. He submitted that his Honour had erred in that he had not taken this into account but had sentenced on the basis of the higher maximum sentences which were available in the District Court. 

32The applicant relied on his Honour's specific reference to those higher maximum sentences (ROS 1.9) and on the emphasis which his Honour gave to the seriousness of the Form 1 intimidation offence (see [28] hereof). 

33There are a number of reasons why this submission should be rejected. In relation to the assault matter, it is clear from his Honour's remarks on sentence that it ""should [not] make a significant difference to sentence"". Next, his Honour was not sentencing the applicant in relation to the offences on the Form 1. The applicant was sentenced for the counts on the indictment and the offences on a Form 1 were taken into account in relation to the sentence imposed for count 1. 

34Clear guidance has been given as to the approach to be adopted by sentencing courts when Form 1 matters are under consideration, i.e. Attorney General's Application under section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518, (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 (the guideline judgment). There Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL, Grove, Sully and James JJ agreed) said: 

""39 The sentencing court is sentencing only for the ""principal offence"". It is no part of the task of a sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and then apply a ""discount"" for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence. ... 

42 The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. ..."" 

35To follow the approach propounded by the applicant would be to engage in the very process which has been disapproved in the guideline case, i.e. it would involve an attempt to determine an appropriate sentence for the intimidation offence listed on the Form 1. 

36This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground 2: That the sentencing judge did err in failing to find special circumstances to justify a variation of the statutory ratio. 

37The applicant submitted that there was ample evidence before his Honour to justify a finding of special circumstances and that his Honour was in error in failing to make such a finding. The applicant referred to the psychological report with its recommendation for residential rehabilitation and to the need for him to care for his injured wife. The applicant submitted that, on the basis of that material, his Honour should have found special circumstances. 

38The principles applicable to the setting of the non-parole period of a sentence under s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 are well settled. The non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in custody, having regard to all the elements of sentencing, such as punishment, rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender's subjective circumstances: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 627-629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [26]. 

39A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact in respect of which this Court is slow to intervene: R v El Hayek [2004] NNSWCCA 25; [2004] 144 A Crim R 90 at [103]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; Quayle v R [2010] NSWCCA 16 at [41]. In other words, the facts of this case may have allowed his Honour to make a finding of special circumstances but they did not compel him to do so. 

40In Simpson Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, Grove J and Newman AJ agreed) said in relation to what can constitute special circumstances: 

""73 One practical effect of the statutory proportion has been to create a field of disputation which enables matters of fact and judgment to be expressed as if they constituted propositions of law. This arises only because the fetter is expressed in words which suggest a legal standard. It will be a very rare case in which there is no fact capable as a matter of law, of constituting a ""special circumstance"". The decision is first one of fact - to identify the circumstances - and secondly one of judgment - to determine that those circumstances justify a low proportion relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive."" 

41In this case his Honour was not asked to find ""special circumstances"". In Quayle there was material before the District Court capable of amounting to ""special circumstances"" and it was submitted that the judge should have made such a finding. RA Hulme J (Grove and Simpson JJ agreeing), said: 

"" It is difficult to say that a judge was in error for not doing something that he or she was not asked to do. A finding that there are, or are not, special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact: see R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25 per Howie J at [103]. ..."" 

42A common reason for a finding of special circumstances is a need for effective rehabilitation ( R v Silver (1999) NSWCCA 108 per Simpson J at [28]). 

43Apart from the evidence of the psychologist that residential rehabilitation would be useful for the applicant, there was no evidence that he wished to undergo or would undergo such rehabilitation. His Honour found, as he was entitled to, that the applicant did not have prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour was not satisfied as to the state of health of the applicant's wife and as to her needs. This also was a finding open to his Honour. 

44Error has not been identified in his Honour's refusal to find special circumstances. This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground 4: The applicant has a justified sense of grievance in respect of the comparative sentences of the applicant and the co-offender. 

45The applicant submitted that because he and Baker were co-offenders in relation to the same offences, there was no justification for the significant discrepancy between their sentences, i.e. a full term of 3 years compared to 2 years, and a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months compared to 1 year. 

46The applicant submitted that his Honour's findings as to the respective parts played by him and Baker were not open on the evidence. He submitted that the statement ""This is the dog I was telling you about"", together with the applicant being the first person into the victim's apartment, were not sufficient to justify findings that the applicant was the initiator of the entry to the victim's home and that Baker was a ""follower"". The applicant submitted that the important matter which his Honour lost sight of was that both he and Baker were acting in a common purpose. He submitted that the differences between him and Baker were not such as to justify such a large discrepancy between the sentences imposed. 

47An analysis of the facts in this matter make it clear that there is no proper basis for the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance. It was open to his Honour to find on the basis of the applicant's statement and actions at the time of the offence in count 1, that the applicant was the initiator of the entry into the victim's flat. This is particularly so when account is taken of the threats by the applicant to shoot or stab the victim. In addition, the difference in the subjective circumstances of the applicant and Baker were so great as to explain the difference in the sentences. 

48The applicant's criminal history was much more significant than Baker's so that ""a more severe penalty was warranted"" having regard to ""retribution, deterrence and the protection of society"". It was ""legitimate"" for his Honour to take account of the antecedent criminal history because it ""illuminates the moral culpability of the [applicant] in the instant case"" ( Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 477). 

49The intimidation on the Form 1 was a matter which could be properly taken into account to increase the penalty for the principal offence because not only was it a significant offence in its own right, but it had been committed while the applicant was on bail for the instant offences. 

50Finally, his Honour could find no evidence of any genuine remorse on the part of the applicant, whereas Baker was found to be not only remorseful but to have good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour was entitled to reach those latter conclusions even though Baker did not give evidence, on the basis of the evidence of his fiancee and the pre-sentence report. 

51Accordingly, it was open to his Honour to find that the objective seriousness of the count 1 offence for the applicant was greater than that of Baker because the applicant had instigated the offence and Baker was under his influence. In addition, Baker's subjective case was substantially stronger than that of the applicant. It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Ground 5: That the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

52The applicant submitted that by reference to four cases - R v Millar [2005] NSWCCA 202; Regina v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285, Regina v J. Tory and L. Tory [2006] NSWCCA 18 and Leese v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 108 - it could be seen that the sentence imposed on him was outside the available range. The facts of those cases involved home invasions and the sentences imposed were significantly less than that imposed on the applicant. 

53The relevant test in relation to ""manifest excess"" was restated in R v Hayek [2010] NSWCCA 139: 

""37 ... the task is not for this Court to decide whether it would have exercised its discretion differently. The applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33], citing Dinsdale (2002) 202 CLR 321 at 325; endorsed in Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16] - [17]."" 

54While consistency in sentencing is an important consideration and a desirable goal, this Court has repeatedly endorsed the principle in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 that the relevant question on appeal is whether the sentences are within a proper range. It is not a question of whether other sentences can be said to be more or less lenient by undertaking a detailed analysis of other decided cases, as these often possess wide and divergent differences in their objective and subjective circumstances to which the sentencing judge may have attached particular weight. 

55In Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 the plurality reiterated at [54] - [55] the limited value of statistics and previously decided cases in the sentencing process. They concluded: 

""59 As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen , ""[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion"". And, as the plurality pointed out in Wong , appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"". Rather, as the plurality went on to say in Wong , ""[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"". But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition. And, in the present matters, the Court of Criminal Appeal, having described the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders, said that ""the sentence imposed in these matters is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error""."" 

56The Crown in its submissions analysed in detail the four cases relied upon by the applicant. That analysis demonstrated that the factual circumstances of the offences and the subjective features of the offenders were so different to those operating in this case as to make those decisions of very little assistance in assessing the applicant's sentence. 

57What is clear, however, is that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that this sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". If anything, having regard to its objective seriousness, the maximum penalty and the applicant's poor subjective case, this sentence could be properly regarded as lenient. 

58This ground of appeal has not been made out. 

Conclusion 

59The orders which I propose are: 

(i) Leave to appeal be granted. 
(ii) Appeal dismissed.

		15 December 2011",2011-11-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758269,O'Hare v R [2011] NSWCCA 252,"Judgment 

1WHEALY JA : I agree with Simpson J 

2SIMPSON J The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court in Wagga Wagga on 28 September 2010, following his plea of guilty to a single charge of aggravated robbery. The circumstance of aggravation was the use of a corporal violence. 

3Section 95(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years for the offence. 

4Syme DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 4 years and 10 months, commencing on 12 November 2009, and expiring on 12 March 2014, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months, which will expire on 11 March 2013. In so sentencing the applicant, her Honour allowed, in recognition of the plea of guilty, a reduction in the sentence she otherwise would have imposed, of 25%: see R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. 

5She also found, pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act "") special circumstances warranting departure from the statutory ratio there prescribed between the head sentence and the non-parole period. The reason for this was the applicant's need for supervision on release. 

The facts 

6The facts were put before her Honour by way of an agreed statement. They may be briefly summarised. 

7The offence was committed on 9 November 2009. At about 4.30 pm on that day the applicant entered a toy shop in Wagga Wagga, at which he was a regular customer, and at which he had recently made some purchases with which he was (or said he was) dissatisfied. The shop assistant, the victim, was known to the applicant. The victim entered the office area of the store. The applicant grabbed him from behind and punched him to the face and head several times, and twice kicked him in the stomach. He demanded that the victim open the safe and give him money. While attempting to open the safe, the victim dropped the key. The applicant kicked him in the buttocks. He made general accusations against the victim, apparently to do with his previous purchases. He verbally threatened the victim with a gun (although he did not produce, and did not have, a gun). The victim believed that he was armed with a gun and feared for his life. 

8The victim walked from the safe, in an attempt to escape. The applicant took hold of his shirt, and then blocked his exit. He pushed the victim in the direction of the cash register in the store. A female customer with a child was in the store, as was another (female) employee. At the applicant's direction, the victim unlocked the cash register, and gave the applicant the till. The applicant removed notes to the value $1,370. He swung a punch at the victim's head, but missed. He ran from the store. 

9The applicant was arrested three days later, on 12 November 2009. None of the money was recovered. The applicant told police that he had spent the stolen money on poker machines, alcohol and cigarettes. 

The applicant ' s personal circumstances 

10Evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances was put before the court by way of a Pre-Sentence Report dated 14 May 2010, together with an earlier Pre-Sentence Report dated 16 July 2003, and a psychological report dated 19 June 2003. The applicant did not give evidence and no other oral evidence was called. Also before her Honour was evidence concerning a prior offence committed by the applicant, of manslaughter (in 2001) in respect of which he entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced by Whealy J (as his Honour then was) on 25 July 2003, to imprisonment for six years, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The non-parole period expired on 22 November 2006, on which date the applicant was released on parole. It was in respect of this sentencing that the 2003 Pre-Sentence Report and psychological report were prepared. The Remarks on Sentence made by Whealy J were included in the material provided to the sentencing judge. 

11The applicant was born in August 1979. He was 22 years of age when he committed the offence of manslaughter, 30 when he committed the present offence. Whealy J was told that, at the time of the manslaughter, he had no prior convictions, other than for three ""minor summary offences resulting in fines"" and he was treated, for the purposes of that sentencing, as a first offender. Evidence now before this Court tells a rather different story, disclosing a significant criminal history in Victoria, principally of offences of dishonesty such as theft, and motor vehicle offences, but extending to burglary (three offences) and obtaining property by deception, and one offence of assaulting police. A good deal of this record was incurred by the applicant as a juvenile, and he was dealt with in the Children's Court. 

12During the period that he was at liberty on bail in respect of the manslaughter offence, the applicant committed some additional offences, including three of breaking and entering, having goods in custody, and stealing from a dwelling; and six offences of making or furnishing a false or misleading statement. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 3 months in respect of all except the false or misleading statement offences, in respect of which he was fined. 

13As mentioned above, the applicant was released on parole on 22 November 2006. His parole period expired on 22 May 2009, less than four months before he committed the present offence. During his period on parole he committed a number of additional offences, two of driving while his licence was suspended, one of driving while disqualified, and one of driving while there was present in his blood the prescribed quantity of alcohol (low range). 

14The applicant was born, and grew up, in Victoria, in a dysfunctional and violent family. He has had little contact with his biological father; the violence was at the hands of his stepfather. He left school at 16, having been suspended on a number of occasions because of disruptive behaviour. He came to live in NSW at the age of 19. He has had various forms of employment, both in Victoria and NSW. He sustained workplace injuries twice in 2002, that caused ongoing pain. He commenced marijuana use at the age of 16, and, as a result of the pain occasioned by the workplace injuries, he said, he began to use heroin, and became addicted. 

15The author of the earlier Pre-Sentence Report accepted, as did Whealy J, that the applicant's dysfunctional childhood had resulted in considerable and ongoing distress and emotional pain. 

16The applicant also began drinking alcohol at 16, and he attributed the manslaughter to heavy intoxication. He was again under the influence of both drugs and alcohol when he committed the present offence. 

17The author of the 2010 Pre-Sentence Report said that he had a supportive family, who would be able to provide him with assistance in the community, and that he would be able to access appropriate community based counselling. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

18The sentencing judge recounted the facts of the offence, and the applicant's personal circumstances in a way that has not, except for one matter, attracted challenge in this application. In recording the applicant's record, she noted the offence of manslaughter, and said: 

""The [offender's] prior criminal record does not afford him the prospect of leniency. He was convicted of manslaughter in 2003 for an offence committed in 2001. The circumstances of that offence are sufficiently similar to the events in this charge to give concern. In the 2001 offence, the victim was a shop assistant who was uninvolved in any kind of provocation and simply going about his own business. After the exchange of some words, but unprovoked, the [offender] punched the victim once resulting in the victim falling to the ground hitting his head and sustaining a fatal injury. 

The [offender] at that time was reportedly upset at breaking up with his girlfriend and struck out angrily to the victim randomly. The offender was reportedly under the influence of alcohol or some other substance at the time."" 

19Her Honour expressly acknowledged that that offence was not an objective circumstance for the purpose of the application of the proportionality principle set out in Veen v the Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465. She accepted that: 

"" ... it is not open for a court to use prior convictions to determine a boundary of an appropriate sentence."" 

20She went on to say: 

""Prior convictions, however, are pertinent when deciding where a sentence should lie. A prior record is not restricted only to the offender's claim for leniency but can be relevant to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the current offence, a continuing attitude of either disobedience of the law or a continuing state of behaviour. 

In the latter case, that is, where there is a continuing attitude of disobedience or misbehaviour by the offender, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that those purposes of sentencing should receive special consideration from the sentencing court."" 

21She declined to find that the applicant was remorseful, or that he had good prospects of rehabilitation, or to find that he has little risk of re-offending. 

22She was sceptical about the applicant's motivation to address his drug and alcohol issues. 

23In respect of the applicant's drug use, her Honour said: 

""He has admitted to having had drug issues since early adolescence and has used cannabis, amphetamines and heroin. His substance abuse appears to continue. 

Counsel submitted that his drug use on the occasion of this offence was 'a relapse', however apart from the fact that there has been little offending between the 2001 offence and this offence, there is no evidence of actual cessation of substance abuse. The offender does not even report that to be the case to the Probation and Parole officer who prepared the 2010 report. 

... 

Even on balance, it is not possible to make a finding as sought that this offence was committed when the offender had 'relapsed' into drug use. There is simply no evidence that he ever ceased."" 

24Some pages later, she said: 

""This offender apparently had an alcohol problem in 2001 and he still has it. He has not curtailed his drug or alcohol use notwithstanding the parole condition which was to address this issue. 

... 

The present Probation and Parole Report, as I have stated, refers to his response to supervision being marginally acceptable. His drug use as reported in the current Probation and Parole Report is still problematic. It states that the offender shows insight into the 'association between his drug and alcohol use and his offending behaviour', but there is no evidence of any resolve that he has to address this issue."" 

25It was in this context that her Honour declined to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

The grounds of the application 

26Two grounds of appeal were proposed. They are: 

(1) The sentencing judge placed undue weight upon the applicant's prior record. 

(2) The sentence is manifestly excessive. 

Ground 1: prior record 

27In written submissions, counsel for the applicant referred to, and apparently endorsed, submissions that had been put to Syme DCJ to the effect that: 

""... the substantial gap between the offences in 2001 and 2009 would permit the court to draw back from a finding that the applicant demonstrates a tendency or proclivity to offend in that way"". 

28In my opinion, this submission ignores the highly relevant circumstance that, for a period of three and a half years of that time, the applicant was in custody. It is true that the offences committed whilst on bail, and whilst on parole, did not exhibit the tendency to violence seen in the manslaughter offence and the current offence. 

29The real basis of this ground, it seems, was an attack on the finding by the sentencing judge that the circumstances of the manslaughter offence were sufficiently similar to the events giving rise to the present charge ""to cause concern"". It was submitted that: 

""The only real points of similarity between the offences are the influence that substance abuse had on the applicant on each occasion and that those offences had elements of corporal violence."" 

30It was then pointed out that the manslaughter occurred as the result of a single punch to the head; that, while that victim was, like the victim of the present offence, a shopkeeper, that was not a reason for the offence and was coincidental, and the victim was in fact outside his store and encountered by the applicant as a passer-by; and that the applicant was ""highly agitated"" due to an earlier altercation with his girlfriend, and intoxicated. 

31It is true that the victim in the manslaughter offence was not attacked by the applicant because he was a shopkeeper, as was the victim in the present offence. However, that difference to me is of little moment. What is relevant is that, while affected by alcohol (and/or drugs) the applicant made an unprovoked attack on each victim, in the second case for reasons apparently to do with his anger concerning his purchases, and his intention to steal money. 

32The submission was made that the current offence ""is primarily a property offence"". I would reject that submission. The details of the offence, recounted above, show that the applicant exhibited a good deal of violence throughout a sustained period. 

33I would reject ground 1 of the application. 

Ground 2: manifest excess 

34A simple submission was made, that the sentence was outside the range properly available in respect of this offence. It was argued that, where the statutory circumstance of aggravation upon which reliance is placed is the use of corporal violence, the nature and extent of the violence will be relevant to the seriousness of the offence. I entirely accept that proposition. I am conscious that there was no evidence of actual injury to the victim, but nevertheless he was put in considerable fear and threatened with a (non-existent) gun, and punched and kicked numerous times. 

35It was argued that, when the 25% reduction for the plea of guilty is factored in, the starting point of the sentence was 6 years and 5 months, and that this could be seen to be manifestly excessive. I would reject that submission. In my opinion the sentence imposed was one within the range open to her Honour. Under this ground, an attack was also made upon the approach taken by her Honour to the applicant's drug use. 

36As I understood the submission, it was to the effect that the finding that the applicant was unable to establish that his offence was the result of a ""relapse"" was converted into a positive finding that he had not ceased drug use. That is not what her Honour said. Both findings were as to the absence of satisfactory evidence that the applicant had ceased drug use. There is no positive finding either way. Her Honour's observations were correct. 

37As I have said, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed was within the range legitimately available. I would reject this ground of the application. 

38I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 

39HOEBEN J : I agree with Simpson J.

		25 November 2011",2011-11-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758271,Beveridge v R [2011] NSWCCA 249,"Judgment  1BATHURST CJ :  I agree with the orders proposed by James J for the reasons given by him.  2JAMES J :  Adam Beveridge applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Neilson for an offence under s 23(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act of cultivating not less than a commercial quantity of cannabis plants, to which he had pleaded guilty.  3The number of cannabis plants cultivated by the applicant was 3,373, which is greater than the number of 1,000 plants specified in Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act as being the large commercial quantity for cannabis plants.  Accordingly, under s 33(3) of the Act the maximum penalty for the applicant's offence was a fine of 5,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years or both.  The sentencing judge imposed a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of three years six months and a balance of the term of two years six months.  4Since 1 January 2008 there has been a standard non-parole period of 10 years for an offence under s 23(2) of the Act which involves not less than the large commercial quantity of prohibited plants.  Previously, there had not been any standard non-parole period for the offence.  The standard non-parole period applied to the applicant's offence.  The Facts of the Offence  5An agreed set of facts was admitted in the proceedings on sentence and in his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge closely followed this agreed set of facts.  I will now quote parts of his Honour's remarks.  ""In December 2009 police commenced an investigation into the commercial cultivation of cannabis within the Chaelundi State Forest which is located 50 kilometres north west of Dorrigo.  The police received information of a possible cannabis plantation at a certain place in the State Forest which was identified as being Lot 3 in Deposited Plan 753514.  That is Crown land and is currently in the possession of the State Forest.  On Tuesday 12 January 2010 police covertly entered the property and attended the location under the authority of a search warrant.  Police observed a large clear area approximately 20 metres by 50 metres.  A four-foot chicken wire fence had been erected around the clearing.  Within the fenced in area, numerous cannabis plants had been planted in rows.  The plants ranged in height between one metre and one and a half metres.  A sophisticated watering system of poly-pipe and hoses had been set out throughout the site running from three large swimming pools that had been erected, obviously to supply water.  A short distance from the crop site, police observed a well-maintained campsite.  On Wednesday 13 January 2010 police again covertly entered the property.  At 9.50am the police observed the Offender to walk from the direction of a stockyard fire trail through the bush into the crop site.  At the time he was observed to be carrying a large red jerry can.  A generator powering a water pump was heard to start up and the cannabis plants were then commenced to be watered by a sprinkler system.  The Offender was then observed to walk to the middle of the crop site where he met a co-offender, Dennis Gordon-Smith.  The Offender then had a conversation with Gordon-Smith, which is of some significance.  The conversation was this:  Beveridge:  ""Growing aren't they?""  Gordon-Smith: ""They're fucking taking off, look at that ... we got some growth here.""  Beveridge:  ""There's a thousand there.""  Gordon-Smith: ""There'd be fucking thirteen hundred of them holes in the ground, bloody, there's over three thousand planted.""  Both the Offender and his co-offender were observed to walk through the crop site watering the cannabis plants and attending to them.  At 12 noon the police executed a search warrant issued by the Local Court at Coffs Harbour.  When the police were seen at the site the Offender attempted to run away into the bush but when police announced that they were police he stopped and gave himself up.  He was then arrested and cautioned.  When sought to be interviewed at the Coffs Harbour Police Station he declined to take part in an electronically recorded interview.  All told, the police extracted 3373 cannabis plants from within the fenced area.""  6In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge observed that the only evidence of the applicant being involved in the cultivation of the plants was contained in these parts of the agreed facts.  The applicant had declined to be interviewed by police and had not given evidence in the sentence proceedings.  The sentencing judge inferred from the conversation between the applicant and the co-offender Gordon-Smith that the applicant did not know how many plants were being cultivated but the co-offender did know and that this would indicate that the co-offender had a greater knowledge of the cultivation than the applicant had.  7In his remarks the sentencing judge said that he would sentence the applicant ""on the basis of the agreed facts that he was actively involved in the cultivation of a crop which was a commercial crop albeit that his knowledge of the cultivation was clearly less than that of the co-offender"".  Subjective Features  8The sentencing judge found that the applicant at the time of sentencing was 39 years old, that he had been in a stable relationship for ten years with a woman by whom he had two children, that he had worked in various occupations, that he was generally of good character and that he was unlikely to re-offend.  The Sentencing of the Applicant  9The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant, and this application for leave to appeal was heard, before the recent decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 in which the High Court held that R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 had been wrongly decided.  10Applying the law as it had been stated in Way and subsequent New South Wales cases based on Way , the sentencing judge said that the standard non-parole period remained as a guide, even though the applicant had pleaded guilty, and made a finding that the present case fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness.  11The sentencing judge decided that an appropriate starting point for a head sentence was eight years and that this starting point should be discounted by 25 per cent because of the early plea of guilty.  His Honour found special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in that the applicant had not previously been sentenced to any term of imprisonment and had good prospects of rehabilitation.  The Appeal  12The applicant relied on two grounds of appeal against sentence, which were:-  1.  The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to properly identify where, on any given scale of objective seriousness, the offence fell and erred in imposing a sentence which reflected a degree of objective seriousness greater than that which was in evidence.  2.  The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  I will consider these grounds of appeal in turn.  1. The sentencing judge erred in failing to properly identify where, on any given scale of objective seriousness, the offence fell and erred in imposing a sentence which reflected a degree of objective seriousness greater than that which was in evidence.  13Relying on Way and subsequent New South Wales cases based on Way , counsel for the applicant submitted that, even though the applicant had pleaded guilty, the standard non-parole period remained as a reference point or guide post and the sentencing judge was required to find where the applicant's offence lay on the range of objective seriousness for the offence ( Vu v R [2006] NSWCCA 188 especially at [32] and [33]).  14The only finding which the sentencing judge had made about the level of objective seriousness of the applicant's offence was the finding I have already referred to, that the applicant's offence fell below the mid range of objective seriousness.  It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that this finding did not comply, or at least did not fully comply, with what had been held to be the obligation of a sentencing judge in assessing the level of objective seriousness of an offence for which there is a standard non-parole period.  15It had been held by this Court in cases following Way that it was not sufficient for a sentencing judge merely to find that an offence fell above or below the middle of the range of objective seriousness; it was necessary for the sentencing judge to specify the extent or degree to which the particular offence departed from a notional offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  Counsel referred to R v Sellars [2010] NSWCCA 133 at [11] per McClellan CJ at CL and the cases there cited.  In R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 it was held that, when a sentencing judge decided that an offence fell below the middle of the range, the sentencing judge should find whether the offence fell substantially, significantly or only slightly, below a notional mid-range offence.  16Counsel for the Crown on the present application did not really dispute that the sentencing judge had erred in the way contended for by counsel for the applicant.  However, it was submitted by the Crown that the sentencing judge's error was merely an error of process and did not of itself lead to a conclusion that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge should be set aside as erroneous.  17If the law as stated prior to Muldrock were to be applied, then I would have held that the sentencing judge had erred but that his error was merely an error of process.  An error by a sentencing judge in not specifying the extent or degree to which an offence departed from the middle of the range had been characterised as an error of process ( McEvoy at [89]; (Sellars at [11]).  Such an error of process did not of itself lead to a conclusion that the sentence ultimately imposed was erroneous (M cEvoy at [89]; Sellars at [13]).  It was still necessary to determine whether the sentence as ultimately imposed was manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate.  However, when a sentencing judge did not identify where an offence fell in the range of objective seriousness, there was an increased possibility that the exercise of the sentencing discretion might have miscarried ( Sellars at [13]).  18As indicated earlier in this judgment the High Court held in Muldrock that Way had been wrongly decided.  The present application is not a suitable vehicle for a close examination of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock .  However, it can be said with confidence that the first ground of appeal could not succeed, if the law as stated in Muldrock is applied.  Indeed, the whole basis on which the first ground of appeal was founded has been undermined by the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock .  Cases such as Sellars and McEvoy on which counsel for the applicant relied were based on Way .  There is no suggestion in Muldrock that a sentencing judge is required to specify with precision the degree to which the objective seriousness of a particular offence departs from the objective seriousness of a notional mid-range offence.  2.  The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  19Counsel for the applicant submitted that what it was established the applicant had done in the cultivation of the plants was more important in the sentencing of the applicant than was the fairly large number of plants in the plantation, Counsel cited R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at 280 [21].  All that it was established the applicant had done in the cultivation of the plants was that, on one day only, he had been at the site of the plantation and had watered and attended the plants.  Counsel for the applicant also referred to the sentencing judge's findings that the applicant did not know how many plants there were in the plantation and that the applicant's knowledge of the cultivation was less than that of the co-offender Gordon-Smith.  20It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that, given the applicant's limited participation in the cultivation and his limited knowledge of the cultivation, the sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.  21Both counsel for the applicant and counsel for the Crown referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Green and Quinn [2010] NSWCCA 313 and particularly to the schedule to the judgment of R S Hulme J in which his Honour summarised a number of previous decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal on appeals against sentences for cultivating not less than a large commercial quantity of cannabis plants.  22In Green and Quinn the Crown appealed against the sentences which had been imposed on the respondents to the Crown appeal for cultivating not less than a large commercial quantity of cannabis plants.  Complicating factors on the Crown appeal were that the Crown had not appealed against a lenient sentence which had earlier been imposed on a co-offender and that to allow the Crown appeal and re-sentence Green and Quinn might create a disparity with the sentence passed on the co-offender.  The Crown appeal was allowed against both respondents by a majority of the five-judge bench and the two respondents were re-sentenced.  The leading judgment for the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal was the judgment of RS Hulme J.  23Subsequently, the High Court granted special leave to appeal on limited grounds relating to the creation of disparity with the sentence on the co-offender.  On 3 August 2011 the High Court allowed the appeal, restoring the sentences which had been imposed by the original sentencing judge.  No formal judgment has yet been published by the High Court.  24In these circumstances, it would be difficult for this Court to place reliance on certain parts of the judgment of R S Hulme J in the Court of Criminal Appeal or to regard any of the sentences imposed in Green and Quinn as affording clear guidance to whether the applicant's second ground of appeal should be allowed.  However, it appears to me unlikely that the High Court's formal reasons when published will affect any of the summaries in the schedule to RS Hulme J's judgment or the comments in his Honour's judgment about those summaries.  25A comparison of the sentences in the cases summarised in the schedule to his Honour's judgment with the sentence imposed on the present applicant would certainly suggest that the sentence imposed on the applicant was a heavy one.  However, I would accept as valid the comments about those sentences made by RS Hulme J at paragraphs [93] - [95] of his judgment.  In these paragraphs of his judgment his Honour made the points, that many of the decisions summarised in the schedule were decisions on Crown appeals and, furthermore, had been given prior to the passing of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act 2009 and that all the decisions had been given before the standard non-parole period for the offence was introduced.  26In paragraph [94] of his judgment his Honour said about the introduction of a standard non-parole period:-  ""When regard is had to the fact that the Judicial Commission statistics show that of 39 offenders sentenced between January 2002 and December 2008 and to whom the standard non-parole period did not apply, for cultivation of a large commercial quantity of cannabis plants, the highest sentence imposed was for a full term of 6 years (imposed on 4 offenders) and the mean sentence was 3 years (imposed on 10 offenders), it is clear that Parliament intended that sentences for the offence should increase.  I do not of course ignore that the sentences reflected in the statistics will have been after discounts and other matters had been taken into account but the difference between the standard non-parole period and the statistics is too great to be accounted for solely by such matters.  It was contemplated in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [132] et seq. that such an increase might well be a consequence of the introduction of the standard non-parole periods.""  27In Muldrock the High Court recognised that the introduction of a standard non-parole period for an offence might have the effect of increasing non-parole periods in sentences for the offence.  At para [31] of the judgment the High Court said:-  ""It may be, as the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in Way , that for some Div 1A offences there will be a move upwards in the length of the non-parole period as a result of the introduction of the standard non-parole period. This is the likely outcome of adding the court's awareness of the standard non-parole period to the various considerations bearing on the determination of the appropriate sentence...""  28Applying what was said by the High Court in Muldrock , I would agree with RS Hulme J's conclusion that the introduction of the standard non-parole period of ten years for the present offence indicates that Parliament intended that sentences for the offence should increase.  29In my opinion, when regard is had to the maximum sentence of 20 years and to the standard non-parole period of ten years, which under Muldrock (para [27] of the judgment) are two legislative guideposts, it is not possible to say that the sentence passed on the applicant was unreasonable or plainly unjust.  The second ground of appeal should be rejected.  30I concluded that, while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.  31HOEBEN J :  I agree with James J.  **********

Introduction 

1The accused, Darren Paul Smith, is charged with having murdered Russell Lyons at Fairfield on 3 June 1995. Ms Yehia SC, who appears for the accused, made application that the evidence of Dr Paul Bennett, whom the Crown intends to call, be excluded. On 28 June 2011 I overruled the objection. What follows were my reasons for doing so. 

2The deceased's body was located in a carpark at the end of a laneway which runs off Smart Street in Fairfield at about 8.40 am on 3 June 1995. According to Dr Ellis, who conducted the post-mortem, his death was caused by head injuries with alcohol toxicity said to have been a contributing factor. The deceased was fully clothed but his shoes and wallet were missing. Despite a lengthy police investigation, it was not until 7 June 2009 that the accused was arrested. Indeed, he only came to the attention of investigating police when a DNA profile matching his profile connected him to the crime scene. His DNA profile was not entered onto the national database until 2008 following his apprehension in Queensland in relation to an offence of stealing a bicycle. Following analysis, a match was made between his profile and DNA material that was located inside each shoe of a pair of Adidas running shoes. The shoes themselves were located on 5 June 1995 a short distance from where the deceased's body was found. Also found on the shoes was blood staining which matched the deceased's DNA profile. A DNA profile matching that of the accused was also located in the area of the rear right pocket of the jeans which the deceased was wearing when his body was discovered. The Crown case is that the accused killed the deceased during the course of robbing him of his shoes and wallet. The Crown also asserts that the Adidas shoes had been worn by the accused but had then been discarded when he realised that the deceased's blood had found its way onto them during the course of the fatal attack. 

3The Crown alleges that some hours prior to the discovery of the deceased's body, the accused had attempted to steal the deceased's wallet during an altercation which had occurred on The Crescent, Fairfield at about 3.30 am. That incident was witnessed by the deceased's friends and drinking companions, John Byrne and Ian Cross. Their evidence was to the effect that they had been out drinking at various establishments in the company of the deceased that evening and that they were making their way home at the time that the incident occurred. It is apparent that each of them was, by that stage, extremely intoxicated. Each of them gave evidence that the deceased had crossed the street when they heard him call out words to the effect of ""he's got my wallet"". The effect of their evidence is that they then ran across the road in order to assist the deceased. They described his assailant as being an Australian with a goatee beard. Shortly thereafter three males, described as being of ""Islander"" appearance, joined in the altercation. The Crown case is that the deceased eventually ran from the scene of the altercation and turned into Smart Street. He then ended up in the carpark to which I referred earlier. It was at that location, the Crown asserts, that the deceased received the fatal injury or injuries, having been pursued there by the accused. 

The evidence to which objection is taken 

4On 10 September 2009 Dr Bennett, who is a podiatrist, received the Adidas shoes for the purpose of conducting an examination of them. He was also provided with a number of items of footwear belonging to the accused which were seized from him upon his arrest. The footwear consisted of two pairs of work boots, which were described as Blundstone and Redback respectively, and three pairs of thongs. He also had available to him foam and inked impressions and plaster casts of the accused's feet as well as video footage of the accused which displayed his gait whilst he was walking. Dr Bennett provided a report dated 27 October 2009 to which were attached a number of photographs of the items to which I have just referred. In his report Dr Bennett recorded the results of his examination and his opinions arising therefrom. 

5Counsel for the accused initially sought the exclusion of the evidence ""pursuant to ss 79, 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act "". A voir dire was then conducted in relation to the admissibility of Dr Bennett's evidence. Shortly after that procedure had commenced, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he did not intend to rely upon certain parts of the report. That had the effect of significantly reducing the scope of the challenge to his evidence as the following exchange makes clear: 

CROWN PROSECUTOR 

...And for the record, I'm making this statement pursuant to s191 of the Evidence Act 1995. 

The statement re facts is in four parts. 

1: The opinion evidence of Dr Paul John Bennett is proposed to be led by the Crown to show that the accused cannot be excluded as the wearer of the Adidas brand shoes, seized by police on 5 June 1995, from the awning at 113 The Crescent, Fairfield. 

2: Podiatry is an area of specialised knowledge requiring study, training or experience. 

3: Dr Bennett has specialised knowledge in the field of podiatry. 

4: The subject matter of Dr Bennett's opinion evidence is not being led as identification evidence, or anything akin to fingerprint identification; rather, it is being led as evidence of the characteristics and points of comparison to be seen on the Adidas shoes; other footwear seized from the accused by police in 2009 and images and impressions of the feet of the accused taken or caused to be taken by the police in 2009. 

If your Honour pleases. 

HIS HONOUR: Do I take it that that means that there are certain parts of the report that you actually won't be relying upon, or certain parts of the opinion? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. If I can come to that: There are particular phrases or terminology that Dr Bennett has used in his report. Dr Bennett used the expression ""significant correlation"". He also uses the expression, ""Relative uniqueness."" 

Those two phrases are not being relied upon by the Crown, for this reason: I can forecast, I can see that kind of language is liable to be received by a jury as being somewhat ambiguous, with more weight being attached on the noun than the adjective, in the expression ""relative uniqueness."" For that reason the Crown doesn't press that part of the report; rather, we rely upon, simply, to use a more clearer word, the points of similarity that Dr Bennett says existed in the various comparisons he made. 

YEHIA: Your Honour, firstly, to clarify when the Crown refers to agreed statements of facts, it is in relation to an agreed statement of facts in terms of what I understand the Crown seeks to adduce and rely upon from the evidence of Dr Bennett. 

HIS HONOUR: It is really use of material, agreed position in relation to use of material? 

YEHIA: That's right. In terms of that, I can indicate that in relation to the bases of the objection to the material that I related to the Court this morning, in view of the change of position of the Crown and in view of the fact that the Crown does not rely on terms such as ""relative uniqueness"" and ""significant correlation"", our objection to what is now sought to be adduced from Dr Bennett, is pursuant to sections 137 and 135. 

Our position is, and has been, that Dr Bennett has the training as a podiatrist. In view of that, he can give evidence of incidents, points of similarity. It was really a s79 point, directed towards the attempt to individualise or identify, by phrases such as ""significant correlation"" and ""uniqueness"". [at T643-44] 

6Dr Bennett gave the following evidence in chief: 

Q. Is the punch line of your opinion that the man you have referred to as the suspect, the accused, can't be excluded as being the wearer of the shoes, the Adidas joggers, which you have referred to in your report as the crime scene shoes? 
A. Correct. 

Q. Have you at the time set out in your report things that you have referred to as being significant or points of significant correlation? 
A. Correct. 

Q. Could you tell his Honour in summary then why it is you say that the accused man cannot be excluded as being the wearer of those Adidas joggers, the crime scene shoes, matter A? 
A. In summary version, there are a number of characteristics in the footwear recovered from the crime scene which can be identified in the additional evidence which was provided to me so there are a number of corrals (sic) that can be identified. When they are considered in totality they present a particular picture of the user's mechanical function to have created those characteristics. 

Q. What allowance if any, have you taken into account about the fact that the crime scene shoes, the shoes referred to as the matter A shoes, were seized in 1995 and the shoes that were taken from the suspect, the accused man were received some 14 years later? 
A. I have given consideration to how an individual's posture may or may not be affected over a course of a period of time. So, for example, considering the effects age may or may not play, awareness of variables like body mass how that may or may not change, awareness of how procedures, surgical procedures may or may not influence patterns and so forth. So, there is a wide range of matters that are considered, and variations related to that. 

Q. Do human beings reach at any particular age a particular gait, that is the way they walk? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What age is that? 
A. It can vary but it is usually with skeletal maturity which can be mid to late teens. 

Q. What impact would, for example, surgery to a limb, the lower limbs, the legs have on that? 
A. It is very dependent on the extensiveness of the surgery, the outcomes from the surgery. So it is not possible to give a singular answer to that, it can vary. From my experience, gait patterns tend to remain largely unchanged as the goal of surgery is successful to return to function as it was. 

7Dr Bennett's conclusion as to the wear pattern of the Adidas shoes was expressed in the following terms in his report: 

[The] shoes demonstrated a clear asymmetry in wear...meaning the left and right lower limbs are functioning differently from a bio-mechanical standpoint. This is subtle, but nonetheless produces a meaningful wear pattern. 

The right limb is transmitting higher ground reaction forces through the footwear and these forces are also more laterally located. The right foot is striking the ground in a more 'supinated' position than compared with the left foot. The right foot is consequently functioning in a slightly more torsional (and compensatory) manner, resulting in greater plantar flexion of the hallux (big toe) and 1 st metatarsal head. These structures also have less dorsiflexion range of movement, resulting in greater compressive forces in the corresponding insole locations. 

8As I have said, Dr Bennett also examined the footwear seized from the accused after his arrest in 2009 and identified various points of similarity in the wear patterns of each of those boots and two of the three pairs of thongs. (The third pair displayed minimal wear and appear not to have been relied upon for the purposes of the examination). For example, Dr Bennett noted significant plantar flexion of the right hallux when compared to the left hallux and opined that this will produce asymmetrical wear patterns in both the insoles and outsoles of the shoes. 

9Dr Bennett noted that the foam impression of the right hallux is 4mm wider than the left hallux and that both this feature, and the greater plantar flexion of the right hallux, are consistent with the greater outsole wear and compression characteristics of the right hallux insole of the Adidas shoes. 

10Dr Bennett concluded that the foam impressions, the plaster casts and the inked impressions of the accused's feet all demonstrated features that are consistent with the wear characteristics seen in the accused's footwear and in the Adidas shoes. 

11Dr Bennett was then cross-examined at some length by Ms Yehia. She had previously cross-examined him at the committal hearing and the transcript of those proceedings was before the Court. It is unnecessary to set out the details of that cross-examination because Dr Bennett was prepared to concede much of what was put to him. 

12As a consequence, counsel for the accused submitted that the probative value of the evidence of Dr Bennett must be assessed as being ""weak"" in the light of the following matters: 


There is no database from which any statistical analysis can be calculated as to the percentage of males in the general population that create a particular wear pattern. When Dr Bennett expressed the opinion that the accused cannot be excluded as the wearer of the shoes there is no statistical certainty that attaches to that statement. 

The comparison of the Adidas shoes and the various footwear and samples taken from the accused were made 14 years apart. Dr Bennett acknowledged that a number of variables might impact upon lower limb functioning over a period of time. The variables that may impact upon lower limb functioning and thereby wear patterns are age, disease, changes in body mass index, trauma and surgery. Dr Bennett agreed that it is preferable to conduct a comparison between a crime scene sample of shoes and a reference sample of the same age. 

Dr Bennett did not have information about any change in the accused's body weight between 1995 and 2009. He was given a number of black and white photographs, none of which depicted the weight of the accused in 1995. Dr Bennett agreed that changes in the weight of an individual could impact upon the wear patterns of shoes because the more a person weighs the greater the amount of frictional forces between the outsole and the ground. 

Dr Bennett conceded that trauma and surgery could potentially impact upon lower limb function, gait and distribution of peak pressure thereby affecting wear patterns. He also conceded that osteoarthritis could result from a fracture to the knee, thereby impacting on wear pattern. (I interpolate that there was no evidence that the accused had ever actually suffered from osteoarthritis). 

Dr Bennett apparently did not have access, at the time of preparing his report, to the accused's medical records which reveal that he had sustained a comminuted fracture to the right patella following an accident in 1997. Having looked at the records, Dr Bennett agreed that the fracture ""potentially"" affected lower limb function. 

Dr Bennett agreed that it is impossible to assess the impact on the accused's lower limb functioning over the years caused by one, let alone a combination, of any of the variables to which reference was made earlier. 

It was submitted that the probative value of the comparison made by Dr Bennett is further weakened by virtue of the fact that he compared the Adidas shoes with footwear belonging to the accused which was of a different type. Dr Bennett conceded that it is desirable to compare ""like with like"" so as to make the results of the comparison as to wear patterns more reliable. 

It was submitted that the probative value of the evidence is also weakened by the fact that while a number of similarities were noted, Dr Bennett identified a number of dissimilarities between wear patterns on the Adidas shoes and some of the items of footwear seized from the accused, including an apparent difference in size between the Adidas shoes and those items which were seized from the accused. 

13At one stage counsel went so far, in written submissions, to contend that ""it is arguable that the evidence of Dr Bennett does not even meet the requirements of s 55"". Counsel further submitted that ""[h]is evidence only has minimal probative value insofar as it identifies similarities between the Adidas shoes and the accused's footwear and feet in 2009. That evidence, even if accepted, cannot rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding, namely, the accused's wear patterns and the condition of his feet in 1995."" 

14It may be observed that Dr Bennett also said in his report that, notwithstanding the factors to which I have referred, ""gait patterns tend to remain relatively unchanged over time unless some or all of the above change to a major extent."" 

15Finally, it may be noted that the accused did not give or call evidence during the course of the application. 

The relevant legislative provisions 

16S 55 is in the following terms: 

(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. 

17""Probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Act and means ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"". 

18Section 135 is in the following terms: 

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 

(b) be misleading or confusing, or 

(c) cause or result in undue waste of time. 


19Section 137 is in the following terms : 
In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 

The relevant authorities 

20A convenient starting point is Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650 in which Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in a joint judgment observed: 

As is always the case with any issue about the reception of evidence, identification evidence being no exception, the first question is whether the evidence is relevant. No attention was given to this question in the arguments advanced at trial, or on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, but that question must always be asked and answered. Further, although questions of relevance may raise nice questions of judgment, no discretion falls to be exercised. Evidence is relevant or it is not. If the evidence is not relevant, no further question arises about its admissibility. Irrelevant evidence may not be received. Only if the evidence is relevant do questions about its admissibility arise. These propositions are fundamental to the law of evidence and well settled. They reflect two axioms propounded by Thayer and adopted by Wigmore. 

""None but facts having rational probative value are admissible"", 
and 
""All facts having rational probative value are admissible, unless some specific rule forbids."" 

In determining relevance, it is fundamentally important to identify what are the issues at the trial. On a criminal trial the ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged. They will, therefore, be issues about the facts which constitute those elements. Behind those ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue. In proceedings in which the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies, as it did here, the question of relevance must be answered by applying Pt 3.1 of the Act and s 55 in particular. Thus, the question is whether the evidence, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment by the tribunal of fact, here the jury, of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. [at 653-54] (footnotes omitted) 

21In R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49, Sully J, with whom other members of the court agreed, observed that: 
[I]n considering whether [the] evidence was admissible in terms of s.55 of the Evidence Act , it is in my opinion important to keep clearly in mind a distinction between the question whether a particular piece of evidence is probative, and therefore admissible at all; and the very different question of the weight fairly to be given to that evidence after it has been admitted properly. 

It is to be observed that s.55 speaks of a rational effect that is brought about ""directly or indirectly"" . This is very broad language, and it suggests, in my opinion, a wide rather than a narrow focus to the inquiry whether a proffered piece of evidence has the rational potential which s.55 requires. [at paras 18-19] 

22In considering s 137 of the Act, I must have regard to what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said about its operation. In R v Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 

After the enactment of s137, the same approach was taken in R v Singh-Bal (1997) 92 A Crim R 397 at 403 and R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [255]-[256], in both of which the formulation from R v Carusi was expressly adopted, i.e. the evidence must be ""taken at its highest"" in order to determine its probative value. ... 

The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach. 

In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment ..."". The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has ""probative value"", as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty. 

This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must ""rationally affect"" the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in Adam supra, a ""test"" of 'rationality' also directs attention to capability rather than weight. 

There will be circumstances, as envisaged by Simpson J in Cook supra, where issues of credibility or reliability are such that it is possible for a court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. In that limited sense McHugh J's observations in Papakosmas that ""considerations of reliability are necessarily involved"" have application. 

To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible ""basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function"". In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s137. ... 

There is now a considerable body of case law in this Court which emphasises the fact that the assessment of this element requires any prejudice to be unfair . There must be a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some way and that that risk will exist notwithstanding the proper directions which it should be assumed the Court will give. (See e.g. R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 151.) (I do not need to refer to the reasoning in some cases that procedural prejudice may be sufficient.) 

To use the test of McHugh J in Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [51]: 

""It is only when the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect that the Crown can be deprived of the use of relevant but weak evidence. And evidence is not prejudicial merely because it strengthens the prosecution case. It is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or contents of the evidence may influence the jury or divert the jurors from their task."" 

(See also R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364 and R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [252].) [at paras 51, 60-64, 72-73] 

23In R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142, James J, with the concurrence of other members of the court, observed: 

It not infrequently happens that evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown in a criminal trial is open to more than one interpretation or is capable of giving rise to more than one inference. However, provided that the evidence is capable of bearing the interpretation or of giving rise to the interference (sic) contended for by the Crown, the fact that the defence can suggest some other interpretation or inference which would be consistent with the innocence of the accused does not, of itself, show that any probative value the evidence has is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 

It is part of the function of the jury as the judges of the facts to determine what interpretation should be given to evidence they accept and to determine what inferences should be drawn from evidence they accept. It is frequently part of the function of the jury to determine which, if any, of a number of competing inferences should be drawn. [at paras 38-9] 

24See also Louizos v The Queen (2009) 194 A Crim R 223 [at paras 30-36]. 

25Although it is not a case that is directly concerned with s 135 or s 137, it is instructive to make further reference to the decision in Festa (supra) upon which Spigelman CJ relied in Shamouil . That case was concerned, inter alia, with evidence of identification made by four witnesses to an armed robbery. Gleeson CJ observed: 

In [ Murphy v The Queen (1994) 62 SASR 121], the number of witnesses who selected the same photograph was significant. But the case shows how evidence falling short of positive identification may nevertheless be of significance, having regard to the whole of the evidence. 

The argument that the evidence of the four witnesses should have been excluded turned upon what were said to be deficiencies in its quality. 

The strength or weakness of evidence may depend in part upon the use that might be made of it. Mr Hill's selection of three photographs, including one of the appellant, of itself could not support a positive conclusion that the woman he saw was the appellant. But the evidence did not stand alone. And even if it only showed that the woman he saw was consistent in appearance with the appellant, that was a material fact. Similarly, the cogency of the evidence of the acts of identification at the Southport courthouse depended in part upon what was sought to be made of it. As positive identification of the appellant, it was weak. In fact, the evidence of Ms Ogilvie and Mr James did not amount to positive identification. But as evidence that the appearance of the appellant was consistent with that of the wigged female seen near the bank at the time of the Biggera Waters robbery, it was of some probative value. 

Questions as to the admissibility of evidence may be related to, but are different from, questions as to whether the totality of the evidence in a case is sufficient to sustain a jury's verdict, or questions as to the warnings that need to be given to a jury about the use that may properly be made of the evidence. If evidence is of some, albeit slight, probative value, then it is admissible unless some principle of exclusion comes into play to justify withholding it from a jury's consideration. It is not enough to say that it is ""weak"", and, as already mentioned, whether it is weak might depend on what use is made of it. The totality of the evidence may be such as to render a conviction unsafe. But that does not affect admissibility. And the jury may need to be warned that evidence, if accepted, only shows consistency of appearance between the person and the offender; a fact which may or may not be of much significance depending upon other matters. Evidence of blood sampling may be relevant and admissible, for example, even though, standing alone, it only establishes that it is consistent with the accused being the offender. Evidence may show that an accused was near the scene of a crime. Such evidence, on its own, does not show that the accused committed the crime. That does not mean it is of no probative value; in the end, it will have to be considered together with all the other admissible evidence. [at paras 11-14] 

26McHugh J said: 

Unfortunately, another class of evidence is sometimes called ""circumstantial identification evidence"". It is evidence that asserts that the general appearance or some characteristic or propensity of the accused is similar to that of the person who committed the crime. It may be evidence of age, race, stature, colour or voice or of a distinctive mark or gait. It differs from positive-identification evidence in that the witness does not claim to recognise the accused as the person who committed the crime or was present in circumstances from which it can be inferred that the accused committed the crime. Although such evidence does not directly implicate the accused in the crime or as being present in incriminating circumstances, it is admissible evidence. It is proof of a circumstance - usually, but not always, weak - that with other evidence may point to the accused as the person who committed the crime. It will be weak evidence, for example, when it merely proves that the perpetrator and the accused are persons of the same ethnic background. It may be nearly conclusive evidence of identity when it proves that the accused and the perpetrator have used a unique modus operandi which is admissible in accordance with the principles concerning the admission of similar fact evidence. 

When circumstantial identification evidence has no element of positive identification, it usually does not have the potential unreliability of positive-identification evidence. A judge is not automatically required to warn the jury concerning the dangers of circumstantial identification evidence. But the circumstances of a particular case may require a warning. When a witness claims that the facial features of the accused are similar to those of the perpetrator, it would usually be appropriate to give the standard warnings given in cases of positive-identification evidence. But the warnings that must be given to juries concerning positive-identification evidence do not apply to most forms of circumstantial identification evidence . ... 

The judicial discretion to exclude evidence in criminal cases applies to circumstantial identification evidence as much as it does to positive-identification evidence. When a trial judge is asked to exclude circumstantial identification evidence on the ground of unfairness, the judge must examine its probative value and its prejudicial effect (if any). In Alexander v The Queen - a case of positive-identification evidence from photographs - Gibbs CJ said: 

""[A] trial judge has a discretion to exclude any evidence if the strict rules of admissibility operate unfairly against the accused. It would be right to exercise that discretion in any case in which the judge was of opinion that the evidence had little weight but was likely to be gravely prejudicial to the accused."" 

... 

In exercising the discretion to exclude positive-identification evidence, the judge must take account of the risk that that evidence will be given greater weight than it deserves and will operate to the prejudice of the accused. In considering that risk, the judge must determine whether the Domican directions that will be given will be likely to overcome the prejudice that might ensue without those directions. If, despite those directions, the risk of prejudice remains and the evidence is weak, the proper exercise of the judicial discretion may require the exclusion of the evidence. Because circumstantial identification evidence is usually no more presumptively prejudicial than other forms of circumstantial evidence, the occasions for its exclusion under the unfairness rule are likely to be fewer than the occasions for excluding positive-identification evidence. [at paras 56-7, 63, 65] 

27There are a number of instances in which courts have admitted evidence of the kind presently under consideration. The Crown placed considerable reliance upon Rose v R (1993) 69 A Crim R 1 in which evidence was given by two podiatrists who had made casts of the suspect's feet. They found that they had some unusual features. They also examined the shoes that the suspect was wearing at the time of the examination and two pair of shoes which had been found at the crime scene. The podiatrists concluded that the shoes left at the crime scene had certain characteristics which meant that the suspect could have worn those shoes. A challenge to the admissibility of the evidence was rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia. The Court observed that ""[p]odiatry is something in the nature of a science which requires a course of study in order to obtain knowledge of it. Each witness had embarked on and completed a course in podiatry"" (at 10). 

28The trial judge in Rose instructed the jury about the evidence in the following fashion: 

It is important to remember what the podiatrists purported to say. The Crown sought to adduce Crown evidence from podiatrists, not on the subject matter of whether by reference to a comparison of the accused's feet and wear marks in the shoes allegedly found apparently dumped in a drain near the scene of these crimes, these were shoes that had been worn by the accused, but on the limited subject matter of whether, by reference to such a comparison, those shoes could have been worn by the accused. 

The subject matter of the opinion evidence in question is not to be viewed as identification evidence, or anything akin to fingerprint identification, but rather as evidence of the characteristics and points of comparison said to be seen on both the feet and the shoes from which circumstantial evidence and inferences may ultimately be sought to be drawn that there was a connection or a correspondence. [at 10-11] 

29Bollen J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, approved of those directions. His Honour said: 

This is certainly in no way an overstatement. I think that the learned trial judge could have left it to the jury as evidence much more strongly than he suggested. I think it was some evidence connecting the accused with the crime. But it was left as a factor or one point in the mass of circumstantial evidence capable of implicating the appellant. [at 11] 

30There are several other decisions concerning evidence of the kind presently under consideration to which the Court was not referred. In Parish v The State of Western Australia [2008] WASCA 90 a pair of boots which the suspect was wearing were seized by police. A podiatrist concluded that they had a tread pattern that was 'very very similar' to the boot print left in the premises that had been robbed. He also gave evidence that the foot impression left in the boots matched the foot impression taken from the suspect. His evidence was that there were no other wear marks of any other wearer on the inner sole. A police forensic officer gave evidence that the boot print from the appellant's boots ""shared the same class characteristics as to the size, shape, style and pattern, although he accepted that it could not be excluded that the boot print could have been made by another pair of boots of the same size and displaying the same class characteristics"". The Court observed that ""the evidence about the similarity of the boot prints was therefore important circumstantial evidence to be taken into account by the jury"" [at para 33]. 

31In Mainwaring v R [2009] NSWCCA 207 both Dr Bennett and another podiatrist gave evidence that they had compared the wear patterns on shoes seized from the appellant and another pair of shoes which were relevant to the charge which he was facing. The effect of his evidence was that he could not exclude the possibility that the appellant had been the wearer of those other shoes. There was no challenge to the admissibility of that evidence. 

32In R v N, GF and N, SG (No 2) [2010] SASC 8, two pairs of shoes which were said to have been discarded by the two accused, who were charged with murder, were subjected to forensic examination by a podiatry expert. The podiatrist concluded that one pair of shoes could not be excluded as having been worn by one of the accused whilst the other pair of shoes could not be excluded as having been worn by the other accused. The trial judge, over objection, admitted the evidence. N, GF was convicted while N, SG was acquitted. N, GF's appeal against conviction was dismissed: R v Newman [2011] SASCFC 36. It does not appear that there was any challenge to the trial judge's ruling. 

33The Crown also placed reliance upon R v Tang (2006) 161 A Crim R 377, a case in which the appellant was convicted of an armed robbery. The Crown led evidence from an expert who purported to identify points of similarity from images of one of the suspects and the appellant, based on facial and body mapping techniques. The case turned largely upon a consideration of whether the evidence fell within the scope of s 79 of the Evidence Act. It was held that whilst there appeared to be an area of ""specialised knowledge"" based on facial identification, the same could not be said of body mapping. 

34Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed, observed: 

At common law there is a distinction between evidence of resemblance and evidence of identification. (See Murphy v The Queen (1994) 62 SASR 121 at 123-124; Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [10] - [11]; Pitkin v The Queen (1995) 80 A Crim R 302 at 304-305.) Evidence of similarity may be relevant and admissible as part of a circumstantial case. There was no suggestion on this appeal that evidence of this character was not admissible. ... 

In the present case, as his Honour held in his judgment on the voir dire features displayed on the videotape or on the stills taken from the videotape were not such as the jury could themselves make a comparison. The process of computer enhancement and magnification of the images and the detailed comparison with undisputed photographic images of the Appellant, was evidence of similarity that was, in my opinion, relevant and admissible. [at paras 83, 85] 

35Counsel for the accused sought to distinguish Rose upon the basis that there were ""prominent and unusual features"" of that offender's feet, that the examination of the offender's feet took place within 6 months of the offence, and that no application had been made that the evidence should be the subject of discretionary exclusion. It was sought to distinguish Tang upon the basis that no application to exclude the evidence had been made pursuant to ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act and because the relevant comparison had taken place within 8 months of the offence. In relation to Festa it was submitted that once again the relevant comparison was conducted within months. 

36Whilst those contentions are undeniably correct as a matter of fact they do not serve, in my view, to diminish the significance of the general propositions which emerge from those authorities. Nor would I accept the submission that Shamouil should be distinguished upon the basis that there was no challenge in the present case to the credibility or reliability of Dr Bennett. In my view the central challenge to Dr Bennett's conclusion was very much based upon its asserted unreliability. 

Consideration 

37It is axiomatic that the Crown must establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. In the present case, the critical question which the jury must determine is whether the Crown can establish that the accused caused the death of Russell Lyons. The accused denies that he did so and does not accept any responsibility for having done so. The identification of that issue is the ""first step in the evaluation of the probative value of any item of evidence"": R v Mundine (2008) 182 A Crim R 302 [at 34]. If the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, then it must be rejected: R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326. See also R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 182 at 199. 

38As I have said, the ultimate fact in issue is whether the Crown can establish that the accused is the person who killed the deceased. Highly relevant to the proof of that matter is what amounts to a subsidiary fact in issue, namely whether the Crown can establish that the accused was wearing the Adidas shoes on the evening in question. Clearly any connection which could be established between the accused and those shoes (which of course had the deceased's blood upon them), could constitute an important piece of evidence in the case which the Crown seeks to establish. 

39As I have observed, the Crown is not relying upon the opinion of Dr Bennett as providing evidence that the accused is the wearer of the Adidas shoes. The evidence, at its highest, is capable of establishing only that he may have been the wearer of those shoes. Indeed in his report Dr Bennett said that ""wear patterns per se are not identifiable with any particular individual"". Nevertheless, Dr Bennett's opinion has the capacity to establish a connection between the accused and the shoes, and as such constitutes a piece of circumstantial evidence, which along with other evidence, is capable of establishing the fact in issue to which I referred earlier. It follows that his evidence meets the requirements of s 55 of the Act. 

40I readily accept that Dr Bennett's opinion is open to challenge. Indeed, it may very well be that the jury would be disposed, on the strength of the matters identified by counsel for the accused, not to accept it. However, as the authorities make clear, that determination remains the province of the tribunal of fact even if, as counsel for the accused contended, it has ""only minimal probative value"". 

41In relation to the argument adduced pursuant to s 137, counsel for the accused submitted that the danger of unfair prejudice arose in a number of respects. First, it was submitted that there was a real risk that the jury would place ""undue weight on the evidence of Dr Bennett by virtue of the fact that he is put forward as an expert witness."" Secondly, it was submitted that there was a real risk that the jury would impermissibly treat Dr Bennett's opinion that the accused could not be excluded as the probable wearer of the shoes as ""equat[ing] to inclusion."" 

42I do not accept those submissions. On the contrary, I have little doubt that with the assistance of counsel, I will be able to fashion directions to the effect that the jury is not to embark upon a process of reasoning of the kind which counsel has identified. Moreover, I would be prepared to give those directions both at the time when Dr Bennett gives his evidence and also during the course of the summing up. Furthermore, I intend to give further directions and/or warnings concerning the perceived weaknesses in Dr Bennett's evidence in a fashion which conforms with what the High Court said in Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 561-2. 

43It was also submitted that the accused has been prejudiced by the fact that he cannot establish what wear pattern his feet created in 1995 because he is unable to produce evidence of his footwear or the condition of his feet or his gait as at that time. Once again, in my view that is a matter which can be pointed out to the jury. That said, the fact that the accused cannot produce evidence of that kind does not necessarily mean that he has actually suffered prejudice. It cannot simply be assumed, as counsel for the accused appears to have done, that had he been able to adduce evidence as to his wear pattern in 1995 that it would have necessarily assisted his case. 

44It follows, in my view, that the challenge to the evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Act, must fail. 

45In conclusion, I note that although s 135 was also relied upon, no separate argument was advanced in relation to its application. For similar reasons to those which have already been provided, I reject the submission that that provision is engaged in the present case.

2758283,Axiak b.h.t. D. Axiak v Ingram [2011] NSWSC 1447,"Judgment 

1The plaintiff brings a claim through her tutor for damages for injuries she sustained in a motor vehicle accident on 26 June 2008. The plaintiff, with her younger sister, Mikaela, alighted from a school bus which was travelling north along Sackville Road, Ebenezer. The plaintiff was struck by the defendant's vehicle as she crossed onto the eastern side of the road. She suffered catastrophic injuries. I was informed by Mr Campbell, senior counsel for the plaintiff, that she has qualified for the Lifetime Care and Support program because of the gravity of her injuries. 

The statutory basis for the plaintiff's claim 

2The plaintiff has, by the filing of an Amended Statement of Claim on 15 September 2011, abandoned any allegation of fault on the part of the defendant. Rather, she alleges that the accident was a blameless accident within the meaning of s 7A of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) ( the Act ), which forms part of Division 1 of Part 1.2 of the Act. That Part makes provision for ""No-fault claims - children and blameless accidents"" and comprises two Divisions: Division 1, entitled ""Recovery for blameless accidents"", and Division 2, entitled ""No-fault recovery by children"". 

3Section 7A of the Act defines ""blameless accident"" in the following terms: 

""... means a motor accident not caused by the fault of the owner or driver of any motor vehicle involved in the accident in the use or operation of the vehicle and not caused by the fault of any other person."" 

4Section 7B provides that the effect of an accident being found to be a ""blameless accident"" within the meaning of s 7A is that the plaintiff's injuries are deemed to be the result of the defendant's fault. Effectively, this gives the plaintiff the same right to damages as if the defendant had been negligent. 

5Section 7C provides that an averment by the plaintiff that the accident was a blameless accident is evidence of the fact in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Section 7D provides that Division 1 of Part 1.2 applies to accidents which occurred after the commencement of the Division. The Division commenced on 1 October 2007 and therefore applies to the accident the subject of the proceedings. Section 7E excludes from the operation of the Division recovery by any driver who caused the accident. Section 7F provides: 

""This Division does not prevent the reduction of damages by reason of the contributory negligence of the deceased or injured person. 
Note. The contributory negligence of a deceased or injured child does not reduce damages of the kind to which the special entitlement to damages conferred by Division 2 applies. See section 7P."" 

6Division 2 of Part 1.2 introduces a scheme whereby all children under the age of 16 who die or are injured in motor vehicle accidents are entitled to recover treatment and care expenses irrespective of whether they can establish fault on the part of the driver, and irrespective of whether they themselves were guilty of contributory negligence (except where the child's conduct probably constituted a serious offence, being an offence punishable by imprisonment of 6 months or more). 

7The relationship between Divisions 1 and 2 is governed by s 7P, which provides: 
""(1) This Division does not apply in a case to which Division 1 (Recovery for blameless accidents) applies, subject to subsection (2). 

(2) In a case in which this Division would confer a special entitlement to recover damages in respect of the death of or injury to a child but for the fact that the case is one to which Division 1 applies, a liability for damages arising under that Division of the kind to which that special entitlement relates (including any such liability of an insurer under section 83 or 84) is not to be reduced on account of the contributory negligence of the child (despite section 7F)."" 

8It follows from s 7P that a child who has been the victim of a blameless accident is entitled to damages in accordance with Division 1. However, where the child is guilty of contributory negligence there is a reduction in the damages to which he or she is entitled, except where the damages relate to the heads of damage specified in s 7J(3), namely: 
""(a) hospital, medical and pharmaceutical expenses, 
(b) rehabilitation expenses, 
(c) respite care expenses, 
(d) attendant care services expenses, 
(e) funeral or cremation expenses"" 

in which case there is no such reduction. 

The plaintiff's contentions as to the proper construction of Division 1 

9The plaintiff contends that she is entitled to damages under Division 1 because the accident was a blameless one within the meaning of s 7A, subject to any reduction for contributory negligence pursuant to s 7F. 

10The plaintiff contends that the words ""any other person"" in the expression ""not caused by the fault of any other person"" exclude the plaintiff. Her primary submission is that contributory negligence does not amount to ""negligence"" and accordingly does not amount to ""fault"". 

11The plaintiff relies on the definition of ""fault"" in s 3 of the Act which provides that ""'fault' means negligence or any other tort"". She says that this means that someone can only be at fault if he or she is a tortfeasor and that these words are not apt to include someone who is guilty of contributory negligence. She says that, having regard to the definition, there is no need to add words to s 7A to exclude the plaintiff, since the plaintiff is already excluded by the definition. Accordingly, even if her own negligence played some role in causing the accident, it cannot be said to have been caused by her fault. 

12The plaintiff says further that s 7F provides for the consequences of her conduct and therefore the legislature must have contemplated that an accident could still be a ""blameless accident"" within the meaning of s 7A, in circumstances where the plaintiff has been guilty of contributory negligence. The plaintiff argues that this construction is required since otherwise s 7F has no work to do. In answer to the defendant's contention that s 7F has work to do if it is confined to contributory negligence which did not cause the accident (as to which see further below), the plaintiff says that this is an artificial, and unstated, limitation on the ambit of s 7F, which Parliament cannot have intended. 

13The plaintiff seeks to fortify her argument that s 7A does not extend to the plaintiff's own fault by reference to s 7B. Mr Campbell submitted that s 7B not only deems an owner or driver who is not at fault to be at fault, but it also, by subsection (2), authorises apportionment between two blameless owners or drivers. The plaintiff argues that s 7B(2) provides a warrant for apportioning responsibility between the defendant, who while not at fault is deemed to be at fault, and the plaintiff who may be guilty of contributory negligence. Such an apportionment could be done, so the argument goes, by reference to ""causal potency"" rather than culpability, since the blameless defendant has, by definition no culpability, other than that which is deemed. 

14Mr Campbell relied on following passage from Astley v Austrust Limited (1999) 197 CLR 1, at 11, per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ and in particular the sentence which is underlined: 
""At common law, contributory negligence consisted in the failure of a plaintiff to take reasonable care for the protection of his or her person or property ... Although conduct amounting to contributory negligence may also constitute the breach of a duty which the plaintiff owes to the defendant, a plaintiff can also be guilty of contributory negligence notwithstanding that he or she owes no duty to the defendant or any third person. A pedestrian, for example, owes no duty to a speeding driver to avoid being run down but is guilty of contributory negligence if he or she fails to take reasonable care to keep a proper lookout for speeding vehicles ... A person may also be guilty of contributory negligence even though the negligence of the plaintiff did not contribute to the accident which caused the damage. That is because contributory negligence is concerned with the failure of the plaintiff to protect his or her person or property against damage and not with whether the failure contributed to the accident ."" [Emphasis added, citations omitted.] 

15He says that because a pedestrian owes no duty to a speeding driver, there can be no doubt that the plaintiff in the instant case did not owe a duty to the defendant. Accordingly, the plaintiff submits that she could not have been at fault because she owed no duty to anyone that was breached and is not otherwise alleged to be a tortfeasor. 

16The plaintiff referred to s 7K, which is in Division 2, which provides: 
""(1) This Division applies even if the death of or injury to the child was caused by the fault of the child, except as provided by this section. 

(2) A court is not to award damages pursuant to this Division in respect of the death of or injury to a child if the court is satisfied that: 

(a) the death of or injury to the child occurred at the time of, or following, conduct of the child that, on the balance of probabilities, constitutes a serious offence, and 

(b) that conduct contributed materially to the death or injury or to the risk of death or injury. 

(3) A serious offence is an offence punishable by imprisonment for 6 months or more. 

(4) This section operates whether or not the child whose conduct is alleged to constitute an offence has been, will be or is capable of being proceeded against or convicted of any offence concerned. 

(5) There is to be no reduction of the damages provided for by this Division by reason of the contributory negligence of the deceased or injured person, except as provided by this section."" 

17The plaintiff concedes that the word ""fault"" when used in Division 2 in s 7K is apt to include contributory negligence, including contributory negligence which does not involve the party being in breach of any duty owed to another. The plaintiff accepts that Divisions 1 and 2 were part of the same legislative package and were introduced to Parliament at the same time, although their commencement dates were different. 

18The plaintiff submits that, even though the word ""fault"" is used in Division 2 to include contributory negligence, it ought not be found to bear the same meaning in Division 1. The plaintiff contends that the context in which the word ""fault"" appears in Division 2 is sufficient to displace the definition in s 3, but it is not sufficient to displace it in Division 1. She also submitted that this reading of s 7K was consistent with s 7A and that the words ""was caused by"" in s 7K means ""was caused solely by"". The plaintiff further submitted that although there may be ambiguity in s 7K, this ambiguity did not affect s 7A, whose meaning is clear, having regard to the definition in s 3. 

19The plaintiff contends that Division 1 of the Act is designed to extend the no-fault system to confer general rights to damages on plaintiffs where the owner or driver of a motor vehicle was not at fault and there is no other relevant tortfeasor who is implicated in the accident. She says that the plaintiff's contributory negligence, even if it was a cause of the accident, does not disentitle her from the benefits of Division 1 and can be taken into account in an adjustment, if need be, for contributory negligence pursuant to s 7F. 

20Mr Campbell pointed to s 5(1)(b) of the Act which provides that one of the objects of the Act is ""to provide compensation for compensable injuries in motor accidents, and to encourage the early resolution of compensation claims"" and contended that this warranted a beneficial construction being given to the Act in favour of the plaintiff in accordance with general principles. He also relied on s 6 of the Act which provides that an interpretation that would promote the objects of the Act ought be preferred to one that does not. 

The defendant's contentions as to the proper construction of Division 1 

21The defendant, by his senior counsel Mr Rewell, submits that the expression ""and not caused by the fault of any other person"" in s 7A includes the fault of the plaintiff. He says that if the plaintiff's own negligence, namely contributory negligence, was a cause of the accident, the accident cannot be a ""blameless accident"" and Division 1 does not apply. The defendant says further that any degree of causal fault is sufficient to disqualify the accident from being a ""blameless accident"" and therefore disentitle the plaintiff from the benefits otherwise available under Division 1. 

22The defendant submits that the scheme of the Act is that a plaintiff who has been injured in a motor vehicle accident is entitled to damages under Division 1 if, and only if, the accident was not caused by the fault of the owner or driver, the fault of the plaintiff, or the fault of any third party. If the motor vehicle accident was caused by the fault of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle, then the plaintiff is entitled to damages as provided for by the rest of the Act. If the motor vehicle accident was caused by the fault of a third party, but not the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, then the plaintiff is left to claim against that third party. If the motor vehicle accident was caused, in whole or in part, by the plaintiff's fault, the plaintiff, if a child, will be entitled to damages pursuant to Division 2 of Part 1.2 of the Act, but not Division 1. If the plaintiff was guilty of non-causative contributory negligence, and neither the defendants nor any other person was at fault, the plaintiff will be entitled to damages under Division 1 which are discounted to take account of the plaintiff's contributory negligence, except for those heads of damage for which provision is made in Division 2. 

23The defendant says that Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 1.2 were part of a package of measures designed to give additional protections over and above what would otherwise be available in a fault-based scheme. He referred me to the following passage from the Second Reading Speech and submitted that it could be used, consistently with Harrison v Melhem (2008) 72 NSWLR 380, to ascertain the purpose of the legislation and the mischief with which it was to deal: 

""Part 1.2 of the bill provides a right of recovery to people injured in motor vehicle accidents occurring in New South Wales where no-one is at fault. That is an 'inevitable' or 'blameless' motor accident. For the purpose of making this new claim for death or injury, the motor accident is deemed to have been caused by the fault of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle. The injury must also be caused by a motor vehicle accident of a kind recognised by the Act. A person who is injured in a blameless accident will be entitled to CTP scheme benefits. The one exception is that the driver of the motor vehicle causing the accident will not be entitled to make a claim under these provisions. However, if that driver is catastrophically injured an application for entry to the Lifetime Care and Support Scheme may be made. 

Part 1.2 also provides a special benefit for children aged up to 16 and a resident of New South Wales at the time of the accident, in those circumstances where the driver of the motor vehicle involved in the accident was not 'at-fault'. The child's injury must be caused by a motor vehicle accident of a kind recognised by the Act. The special benefit will cover the injured child's treatment, rehabilitation and care costs as currently prescribed by the Act. These expenses will be met on an 'as incurred' basis, in the same way that these payments are currently made to other scheme claimants. There will also be entitlement for any treatment and care required in the future. The special benefit also extends to cover burial expenses in cases where the child is killed. The special benefit will not be available to children killed or injured in a motor vehicle accident which occurred in the course of conduct which would constitute a serious offence and which materially contributed to their death or injury. 

In the event a child is injured in a motor vehicle accident where there was no-one at fault, entitlements under the new blameless accident provisions would take precedence."" 

New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 9 March 2006, at 21403-21404. 

24The defendant submitted that it would be artificial to construe the word ""fault"" in s 7A as excluding the plaintiff, just as it would be artificial to construe the word ""negligence"" in s 3 as excluding contributory negligence. He said that whether a person is the plaintiff or the defendant in proceedings may be a matter of fortuity and in these cases the word ""contributory"" does not more than direct attention to the party whose negligence is under consideration. He cited March v E & MH Stramare Pty Ltd (1991) 171 CLR 506 as an example. 

25The defendant also said that ""contributory negligence"" is sometimes referred to as ""the plaintiff's negligence"", although it covers (as the High Court said in the passage in Astley referred to above) not only situations where a plaintiff could be said to be in breach of a duty owed the defendant, but also situations where a plaintiff can be said to have acted in disregard of his or her own safety. 

26Mr Rewell submitted that such a reading of ""fault"" was consistent with the way the word was used in Division 2, and in particular s 7K, where it obviously referred to contributory negligence. 

27Mr Rewell submitted that s 7E does not affect the construction of Part 1.2 as it arises in the instant case, except in so far as it fits harmoniously with the driver being deemed (by s 7B) to be at fault and therefore being unable to recover for his or her own injuries. It also fits within a third party compensation scheme. 

28The defendant says further that this construction still leaves work for s 7F to do because it covers matters which amount to lack of care for the plaintiff's own safety, but which did not themselves cause the accident. The defendant instanced the failure by a passenger in a motor vehicle to wear a seat belt or the failure by a pillion passenger or a cyclist to wear a helmet. He says that this does not create an artificiality in s 7F since there is no need to apply a gloss to the expression ""contributory negligence"" in s 7F because the only instances in which s 7F will apply are those where the plaintiff's own negligence has not caused the accident, since, had the plaintiff's negligence contributed to the accident, the accident would not be a ""blameless accident"" within the meaning of s 7A. 

Findings and reasons for decision on the construction of Division 1 

29For the reasons which follow, I accept the defendant's construction of Division 1. 

30The primary object of statutory interpretation is to construe the provisions of a statute in such a way as to be consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1988) 194 CLR 355, at [69] and [71] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. This means that the statute must be construed as a whole and effect must be given to the words of each provision. 

31Words take their meaning from context but it is generally to be expected that Parliament has used a term consistently. This principle is of importance when one considers the introduction of Part 1.2 which comprised Divisions 1 and 2. That ""fault"" is used in Division 2 of Part 1.2 to refer to contributory negligence is a powerful indication the Parliament intended it to include contributory negligence in Division 1. I consider that this textual analysis of Part 1.2 is sufficient to overcome the plaintiff's argument that ""negligence or any other tort"" in the definition of ""fault"" in s 3 is designed to limit negligence to the negligence of the defendant or other third party and exclude the plaintiff's negligence (which, as the plurality in Astley said in the passage set out above, may or may not involve a breach of duty to anyone). 

32Although there are instances where a court will read a statute as if it contained additional words, the circumstances in which this is appropriate are rare. A court would have to be satisfied of the intended purpose of the statute, the failure of Parliament and the draftsperson to give effect to that purpose, and of the substance of the provision Parliament would have made but for its inadvertence or drafting error: Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 147 CLR 297, at 306-307 per Gibbs CJ, at 310-312 per Stephen J and at 322 per Mason and Wilson JJ; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV (2009) 238 CLR 642, at 651-652 per French CJ and Bell J. 

33I do not consider this to be an instance where it is appropriate either to put a gloss on the plain meaning of the words in s 7A or to construe the word ""fault"" as being confined to the acts of a tortfeasor rather than to embrace a plaintiff's negligence. Nor do I consider that s 7K can properly be read as if it said ""caused solely by the fault of the child"", instead of ""caused by the fault of the child"". 

34If the plaintiff is guilty of negligent acts or omissions which caused the accident, wholly or in part, then the accident cannot be said to be ""blameless"" and therefore Division 1 does not apply. 

35The expression ""contributory negligence"" is apt to include both acts that caused the accident and those which, although they did not cause the accident, played a causative role in the plaintiff's injuries. Where the plaintiff's own negligence caused, or contributed to the accident, the accident will not be ""blameless"". Where the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence, which did not cause or contribute to the accident, her damages may be reduced pursuant s 7F. 

36This construction gives effect to all the provisions of the Act, and, in particular, preserves the distinction between Divisions 1 and 2 in Part 1.2. It accords a consistent meaning to the word ""fault"" throughout Part 1.2. Although it might be said to be anomalous for a plaintiff who is only partly at fault, to be disentitled to damages under Division 1 and to be confined to recovery of, or payment for, expenses under Division 2, this is the choice that Parliament has made. I find that Parliament has, through the enactment of Division 1 of Part 1.2, when read with Division 2 and the Act as a whole, evinced an intention to extend the benefits of a compensation system, which principally depends on fault being established, only to the innocent victims of accidents for which no one, including the plaintiff herself, is at fault. 

37It follows from my interpretation of Division 1 that if I find the plaintiff to have been at fault, whether wholly or partly for the accident in which she was injured, she is not entitled to damages under Division 1. 

38I propose to consider the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the accident, and to make findings accordingly. 

The accident: the impact and the surrounding circumstances 

39The plaintiff, who was born on 13 March 1994, was 14 at the time of the accident. Her sister, Mikaela, born on 9 September 1995, was 12. They were in years 9 and 7 respectively at the Bede Polding College. Because the Axiak family lived on the eastern side of Sackville Road, it was necessary for the plaintiff and her sister to cross the road, from the point where the bus stopped to let them off, to get home. At that point Sackville Road had one lane in either direction. There were double unbroken lines along the middle of the road, which signified that overtaking was not permitted. The area was residential in that there was a number of dwellings but it was also somewhat rural since there were farms and paddocks in the vicinity of the houses. 

40A school bus, which was carrying the plaintiff and her younger sister, Mikaela, stopped opposite the family's home on Sackville Road, at about four o'clock in the afternoon to permit the girls to disembark. Sackville Road does not have a sealed shoulder at the point at which the plaintiff and her sister were dropped off. The weather was fine and the road surface was dry on that day. 

41Mr Daniels, the driver of the vehicle which was following the bus, estimated that when the bus pulled in to stop, 3/4 of the bus was still on the road, and only 1/4 was on the dirt shoulder. 

42The plaintiff and her sister did not, as a general rule, catch the school bus in 2008. Their eldest sister, Calina, who was doing the Higher School Certificate, had recently obtained her licence. Either Calina or her boyfriend would generally pick them up from school, but on the day of the accident, she had another engagement and the younger girls caught the school bus home. However, in the previous year, 2007, the four girls had generally caught the bus home together. 

43After having got off the bus, the sisters walked around to the back of the bus. A vehicle driven by Mr Daniels was following the bus and came to a stop behind the bus. Mr Daniels was familiar with the road and was unsurprised by the presence of the school bus, since two of his children travelled on that bus, and indeed were travelling on it that afternoon. The bus then pulled away until it was once again entirely on the sealed part of the road. 

44Mr Daniels watched the girls crossing the road in the space between the bus and his vehicle. In a statement which he prepared on the evening of the accident, he wrote: 

""... saw a bus leaving the curb [sic] opposite 728 Sackville rd as the bus pulled away two girls approx 12 and 14 years old ran behind the bus, I believe watching me coming but not watching the other way."" 

45Mr Daniels gave oral evidence that the two girls darted behind the back of the bus between his vehicle and the bus. He also said that they ran. 

46The defendant, Mr Ingram, was driving in a southerly direction. He was familiar with the road since he regularly used it to travel to work. His then girlfriend, Nikki Peirson, was a passenger in the front seat. When he came around a curve in Sackville Road, he saw the bus and slowed in what the parties agree was an acceptable manner, from the applicable speed limit of 80 kms per hour to 40 kms per hour. Any view of the girls that he might otherwise have had was completely obscured by the bus. 

47The defendant first saw the girls when they emerged from behind the bus. The plaintiff, who was slightly ahead of her sister, ran straight in front of the defendant's vehicle. Although the defendant braked straight away, he could not get his foot onto the brake before the collision happened. The plaintiff's body was struck by extreme right of the bonnet; she was propelled onto the bonnet, hit and fractured the extreme right hand side of the upper part of the windscreen of the defendant's vehicle and then came off the bonnet and landed on the side of the road beside the vehicle. 

48Mr Ingram's evidence was relevantly unchallenged and was corroborated by that of Ms Peirson. 

49Ms Peirson said that, when she first saw the plaintiff, she was running and looking the other way. She said that when the plaintiff saw the defendant's vehicle she tried to stop but could not because of the momentum created by her running. Her centre of gravity was ahead of her legs because her upper body was leaning forward as she ran. She said that the leg that the plaintiff led with as she was running was the part that hit the defendant's vehicle. She saw, in the split second before the impact, the plaintiff looking in the direction of the defendant for the first time. 

The relevance and effect of the plaintiff's age 

The evidence of what a reasonable child of the plaintiff's age would have appreciated 

50In determining whether, and to what extent, the accident was caused by the plaintiff's negligence, the question arises what could be expected of an ordinary child of the plaintiff's age: McHale v Watson (1966) 115 CLR 199. The test is an objective one. If conduct such as the plaintiff's could reasonably be expected of an ordinary child of her age then the plaintiff may not be guilty of contributory negligence at all, and it could not properly be found that her fault caused or contributed to the accident. However, even though Mr Campbell did not expressly concede that there was some fault on the part of the plaintiff, he only faintly advanced the proposition that an ordinary child of the plaintiff's age could reasonably have been expected to act as she did. Rather, he put that her age was relevant to the reduction that ought be made to her damages. 

51There are three principal sources of evidence that are potentially relevant to the question what could be expected of an ordinary child of the plaintiff's age: 

(a)The expert evidence of Mr Griffiths, a biomedical and mechanical engineer; 

(b)The evidence of what was taught in schools in NSW about road safety to children up to the age of the plaintiff at the time of the accident, including materials from the RTA Road Safety Kit; 

(c)The evidence of the plaintiff's sisters, two of whom were older, and one of whom was younger, than her, as to what each understood as the relevant road safety principles. 

52The gist of Mr Griffiths' evidence was that ordinary children aged less than ten years were not sufficiently mature to cross the road safely without adult assistance. He referred to research which established that the ability of children under ten to control their impulses and base decisions on long-term consequences is still immature, which meant that they ought not be permitted to cross roads unsupervised. However, after the age of ten, ordinary children can be expected to cross the road safely. 

53Mr Griffiths gave evidence that an ordinary child of 14 without developmental difficulties would wait until a bus from which he or she had alighted had gone, move to a location where the child had a good view of traffic approaching from either direction and, when the road is clear, make the crossing. He said that this proposition did not depend on any road safety education having been given to the child. Indeed, he said the research for the proposition that a child over the age of ten should be able to cross the road without adult supervision was performed before the RTA road safety kit was developed. 

54When cross-examined by Mr Campbell, Mr Griffiths agreed that a child of 14 years is still a child, and that a child of that age may be easily distracted and forget the lessons concerning road rules that he or she has learned. He responded to the proposition that was put to him in cross-examination that ""a good kid can make a mistake on a given day"", by saying, ""Oh well, people make mistakes."" 

55The defendant tendered material which showed that in the years up to and including Year 9 (being the year the plaintiff was in at the date of the accident), children are taught, as part of the usual school curriculum, various principles of road safety. The defendant established, by the tender of such materials, that children who receive instruction in accordance with such material would appreciate, before they reached Year 9, two fundamental principles: first, that one should not cross the road without looking in both directions to make sure that the road is clear; and secondly, that when one alights from a bus, one ought wait until the bus has departed before one attempts to cross the road. The material of this nature that was tendered by the defendant was produced on subpoena by both St Matthew's Primary School and Bede Polding College, being the primary and secondary schools that the plaintiff attended. 

56In lieu of videotapes being tendered by the defendant, the plaintiff conceded that there were RTA videotapes available at the plaintiff's school, the effect of which was that one ought not cross the road until a bus has departed from the scene. 

57There was no evidence to establish that the plaintiff had been present at any lesson where instruction as to these matters had been given. Mr Campbell submitted that the material was, accordingly, incapable of establishing whether the plaintiff, and her peers, received such instruction. Mr Rewell said that the evidence comprised compelling circumstantial evidence that the plaintiff and her peers had received such instruction and that I should find accordingly, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. 

58In light of the evidence of the plaintiffs' sisters set out below and the evidence of Mr Griffiths, which I accept, I do not need to determine whether the plaintiff herself was instructed as to the matters contained in the road safety material tendered by the defendant. It is difficult to see how this matter is a relevant fact in any event since the test is an objective one. 

59The evidence of the plaintiff's sisters is relevant, in so far as it provides some indication of the level of awareness of ordinary children of particular ages. The plaintiff's sisters attended St Matthew's Primary School and Bede Polding College, as had the plaintiff. 

60The plaintiff's eldest sister, Calina, agreed that it was reinforced during primary school and in the early years of high school that if one got off a bus, one ought wait for the bus to leave before attempting to cross the road. She agreed that a similar message was imparted by their parents. 

61The plaintiff's second sister, Antonia, who is older than the plaintiff, gave evidence that she was aware that if she got off a bus she should let the bus leave and drive away before checking both ways and then crossing the road. Although she could not identify where she had learned the road safety principle, she agreed that she would have known if not by the end of primary school, then definitely by early high school. 

62The plaintiff's third sister, Mikaela, who is younger than the plaintiff, was in her first year of high school, Year 7, at Bede Polding College at the time of the accident. She agreed that even when she was at primary school she knew that when she got off the bus, she should allow the bus to leave before looking both ways before crossing the road. She agreed that she was reminded of this from time to time either by her parents or her teachers or both. 

The parties' submissions on the effect of the plaintiff's age on her degree of culpability 

63The defendant submitted that the evidence amply established that the plaintiff, in crossing the road as she did, before the bus had departed, and without looking, until it was too late, in the direction from which the defendant was coming, acted in disregard of her own safety and that this was if not the sole then at least a contributing cause of the accident. 

64The plaintiff submitted that her age was a factor relevant to the assessment of what reduction, if any, ought be made to the plaintiff's damages by reason of her contributory negligence, such that the reduction was ""just and equitable"". As I have said above, s 7F will only apply if I find that the plaintiff was not at fault 

Findings on fault 

65I accept the evidence of Mr Griffiths that an ordinary child of 14 ought not have crossed the road as the plaintiff did. Not only did she not wait until the bus on which she had been travelling had departed so as to clear a line of sight of oncoming traffic, but she ran across the road at such a rate, when she could not see the side of the road where the defendant was, that she was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the defendant's vehicle. Had she been less than ten, there may have been a question whether she could be said to be blameless because an ordinary child of ten would not be capable of appreciating the consequences of crossing the road in that manner. But the plaintiff was already 14 on the day of the accident. Her conduct was the result of carelessness, not youth. Accordingly the accident was not a ""blameless accident"" because it was caused by her fault. She is therefore not entitled to damages under Division 1 of Part 1.2 of the Act. 

Contributory negligence; introductory matters 

66On my interpretation of Division 1, s 7F operates only in circumstances where there is a blameless defendant on the one hand and a plaintiff whose own negligence has not caused the accident, but whose injuries have been made worse by his or her disregard for his or her own safety. 

67However, I propose to assess any reduction for contributory negligence in the alternative, lest it be found by the Court of Appeal that my construction of s 7A in particular and Division 1 in general is in error. 

68Although the plaintiff originally contended that the defendant had elected, by an amendment to his pleading, to abandon an allegation of contributory negligence, she accepted that, if the defendant amended his pleading, as he undertook to do, he could rely on the allegation. The plaintiff did not oppose leave being granted on 22 November 2011 to the defendant to file an amended defence to the amended statement of claim in which a reduction for contributory negligence was alleged in the alternative. 

69I note that the plaintiff concedes that there is material from which I could infer contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. 

70The standard of contributory negligence is governed by s 5R of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), which provides as follows: 
""(1) The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm. 

(2) For that purpose: 

(a) the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and 

(b) the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time."" 

71A finding of contributory negligence is mandated in the circumstances provided for by s 138 of the Act, none of which applies in the instant case. Section 138 covers matters which may have caused the accident and others, such as failing to wear a seatbelt, which are not generally causative. 

72Mr Campbell conceded that there was material on the basis of which I could reduce damages on account of the plaintiff's contributory negligence, but said that I should take into account the plaintiff's age and that she was a child at the time of the accident. He submitted that, even if her age was not sufficient to render her blameless, it was a factor to be taken into account since the assessment of reduction for contributory negligence must be ""just and equitable"". 

73Mr Campbell further submitted that there was no necessary starting point that the plaintiff's and defendant's respective responsibilities for the accident should add up to 100%, since the statutory scheme was based on the proposition that the defendant was not at fault, and therefore there was necessarily no culpability on the part of the defendant. 

74Mr Rewell submitted that the accident was wholly caused by the plaintiff's careless conduct and that therefore even if I accept the construction of s 7A for which Mr Campbell contends, I should reduce damages under s 7F by 100%. A reduction of damages by 100% is authorised by s 5S of the Civil Liability Act . 

75I was referred to the decision of the High Court in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALJR 492, at 494 per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Dean JJ, which contains the following classic statement of apportionment by reason of a plaintiff's contributory negligence: 
""The making of an apportionment as between a plaintiff and a defendant of their respective shares in the responsibility for the damage involves a comparison both of culpability, ie of the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man ( Pennington v Norris (1956) 96 CLR 10 at 16) and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage: Stapley v Gypsum Mines Ltd [1953] AC 663 at 682; Smith v McIntyre [1958] Tas SR 36 at 42-49 and Broadhurst v Millman [1976] VR 208 at 219, and cases there cited. It is the whole conduct of each negligent party in relation to the circumstances of the accident which must be subjected to comparative examination. The significance of the various elements involved in such an examination will vary from case to case; for example, the circumstances of some cases may be such that a comparison of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage will be of little, if any, importance."" 

76The difficulty with arriving at a reduction less than 100% in the instant case is that the defendant was not only blameless, but his driving accorded in all respects with reasonable standards. This is not a case of a defendant who had an unforeseeable heart attack and allowed his vehicle to swerve to the wrong side of the road, or who could not disable cruise control and therefore was unable to slow the vehicle to avoid a collision. In such cases it would be appropriate to make allowance for the relative importance of such, albeit innocent, deviation from proper driving standards when assessing the reduction in damages of a passenger who, say, was not wearing a seat belt. 

77However, in my view, it cannot be said that the defendant in the instant case caused the accident in any material legal sense. The only test of causation he meets is the 'but for' test: he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was only a cause of the accident in the same way as it could be said that the bus driver was, for dropping off the girls at that particular minute. Even leaving aside the defendant's lack of culpability, this is insufficient to establish any causal connection at law. 

78I find the plaintiff's disregard for her own safety to be the sole cause of the accident. Accordingly, if, contrary to my interpretation of Division 1, s 7K arose for consideration, I would have found that the plaintiff's damages ought be reduced by 100%. 

The associated claims for nervous shock 

79The plaintiff's sister, Mikaela, and her father, Michael, have brought claims for nervous shock. Mikaela witnessed the accident, and only narrowly missed being involved in the collision herself. Mr Axiak came upon the scene of the accident shortly after it had occurred. The parties asked that these proceedings be listed with the plaintiff's proceedings, since if the plaintiff's accident is not a ""blameless accident"" within the meaning of Division 1 of Part 2, neither she, nor her sister, nor her father, obtains the benefit of s 7B, which deems the defendant to be at fault. 

80Accordingly, by reason of my finding that the accident was not ""blameless"", I make orders in each of the following proceedings as follows: 

(1)In matter 213758 of 2010 (Alana Axiak b.h.t. Donna Axiak v Ingram), order: 

(a)judgment for the defendant; and 

(b)plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs. 

(2)In matter 206353 of 2011 (Mikaela Axiak b.h.t. Donna Axiak v Ingram), order: 

(a)judgment for the defendant; and 

(b)plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs. 

(3)In matter 206313 of 2011 (Michael Axiak v Ingram), order: 

(a)judgment for the defendant; and 

(b)plaintiff to pay defendant's costs.

		28 November 2011",2011-11-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2758291,Meakin v Director of Public Prosecutions & Anor [2011] NSWCA 373,"HEADNOTE 
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 
The applicant, Mr Meakin, was charged with driving in a manner dangerous to the public and driving with a mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol (PCA) contrary to Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, ss 42(2) and s 9(3)(a) respectively. The applicant pleaded guilty to the PCA offence. He was convicted of the dangerous driving offence before Culver LCM and sentenced to imprisonment by way of periodic detention. The automatic period of licence disqualification for multiple offences arising from the same incident was five years: Road Transport (General) Act, s 188 (4). The applicant was disqualified from driving for three years in respect of the PCA offence and for five years in respect of the dangerous driving conviction, accumulating to a total period of licence disqualification for eight years. 
The applicant appealed to the District Court against his dangerous driving conviction and against sentence. Morgan DCJ dismissed the conviction appeal but varied the sentence. Her Honour did not interfere with the licence disqualification orders. 
Three years later, the applicant sought to re-open the sentence proceedings in respect of the licence disqualification period, pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 43(2), on the basis that the period ordered was contrary to law within the meaning of s 43. Morgan DCJ dismissed the application. 
The applicant sought prerogative and declaratory relief pursuant to the Supreme Court Act , ss 65, 69 and 75, in respect of Morgan DCJ's refusal to reopen the proceedings. The issue before the Court of Appeal was whether, in failing to have regard to the maximum automatic licence disqualification period in the Road Transport (General) Act , s 188(4), Morgan DCJ failed to take into account a relevant consideration when imposing a total period of licence disqualification on the applicant. 
The applicant submitted that her Honour's refusal to re-open the sentence proceedings pursuant to s 43 constituted jurisdictional error in denying that there was jurisdiction to re-open the sentence proceedings pursuant to s 43. 
Held: dismissing the application 
Per Allsop P: 
(1) There was no jurisdictional error and no operative legal error. The original sentence was not unlawful and the issue was not agitated on the appeal. 
Per Beazley JA (Allsop P substantially agreeing): 
(1) The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 43, is engaged where the court imposes a sentence that is ""contrary to law"" or where the court fails to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law: R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150. 
(2) To be entitled to prerogative and declaratory relief, the applicant must establish jurisdictional error in the refusal of Morgan DCJ to re-open the sentencing proceedings: [52]; District Court Act, s 176; Supreme Court Act, s 69(5); Spanos v Lazaris [2008] NSWCA 74 ; Hoffenberg v District Court [2010] NSWCA 142 . 
(3) Underlying the jurisdictional question was whether on the appeal, Morgan DCJ was required to take into account the Road Transport (General) Act , s 188(4) so that a failure to do so meant that her Honour had imposed a sentence contrary to law. 
(4) The applicant did not establish that the licence disqualification was in issue on the District Court appeal. As no questions were asked of the applicant relating to that issue, the court could more readily infer that the matter was not in issue: [80]; Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (No 2) (1991 ) 22 NSWLR 389. 
(5) As the licence disqualification was not in issue on the sentence appeal, there was no jurisdictional error in failing to consider the Road Transport (General) Act , s 188(4). 
(6) The applicant did not establish, and as Morgan DCJ held, Culver LCM had not failed to take into account the Road Transport (General) Act , s 188(4). 
(7) In circumstances where the licence disqualification period was not in issue on the appeal and there was no error in the sentence imposed by Culver LCM, there was no jurisdictional error in refusing the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 43 application. 
(8) Even if there was a failure to take into account the automatic period of licence disqualification specified in Road Transport (General) Act , s 188(4), that failure did not fall within the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 43 as that section applies where the sentence imposed is contrary to law. Here the licence disqualification period imposed was lawful. 
(9) Relief under the Supreme Court Act , ss 65 and 69 is discretionary and should be refused in any event in circumstances where the s 43 application was made three years after the District Court appeal was determined, without any explanation for the delay: [96]. 
Per Basten JA: 
(1) The application to review the refusal of the District Court to reopen the sentencing required identification of judicial error: [102] 
District Court Act 1973 (NSW), s 176 
Spanos v Lazaris [2008] NSWCA 74; Director of Public Prosecutions v Emanuel [2009] NSWCA 42; 193 A Crim R 552; Hoffenberg v District Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 142 referred to. 
(2) The review application must fail unless the judge misapprehended the scope of her judicial power under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 43, which she did not: [111] 
Ho v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 35 NSWLR 393; R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150 considered. 
(3) The submission that the Magistrate had been in error in failing to take account of the period of automatic disqualification failed (a) because it was not shown that her Honour had so failed, (b) that aspect of the sentencing was not in issue in the District Court and (c) the District Court orders superseded those of the Local Court: [106], [107] and [115] 
Wishart v Fraser [1941] HCA 8; 64 CLR 470 referred to. 
Orders 
Application dismissed with costs. 


			Judgment 

1ALLSOP P : I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Beazley JA and Basten JA. Their Honours' reasons enable me to state my views shortly. 

2For the reasons given by both Beazley JA and Basten JA, it was not shown that the magistrate made any error or failed to have regard to all relevant aspects of the legislation. 

3On the appeal, Mr Meakin, represented by highly experienced senior counsel, effectively abandoned any challenge to the disqualification. Thus, the appeal was fought upon the basis of the lack of dispositive relevance of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW), s 188. 

4It was in those circumstances that the learned District Court judge made no reference to s 188(4). 

5This is not jurisdictional error, or any kind of operative legal error. The original sentence has not been shown to be unlawful and the issue was not agitated on appeal. In these circumstances, no relevant error has been revealed in the approach of the District Court judge. 

6If I am wrong in these conclusions, I would refuse relief on a discretionary basis for the reasons given by Beazley JA. 

7BEAZLEY JA : The applicant seeks prerogative and declaratory relief pursuant to the Supreme Court Act 1970, ss 65, 69 and 75 in respect of the refusal of Morgan DCJ to reopen proceedings to correct a sentencing error that her Honour allegedly made when imposing periods of licence disqualification upon the applicant for offences of which he was convicted under the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (the RT (S & T) Act). The alleged error was that, in failing to have regard to the maximum automatic licence disqualification period specified in the Road Transport (General) Act 2005, s 188(4), her Honour failed to take into account a relevant consideration when imposing the total period of licence disqualification on the applicant. 

Background facts 

8The applicant was charged with the offence of driving in a manner dangerous to the public contrary to the RT (S & T) Act, s 42(2) and with a further offence of driving with the mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood (mid-range PCA) contrary to the Road Transport (General) Act , s 9(3)(a). Both charges arose out of an incident on 4 October 2006 when the applicant had been directed by police to pull over for a random roadside breath test. 

9The applicant pleaded guilty to the mid-range PCA offence. He was convicted of the drive in a manner dangerous offence after a summary hearing in the Local Court before Culver LCM on 31 May 2007. Culver LCM sentenced the applicant to periods of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. Her Honour also disqualified the applicant from driving for three years in respect of the PCA offence and for five years in respect of the dangerous driving conviction. Her Honour ordered that the periods of disqualification be accumulated so that the total period of licence disqualification was for eight years commencing on 4 October 2006. 

10The applicant appealed to the District Court pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, s 11 against his conviction of drive in a manner dangerous and against sentence. The appeal was heard on 17 October 2007 by Morgan DCJ. 

11On 17 December 2007 Morgan DCJ dismissed the appeal against conviction, but found that the objective seriousness of the offence was less than had been found by Culver LCM. 

12On the sentence appeal, her Honour quashed the sentences of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention imposed by Culver LCM. Her Honour re-sentenced the applicant to a total period of 250 hours community service. That sentence has been served and no issue arises in relation to it on the present application. 

13The matter proceeded upon the basis in this Court that her Honour "" confirmed "" the periods of licence disqualification ordered by Culver LCM. That is a sufficient although not fully accurate description of her Honour's orders. The use of this language, that is, of "" confirming "" the order of disqualification made by Culver LCM may not have been correct. Pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act , s 20(2), the District Court may determine an appeal against sentence by setting aside or varying the sentence or dismissing the appeal. In the present case, her Honour varied part of the sentence imposed by the Local Court but did not interfere with the orders imposed in respect of the licence disqualification. In those circumstances, the proper order may have been to dismiss that part of the appeal relating to the licence disqualification period. 

14The language used by her Honour reflected the language of s 68, which makes provision for the date upon which a sentence, "" confirmed "" or "" varied "" by the District Court on appeal, is to take effect. The section applies to licence disqualifications under the Road Transport (General) Act 2005: see s 68(1A). In this case, as her Honour did not alter the date from which the licence disqualification period was to run, there was no need to invoke s 68. 

15The relevance of the order her Honour made or ought to have made raises the question of the juridical function that she was undertaking on the sentence appeal. In particular, there is a question whether her Honour was required to re-sentence the applicant afresh. This question is relevant to the issue whether her Honour was required to have regard to the terms of s 188(4) in determining that part of the sentence appeal that related to the period of licence disqualification. 

16On 13 September 2010, the applicant filed a notice of motion in the District Court seeking an order that the sentence proceedings against the applicant be reopened pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 43(2) (the s 43 application). The notice of motion was supported by an affidavit of John Laxon, Mr Meakin's solicitor, sworn 13 September 2010, in which he stated that the application was made to reopen the proceedings in respect of the licence disqualification period on the basis that the licence disqualification period ordered was "" contrary to law "" within the meaning of s 43. 

17On 15 December 2010, Morgan DCJ dismissed the s 43 application. 

18On 23 December 2010, the applicant filed a summons in this Court in which he sought the following relief: 

""1. Relief in the nature of certiorari pursuant to s69 of the Supreme Court Act , 1970 , quashing the order of [the District Court] made on 15 December 2010, dismissing [the applicant's] application brought pursuant to s43, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , 1999 , to reopen the proceedings brought against [the applicant] by [the first respondent] ('the proceedings'). 

2. Relief in the nature of mandamus pursuant to s65 and s69 of the Supreme Court Act, 1970 , directing [the District Court] to convene and determine [the applicant's] application to reopen the proceedings in accordance with law. 

3. A declaration pursuant to s75, Supreme Court Act , 1970 , that [the District Court] erred in law in failing to find that the sentence imposed on [the applicant] was contrary to law within the meaning of s43, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999. 

4. Costs."" 

19For the reasons which follow, I consider that the summons should be dismissed. 

The statutory scheme 

The Road Transport (General) Act 

20The Road Transport (General) Act , Pt 5.4 provides for sanctions relating to licences. Part 5.4, Div 1 provides for licence disqualification. Section 187, provides: 

"" 187 Court may impose penalty and disqualify driver on conviction 

(1) Subject to section 188 of this Act ... a court that convicts a person of an offence under the road transport legislation may, at the time of the conviction, order the disqualification of the person from holding a driver licence for such period as the court specifies. 

(2) If the court makes an order disqualifying the person, the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for the period specified by the court. 

(3) Any disqualification under this section is in addition to any penalty imposed for the offence ..."" 

21Section 188 provides for licence disqualification for certain major offences. A major offence is defined in s 3 to mean, relevantly, a crime or offence referred to in the definition of "" convicted person "" in s 188. 

22Section 188(1) is a definition section internal to s 188 itself. It provides, relevantly: 

"" 188 Disqualification for certain major offences 

(1) Definitions 
In this section: 

automatic disqualification means a disqualification under this section from holding a driver licence without specific order of a court. 

convicted person means: 

... 

(c) a person who is convicted of an offence under any of the following provisions: 
... 
(iv) section 9 ... (3) (a) ... 

conviction means the conviction in respect of which a person is a convicted person. 

ordered disqualification means disqualification under this section from holding a driver licence that is ordered by a court."" 

23Section 188(2) deals with the disqualification period if a person had no previous major offence within a period of five years prior to the subject offence. Section 188(3) deals with the disqualification period if a person has a previous offence within a period of five years prior to the subject offence. As the applicant had convictions for a major offence within this statutory period, s 188(3) applied. The section provides, relevantly: 

"" (3) Disqualification if previous major offence 

If, at the time of the conviction of the convicted person or during the period of 5 years before the conviction ... the convicted person is or has been convicted of one or more other major offences (whether of the same or a different kind): 

... 

(b) where the conviction is for an offence under section 9 (3) or 12 (1) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 : 
(i) the person is automatically disqualified for 3 years from holding a driver licence, or 
(ii) if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 12 months) or longer period of disqualification-the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order, or ... 

(d) where the conviction is for any other offence: 
(i) the person is automatically disqualified for 5 years from holding a driver licence, or 
(ii) if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 2 years) or longer period of disqualification-the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order."" 

24Section 188(4) provides for the calculation of disqualification periods in case of multiple offences as follows: 

"" (4) Calculation of disqualification periods in case of multiple offences 

If 2 or more convictions of a person are made, whether or not at the same time, for crimes or offences arising out of a single incident involving the use of a motor vehicle or trailer, the following provisions apply: 

(a) for the purpose of ascertaining which of subsections (2) and (3) should apply in relation to any such conviction: 
(i) the other of those convictions are to be disregarded, and 
(ii) subsection (2) or (3) (as the case may require) is, accordingly, to be the applicable subsection, and 
(b) the maximum period of automatic disqualification in respect of all those crimes or offences is to be: 
(i) if subsection (2) is applicable-3 years, or 
(ii) if subsection (3) is applicable-5 years ..."" 

Section 188(4)(b)(ii) was the applicable subsection in this case. 

25The effect of s 188 is that the periods of automatic licence disqualification apply, including the maximum period in cases of multiple offences, unless the court makes a specific order. The court may make an order which is either greater or less than the automatic period of licence disqualification subject to the minimum periods of disqualification that are prescribed. No maximum period is prescribed. 

The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 

26The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 43 provides as follows: 

"" 43 Court may reopen proceedings to correct sentencing errors 

(1) This section applies to criminal proceedings (including proceedings on appeal) in which a court has: 
(a) imposed a penalty that is contrary to law, or 
(b) failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law, 

and so applies whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence in those proceedings. 

(2) The court may reopen the proceedings (either on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings) and, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard: 
(a) may impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law, and 
(b) if necessary, may amend any relevant conviction or order. 

... 

(6) In this section: 
impose a penalty includes: 
... 
(e) make an order ... with respect to ... disqualification or loss ... of a licence ..."" 

27Section 43 is a remedial legislative provision and is to be given a broad construction so as to achieve its legislative purpose, namely, the provision of a simple procedure to correct sentencing error: see R v Tolmie [2004] NSWCCA 396; Ho v DPP (1995) 37 NSWLR 393, per Kirby P at 402; Erceg v The District Court of New South Wales & Anor [2003] NSWCA 379; 143 A Crim R 455 . See also the Second Reading Speech, where the Minister stated that the object of s 43 was to provide a "" simple procedure to correct sentencing errors "" and as a means of "" correcting mistakes of a simple character "" ( New South Wales Legislative Assembly , Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 21 September 1988 at 1673). 

28Section s 43 is not concerned with the correction of all sentencing errors. Rather, the section is engaged where there is a sentencing error that falls within the terms of the statute, namely, where the court had imposed a sentence that was "" contrary to law "" or where the court had failed to impose a penalty that was required to be imposed by law: see R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150. It is the former error that is in issue in this case, that is, whether the sentence relating to the licence disqualification period was imposed "" contrary to law "". 

29Section 43 is not confined to error in respect of the existence or terms of a statutory provision. It is sufficient that the penalty imposed was contrary to principles of law as expounded in the case law: see Ho per Kirby P at 402-403. See also Staats v The Queen (1998) 123 NTR 16; Melville v The Queen (1999) 150 FLR 296 . In Ho Kirby P pointed out at 403, in obiter comments in respect of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 24 (the predecessor provision to s 43), that the phrase "" contrary to law "" is wider than the phrase "" imposed a penalty that is not provided by law "". His Honour referred to the common law sentencing principle that where, prior to sentence, a person has spent time in custody in respect of an offence, the trial judge should take the period of pre-sentence custody into account. Ordinarily, credit should be given for the time served. A failure to consider this would be an error of law in the sentencing discretion and the resulting penalty would be "" contrary to law "" within the meaning of s 43. 

30In Finnie (No 2) Howie J (Spigelman CJ and Dunford J agreeing) noted, at [32], that s 43 could be engaged where there had been an erroneous finding of fact or an omission to find, or take into account, a relevant fact. The section, on its terms, was not limited to "" error of law "". Relevantly for present purposes, Howie J noted that there was no requirement that "" any error be identified except in the outcome of the sentencing proceedings "". As his Honour stated: 

""It does not matter whether the sentencing court made a mistake of law or fact in arriving at a penalty that was contrary to law... It is not difficult to imagine a situation where a sentencer overlooked a fact in evidence before the court and as a result imposed a sentence that fell within the scope of the provision. A not uncommon example would be that the failure to take into account the existence of a particular traffic conviction resulted in the court failing to impose the disqualification period mandated by statute where such a prior conviction exists. Where a relevant error is established, the section is engaged and, at least in so far as the jurisdiction of the court to reopen the sentencing proceedings is concerned, it is unnecessary for the court to determine how the erroneous sentence came about."" 

31A similar construction was given to s 43's predecessor provision, the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act , s 24. In R v Denning (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 May 1992, unreported), Grove J noted that s 24 was not limited to rectifications of error that could be achieved by mechanical adjustments. The section also applied to make a correction "" to achieve the intended effect of the otiose earlier imposition "". His Honour stated that the purpose of the power granted by s 24 was the avoidance of unnecessary appellate proceedings where identifiable error of a particular kind could be brought to the attention of the sentencing tribunal. His Honour stated that was the section that enabled "" the rectification of that perceived error "". 

32It should be noted that in Queensland, the authorities are to the effect that a sentence based on a factual error is not encompassed within the term "" sentence [imposed] that is not in accordance with law "": R v Woodford (1996) 89 A Crim R 146; R v Deacon (1993) 65 A Crim R 261; Boyd v Sandercock; ex parte Sandercock [1990] 2 Qd R 26. In Boyd v Sandercock it was held that the phrase "" contrary to law "" does not include a case where the sentence imposed was correct on the factual material before the court at the time of sentence. The Court stated that it was irrelevant that it was later ascertained that the factual material was erroneous. This Court in Finnie (No 2) left that particular question open: see at [30]. Shortland v Hea th 1977 WAR 61 and Traegar v Pires de Albuquerque (1997) 18 WAR 432 are to the same effect . See also Staats per Angel J at [27]. In Traegar , however, the Court of Appeal acknowledged that there was room for debate on the question. 

33The question whether the section applies where a court has sentenced on wrong factual material may depend upon the nature of the factual material not brought to the court's attention and the consequences of that omission. In Traegar the penalty imposed was not the penalty required by statute had the correct facts been before the court. The consequence in that case was that on the correct facts, a higher penalty ought to have been and was subsequently imposed. That might be a reason against the construction given to the section by the Court of Appeal in that case. On the other hand, there is an argument that it would be contrary to the proper administration of the criminal justice system for a convicted person to have a penalty imposed to which the person was not liable, that is, a penalty that was "" contrary to law "", because of a failure to bring a matter of fact or law to the attention of the sentencing judge. The discretion in s 43 itself may be sufficient to deal with the case where the result of reopening would result in any unfairness to the accused person, such as the imposition of a higher penalty. 

Proceedings before Culver LCM 

34In the proceedings in the Local Court, Culver LCM found that the applicant, who was represented by Mr Bolton SC, deliberately drove at two police officers who had signalled him to stop to undertake a random roadside breath test. She sentenced the applicant on that basis. As indicated, the applicant pleaded guilty to a mid-range PCA offence arising from the same incident. 

35In her reasons on sentence, Culver LCM referred to the maximum penalty that could be imposed for both offences and the automatic period of licence disqualification relevant to each. In relation to the licence disqualification period, her Honour noted that the automatic period could be reduced but that there was a prescribed minimum period below which a disqualification period could not be ordered. 

36Her Honour made no reference to the fact that the legislation did not prescribe a maximum period of licence disqualification and thus made no reference to the possibility of increasing the licence disqualification period beyond the automatic period. Nor did her Honour make any reference to s 188(4). 

37Culver LCM stated that having regard to the factual circumstances in this case, the sentences she imposed should properly be made consecutive, so as to recognise the full criminality involved. It was apparent from her Honour's orders that that statement was directed both to the penalties imposed by way of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention and to the periods of licence disqualification. 

38Her Honour convicted the applicant on the PCA offence and ordered that he was "" disqualified from driving for three years "". Her Honour also sentenced him to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. Her Honour then convicted the applicant of the drive in a manner dangerous offence, and ordered that he was "" disqualified for five years from driving and that is consecutive upon the earlier disqualification I imposed "". Her Honour sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of eight months with a total term of 12 months to be served by way of periodic detention. Her Honour then directed the following comments to the applicant: 

""Sir ... If you breach my orders for disqualification and you drive during that period you can be convicted and sent to gaol."" 

Appeal to the District Court 

39On the appeal to the District Court, the applicant was represented by Mr Hughes QC, leading Mr Bolton SC and Mr Hughes of junior counsel. The applicant gave evidence on both the conviction and sentence appeals. Her Honour dismissed the appeal against conviction, but found a lower level of culpability than had been found by Culver LCM. 

40Before the applicant was called to give evidence on sentence, Morgan DCJ asked the Crown what the penalties were in respect of both offences. She also asked what the disqualification periods were and what periods of disqualification had been imposed by Culver LCM. There is no transcript of the responses that were given to her Honour, although it was recorded that her Honour stated she could be given that information later. 

41The applicant's evidence on sentence comprised approximately one page of transcript of evidence in chief. In response to a question from Mr Hughes QC, as to why he had abstained from alcohol since the day of his arrest, the applicant stated that he "" could see it was not doing [him] any good "". He explained that it was endangering his health and his treatment. The applicant said that since the accident he had received treatment from a psychiatrist. 

42Mr Hughes QC also asked the applicant what had happened to the car that he was driving on the night of the offences. The applicant responded that he had sold it. Apart from this one reference to the motor vehicle, Mr Hughes QC did not ask any questions of the applicant as to whether he needed his licence for any purpose, or as to what his transport needs were, or as to how he was managing his transport arrangements without his licence. Nor were these matters raised in cross-examination. 

43As indicated, her Honour varied the sentence of periodic detention imposed by Culver LCM and sentenced the applicant to periods of community service. In respect of the licence disqualification periods her Honour made the following orders; 

""With respect to the driving PCA matter he is disqualified for three years to date from 4 October 2006 expiring on 3 October 2009. With respect to the period of disqualification from the drive manner dangerous (sic) I confirm the five years to date from 4 October 2009 expiring on 3 October 2014."" 

The s 43 application 

44The only evidence on the s 43 application was the affidavit of Mr Laxon, in which he annexed the transcripts of the Local Court hearing and the District Court appeal hearing, although there was no transcript of counsel's submissions in either court. The affidavit otherwise set out, relevantly, a chronology and the orders that had been made in the Local Court and in the District Court. 

45Morgan DCJ recorded the applicant's submission that whilst Culver LCM, in imposing sentence: 

""... had regard to the automatic periods of disqualification applicable to the individual offences and indeed ultimately imposed those periods"" 

she had not made any reference to the "" correct period of licence disqualification "", being the maximum automatic period of disqualification in the case of multiple offences or which provision was made in s 188(4). In this regard, the applicant argued that "" the correct period of licence disqualification "" was a relevant consideration to which Culver LCM had failed to have regard and that she had thereby erred in law. The applicant contended that as Morgan DCJ had merely confirmed the period of licence disqualification, she had 'adopted' Culver LCM's error and therefore had also erred in law. 

46Morgan DCJ identified the issue raised by the applicant as being whether she had failed "" to consider the legal basis of disqualification "" when she confirmed the periods of licence disqualification made by Culver LCM, and thus had made an order "" contrary to law "" within the meaning of s 43(2). 

47It is apparent from her Honour's reasons that she considered that she had not been asked to vary the period of licence disqualification. In this regard, her Honour stated that no submissions were made with respect to the periods of disqualification and that she was "" quite certain that at no time was the issue of s 188(4) raised "". She said that the subsection had not been brought to her attention and had not been taken into account by her. Her Honour observed that prior to the s 43 application, she was not aware of the provision and noted that it was not known whether Culver LCM had been referred to s 188(4). 

48Her Honour also recorded her "" clear recollection "" that there was "" but a fleeting reference to the periods of disqualification "" imposed by Culver LCM. Her Honour's reference to "" a fleeting reference to the periods of disqualification "" reflected the exchange between her Honour and Mr Dhanji SC during the course of argument in the s 43 application. Her Honour indicated to Mr Dhanji that she remembered Mr Hughes QC referring "" right at the end [to] whether I would consider changing the period of disqualification "", to which her Honour recalled responding, "" Mr Hughes, you shouldn't push your luck because [the applicant] had been very fortunate "", or words to that effect. 

49Her Honour then noted in her reasons that the applicant: 

""... was not asked one question by his legal representatives nor by the Crown relating to the periods of disqualification imposed upon him."" 

50Morgan DCJ held that regardless whether s 188(4) was brought to the attention of Culver LCM, this was not a case where a period of licence disqualification had been imposed that could not be imposed. Nor could it be said that the periods of disqualification were not imposed in accordance with the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. Morgan DCJ concluded, therefore, that no error of law had been disclosed in the licence disqualification periods imposed by Culver LCM. 

51It followed, on her Honour's reasoning, that her confirmation of the periods of licence disqualification did not disclose any error of law. As the periods of disqualification imposed and their accumulation were not contrary to law, no basis had been established to reopen the sentencing proceedings. Accordingly, her Honour refused the application. 

Is the applicant entitled to relief in this Court? 

52To be entitled to any of the relief claimed in the summons, the applicant must establish jurisdictional error in the refusal of Morgan DCJ to reopen the sentencing proceedings: see the District Court Act 1973, s 176; Supreme Court Act , s 69(5); Spanos v Lazaris [2008] NSWCA 74 at [15]; Hoffenberg v District Court [2010] NSWCA 142. 

53In Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58; 184 CLR 163 at 177 the High Court held that an inferior court commits jurisdictional error if it mistakenly denies the existence of jurisdiction, including where the inferior court makes an order to the effect that it lacks jurisdiction, or refuses to exercise jurisdiction based upon a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction, or a misconception of the nature or limits of its jurisdiction. The Court stated further, at 177: 

""... jurisdictional error will occur where an inferior court disregards or takes account of some matter in circumstances where the statute or other instrument establishing it and conferring its jurisdiction requires that that particular matter be taken into account or ignored as a pre-condition of the existence of any authority to make an order or decision in the circumstances of the particular case."" 

54In Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 at [56], the High Court acknowledged that a degree of uncertainty attended what is meant by "" jurisdictional error "". The Court, at [72], referred to three examples of jurisdictional error identified in Craig , including, relevantly, disregarding a matter that the relevant statute required to be taken into account as a condition of jurisdiction, and the misconstruction, by the inferior court of the relevant statute, thereby misconceiving the nature of the function the inferior court was performing or the extent of its powers. The Court noted, as it had in Craig , that in the last of these categories, "" the line between jurisdictional error and the error in the exercise of jurisdiction may be particularly difficult to discern "". 

55The applicant submitted that her Honour's refusal to re-open the sentence proceedings pursuant to s 43 constituted jurisdictional error. The jurisdictional error identified by the applicant was that her Honour erred in denying that there was jurisdiction to reopen the sentence proceedings pursuant to s 43. 

56The appellant advanced the following propositions in support of his argument that Morgan DCJ had committed jurisdictional error: 

(1) The automatic maximum period of disqualification set by the legislature in s 188(4), where a person had committed multiple offences, was a relevant consideration in determining whether to set a longer or shorter period of licence disqualification. 

(2) Morgan DCJ erred in holding that the failure to take into account the correct automatic disqualification period was not an error within s 43. 

(3) As a result of the error identified in (2), her Honour wrongly held that she did not have jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings. As that was an error going to jurisdiction, relief pursuant to s 65 and/or s 69 was available. 

(4) There was no discretionary basis upon which this Court would refuse relief. 

57The applicant acknowledged that the period of licence disqualification imposed by Culver LCM and "" confirmed "" by Morgan DCJ was within power. He submitted, however, that the power had to be exercised according to law. To exercise the sentencing discretion according to law, it was necessary for the sentencing judge to know what the relevant law was before imposing sentence. 

58This led to the applicant's central submission, namely, that a failure to consider the automatic period of licence disqualification provided for by s 188(4) was a failure to exercise the sentencing power according to law and that such an error was one to which the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , s 43 applied. The applicant submitted that this was so, regardless whether any evidence or submissions were directed to the automatic period provided for by s 188(4). The applicant submitted that in confirming the licence disqualification period imposed by Culver LCM, her Honour had failed to consider the maximum period of automatic licence disqualification applicable in the case of multiple offences arising out of a single incident. Her Honour's finding on the s 43 application that the sentence imposed was not contrary to law was thus amenable to declaratory and prerogative relief. 

59The applicant submitted that the effect of Morgan DCJ's "" confirmation "" of the licence disqualification period was to displace the sentences imposed by Culver LCM: see Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act , ss 17, 20 and 68. See also Wishart v Fraser [1941] HCA 8; 64 CLR 470. It followed that the relevant error for the purposes of seeking relief in this Court was that of Morgan DCJ. The applicant submitted, however, that the question whether Culver LCM had failed to take into account the automatic period of licence disqualification period under s 188(4) was relevant, as Morgan DCJ had not exercised an independent sentencing discretion in confirming the periods of disqualification ordered by Culver LCM. If Culver LCM had erred, Morgan DCJ erred in the adoption of that error. 

Is the decision of Culver LCM relevant? 

60As I have indicated, the applicant's approach on the s 43 application was that her Honour had adopted the error made by Culver LCM and had thereby erred. The same argument was advanced on the hearing of the summons in this Court, but was expanded to include a submission that Morgan DCJ was required, on the sentence appeal, to turn an independent mind to the disqualification period to be imposed, regardless of whether the applicant had put that aspect of the sentence in issue and regardless of whether her Honour was directed to the terms of, relevantly, s 188(4). 

61As I have already indicated, it is possible that her Honour did not sentence the applicant afresh on the sentence appeal insofar as the licence disqualification period was concerned. The position in Wishart v Fraser , where a magistrate's order ceased to have effect once an order was made by the District Court on an appeal, was different. The legislation in that case included a power, on appeal to "" confirm "" the order of the magistrate. There was no power in the legislation to dismiss the appeal: the Justices Act 1902, s 125. 

62Notwithstanding the uncertainty as to whether the orders made by her Honour replaced the orders of Culver LCM and subject to the question whether the licence disqualification period was in issue on the sentence appeal, her Honour was required to independently exercise her discretion as to whether to set aside or vary the sentence or dismiss the appeal. It follows that the relevant decision for the purposes of s 43 application and for this Court is the decision of Morgan DCJ. However, in deference to the argument that Morgan DCJ in fact "" adopted "" the order and, therefore, the underlying reasoning of Culver LCM, I will deal with the applicant's arguments in support of that submission. 

Did Culver LCM impose a licence disqualification period contrary to law? 

63The applicant submitted that although Culver LCM referred to the automatic periods of disqualification for the individual offences of which Mr Meakin had been convicted, she made no reference to what Parliament had prescribed when dealing with multiple convictions arising out of a single incident, such that it should be inferred that her attention had not been drawn to s 188(4) and that she overlooked the maximum period of disqualification provided for in that section. 

64For my part, I would not draw that inference. It is apparent from her reasons that Culver LCM was aware that there were automatic periods of disqualification; what those periods were in respect of each offence; that she could make orders in respect of the disqualification period; and that minimum periods of disqualification were prescribed. Those were matters of importance to the sentencing function that her Honour was about to undertake. In particular, it was relevant for her Honour to know that she could "" order "" a period of disqualification. Her Honour's comment, reproduced at [38] above, indicates she was fully aware that she could order a period of disqualification. It was also critical for her to know that there was a minimum period of disqualification and what that was. 

65In my opinion, the absence of any mention of the maximum automatic period specified in s 188(4) does not necessarily give rise to the inference that her Honour was unaware of the provisions. Her Honour may have considered it unnecessary to refer to the provision because, as was apparent from her reasons, she had decided that the sentences she was intending to impose, including the disqualification period, should be cumulative, to take account of the criminality involved. 

66I say something below as to the nature and extent of the evidence on the summons. Insofar as the submission was made that the Court should infer that Culver LCM's attention was not drawn to s 188(4) by counsel, I merely comment that direct evidence could have been adduced to establish that matter. However, the Court was asked to draw inferences from the content of her Honour's reasons. In my opinion, the material before the Court, at the most, gives rise to competing inferences of equal likelihood: see Luxton v Vines [1952] HCA 19; 85 CLR 352. 

Did Morgan DCJ impose a licence disqualification period contrary to law? 

67As the applicant has not established that Culver LCM erred as alleged, it has not been established that Morgan DCJ erred because she adopted Culver LCM's error. Accordingly, the applicant's first argument should be rejected. 

68That leaves for consideration the further questions: whether the licence disqualification period was in issue on the sentence appeal; whether her Honour was bound to consider s 188(4) when imposing a period of licence disqualification regardless of whether the licence disqualification period was in issue on the sentence appeal; and whether her Honour committed jurisdictional error in refusing the application to reopen the sentencing proceedings. 

69In support of his submission that the licence disqualification period was in issue on the sentence appeal, the applicant contended that his evidence as to his abstinence from alcohol since his conviction was relevant both to sentence by way of fine or imprisonment, as well as to any period of licence disqualification. He pointed out that at the time of the appeal, the evidence as to his abstinence from alcohol was that his prognosis was positive, the inference being, as I would understand the submission, that he was fit to hold a licence and that this was a matter relevant to the licence disqualification period. 

70During the course of argument, attention was drawn to the applicant's evidence before Morgan DCJ that he had sold his car, which might indicate that the licence disqualification period was not in issue. The applicant submitted that this evidence was at best neutral and certainly could not base an inference that he was not concerned to raise the period of licence disqualification as part of his appeal against sentence. I do not agree. This evidence, expressly elicited from the applicant by his senior counsel, is supportive of, but not sufficient of itself, to draw an inference that the period of disqualification was not in issue, or at least not seriously in issue, before her Honour. If the period of licence disqualification was in issue, questions would have been asked that directly concerned it. In the absence of those questions being asked, the Court should not draw the inference that the applicant seeks: see Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (No 2) (1991 ) 22 NSWLR 389. 

71The applicant also relied upon a medical report of a treating psychiatrist, a Probation and Parole pre-sentence report, a final report from the PCYC Traffic Education Program and testimonial material that had been in evidence in both the Local Court proceedings and on the sentence appeal in the District Court. This material was not re-tendered on the s 43 application and there was a question as to its relevance in the present proceedings. 

72In my opinion, the material is relevant to the question whether the licence disqualification period was in issue on the sentence appeal. Whether it supported that proposition is a different question. The medical and testimonial evidence was directed to the applicant's good character, his contrition, his attempts at rehabilitation in relation to his alcohol problems and to his realisation of the harm that can be caused by drink driving and speeding. The Probation and Parole pre-sentence report did not direct any attention to the question of licence disqualification. The Traffic Education Program final report indicated that the applicant had an understanding of the dangers of drink driving and speeding. 

73To the extent that this material related to the applicant's recognition of the dangers of drink driving it may have had some relevance to the period of licence disqualification. I would infer that that was the case in the Local Court. So far as the sentence appeal in the District Court was concerned, the tendered material would have been relevant to the disqualification period to the same extent, if the disqualification period was in issue. However, of itself, that part of the material relating to the applicant's recognition of the dangers of drink driving is insufficient to base an inference that the period of licence disqualification was in issue on the District Court appeal. 

74The applicant then advanced a number of arguments which he contended demonstrated that the disqualification period was in issue. He submitted that the result on the conviction appeal had been favourable to him, in the sense that her Honour had found the objective seriousness of the offence was less than had been found by Culver LCM. It was for that reason that her Honour had varied the sentence of imprisonment and had ordered that the applicant serve consecutive periods of community service totalling 250 hours. The applicant submitted that it followed that her Honour was required to consider the period of disqualification to be imposed. 

75In an allied submission, the applicant contended that there was no basis to infer that he had litigated his way out of challenging the disqualification period imposed upon him by Culver LCM. He submitted that there was a difficulty in finding that an inference could be drawn that a deliberate decision had been taken on the appeal to the District Court not to raise the period of licence disqualification, in circumstances where it could only have been to his benefit to have raised it. 

76Whilst these are arguments that support the applicant's contention, they do not advance the question whether the licence disqualification period was in issue one way or the other. In particular, the last argument fails to grapple with Mr Hughes QC's obvious retreat when Morgan DCJ told him "" not to push his luck "". 

77Nor do these arguments counterbalance the fact that, as her Honour noted at p 4 of her reasons, the applicant had not been asked "" one question by his legal representatives or by the Crown relating to the periods of disqualification imposed upon him "" and she was "" certain that at no time was the issue of s 188(4) raised before [her] "". The highest the matter reached, on her Honour's recollection, was that the question of the period of licence disqualification had, at the most, been "" lightly touched upon "" by the applicant's senior counsel. I infer her Honour considered that the question of licence disqualification was not a matter that had been raised in any way that required her to turn her attention to it. 

78The applicant sought to neutralise the effect of this apparent, if not obvious, omission of senior counsel to raise s 188(4) before her Honour, or to submit that she was required to deal with the licence disqualification period, with the response that although his senior counsel was highly experienced, licence disqualification was not his area of legal expertise. I do not consider the response assists the applicant. The period of licence disqualification was either in issue or it was not. It was apparent that Mr Hughes QC retreated from putting the disqualification period in issue. 

79Accordingly, given the transcripts and her Honour's reasons on both the sentence appeal and the s 43 application, I am of the opinion that the disqualification period was not in issue on the sentence appeal. The applicant sought to have the Court draw an inference that it was in issue on material that was equivocal at best. There was evidence that could have established that fact. The applicant, his solicitor, or any of the three counsel who appeared for him in the District Court could have given that evidence. No explanation was given as to why none of these persons gave evidence on this question. In the circumstances, the Court is more comfortably able to draw the inference that the matter was not in issue: see Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; 101 CLR 298. 

80In my opinion, subject to one matter, there cannot be a failure to take into account a relevant consideration in respect of a sentence that was not in issue in the proceedings. In this case, I have concluded that the aspect of the sentence comprising the period of licence disqualification was not in issue on the District Court appeal. That is different from a case such as Traegar where the relevant sentence was in issue but the court was not told of a fact relevant to the sentence that by law ought to have been imposed. There is at least one qualification to the view I have expressed in the first sentence of this paragraph. If in making an order, the effect of which was to confirm an order made in the court below, then, if the lower court's order was not within power, s 43 would be available to correct the error. That was not the position here. 

Was Morgan DCJ required to have regard to the automatic licence disqualification period? 

81The applicant's next submission was that regardless whether he had raised the period of disqualification on the sentence appeal, her Honour was obliged to have regard to the legislative regime that governed licence sentence disqualification. It was said that ss 188 and 188(4) was a relevant consideration in the sense of one that the trial judge was bound to take into account: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40; 162 CLR 24 at 39-40. Put shortly, it was submitted that her Honour was required to know what the relevant law was so as to impose a sentence according to law. I will consider this submission on the assumption that I am wrong in my conclusion that the licence disqualification period was not in issue on the appeal. 

82The premise upon which the submission was based was that her Honour was required to sentence the applicant afresh. I have doubted that premise, but I will proceed on the basis that the same arguments would be advanced even if the correct premise is that her Honour was required to exercise an independent discretion as to whether to dismiss the appeal in respect of the disqualification period. 

83As I have already indicated, s 43 is concerned with the correction of sentencing errors that answer the description in s 43(1) and, relevantly in this case, a sentence that was "" contrary to law "". The only way in which it was asserted that the section was engaged was the argument that Morgan DCJ, in determining what disqualification period to order, was required to have regard to the automatic disqualification period under s 188(4). As she had not done so she had imposed a sentence that was "" contrary to law "". 

84In support of this submission, the applicant relied upon the remarks of Howie J in the Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a Guideline Judgment Concerning the Offence of High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol Under Section 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (No. 3 of 2002) [2004] NSWCCA 303; (2004) 61 NSWLR 305 (the Guideline judgment), at [126]-[127]. 

85Howie J, at [126] of the Guideline judgment, stressed that the automatic disqualification period was not to be treated as if it were the maximum period of disqualification. His Honour observed that there must be cases where a period of disqualification greater than the disqualification period ought to be ordered. However, his Honour further commented, at [127], that "" courts are too ready to reduce the automatic period and choose the minimum period "". His Honour continued: 

""The failure of the courts to give sufficient regard to the automatic disqualification periods prescribed by Parliament is indicated by a finding that in only 11 per cent of cases was the offender disqualified for as long as 2 years and 14 per cent for as long as 3 years ... There should be sufficient and appropriate reasons for reducing the automatic period that are capable of being expressed by the court before such a step is taken. Those reasons should take into account the scheme of the Act and the significance of Parliament's view that the automatic period is the period of disqualification to apply in the usual case."" 

86Later, at [146], in proposing the guideline for a high range PCA, his Honour stated that in an ordinary case, "" the automatic disqualification period will be appropriate unless there is good reason to reduce the period of disqualification "". It is apparent from his Honour's remarks that the minimum period of disqualification would usually involve the imposition of a penalty that was inadequate. Although his Honour's remarks were made in respect of a high range PCA, it can be accepted that they would be relevant to a mid-range PCA, as was the case here. 

87The applicant's submission relied, in particular, on the last sentence of Howie J's remarks at [127], namely, if the automatic period was the period of disqualification to be imposed in the usual case, the Court would have to know what that period was in order to determine whether some greater or lesser period was warranted. 

88As a matter of sentencing principle, a court is required to have regard to the maximum penalty for an offence. It would be contrary to law to impose a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum. This is a trite proposition and needs no exposition. The maximum penalty also provides an indication to the court of the relative seriousness of the offence: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 281 ALR 652 at [31]. It was in this sense that in Muldrock the Court described the maximum prescribed sentence as a legislative "" guidepost "": see at [27]. 

89The Court applied the same description to the standard non-parole periods. After making the observation that the maximum penalty served as an indication of the relative seriousness of the offence, the Court stated: 

""The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case. It may be, as the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in Way , that for some Div 1A offences there will be a move upwards in the length of the non-parole period as a result of the introduction of the standard non-parole period. This is the likely outcome of adding the court's awareness of the standard non-parole period to the various considerations bearing on the determination of the appropriate sentence. It is not because the standard non-parole period is the starting point in sentencing for a midrange offence after conviction."" (citations omitted) 

90Section 188, as I have indicated, does not prescribe a maximum period of licence disqualification. It prescribes a minimum period and an automatic default period if no order of disqualification is made. The minimum period of disqualification is a matter that a sentencing judge would be required to have in mind when determining what order to make, as the imposition of a lesser period would be contrary to law. 

91In my opinion, the automatic disqualification period is also a matter to which a sentencing judge should have regard in determining the penalty to be imposed, as it provides to the court an indication of the seriousness with which the legislature regarded various levels of PCA offences. The fact that the legislature considered it appropriate to legislate for a maximum period of disqualification in the case of multiple offences arising from the same incident, also provides an indication to the sentencing judge that the legislature had in mind that a form of accumulation was appropriate. These observations say no more than that, as is the case in sentencing in respect of any statutory offence, a judge, in sentencing for an offence or offences that fall within the Road Transport (General) Act , Pt 5.4, should be aware of the statutory provisions. 

92A failure to be aware of such statutory provisions may result in a sentence that is manifestly inadequate or excessive. It is a different question as to whether that constitutes a sentencing error that is "" contrary to law "" within s 43. In my opinion, that question can be answered fairly readily. As I have discussed, the effect of the authorities is that s 43 looks to the outcome of the proceedings. It is the sentence imposed which must be "" contrary to law "". That is, there must be an error in the sentence imposed with the consequence that some different sentence is required. Thus a sentence that is greater or less than that prescribed will be a sentence imposed that is "" contrary to law "". For example, if a sentence is imposed in respect of a high range PCA, when the offence was a mid or low-range PCA, there will be a sentence imposed that is "" contrary to law "". 

93The applicant accepts that the licence disqualification period imposed by Culver LCM and "" confirmed "" by Morgan DCJ was within power. Although the applicant did not fashion his submission this way, what in fact he seeks to do is demonstrate that had Morgan DCJ been aware of the automatic disqualification, there may have been a different result in the exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion. In my opinion, s 43 does not cover such a case. This case is quite different from the example given in Ho where the appellant could specifically identify what sentence would have been imposed had the court taken into account the period of pre-sentence imprisonment. 

94In my opinion, the applicant has not demonstrated jurisdictional error. 

Discretionary considerations 

95Even if I am wrong in any of the foregoing, I would, as a matter of discretion, refuse the relief the applicant seeks for the following reasons. 

96The s 43 application was seriously delayed, having been made some three years after the District Court appeal was determined. No explanation has been given for that delay, other than for the applicant's wish to have some amelioration of the lengthy period of disqualification that was imposed. 

97Even if the licence disqualification period was in issue on the sentence appeal, the main focus of the appeal was to obtain a variation of the sentence of imprisonment that was imposed. At the most, there was a fleeting mention of the disqualification period. In my opinion, as a matter of discretion, when the applicant did not seriously contend for a different result on the sentence appeal, the Court ought not now enable that possibility by the grant of prerogative relief requiring the District Court to reopen the sentence hearing. 

98For these reasons, I would order that the summons be dismissed with costs. 

99BASTEN JA : On the night of 4 October 2006 the applicant, Mr Peter Meakin, failed to stop as directed by police, for breath testing. He was charged with dangerous driving and driving with a prescribed concentration of blood alcohol in the mid-range. In April 2007 he was convicted by Magistrate Culver of the dangerous driving offence and pleaded guilty to the mid-range PCA offence. He was sentenced to imprisonment, to be served by way of periodic detention and was disqualified from holding a driver licence for eight years. He appealed to the District Court. 

100On 17 December 2007, Morgan DCJ dismissed the appeal against conviction, but, taking a lesser view of the seriousness of his misconduct, varied the sentences of imprisonment to community service orders. She ""confirmed"" the costs order and the period of disqualification imposed in the Local Court. 

101There was no appeal available from those orders. No application was made to this Court in its supervisory jurisdiction suggesting jurisdictional error in the sentencing proceedings. Rather, almost three years later, on 13 September 2010, the applicant sought an order, pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act ""), re-opening the judgment of 17 December 2007, with respect to the period of disqualification. On 15 December 2010 the application was dismissed by Morgan DCJ. 

102There was no appeal available from the refusal to reopen the proceedings in which the applicant was sentenced. The application to this Court invokes the supervisory jurisdiction, seeking relief in the nature of the old prerogative writs, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). Given the privative clause in s 176 of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW), to obtain relief in this Court, the applicant must, as he accepts, demonstrate jurisdictional error on the part of the District Court at the re-opening hearing: Spanos v Lazaris [2008] NSWCA 74 at [15]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Emanuel [2009] NSWCA 42; 193 A Crim R 552 at [18] and [45] and Hoffenberg v District Court of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 142 at [3]-[5]. 

103It was not contended by the applicant that the period of disqualification imposed by the magistrate was not available to her, in the sense that it was beyond power. Nor was it contended that it was not within the power of the District Court to confirm that sentence on appeal. There may have been an error on the part of the magistrate in specifying the date on which the period of disqualification terminated, given that the order was stayed by the appeal to the District Court, but that is not an error of which the applicant complains: cf Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Higginson [2011] NSWCA 151. 

104The argument for the applicant was that Morgan DCJ committed jurisdictional error by denying the existence of a jurisdiction which she in fact enjoyed. She thus failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in her, inviting an order in the nature of mandamus and, no doubt, certiorari in support thereof. Relief in the nature of certiorari is not, however, available for non-jurisdictional error of law discernable from the reasons of the primary judge. 

105Morgan DCJ, on the re-opening application, summarised the operation of the relevant provisions of s 188 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) in terms with which the applicant does not cavil. That provision empowers a court to disqualify the person ""for such period as may be specified in the order"". In respect of specific offences, minimum periods are imposed and, in the absence of a court order, there is an automatic statutory disqualification. 

106The periods of automatic disqualification for the two offences for which the applicant was convicted were 3 years and 5 years respectively. However, in respect of two convictions arising from ""a single incident"" the lesser period would have been disregarded and the period of automatic disqualification would have been 5 years: s 188(4)(b). The magistrate specified a period of 8 years which was, in effect, an accumulation of the automatic disqualification periods for each offence. Whether or not she realised she was extending the period of automatic disqualification is not clear, but it no longer matters. The sentencing exercise was undertaken afresh by the District Court. As a result, the relevant sentence is that imposed by the District Court: Wishart v Fraser [1941] HCA 8; 64 CLR 470. Whatever error may have been made by the magistrate, there can be no challenge to her orders and therefore the error is irrelevant, except to the extent that it can be shown that the District Court adopted her reasoning and thus her error. 

107In seeking to re-open, the applicant relied upon an affidavit of his solicitor, which noted that submissions on penalty in the District Court had not been transcribed and which provided no evidence as to what, if anything, was said in the course of submissions with respect to the disqualification order. There is no suggestion in the judgment of Morgan DCJ on sentence, that there had been any challenge to the disqualification order. Further, in her judgment on the re-opening application, Morgan DCJ stated (p 4): 

""To my clear recollection there was but a fleeting reference to the periods of disqualification which had been imposed by the learned Magistrate. 
... 

Although the submissions by counsel were not transcribed, to my recollection no submissions were made to me with respect to the periods of disqualification. I am quite certain that at no time was the issue of s 188(4) raised before me."" 

108Those statements constitute findings of fact, relevant to the application then before the District Court. Those findings are unchallenged and, in the present proceedings, unchallengeable. Furthermore, they require the dismissal of the present application. A judge imposing a sentence entirely within power, who was not asked by the applicant to impose any different sentence, cannot have committed jurisdictional error. 

109In her careful judgment on the re-opening application, Morgan DCJ then referred to cases in relation to the scope of s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act , dealing with the circumstances in which a court might re-open an earlier proceeding and, in particular, Ho v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 35 NSWLR 393 and R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150. She then concluded: 

""As has been acknowledged by counsel for the applicant the Magistrate had a discretion to increase the period of automatic disqualification above that specified in the section. In structuring the periods of disqualification the way that she did makes clear how seriously she regarded these offences. 

In my view, whether or not s 188(4) was brought to her attention, this is not a case in which the learned Magistrate imposed a period of disqualification which was not available to her. This is not a case like Ho where the judge overlooked a period of time already served in custody and even giving the section the widest possible operation it could not be said that the periods of disqualification were not imposed in accordance with the proper exercise of her discretion. 

In my view there has not been disclosed any error of law made by her Honour in imposing the disqualification periods which she did and it follows nor does my confirmation of the orders of disqualification of licence made in respect of each of the offences. Therefore I do not consider the penalty that has been imposed is contrary to law."" 

110In order to challenge this reasoning, senior counsel for the applicant put forward three propositions. The first, being the broad statement that her Honour denied she had jurisdiction under s 43, is unsupportable. She clearly recognised that such jurisdiction existed, but denied that it was engaged in the present case. 

111The second proposition was at a lower level of generality, namely that her Honour misconstrued s 43, by failing to adopt a broad construction of the kind required by Ho and Finnie . In other words, a wider range of errors was available for correction under s 43 than she recognised. As her Honour properly acknowledged, she was bound by the reasoning in Ho and Finnie and correctly identified the scope of the jurisdiction conferred. If she had failed to apply the principles correctly, there might have been a question as to whether that constituted an error of law at all, let alone jurisdictional error. However, it cannot be said that she identified an error which in fact fell within the scope of s 43 but held that it did not. Rather, she found that there had been no error at all. 

112The third proposition relied on by the applicant was that there was error in imposing a period of disqualification without having regard to the period of automatic disqualification applicable to the circumstances before the Court. That period was, in the language of judicial review, a ""relevant consideration"", being a mandatory consideration in the sense that a failure to take it into account will invalidate the exercise of power: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40; 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 (Mason J). However, such language should be used with care, particularly when transposing the concept from administrative to judicial decision-making. Here, there is a sense in which the period of automatic disqualification is critical to the exercise of the court's power: a court cannot prescribe the automatic period of disqualification, but only a shorter period or a longer period. However, beyond that statutory limitation on power, it is by no means clear what it means to say that the automatic disqualification must be ""taken into account"" by the Court in making some other order. The statute does not say that it must be taken into account, nor how it should be taken into account. The statute does not say that it is the period appropriate to a particular kind of offence; rather, the statute expressly provides that the court may order disqualification, without identifying any relevant criteria, standards or limits (except minimum periods for specific offences). 

113There is a further difficulty in suggesting that there are mandatory matters in respect of such an exercise as sentencing, absent consideration of which the sentence will be invalid, or at least erroneous in some lesser sense. Thus, in situations where the consideration of specified matters is prescribed, as in s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act , the obligation is carefully limited to such matters as are ""relevant and known to the court"": s 21A(1). Such a limitation would no doubt be implied, if not made express. Were it otherwise, the sentencing process would become fraught with the risk of erroneous decision-making and every case would need to be expanded to avoid the risk of inadvertent error. Senior counsel for the applicant noted that in Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission (NSW) [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531, even the consent of a defendant to a particular course would not save a conviction from invalidity if that course constituted jurisdictional error. However, there is a difference between matters which are fundamental to the validity of proceedings, and matters which must be taken into account, if drawn to the attention of the court. 

114There may be circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice can occur because of the manner in which a case was conducted by counsel: see, eg, Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [9]-[10] (Gleeson CJ). However, failure to take a point, including one as to the constitutional validity of the law under which proceedings are brought, will not usually provide a basis for re-opening a case finally determined. As explained in University of Wollongong v Metwally (No 2) [1985] HCA 28; 59 ALJR 481 at 483: 
""It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case had been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had [an] opportunity to do so."" 

115In any event, the submission fails on a factual basis. The primary judge was not satisfied that the magistrate did not take s 188(4) and the relevant automatic disqualification period into account: she said that whether it was ""brought to her Honour's attention ... is not known"": p 5. That left the applicant with the proposition that even though the period of disqualification imposed by the magistrate was not challenged on appeal, and no one referred the District Court to any possible error on the part of the magistrate in failing to take account of s 188(4), nevertheless because her Honour confirmed the period without herself having reference to s 188(4) (or any other relevant consideration) she must have imposed a sentence ""contrary to law"" and thus within the terms of s 43. To dismiss such a submission not only did not constitute jurisdictional error, but was clearly correct. 

116The summons should be dismissed. The proceedings being in the supervisory jurisdiction, the civil costs rules are engaged. The applicant must pay the respondent's costs in this Court.

		30 November 2011",2011-11-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2758294,R v TROTT & ROBERTSON [2011] NSWDC 236,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Mathew John Robertson and Luke William Trott appear for sentence today after having pleaded guilty to an offence of robbery in company. They were each arraigned on an indictment containing two counts of robbery in company, the charge being the alternative, which the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. 

2The offenders went out drinking. It was Mr Robertson's birthday so he had more than the others. He, Mr Trott and two others, David Field and Christopher Hoffman, were driving home. As they travelled along Vine Street in Hurstville Mr Robertson needed to vomit and so the car pulled up. He got out of the car and vomited into the gutter. At the same time a man by the name of Krishna Sabkota was walking home. He had got off the train at 11 o'clock at Hurstville Railway Station and was heading home alone. It goes without saying that he should have been entitled to walk safely along the street without drunken, violent criminals setting upon him. Unfortunately Mr Robertson and Mr Trott did not seem to share that idea.

3Mr Robertson was out of the car but the others were in the car. Quite what occurred has been the subject of some discussion and evidence today. Mr Robertson has at one stage given evidence inconsistent with the version of events which appears and agreed, and I emphasise the word agreed, in the summary of facts. Indeed at one stage he denied committing a robbery at all. However after Mr Hutchinson spoke to him and he was recalled to give further evidence he did accept that he did what I am about to describe. 

4As I said Mr Sabkota walked past Mr Robertson vomiting in the gutter. Mr Robertson approached Mr Sabkota and demanded that he give him his mobile phone. Mr Sabkota tried to run away but Mr Robertson was not going to have that. He chased after him and punched Mr Sabkota to his left shoulder. He punched him again which caused Mr Sabkota to fall to the ground. Mr Robertson was not finished. He continued to punch Mr Sabkota, as he was lying helpless on the ground, to his head, face and shoulder. 

5By this stage Mr Trott had got out of the car. Contrary to what he has said to others who have interviewed him for the purpose of these proceedings he was involved in the robbery in the following way. Mr Sabkota saw Mr Trott and believing that Mr Trott might be able to help him he called out for help. Mr Trott's response was simply to punch Mr Sabkota in the head, face and his shoulder. It was at that stage that Mr Robertson took Mr Sabkota's mobile telephone from him and then one of them, either Mr Robertson or Mr Trott demanded that Mr Sabkota give them his money and wallet. Mr Sabkota showed his empty wallet to the offenders and they got back in their car and drove away. 

6Not surprisingly Mr Sabkota immediately reported what had happened to the police. Police then discovered the car and, discovered incriminating material in it, including matters belonging to Mr Sabkota. They also discovered Mr Sabkota's mobile phone after one of the officers cleverly dialled his telephone number and heard Mr Sabkota's mobile telephone ringing in the car. 

7This offence represents not only an offence of violence which has Mr Sabkota as its victim, it represents a very significant breach of the peace. Gleeson CJ, when he was the Chief Justice of New South Wales, spoke about offences of this type and the impact they have on the community in a decision called R v Ranse (unreported) 8 August 1994. He emphasised the breach of the peace aspect of offences of this kind. All of us should be able to walk home safely at night alone, and when offences of this kind occur, all of us suffer. We walk apprehensively. We are forced to take actions to ensure our personal safety. Many of us do not go out at night at all because of the fear that offences of this kind create. It is for this reason that offences of this kind are most serious indeed.

8This was not the first time that Mr Trott had committed an offence of this nature. Somewhat remarkably he was on parole at the time he committed this offence as well as probation. He had served a short period in custody in a Juvenile Justice facility for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and had been released to parole. He was on probation from the Children's Court. An examination of his criminal history reveals earlier offending involving robbery and robbery in company. The criminal history also reveals, that for all of his offending, Mr Trott was dealt with relatively leniently. I suspect this did him no favours. The leniency that was shown to Mr Trott, I have little doubt, created in him a belief that he could commit offences of this kind repeatedly and get away with them, that is, receive only minor punishment. That attitude seemed to have continued despite the breach of conditional liberty that this offence represented. No action was taken on the breach of parole and no action was taken on the breach of the probation order. That attitude by the authorities I believe has compounded the problem, I repeat, creating in Mr Trott the belief that he can commit offences of this kind and not be significantly punished. How else to explain why he would get out of the car whilst Mr Robertson was robbing Mr Sabkota and inflict violence upon him?

9Mr Trott is now twenty years of age, he was nineteen at the time of the offence. He is the only child born to his natural parents but he has met his biological father only once. He regards his stepfather as his father and he has two younger half-siblings, a sister and a brother. After his natural parents separated his mother began to drink and would fly into rages at her partners. Things improved after his mother met his stepfather. She ceased drinking and calmed down. He has a close bond with his half-siblings and lives in the family home with them. He had some troubles at school, being expelled for fighting. He ceased his secondary education when he got a job at the Pizza Hut. He has then had a number of other positions, including working as a removalist with his stepfather, securing an apprenticeship as a carpenter and now works as a carpentry apprentice for Building Advisory Service Pty Limited. A reference tendered from a director of that company speaks highly of him.

10He began to use alcohol when he was about fourteen and would drink to excess regularly. The fact that he committed this offence whilst intoxicated is not really a matter of mitigation in his case. He said that all his other offending occurred whilst he was drunk and so he must have been aware of the link between drinking and offending when he voluntarily consumed alcohol that evening. Of course the connection between alcohol and offending is still relevant however because if the offender can overcome his problems with alcohol then it is much less likely that he will continue to commit offences in the future. 

11I now turn to the matter that Mr Krisenthal placed most emphasis on. Mr Trott spent two months and one week in custody. Because of his age that was an adult gaol. I observed Mr Trott give evidence about his experience in adult custody. I have no doubt that he found that experience scary or perhaps even terrifying. Having visited many prisons myself I can understand why he would feel that way. Prisons are terrible places, full of violent people who care little about the rights of others. Since being released on bail after two months and one week in custody Mr Krisenthal says there has been a remarkable turnaround in his client. No offence has been committed and he has complied with strict conditions of bail, including a curfew. He is now employed and well respected by his employers. Mr Krisenthal submits that his client has achieved already a substantial measure of rehabilitation. 

12The material before me would suggest that he is, in many respects, a different person to the one who committed this offence in July last year. He appears to have abstained from alcohol. He has completed an anger management program with Enough is Enough, although I do note that he had started that program before he committed this offence. I accept that the offender does desire to put his offences behind him. Although he is quite young, he has managed to rack up a significant number of serious offences. Indeed, as at July 2010 he was demonstrating a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. He seemed to have little thought for the consequences of his actions, either as far as he is concerned or, as far as the victims of his offences are concerned. But from what I can see there is at least the possibility that his time in adult prison has affected his outlook to the extent that he is making real and genuine efforts to rehabilitate himself. Mr Krisenthal suggested that whilst he accepted that a custodial sentence was required any sentence of imprisonment could be suspended assuming, of course, that the period of imprisonment I decide upon would be two years or less.

13In determining the length of the sentence I take into account the presentence custody and discount that sentence by ten per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. When I do that I reach a result where the sentence of imprisonment I am contemplating makes the offender entitled to a suspended sentence. But, and this is a big but, I do not consider that a suspended sentence is appropriate for two reasons. Firstly, it does not act as sufficient personal deterrence to the offender. Secondly, he needs to be punished for what he has done. 

14The realities of a suspended sentence cannot be ignored. The offender walks out of court a free man subject to a requirement that he not commit criminal offences for the period of suspension. In contrast to what has occurred when he has been sentenced in the past, I consider that the offender needs to made aware in very concrete terms by the imposition of a sentence which carries a substantial element of punishment that he cannot continue to act in the way he has been and expect to get away with it. 

15I turn now to Mr Robertson. In contrast to Mr Trott, Mr Robertson had no criminal history at all. He lived with his parents and two siblings until he was asked to leave home. This followed a period where the business that his parents were involved in failed. His father starting drinking excessively and the atmosphere at home changed considerably. After he left home he began squatting in a boatshed near his home. His younger brother used to bring him food. Notwithstanding that he was living alone, he continued to go to school. He remains distressed that his parents apparently made no attempt to enquire about his welfare. 

16He moved in with his grandmother after completing his School Certificate and, whilst she was loving and caring, it was around this time that the offender started drinking significant quantities of alcohol. At one stage he was living in his car. Matters only began to improve after he met his girlfriend, Sally Carr. He has moved in with her family and lives there to this day. He has had very little contact with his own family and I rather gather has come to regard Ms Carr's family as his own. 

17As with Mr Trott, he too has had work over the years and has been quite successful at whatever job he took on. He is now working for Leon K Engineering. He says very positive things about working for that company and the director, Leon Kallatsis speaks very highly of him. He hopes next year to begin a TAFE course in engineering. 

18He has been assisted recently by a psychologist, Mr Neil Ballardie to deal with issues such as low self esteem and has also been involved in the Salvation Army's Positive Lifestyle Program. Reports from Mr Ballardie and the Salvation Army demonstrate that Mr Robertson has participated well in counselling and it has been of benefit to him. 

19Of course one of the issues that arises in this case is parity. Neither Mr Robertson nor Mr Trott should have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed on him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender. As in most cases there are factors that work both ways. Whilst Mr Robertson has no prior convictions and was not on any form of conditional liberty at the time of this offence, he was the prime mover in the offence. Nevertheless, because Mr Robertson's offence was his first, despite the fact that the was the prime mover, I will impose upon him a sentence which is less severe than the sentence I will impose upon Mr Trott. In Mr Robertson's case there is no history of him committing offences whilst intoxicated and so I will regard the circumstance that he was very significantly drunk to the point of vomiting at the time he committed this offence as a matter in his favour. 

20Mr Hutchinson accepted that his client too could realistically only expect a custodial sentence and attention then turned to the form that it would take assuming, once more, that the length of the sentence I decided to impose upon Mr Robertson was such that alternatives were open. As with Mr Trott, I consider that a suspended sentence is inappropriate. It does not reflect the seriousness of what these two men did. It would not involve sufficient punishment of Mr Robertson. I believe that community expectations are such that someone who sets upon a young man walking home alone, strikes him repeatedly and robs him of his mobile phone are such that that person cannot go unpunished, even if it is their first offence. I believe that it is appropriate in this case for the sentence that I impose to reflect those community values. 

21I raised with Mr Hutchinson whether an intensive corrections order would be appropriate. Mr Hutchinson's response was that the pre-sentence report suggested that Mr Robertson was not a person in need of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service because the issues that Mr Robertson faces with alcohol, anger management and the like are being dealt with elsewhere. On the other hand the report from the psychologist, Ms Robilliard, says that ""Mathew may benefit from a period of monitoring and support by the Probation and Parole Service"". Not only do I prefer the opinion of Ms Robilliard, given Mr Robertson's background, but I recognise that many components of an intensive correction order do involve hardship on the person serving that order and so there is a significant component of punishment involved in a person serving such an order. If it turns out that the Probation and Parole Service suggest that Mr Robertson is unsuitable for an ICO because he does not need supervision by the Probation and Parole Service then other forms of custody, short of full-time imprisonment, will be open to me. I have in mind, because of the length of the sentence I have decided to impose, the possibility of home detention.

22I return now to Mr Trott. This offence represents the culmination of a period of offending by a person who appeared to care little of his obligations to obey the law. He entirely voluntarily got out of the car that night and struck an entirely innocent person for reasons that are difficult to understand, knowing full well that if he did that he would likely go back into custody. Ordinarily that would mean that the only way that such a sentence of imprisonment could be served would be full-time in an adult gaol. However, I will not do that for two reasons. firstly, Mr Trott was not the prime mover and secondly, the evidence would suggest that, as Mr Krisenthal suggested, his short, sharp shock in the adult gaol has led to a significant change in his attitude and behaviour. I want Mr Trott to know however, how close he was to going back into an adult gaol for a significant period of time. This is one of those cases where the way in which the sentence of imprisonment should be served is finely balanced and it would not have taken much for me to decide that Mr Trott would not be going home today but would be going back to that awful place where, as I said earlier, violence is common and respect for the rights of others is almost entirely absent.

23I have decided that Mr Trott should, if eligible, serve the sentence of imprisonment by way of an intensive corrections order. If it turns out that he is not suitable then, because of the length of sentence I have decided to impose upon him, he will not be eligible for an alternative such as home detention and so there remains the possibility that despite everything I have said Mr Trott will nevertheless end up serving his sentence in an adult gaol.

24In each case I am satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence will be for a period of no more than two years. I can indicate that the periods I have determined will be appropriate are two years in the case of Mr Trott and eighteen months in the case of Mr Robertson. 

25Each offender is referred for assessment as to his suitability for intensive correction orders as a means of serving the sentence. 

26They are each to be granted bail on their current terms until they appear before me once more after the assessment has been completed. Now that will obviously have to be in the new year on 17 February 2012 at 2 o'clock.

27Mr Trott and Mr Robertson do you understand what I have done? Mr Trott, especially in your case you are not out of the woods yet. Much depends on the assessment by the prison authorities, so it is in your interest to co-operate with them and persuade them that you can do what you are promising to do. As I said if you are not suitable for this intensive correction order you might still end up in a prison. 

28Mr Robertson, it is less likely that you will end up in prison but there is still a possibility depending on whether you are not suitable for an ICO. And if I remand you for assessment for home detention and you are not suitable you may well end up in gaol after all as well. 

29So you are both on bail. It is important that you both comply with the conditions of bail. It is important that you both comply with the requirements of the people that will be assessing you. If you do not it is much more likely that you are going to go back into gaol.

		23 July 2012",2011-11-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758306,GOVINDARAJU v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 255,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agree with the orders proposed by Hall J and with his Honour's reasons. 

2HALL J : The applicant, Balamurugan Govindaraju, by notice dated 6 April 2011, seeks leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 16 July 2010. 

3The applicant was charged with an offence of importing a substance, being a border control drug, namely, heroin, the quantity of which was said to be a marketable quantity, contrary to the provisions of s.307.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) ( ""the Code"" ). 

4The maximum penalty for such an offence is 25 years' imprisonment and/or a fine of $555,000: see s.307.2(1). 

5The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years commencing 12 April 2009 and expiring on 11 April 2018. The sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 5 years, 4 months and 24 days. Accordingly, the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 4 September 2014. 

6The following two grounds of appeal were relied upon:- 

""1. The sentencing judge erred in finding an aggravating factor was that the applicant's role was greater than that of a courier. 

2. The sentencing judge erred in using the statement of assistance as evidence of the objective gravity of the offence."" 

7At the hearing, leave was granted for the applicant to rely upon a third ground. On 6 July 2011, the applicant filed a Supplementary Grounds of Appeal in which the following addition ground was set out:- 

""3. Her Honour erred in failing to allow procedural fairness to the applicant by her finding, as an aggravating factor, that the applicant's role was above that of a courier without providing the applicant the opportunity to make submissions to the contrary."" 

Background 

8The applicant was born on 3 June 1978. He was, accordingly, 30 years of age as at the date of the offence, namely, 12 April 2009. 

9The applicant advised that he was married with no children. His wife or former wife is presently said to reside in Indonesia. The evidence in this Court established that she has separated from the marriage. 

10In Malaysia, the applicant worked in various factories as a factory hand and, on two occasions, he went to Singapore in search for better paid work. It appears that he was there employed as a truck driver as at the date of the offence. 

11He had not previously visited Australia and had no family or other contacts when he arrived in this country. 

12He is not adversely recorded against any criminal law enforcement indices in Australia. However, evidence was produced at the sentencing hearing which indicated that he has a limited record of criminal offences in Malaysia and Singapore. I will refer to his criminal history later in this judgment. 

Circumstances of the offence 

13At the sentencing hearing, the Crown tendered a statement of facts which established the following matters. 

14The applicant arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport at about 6.55 pm on Sunday 12 April 2009 aboard a Malaysian Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He was travelling on a Malaysian passport with a visitor's visa which was valid in Australia for three months. 

15On arrival, he was questioned by Customs Officers. He advised that he had travelled to Australia from Malaysia after a two week stay in India where surgery had been performed on his shoulder. He indicated that the purpose of his trip to Australia was for a short seven day holiday. 

16He subsequently told Customs Officers that, whilst in India, he had been given gold to swallow and smuggle into Australia. 

17He consented to undergo an internal search and, in due course and following admission to St George Hospital, Kogarah, he passed a total of 75 foreign objects (pellets). 

18On 15 April 2009, he was charged. On 16 April 2009, investigations determined that the 75 pellets contained compressed off-white powder, the gross weight of which was 594.9 grams. These were analysed and were confirmed as being heroin. The purity of the heroin was 62.6%. The total pure weight of heroin imported by the applicant was calculated to be 372.4 grams. The ""street value"" of 594.9 grams of heroin was estimated at between $148,725 and $267,705. 

19The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. Accordingly, t he details of the applicant's background are based upon the history as recorded in a psychological report by Dr Katie Seidler, clinical and forensic psychologist dated 11 September 2009. The report was tendered at the sentencing hearing and became Exhibit 1. 

20Dr Seidler noted that the applicant appeared to be ""somewhat unsophisticated, both socially and intellectually"" . She obtained a history of the applicant's father dying in about 2003. His mother was living in Malaysia and had health problems. His eldest brother was said to have died in 2007 in a motor vehicle accident. The loss of his brother was said to have had an impact upon him. 

21He attended school in Malaysia and competed primary school. He ceased mid-way through his second year of high school (Year 8) in order to pursue employment and begin contributing financially to the family. 

22The report set out the history of various employments in factories from the age of 15 in Malaysia including a period in a restaurant conducted by his aunt. He travelled to Singapore to obtain work at a factory, but eight or nine months later he returned to Malaysia where he resumed work as a factory hand in a plastics factory. 

23At some unknown time, he returned to Singapore again in the search for work but was unsuccessful and again moved back to Malaysia. He again commenced work at a factory where he was involved in stock keeping duties and truck driving. 

24In February 2009, he injured his left shoulder in a motor cycle accident. It seems it was not long after this incident that he travelled to Australia. 

25In 2008, he married an Indonesian woman. She was apparently required to return to Indonesia for visa reasons in June 2008, several months after they were married. He maintained contact with his wife, although with some difficulties. As indicated above, they have since separated. 

26The applicant admitted to some use of alcohol and on three occasions experimenting with cannabis. 

27In paragraph 33 of Dr Seidler's report, there is a history concerning events that were said to have led to the applicant's involvement in the subject offence. According to that history, he was contacted by an acquaintance of an uncle who allegedly offered him a sum of money to transport drugs into Australia. 

28It was then recorded that the applicant described a fairly protracted process whereby he was met by a number of Indian and African men. He then travelled to India and was put up in a hotel, which was said to have been funded by these men. According to the applicant, he remained in their company for approximately three weeks, during which time his visa and air ticket were obtained, and other travel arrangements were made on his behalf. The history records that it was during this period that he was instructed to swallow the drugs he was to transport to Australia. The applicant said that he had considerable difficulty with this, but was informed that he would be left stranded in India and forced to make his way back to Malaysia if he was unable to swallow the pellets. 

29According to the history in the report (paragraph 34), the applicant indicated that his decision to import drugs to Australia was based on his need to finance a cardiac operation for his mother. The surgery, in this respect, was said to be crucial and that neither he nor his mother could afford to finance it independently. 

Remarks on Sentence 

30The sentencing hearing took place on 2 July 2010. The matter was adjourned until 16 July 2010 on which date the sentencing judge delivered her remarks on sentence. 

31In relation to the applicant's role in the importation, the sentencing judge determined that it was greater than that of a mere courier. In that respect, her Honour stated (ROS, p.7):- 

""I find that the role played by him was that of an importer of a large quantity of high grade heroin. The potential street value of that drug was significant - between $148,000 and $267,000. Considerable planning had gone into the intended importation. He had met with those higher up in the hierarchy in Malaysia. He travelled with them to India and remained in their company for three weeks. He ingested the drugs. He returned to Malaysia and then flew on to Sydney, with a view to providing the pellets to an unnamed person in Sydney. In addition to his travel costs, he was to be paid for his role. I find he played an essential role in the importation of this quantity of heroin. He was involved at a greater level than a mere courier, demonstrated by his involvement with the identified men over a three-week period of time, during which time he had left his home country in order to participate in this crime. That, to my mind, aggravates the offence over and above a mere courier from one's homeland to a foreign country. "" (emphasis added) 

32Her Honour went on to state that assistance provided to the Australian Federal Police ""... discloses a greater knowledge of the whole syndicate than what a mere courier could be expected to know, although his assistance was of no benefit"" (ROS, p.7). 

Grounds of appeal 

33Grounds 1 and 3 overlap and, accordingly, will be considered together. 

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding an aggravating factor was that the applicant's role was greater than that of a courier 

Ground 3: Her Honour erred in failing to allow procedural fairness to the applicant by her finding, as an aggravating factor, that the applicant's role was above that of a courier without providing the applicant the opportunity to make submissions to the contrary 

34Ms R Mathur of counsel, who appeared in this Court on behalf of the applicant, observed that the Agreed Statement of Facts tendered by the Crown did not expressly stipulate the role played by the applicant other than to say that he imported into Australia 372.4 grams of pure heroin. 

35It was acknowledged in those submissions that the role played by an offender in effecting the importation of drugs is an important factor in determining the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. 

36In relation to the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant's role was more than that of a mere courier, it was contended that there was insufficient evidence to establish that that was the fact beyond reasonable doubt. Reference was made in the submissions for the applicant to the High Court's judgment in Olbrich v R (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27] and [28]. 

37It was submitted (Written submissions at [12]):- 

""... There was limited evidence with respect to the applicant's ' involvement ' with the three men whilst in India. The only evidence before the court was that it was during this time that his visa, ticket and travel arrangements were made. The sealed envelope containing [person's named inserted] statement takes the matter no further. It was further observed that the reference in Dr Seidler's report to the applicant's account that he was told that if he did not ingest the pellets, he would be left stranded in India and forced to make his own way back to Malaysia does not bespeak of a man whose role could be described as greater than that of a courier."" 

38In summary, the submission for the applicant was that there was no evidence to support a finding that there were additional acts performed by the applicant to place him above a courier in the hierarchy of the drug importation venture. On that basis, it was contended that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence that was not warranted in law. 

39Counsel for the applicant relied upon statistics for offenders who pleaded guilty to an offence under s.307.2(1) of the Code involving the importation of heroin. It was said that these figures, inter alia, indicated that 95% received a sentence of less than 9 years. Of those, 97% received a non-parole period of 5 years or less. Accordingly, it was said that the statistics placed the applicant's sentence in the top 5% for offences under the above section. 

40The contention was that, having regard to the actual acts known to have been performed by the applicant, neither the role played by him nor the quantity of drug involved, warranted a sentence which placed his term of imprisonment in the top 5% of all offenders dealt with under the section of the Code. 

41In response, the Crown observed, firstly, that the role played by the applicant is a matter of importance in assessing the objective criminality of his offence and, secondly, that he had the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, that he was a ""mere courier"" so that such a finding mitigated his culpability in the importation of the drug. The Crown added that characterising the role of an offender by reference to a descriptive tag or label (eg couriers and principals) must not obscure, or be a substitute for, an assessment of what the offender did: Olbrich (supra) at 278. 

42The Crown also observed that the applicant did not give evidence, as was his entitlement. However, that left the judge with a ""paucity of evidence"" in relation to the extent of his involvement in the criminal enterprise in question. 

43The Crown acknowledged that the Statement of Facts did not indicate the role played by the applicant in the importation beyond referring to the quantities and nature of the drug and the internal concealment of the pellets. However, it submitted that the details of the circumstances in which the applicant came to commit the offence were set out in paragraph 33 of Dr Seidler's report. The report had not been admitted into evidence on any limited basis. 

44It was also submitted that there was no evidence which either directly or indirectly was inconsistent with paragraph 33 of Dr Seidler's report. Accordingly, it was submitted no error had been disclosed by the sentencing judge in assessing the objective gravity of the offence. 

45In his oral submissions, Ms Mathur contended (transcript, 6 July 2011 at p.2):- 

""In my respectful submission, that finding that the applicant was more than a mere courier, was material error. It was a material error as it had led, firstly, to an aggravating circumstance. That aggravating circumstance led to, and has a bearing on, the objective seriousness of the offence. The objective seriousness of an offence when it is heightened, leads to either a sentence which is increased or a starting point which is increased. Her Honour at first instance expressly stated in her reasons that the offence had been aggravated. In my submission to the Court, that is a material error. It infected or affected the sentencing discretion ..."" 

46Ms Mathur further contended that, in relation to drug offences, two matters which are of significance in determining the objective seriousness of such offences are the role of the offender and the quantity of the drug involved. In the present case, the applicant's role, it was submitted, was wrongly assessed as greater than that of a courier. This had led to a sentence that was higher than was warranted in the circumstances. 

47It was additionally submitted on behalf of the applicant that he was denied procedural fairness, in circumstances in which no submissions at all had been made before the sentencing judge in relation to the history contained in Dr Seidler's report and no notice had been provided to the applicant's counsel as to the sentencing judge's intention to take the history in Dr Seidler's report into account as a possible basis for establishing a role greater than that of a mere courier. 

48It was alternatively submitted that the history in the report, even if taken into account, did not justify a finding that the applicant was more than a mere courier. It was argued that the finding made to the contrary was erroneous, firstly, because it was made in breach of the procedural fairness requirements and, secondly, it was contrary to the evidence tendered at the sentencing hearing. 

Consideration 

49There are, in my opinion, certain difficulties with the finding made by the sentencing judge that the applicant's role was greater than that of a mere courier. 

50Firstly, no submission to that effect had been made by the Crown at the sentencing hearing. Secondly, no notice was provided by the sentencing judge that she may act on the basis that the history recorded in Dr Seidler's report was evidence capable of supporting a finding that his role was greater than that of a mere courier. 

51After the hearing had been adjourned on 2 July 2010 and resumed on 16 July 2010, the record indicates that no further submissions were taken in the matter and her Honour immediately proceeded to deliver her remarks on sentence. 

52In the circumstances to which I have referred above, it was, in my opinion, incumbent upon the sentencing judge to give notice of her intention to consider whether the evidence could support adverse finding on sentence in circumstances where no such finding had been sought by the Crown. The absence of notice in the present case, of course, explains why there was no submission by either party on the question as to whether such a finding was open based upon the history set out in the medical report and in circumstances where the agreed statement of facts made no reference to that matter. 

53The requirement to afford procedural fairness to an offender in sentencing proceedings has arisen in various contexts. In Baroudi v R [2007] NSWCCA 48, the applicant contended that the conduct of the sentencing judge during submissions on sentence strongly suggested that he intended to act upon a concession made by the Crown Prosecutor in relation to the length of the non-parole period. However, in this remarks on sentence a little over a month later, the judge did not refer to the Crown's concession and imposed a non-parole period of around 12 months longer than the concession. It was submitted that the judge erred in failing to provide reasons for ignoring the Crown's submission and in failing to warn the applicant that he intended to impose a far longer sentence than that contemplated in the Crown's submissions to the Court. It was contended that the applicant had been denied procedural fairness and that, as a result, the proceedings had miscarried. 

54In that case, Price J (with whom Sully and Howie JJ agreed):- 

""33. In the present case, it was open to the Judge to indicate that either his views were tentative or that he neither accepted nor rejected the Crown concession. Such an indication would have afforded counsel to opportunity to dissuade the Judge from imposing a lengthier sentence. With respect to his Honour, his inadvertent failure to do so denied the applicant procedural fairness."" 

55In Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 282, the Court of Appeal considered a procedural fairness issue in somewhat more extreme circumstances where a District Court judge had disposed of an appeal by increasing the appellant's sentence, substituting a custodial sentence for a non-custodial penalty. In the course of his decision Kirby P (with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed) observed:- 

""... Fair procedure requires, at least for important decisions and those critical to the determination of a case, that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties affected or their representatives so that a fair opportunity is presented for contrary argument to persuade the judicial decision-maker to a different view. ... It is sufficient to say that, given the seriousness of the order which he was contemplating, (the judge) ought to have exposed his thinking to counsel for the claimant. Against the background of the considerations already mentioned, the high desirability of doing so amounted to an obligation ..."" 

56Finally, in R v Tadrosse (2005) 65 NSWLR 740, it was asserted that the sentencing judge erred in taking into account two matters of aggravation under s.21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Howie J at [19] observed:- 

""In my opinion, a sentencing judge would be prudent to raise with the parties during addresses whether any of the factors listed in s.21A(2) apply to the particular sentencing exercise being undertaken. If the sentencing judge considers that any of the aggravating factors listed are present, it seems to me that, in fairness to the offender and as a matter of good common sense, the judge should indicate to the offender's legal representative that he or she is considering taking that matter into account so that, if necessary, the Court might be persuaded that the aggravating feature is not present or for some reason it should not be taken into account in the peculiar circumstances of the particular case."" 

57On consideration, I have concluded that the sentencing judge was required to warn or give notice to the applicant that she contemplated at least the possibility of relying upon the history set out in Dr Seidler's report as evidence relevant to a determination as to whether the applicant's role was more than that of a courier. In circumstances in which the agreed facts did not suggest the contrary and in which the Crown made no contention that the applicant acted other than as a courier, fairness, in my respectful opinion, required the sentencing judge to indicate that she proposed to regard the history contained in the report as material that could establish that the applicant had acted in a role that was more than that of mere courier. 

58A further matter of concern is that, with respect, the sentencing judge appears to have read too much into the history recorded by Dr Seidler in paragraph 33 of her report. In that respect, I note the following:- 

(1) There is no indication as to who the ""Indian and African men"" were or what their position or role was in relation to preparations for the importation. 

(2) There is no indication that in the three weeks that the applicant was in the company of the three men he was actively doing anything in relation to the criminal enterprise. What the men were doing and why they were waiting there for three weeks is unknown. It may well have been that the Indian and African men were simply functionaries who were there to implement the necessary arrangements at the direction of others preparatory to the ingestion of the pellets by the applicant and him then travelling to Sydney. 

(3) I accept the submission to the effect that the threat made to the applicant that, if he did not swallow the pellets, he would be forced to make his own way back to Malaysia suggests that he was not participating at a medium or high level in the enterprise but rather was being told what to do and was threatened if he did not act in accordance with those directions. 

59Accordingly, I have concluded that the sentencing judge was in error in making the adverse finding as to the applicant's role. 

60The history set out in Dr Seidler's report, as I have indicated, did not, in my opinion, support the inferences drawn by the sentencing judge. The fact that the applicant was in India with the unspecified persons for three weeks without more could not convey the applicant's role was more than that of courier. He may well have been told to arrive at a particular time and was then kept waiting around for three weeks. The fact that he was said to have been in the company of those men does not, of itself, indicate that he, in that period of time, was engaged in any activity associated with the forthcoming importation. 

61Accordingly, I do not consider that paragraph 33 of Dr Seidler's report provided a sufficient foundation from which the sentencing judge reached the conclusion she did about the applicant's role. 

62The impugned finding was potentially a matter of significance, insofar as her Honour expressly referred to it as having been an aggravating factor in determining the seriousness of the offence. The inference is that the sentence was determined in light of her Honour's findings as to the objective and subjective factors. 

63The question as to whether or not the sentence was manifestly excessive or was otherwise the subject of appellable error is discussed below. 

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in using the statement of assistance as evidence of the objective gravity of the offence 

64At the sentencing hearing, the Crown tendered an Assessment of Assistance provided by the Australian Federal Police. It was tendered in a sealed envelope. 

65The submission for the applicant was that, insofar as the evidence of assistance revealed anything of the applicant's role in the commission of the offence, it went no further than (and indeed it was submitted significantly less than) the evidence in Dr Seidler's report as to the applicant's role. 

66Whether the use of evidence of assistance was restricted, it was observed, will depend on the circumstances, but normally the information cannot be used against an offender: Bourchas v R (2002) 133 A Crim R 413 at [99]. 

67It was also submitted that, insofar as the evidence of assistance disclosed matters such as where the offender stood in the hierarchy of an organisation involved in the importation of drugs, or that explained how the offender became involved and the offender's state of mind, such evidence may be relied upon by the offender to be used in his favour but not used in aggravation of his criminality in respect of the offence: R v Meggett (1999) 107 A Crim R 257 at 261 per Wood CJ at CL. 

68It was argued in this case that the sentencing judge referred to the evidence of the applicant's assistance in her remarks when her Honour stated (ROS at p.7):- 

""His attempt to provide the Australian Federal Police with assistance discloses a greater knowledge of the whole syndicate than what a mere courier would be expected to know, although his assistance was of no benefit ..."" 

69On behalf of the applicant, it was submitted that, leaving to one side the issue of whether or not such a finding was open on the evidence, the sentencing judge erred in using the evidence as to assistance for the purpose of finding it to be evidence ""as disclosing a greater knowledge of the whole syndicate than what a mere courier would be expected to know"" . It was argued that the sentencing judge erred in using the evidence against the applicant to determine the role he played in the importation and thereby the objective criminality of the applicant: Bourchas (supra). 

70In the written submissions for the applicant, it was stated that it is by no means clear from her Honour's remarks that the information was used against the offender. However, when read in context, it was submitted it is apparent that the view being expressed by the sentencing judge is that the evidence of assistance was confirmatory of the conclusion that her Honour had already reached, on other evidence, that the applicant was more than a ""mere"" courier: Crown's written submissions at [21]. 

71It was submitted that the error compounded the error the subject of Ground 1 and led to a sentence which was not warranted in the circumstances. 

72The Crown alternatively submitted that, even if error had been shown in the use made of the assistance statement, it was not one that was material to the outcome and that this Court would not intervene, particularly as the sentence, it was submitted, was appropriate. 

73Whilst I consider it is arguable that her Honour did impermissibly utilise the Statement of Assistance adversely to the applicant, by reason of my conclusion in relation to Grounds 1 and 3 and the matters discussed below in relation to the sentence imposed, it is not necessary that I express any final or concluded opinion on the matter raised by Ground 2. 

Do the sentencing errors warrant intervention? 

74It was noted in the Crown's written submissions at [24] that the submission for the applicant (written submissions at paragraph [14] and the final sentence of paragraph [17]) suggested that the sentence imposed was so high as to be outside the available arrange, and thereby was manifestly excessive. 

75In that respect, it was observed that this Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because (if it be the case) the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her own discretion: Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665 at [15]. 

76The question, the Crown observed, was whether the result reached by the learned sentencing judge has been ""upon the facts ... unreasonably or plainly unjust [so that] the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance"" or, in other words, was the sentence ""manifestly wrong"" : Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [22] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ. 

77The Crown contended that the evaluative judgment made by the sentencing judge addressed all relevant considerations and has not resulted in a sentence that could be said to be obviously wrong or not open: DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 273 ALR 324 at [69] per Allsop P. Accordingly, the sentence could not be viewed as manifestly excessive. 

78The Crown referred to the general sentencing principles concerning serious federal drug offences enunciated in R v Nguyen; R v Phan [2010] NSWCCA 238 at [72] per Johnson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and R A Hulme J agreed) including:- 

(1) Although the weight of the drug imported is not the principal factor to be considered when fixing sentence, the size of the importation is a relevant factor and has increased significance when the offender is aware of the amount of the drugs imported. 

(2) The amount of the drug is a highly relevant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. 

(3) Involvement at any level in a drug importation offence must necessarily attract a significant sentence, otherwise the interests of general deterrence are not served. 

79The Crown submitted that it could not be contended that the findings made by her Honour were not open. In this respect, it was noted that her Honour referred to both the nature and the weight of the drug involved. It was also submitted, that her Honour took into account relevant subjective factors and gave them appropriate weight as well as allowing a full discount for the applicant's plea of guilty. 

Consideration 

80Although no separate ground was raised contending that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, in the course of Ms Mathur's submissions in relation to Grounds 1, 2 and 3, a number of matters were raised which it was contended had resulted in a sentence that was greater than should have been imposed had the asserted errors in sentencing not occurred. 

81Ms Mathur, whilst acknowledging the limited use of the statistics, relied on the statistics referred to earlier in this judgment which put the applicant's sentence fell within the top 5% of sentences for offences of the kind in question. In this respect, reliance was placed upon the fact that the amount of the prohibited substance (pure heroin at 372.4 grams) was ""at the lower end when the range goes between two grams and 1.5 kilograms"" (transcript, 6 July 2011 at p.6). 

82Ms Mathur submitted that, having regard to the amount of the drug involved and the role played by the applicant, the offence was ""unremarkable"" (transcript, p.6). 

83Reliance was also placed upon subjective factors, in particular, the fact that the applicant had come from a background of poverty and that he would spend time in custody under more difficult circumstances than others by reason of his limited English and the fact that he had no family ties in Australia. Ms Mathur stated ""... In my submissions, those three factors make it, as I indicated, a somewhat unremarkable offence and would not warrant a sentence which places it in the top 5% of sentences with respect to sentences of this nature"" (transcript, p.6). 

84It was also submitted for the applicant at [17]:- 

""The applicant participated in this offence to raise funds to finance his mother's cardiac operation. She has since passed away, leaving the applicant with one surviving family member, namely, his sister. He has no family or friends in Australia. He is culturally isolated. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court, attempted suicide subsequent to his incarceration and as accepted by the sentencing judge, he is remorseful and contrite. The starting point in this case, before the discount for the plea of guilty, was 12 years. Taking into account the circumstances of the case, a lesser sentence was warranted at law: s.6(3)."" 

85In the Crown's written submissions (paragraph [34]), a list of comparable cases was provided, it being noted that the Court's primary concern was with consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles: Hili v R (2010) 272 ALR 465 at [48]-[50]. The Crown contended that a consideration of such ""comparable cases"" does not provide a basis for the submissions that the sentence in question was manifestly excessive. Reference was made to sentencing cases referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa (supra) and to the summary of cases in R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 169 at [74]. 

86It is not necessary for the purposes of the present application to review all of those cases. It is sufficient to note the following:- 

R v Mirzaee [2004] NSWCCA 315 

87In that case, the offender entered a plea of guilty to an offence under s.233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 in respect of trafficking in heroin. 

88The amount of heroin imported was 578 grams of pure heroin (in contrast to the present case of 372.4 grams of pure heroin), the trafficable quantity being 2 grams. 

89The street value (which was the subject of some dispute) was argued as being $2 million. 

90The offender's role was that of a courier. He was aged 57 and was given the benefit of a 25% discount for an early plea. 

91He applied for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 3 years. This Court reduced the non-parole period from 6 years to 4 years and 6 months. 

R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 314 

92The offender pleaded guilty to importing heroin, being not more than the trafficable quantity under s.233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act . The offender was aged 27 years. 

93The amount of pure heroin involved in that case was 244.6 grams, which represented 122 times the trafficable quantity of heroin (2 grams). 

94The wholesale value of the heroin was $120,000. The street value was estimated at between $611,500 and $856,100. The offender was a low level drug importer. 

95The sentence imposed below comprised a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months and a total sentence of 9 years. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to a total term of 8 years involving a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 

Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136 

96The offender, aged 40 years, pleaded guilty to an offence under s.233B of the Customs Act in respect of an amount being not less than the trafficable quantity of heroin, namely, 117.6 grams of pure heroin (140 grams gross weight). 

97The applicant was a courier and had a low cognitive ability. 

98He received a sentence of 7 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. 

99This Court dismissed the appeal. 

100In R v Bezan [2004] NSWCCA 342, the appellant was sentenced on appeal to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years for the importation of a trafficable quantity of heroin in contrary to s.233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act . The offender had personally imported 490 grams of powder containing 260 grams of pure heroin (worth as much as $900,000) in a marble chess board. He was convicted of the offence by a jury. He was not merely a courier, but had no criminal history 

101In addition to the above cases, the Crown referred to sentences imposed in the following cases:- 

(1) Teehan v R [2006] NSWCCA 401. 

(2) R v Tran [2007] QCA 221; (2007) 172 A Crim R 436. 

(3) R v Jimson [2009] QCA 183. 

102Ms Mathur in his oral submissions identified the way in which he challenged the sentence imposed (transcript, 6 July 2011, at pp.7-8):- 

""The crux of my submission is that the court may well find when it looks at the table outlined in De la Rosa there may well be a number of cases that assist the applicant in his submission that this was a sentence of the upper range and there may well be cases that say that this is within the range. The important issue in this case, however, is that the appeal is under s 6(3), namely, that although the range of sentences may be considered is not considered to the same extent as it were being argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

The key issue is, was an error made, was it a material error and did it infect or affect the sentence imposed. Had that error not been made would a lesser sentence have been imposed and when looking at what a lesser sentence is the court looks at the statutory regime and in this case s 16A and those factors therein and sentencing principles. When looking at that in my submission a lesser sentence would have been warranted irrespective of the fact that there may be cases that are factually analogous that end with the same sentence, namely, a head sentence of 9 years and a non parole period of around the five year mark."" 

103The applicant having entered a guilty plea to a Federal offence, namely, an offence under s.307.2(1) of the Code, in the event that this Court intervenes the re-sentencing task is to be undertaken in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions concerned with sentencing to be found in Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

104In the event of re-sentencing, determination of an appropriate sentence requires this Court to impose a sentence by application of the principles provided for in s.16A(1) of the Crimes Act . The Court in that regard must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. In such determination, the Court is required to have regard to the list of matters which a sentencing court is to take into account in determining sentence to be passed or ordered to be made as provided by s.16A(2), insofar as those matters are relevant and known to the Court. The latter provision also permits other matters to be taken into account. 

105Division 4 of Part 1B of the Crimes Act , in the circumstances of the subject offence, requires that the Court either fix a single non-parole period in respect of the sentence to be imposed or to make a recognisance release order: s.19AB(1)(d) and (e). In the determination of a non-parole period, the Court is to be guided by the general principles identified by the High Court in Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623; Deakin v R (1984) 58 ALJR 367; Inge v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 295; Bugmy v R (1990) 169 CLR 525. See also Hili (supra) at [40]. 

106I have concluded that, for reasons set out above, the sentencing process in the Court below miscarried and that the sentencing errors to which I have earlier referred resulted in a sentence which was excessive to the point that this Court should set aside the sentence and re-sentence the applicant. 

107In the determination of both the head sentence and the non-parole period, it is, of course, necessary to have regard to the objective seriousness of the offence including, in particular:- 

(1) That the offence involved the importation of pellets containing compressed powder, the gross weight being 594.9 grams with a 62% purity resulting in a total pure weight of heroin of 372.4 grams. 

(2) The approximate street value of the heroin was said to be between $148,725 and $267,705. 

(3) That the applicant's role was that of courier. 

108In relation to subjective circumstances, the following matters are also to be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed including the non-parole period:- 

(1) The evidence from Malaysian authorities which establishes that the applicant had a relatively minor criminal history including one drug offence, possession of a drug, committed on 8 June 2001 for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 months. 

(2) The subject offence, accordingly, represents the only serious drug offence committed by the applicant. 

(3) The applicant is presently aged 33 years. He was raised in Malaysia in circumstances in which, by reason of poverty and injury to his father, he was required to enter the workforce at the age of 15 years, ceasing study mid-way through his second year of high school to pursue employment and contribute financially to his family. 

(4) He was assessed by the clinical psychologist, Ms Seidler, as being a low functioning man intellectually and, in many ways, was naive socially, which factors, it was suggested, would well have contributed to his decision-making concerning his involvement in the illegal importation. His offending behaviour was assessed as being not of a kind consistent with an inherent anti-social character. 

(5) The applicant's custodial case management file, relevant extracts of which were attached to the affidavit of Janet Kae Witmer, solicitor, confirmed that, since being in custody:- 

(a) He has demonstrated good work performance and has demonstrated a positive attitude towards his work. 

(b) That he has at all times demonstrated a polite and courteous manner to staff and other inmates within the prison industries. 

(c) That he has followed directions given to him by staff and there have been no custodial problems associated with him. 

109Finally, in the determination of sentence, I have had regard to the sentencing for like offences to which attention has been drawn on behalf of both the applicant and the Crown. 

110In re-sentencing the applicant, I have concluded that an appropriate sentence is an overall term of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, the latter representing a ratio of the non-parole period to the total term of approximately 53%. 

111I accordingly propose the following orders:- 

(1) Leave to appeal granted. 

(2) Appeal against sentence upheld. 

(3) The sentence imposed by the District Court on 16 July 2010 be set aside. 

(4) That the applicant be sentenced to non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months imprisonment to commence on 12 April 2009 and to expire on 11 July 2013 and a balance of term of 3 years and 9 months to expire on 11 April 2017. 

112Accordingly, the first date upon which the applicant will eligible for release on parole will be 11 July 2013. 

113HARRISON J : I agree with Hall J.

		01 December 2011",2011-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2758308,R v CHIA [2011] NSWDC 237,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: John Chia was detected by police on 1 January as being a drug supplier. They went to what I gather was a music festival in the Domain. Police are fully aware that such music festivals often involve people using drugs such as ecstasy and so they closely observed the goings on. They saw some suspicious activity involving the offender and a man whose name turned out to be Alistair Ross. Police thought they observed a drug supply transaction and investigations proved that to be the case. After they saw Mr Chia hand something to Mr Ross and Mr Ross hand something back they stopped both people. They searched Mr Chia and found $390. They looked at his telephone which revealed incriminating messages, such as, 'Hey, mate, I want ten. Where are you?' They spoke to Mr Ross who told them that the offender had sold him six tablets of ecstasy for $150.

2The facts as I have recited them so far relate to the first offence of supplying a prohibited drug, that is the actual supply to Mr Ross of the six tablets of ecstasy totalling 1.81 grams. They also relate to a matter on a Form 1. The $390 which was found in Mr Chia's possession is suspected to be and clearly is the proceeds of crime, namely drug supply. Police also found when searching Mr Chia a key to a Honda motor car. They asked Mr Chia how he got to the Domain and he lied to them. He told them he had caught a train. Not surprisingly police did not believe him. They searched the surrounding area and located a Honda car that matched the key they had found in Mr Chia's possession. They searched it and they discovered forty-nine and a half further tablets of ecstasy that looked exactly the same as those that Mr Ross had purchased from the offender. They also discovered a small quantity, slightly more than half a gram, of cannabis leaf. The drugs found in the car relate to the second offence of supply for which the offender is to be sentenced, that is an allegation that he had 49.5 tablets weighing 14.8 grams in his possession for the purpose of supply. The possession of cannabis leaf also appears on the Form 1 to be taken into account when I sentence Mr Chia for the second of those drug supply matters.

3Mr Chia is really too old to be conducting himself as he was. He was born in 1959. He grew up in a home that was marred by domestic abuse, mostly afflicted upon his mother by an abusive father. Mr Chia's father died when he was eighteen and, in contrast to what would usually be expected, this was something of an advantage because it lifted the burden of violence that Mr Chia had experienced for the majority of his childhood. 

4He has worked regularly, although his most recent work has been in the security industry. Because you need a licence to do that and because of the charges that he faces, he has had difficulty performing that work over recent times. He has been married, but separated from his wife about eight years ago. He is the primary carer of two of the children from that relationship. The offender's seventeen-year-old daughter lives with her mother but every weekend she lives with the offender.

5Mr Chia's history reveals that he has had problems with his addictions to various things over the years, whether it be attendance at a gym or more recently gambling. He was able to overcome his addiction to the gym by himself, but his problems with gambling have been harder to deal with. I do not find this surprising at all. Despite the efforts of publicists for various forms of the gambling industry we judges know the significant problems that gambling causes for many in the community. We see the results of the efforts of the providers of gambling to encourage addiction in problem gamblers, whether it be by carefully designed poker machines or more traditional forms of advertising. The incessant promotion of gambling even during football commentary these days creates enormous problems when people such as Mr Chia attempt to overcome their gambling addiction. Every time people such as Mr Chia achieve a measure of rehabilitation there is the risk that that would be undone as gambling addicts are bombarded with reminders of the supposed joys that gambling can bring.

6Notwithstanding that, of course Mr Chia's decision to gamble is a matter of his personal choice. He only ultimately has himself to blame for giving in to his desires to gamble recognising as he does that this has caused financial hardship. These offences are related to his financial situation. The offender bought the drugs in bulk and was selling them at a small profit in order to make money. He was a drug user too so he is not in that category of offending of a non-user dealer, which has been traditionally regarded as the most serious form of dealing. His finances were so bad that he was paying twenty-seven per cent per annum interest on his credit card. These offences appear to represent the culmination of a downward spiral. Since being charged the offender has taken some perhaps belated steps to overcome the problems that he faces. 

7The Crown submissions started with the well known proposition that those who traffic to a substantial degree must ordinarily expect full-time custodial sentences. I do not consider that it could be said that Mr Chia was trafficking to a substantial degree. There is but one occasion, 1 January, on which Mr Chia was trafficking. That means that exceptional circumstances do not have to be demonstrated before a sentence other than full-time custody is imposed. 

8Ms Anderson submitted that the appropriate sentence would be a sentence of imprisonment that was suspended. Given the length of the sentence I have decided to impose, that option is available. But I am not going to do that because I consider that there needs to be an element of punishment. The courts cannot ignore the realities of the consequences for an offender of a suspended sentence which, if the offender manages to serve the period of suspension without committing a further offence, (something all members of the community are obliged to do anyway,) involve no punishment. On the other hand I do not consider that a full-time custodial sentence is required. I have determined that the most appropriate outcome is a sentence of home detention. Neither the Crown nor Ms Anderson spoke in opposition to that order.

9For the first offence of supply that relates to the actual supply to Mr Ross, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of three months. For the second offence of supply, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I set a non-parole period of six months and a period of eligibility for parole of six months making a total sentence of twelve months. Both of those sentences are to be served concurrently.

10Before imposing sentence, however, formally, I refer Mr Chia for assessment as to his suitability to serve those sentences by way of home detention and I continue his bail in the meantime so that assessment can be made.

11That means Ms Anderson we will not be able to do this until the new year.
