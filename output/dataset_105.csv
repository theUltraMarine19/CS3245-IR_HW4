       Commonwealth Director of  
       
       Public Prosecutions 
       
        
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  Proceedings are in train in the Local Court against the plaintiff, James Soong, who faces 34 summary charges under s221F(14) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and s8Y of the Taxation Administration Act 1958 that he was concerned in the management of two companies which failed to remit PAYE tax instalments to the Commissioner of Taxation. His application to that Court for a permanent stay of proceedings was refused by Magistrate Bartley. He seeks leave to appeal against that decision under s53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. That provision empowers this Court to entertain an appeal by leave against an interlocutory order made by the Local Court, but only on a ground involving a question of law alone. 
     
      
    2 The offences are alleged to have been committed over a three year period between 1995 and 1998. At relevant times Mr Soong was a director of the two companies involved, Concrete Formwork Pty Ltd and Build-Form Pty Ltd. Those companies were part of the Fyna group of companies, of which the applicant was the managing director. The business of those companies was supplying formwork for construction. The total of the tax instalments involved is almost $7.5 million .  
     
      
    3 It is necessary to sketch the history of the proceedings. Between mid 1998 and early 1999, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) conducted an audit of the Fyna group, during which company records were produced and meetings took place with Mr Soong and the group’s in-house accountant, Edward Pearce. The investigation uncovered evidence that money deducted from employees’ wages which should have been remitted to the ATO had been used for purposes relating to other corporate commitments of Mr Soong. On 23 February 1999 the Australian Federal Police executed a number of search warrants, seizing relevant records, and on the same day both Mr Soong and Mr Pearce were arrested. 
     
      
    4 Both men were charged with three counts of defrauding the Commonwealth, under s29D of the Crimes Act 1914. In August of that year, after an assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence against Mr Soong to support those charges, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided that they should be withdrawn because of a deficiency in the evidence which need not be examined for present purposes. On 25 August the Director was granted leave in the Local Court to withdraw the charges. Mr Soong, who was represented on that occasion, did not oppose that course. However, the prosecution of Mr Pearce for the three charges proceeded, and towards the end of 2000 he was found guilty of them and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 Early in 2001 the Director commenced a review of the available evidence to determine whether there might be a basis to lay further charges against Mr Soong. Additional material was received from the Federal Police but, more significantly, on 2 May 2002 Mr Pearce contacted the police and offered to provide information to assist them in the investigation. On 24 November 2002 he took part in a lengthy recorded conversation with the case officer, federal agent Moerman. A transcript of that conversation was furnished to the Director in January 2003. In the light of the information provided by Mr Pearce, and after an examination of documents referred to by him, the case against Mr Soong was re-assessed. 
     
      
    6 In the result, approval was given on 30 July 2003 to launch the prosecution of Mr Soong for one offence under s29D of the Crimes Act, alleging his defrauding the Commonwealth by concealing PAYE deductions of employees of another company of the Fyna group, Noxequin Pty Ltd, and for the 34 charges the subject of these proceedings. Those summary charges arose from the conduct giving rise to the earlier charges under s29D which had been withdrawn. Court attendance notices in respect of all these charges were served upon Mr Soong on 26 August 2003. It is the Director’s case that the evidence available from Mr Pearce was an important factor in the decision to bring these new charges. 
     
      
    7 The brief relating to the charges was served in mid October 2003. At the end of July 2004 Mr Soong was committed for trial in respect of the s29D offence. The summary charges were placed on a certificate under s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as related offences, to be dealt with by the trial judge at the end of the trial. The trial took place over several weeks between April and May 2005, but the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. 
     
      
    8 There then ensued negotiations about the disposition of the outstanding matters. Initially, Mr Soong offered to plead guilty to a charge of imposition on the Commonwealth under s29B of the Crimes Act for the Noxequin matter, in place of the s29D charge, if the summary charges were withdrawn. The Director was prepared to accept the plea to a s29B charge but not to withdraw the summary charges. Mr Soong was not prepared to enter pleas to the summary charges until the indictable matter was resolved. In the event, the plea of guilty to the s29B charge proceeded in the District Court, but the Director obtained an order that the summary matters be remitted to the Local Court. 
     
      
    9 The charge under s29B was an attempt to impose upon the Commonwealth by an untrue representation that there was no company other than Build-Form Pty Ltd in the Fyna group that should be remitting PAYE tax. The focus of the charge was the concealment of the fact that PAYE tax instalments amounting a little over $475,000 had been deducted from the wages of Noxequin employees but not remitted to the ATO. The plea was entered before Tupman DCJ, and her Honour sentenced Mr Soong to a term of imprisonment for 9 months which was suspended under s20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. It will be necessary to examine these sentence proceedings further, because they lie at the heart of some of the grounds of the present application. 
     
      
    10 In December 2006 the summary matters were listed for hearing in the Local Court for five days, commencing on 14 May 2007. In the event, those days were occupied by the application for a permanent stay. Magistrate Bartley’s judgment refusing that application was delivered on 20 August 2007. This outline of the proceedings omits a number of intermediate steps, including adjournments, set out in detailed chronologies provided to his Honour by both parties. 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    11 The application in the Local Court was founded upon a considerable body of evidence, and it is apparent from his Honour’s reasons that there was extensive reference to authority. Before me also the evidence was canvassed in some detail and a number of authorities were relied upon. In the event, while acknowledging the thoroughness of the submissions of counsel for Mr Soong, the matter can be dealt with relatively briefly.  
     
      
    12 In the Local Court the application had been founded upon the following propositions: 
     
      
      (a) Mr Soong had been placed in double jeopardy; 
       
      (b) he had been harassed by multiple prosecutions; 
       
      (c) the delay in proceedings was oppressive and prejudicial to him; and 
       
      (d) the state of his health was such that the prosecution should not proceed.  
       
      
    13 The application in this Court asserts that his Honour erred in law in his approach to the matter generally and failed to give adequate reasons for his decision. An amended summons sets out 11 specific grounds of the application, one of them particularising 16 complaints about his Honour’s reasoning. It is unnecessary to set out all these grounds. In effect, they are themselves particulars of broader complaints about the manner in which his Honour dealt with the four bases of the application. It is in that way that I approach the matter. Put shortly, what was argued on Mr Soong’s behalf was that it was not open to his Honour to have rejected each of those bases as he did. 
     
      
       
      Double jeopardy / multiple prosecutions 
      
    14 These aspects of the application are related and can be dealt with together. This is not the occasion to examine the notion of double jeopardy, including the different senses in which that expression might be used, in modern Australian law. Those issues were canvassed in The Queen v Carroll [2002] HCA 55, 213 CLR 635. Relevantly for present purposes, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at [9] cited a passage in the joint judgment in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, also at [9], in which their Honours referred to the use of the expression to “encompass what is said to be a wider principle that no one should be ‘punished again for the same matter’…”. Similarly, in Carroll, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [86], translating a familiar Latin maxim, referred to “the interest of the individual in not being twice vexed for one and the same cause.” 
     
      
    15 The argument for Mr Soong was that the pursuit of the summary charges was effectively to try him a second time for criminality substantially the same as that which had already been dealt with. Of course, as his Honour noted, no issue of that kind arose from the withdrawal of the original charges under s29D of the Crimes Act, and before me counsel for Mr Soong made no such submission. The focus of the argument was the sentence proceedings before Judge Tupman.  
     
      
    16 As I have said, the charge to which Mr Soong pleaded guilty before her Honour centred upon the concealment of Noxequin’s liability to remit PAYE deductions to the ATO. Nevertheless, an agreed statement of facts revealed that the charge arose from the wider ranging investigation which I have recounted and was said to be part of a more extensive pattern of offending. Her Honour was aware of Mr Soong’s arrest in February 1999, the charges which were then laid against him, and the subsequent history leading to the outstanding summary charges. 
     
      
    17 As I understand it, the argument was that her Honour had regard to the whole of the criminality exposed by the investigation in dealing with Mr Soong for the matter before her. This was said to be evident from her remarks on sentence and from some exchanges with counsel in hearing submissions on sentence. A fair reading of that material, however, does not support that proposition. It is clear that her Honour treated the evidence of the overall investigation and of the other charges laid merely as background material. 
     
      
    18 When that history was raised in the course of submissions on sentence, counsel for the Director drew a clear distinction between the charges initially laid and that with which her Honour was dealing, while acknowledging that they involved conduct of a similar kind. Nothing in her Honour’s exchanges with counsel then appearing for Mr Soong suggests that she was not mindful of that distinction. More importantly, her Honour’s remarks admit of no doubt that her focus was on the particular charge to which Mr Soong had pleaded guilty. Among other things, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        On 15 January 1999, during an audit meeting, when asked by ATO officers questions about the group tax liability of the FYNA Group, the offender falsely denied that there was any other company than Build Form Pty Limited within the Group which should be remitting PAYE tax. He knew that to be false because he was aware of the activities of Noxequin during the immediately preceding period. 
        
       
       
        
        That is the subject matter of the false representation and the subject of the charge before me. 
        
       
       … 
       
        
        So far as this matter is concerned, as actually brought before me, it is one count amounting to a representation made on one occasion almost eight years ago that there were no other companies liable to remit group tax. This representation had the effect of concealing the liability to remit almost half a million dollars in collected PAYE tax and the benefit sought by the offender was that he would have access to the funds for the purposes of his own businesses to allow them to continue. 
        
       
      
     19 I might add that the lenient sentence which her Honour imposed puts paid to any suggestion that she had regard to a wider pattern of criminality. One of the factors contributing to that leniency was the delay in the matter being finalised and, to some extent, that was the context in which her Honour referred to the history of the proceedings as a whole since Mr Soong’s arrest. The charges with which I am concerned, although of a nature broadly similar to the Noxequin charge, are clearly directed at distinct criminality relating to two other companies in the Fyna group.  
     
      
    20 In his judgment Magistrate Bartley correctly observed: 
     
      
       
        
        The thirty-four charges do not amount to litigation afresh of matters already judicially determined. 
        
       
       
        
        No issue of criminal liability arising in the thirty-four charges has already been disposed of. The accused is not being twice vexed in the same cause. 
        
       
       
        
        More broadly, in all the circumstances, the thirty-four charges are not unwarranted harassment of the accused by multiple prosecutions. 
        
       
      
    21 No error has been shown in his Honour’s approach to this aspect of the application.  
     
      
       
      Delay 
       
      
    22 I have dealt with the grounds of the application relating to double jeopardy and multiple prosecutions on their merits, even though it is questionable whether they raise a question of law. The remaining grounds of the application certainly do not. Under the guise of the assertion that certain findings of fact were not open to his Honour, they are really a critique of his assessment of the evidence and the inferences he drew from it. 23 On the issue of delay, the focus of the argument was the period between August 1999, when the original charges under s29D were withdrawn, and August 2003, when the prosecution was re-commenced with the fresh charge under s29D and the summary charges. The progress of the matter thereafter was protracted for reasons which are apparent from my sketch of its history, but it was otherwise unremarkable. 
     
      
    24 His Honour accepted that it was mainly the availability of the evidence of Mr Pearce which led to the revival of the prosecution and that the period preceding it, to adopt the expression used in written submissions for the Director, “was not characterised by investigative or prosecutorial neglect.” The Director had limited notice of the application in the Local Court for a stay and the basis of it, and relied upon the evidence of the solicitor then handling the matter, Ms Karen Wildermoth. She came into the matter late in 2004, and did not have carriage of it at the time the fresh charges were laid. Her evidence was based upon an analysis of the Director’s file, and his Honour found her to be an impressive witness.  
     
      
    25 Her review of the Director’s records supported the conclusion that the decision to re-launch the prosecution was substantially based upon the evidence available from Mr Pearce. There was a conflict between her evidence and that of federal agent Moerman, whose evidence called into question the value of Mr Pearce as a witness. For Mr Soong it was contended that the Director was preparing to recommence the proceedings by May 2002 before Mr Pearce came forward with an offer to assist. Mr Soong’s position was that the evidence of Ms Wildermoth should not have been preferred over that of the federal police officer who had been involved in the investigation, noting that the solicitor who had had carriage of the case at the relevant time, Ms Ann Gordon, had not been called. 
     
      
    26 It was for his Honour to assess this evidence. It was not reasonable to expect the Director to call any solicitor earlier involved in the matter, given the late notice of the application and the basis for it. His Honour found that federal agent Moerman had “vacillated about the value of Mr Pearce as a witness.” He concluded that, while the Director was “moving towards charging” Mr Soong with some further offences having regard to additional evidence other than that of Mr Pearce, it was ultimately Mr Pearce’s evidence which “was the most important of the fresh evidence that justified prosecuting and maintaining” the new charges. That was a conclusion open to his Honour. 
     
      
    27 Further, his Honour found that Mr Soong had not been prejudiced by the delay in conducting his defence of the summary charges. He had been on notice of the allegations since his arrest in 1999, and the evidence against him was primarily documentary. This finding also was clearly open. 
     
      
    28 No purpose would be served by a more detailed analysis of the arguments put on behalf of Mr Soong on this aspect of the application. It is sufficient to say that they amount to no more than criticisms of his Honour’s fact finding and reasoning, and raise no question of law. 
     
      
       
      Health 
       
      
    29 There was evidence before his Honour that Mr Soong had a history of heart disease, and had undergone a bypass operation in October 2000. He suffered from other conditions, including moderate hyperglycaemia. In late April 2007, not long before the hearing of the stay application in the Local Court, he attended upon his general practitioner, Dr Leung, complaining of intermittent chest pain and palpitation, together with loss of appetite, anxiety and depressive moods. His Honour had before him reports of Dr Leung, who also gave oral evidence, as well as reports of a cardiologist, Dr NC Patel, and a diabetic specialist, Professor Denis Yue. Of primary significance was Dr Leung’s observation that, while the cause of the chest pain and palpitation was unclear, he felt that the combination of the presenting symptoms was likely to be related, directly or indirectly, to the court proceedings. He reported that further psychological stress would “definitely increase the risk of a another cardiac event which may potentially be fatal.”  
     
      
    30 His Honour found no support for that proposition in the reports of Dr Patel, and concluded that Dr Leung had put Mr Soong’s medical case “at, and somewhat beyond, its highest.” The complaint in this Court is that there was no medical evidence contradicting that of Dr Leung. In particular, although earlier medical reports had put the Director on notice of Mr Soong’s medical problems, the Director did not seek to have him medically examined and did not tender any medical evidence. Again, given the short notice the Director had of the stay application, it was unreasonable to suggest that the prosecution should have done. In any event, the evidence of Dr Leung was that in earlier years Mr Soong’s condition had stabilised and, at least since 2003, had been managed by prescribed drugs. In all the circumstances, his Honour was not bound to accept Dr Leung’s evidence of the possible consequences of the continued court proceedings and, yet again, that conclusion was open to him. 
     
      
    31 This complaint also raises no question of law. 
     
      
    32 Generally, his Honour's task was to exercise a discretion through the balance of competing considerations (in which he expressly included the evidence of Mr Soong’s medical conditions). One of those considerations was the undoubted seriousness of the charges and the public interest in their prosecution. His judgment demonstrates a careful examination of the evidence in that process, and the ground that he failed to give adequate reasons for his decision is without substance. It is not to be forgotten that the power of a court to stay a criminal prosecution will be used only in most exceptional circumstances: Jago v District Court (NSW) 1989 168 CLR 23, per Mason CJ at 31. Put shortly, Mr Soong failed to persuade his Honour that there were such circumstances in this case. 
     
      
    33 No error of law has been established. Accordingly, leave to appeal is refused. 
     
      
    34 Before parting with the matter, I should record that it is tinged with sadness. There was a period after judgment was reserved in which further material was sent to me which, if necessary, might have been the subject of further submissions. I received that material but, in the event, did not find further submissions necessary. During that period counsel for Mr Soong, Julius Mendel, suffered a serious illness. I am pleased to learn that he has since recovered. Tragically, however, during the same period counsel for the Director, Matthew Bracks, died. I can do no more than express my appreciation of the assistance of both of them in this matter.

    JUDGMENT 
    Application to adduce evidence of other sexual experience pursuant to s.293 (6) (b)1. Given the alleged victims were children when the offences alleged by the Crown are said to have occurred, none of the complainants’ names is to be published, nor is anything to be published which is likely to identify any of them. Given the alleged victims are children of the accused and still carrying his surname, publication of his name could lead to their identity being revealed. Thus the non-publication order to protect the identity of the victims necessarily extends to publication of the accused’s surname. 2. The indictment presented to the Court charges the accused with seven counts of sexual offending, although count 3 is an alternate charge to count 2. The second and third charges relate to an allegation of rape, in the alternative, carnal knowledge by the accused of his daughter, Trish. This offence is said to have occurred between September 1969 and September 1971. Count 7 is an alleged act of indecency upon the daughter Trish. It is said to comprise cunnilingus. It is said to have occurred in April 1975.3. The accused is also charged with the rape of his daughter Linda between January and November 1973 (count 4) and of indecently assaulting Linda between January 1967 and March 1967 (count 1). Finally there is a charge of indecently assaulting his son Kim between June 1973 and June 1975 (count 5).4. The charges against the accused in respect of Trish and Kim are being retried. In the indictment presented for the first trial before acting Judge Boulton there were five charges, the charges relating to Linda having been earlier separated for trial on their own. Defence counsel no longer seeks severance, hence the inclusion of all complainants' allegations in the one indictment.The Crown allegations against the accused5. In 1975 the accused was the father of 8 children with his then wife Tanya. The eldest was J--, followed by R---, Trish, G---, Linda, Kim, S--- and A---. Between 1975 and 1978 the accused and Tanya separated. He began a relationship with another woman, Joanne, who at that time was the mother of daughters. It is not clear on the evidence before me whether the second wife has borne other children fathered by the accused.6. The Crown alleges the accused began sexual activity with Trish when she was aged 4 or 5 years. Initially it was fondling of her genital area. It progressed through the years to include penile/vaginal and anal intercourse until she was about 17 years old. There were periods during the years from the early 1960s through to 1975 when two or more children shared a bedroom or bedrooms. Trish alleges that between her 5th and 9th year the accused would come into her bedroom, open her legs whilst she was in bed at night, and masturbate himself “onto my vaginal area”. She claims that she also saw him “playing sexual games” at night with her brothers R--- and Kim by masturbating them, or having them masturbate him.7. The family moved from time to time to new housing. During her teenage years Trish shared a bedroom with her younger sister Linda. The accused would enter this bedroom, select one or other of his daughters, both of whom where sleeping in the same bedroom, and sexually assault her. That included placing his hands on her vagina, engaging in cunnilingus. During these acts he would masturbate himself. Trish claims at the age of 13 she lost her virginity to her father when he penetrated her vagina with his penis. Thereafter he had sexual intercourse with her at least once weekly until she left home. Trish claims the accused also had intercourse with her sister Linda on a regular basis while both she and Linda shared the same bed. Linda gives an account consistent with that given by Trish.8. J---, the eldest child, gives an account of first being sexually assaulted when aged five. He was in the bath; his father entered the bathroom and indecently fondled him. Thereafter five or six times weekly he was sexually interfered with, the interference graduating to fellatio of him by the accused, and fellatio of the accused by him. The accused would make J--- masturbate him. By puberty sexual interference had reached a point of anal penetration by the father of him, and a requirement of him that he anally penetrate the father. The penetration of each would continue until ejaculation. On J---’s account things did not stop there. 9. While J--- was still at primary school, his father started to involve this son in sexual acts with one or other of his sisters. One or other was selected by the father. J--- was forced to penile penetrate one of his sister’s vagina, or with having three way sex with a sister and the father. For example if Trish was sucking J---’s penis, the father would penetrate her vagina.10. J--- alleges his brothers R--- and G--- had to do the same things with their sisters. When this activity was on-going the other children were locked out of the house. Kim was seven years younger than J--- and nearly 5 years younger than Trish. Kim claims he was not involved in this three-way activity. J--- claims he and brother R---, upgraded the garage of the home they were then living in at P--- St, Fairfield to provide a bedroom for themselves, moved out of the house to flee the sexual appetite of the accused.11. The Crown case is all these sexual activities of the father were done while the mother was asleep or nursing a new borne baby in the marital bedroom, on shift work, or otherwise away from the home. It is the Crown case the mother, Tanya, discovered the sexual interference, initially of her daughter Trish, when she entered the girls’ bedroom in the early hours of a morning to discover the accused partially unclothed, hiding behind the bedroom door saying “This is not what you think it is.” She contacted Lifeline and the Fairfield Police. Tanya’s account is that the response of both organisations was that she should go to Community Health clinic and have them checked out. Tanya claims she was told that having the children medically examined or going through court would be too traumatic for them, but rather they should be taken to counselling. Tanya’s account is she told her husband she wanted him gone, but at a family conference the children agreed he should not be asked to leave, but he had to go to Community Health to receive counselling, and there was to be no more violence from him towards the children or his wife in future. 12. Initially, the mother had not realised more than one child had been the subject of the accused’s sexual activities. But within a week or so, she found that “boys” and Linda had been involved sexually with the accused, and that at his insistence J--- and R--- would have sex with Trish and Linda. 13. The Crown case is the accused demonstrated violence towards each of the complainants generally and particularly in respect of demanding and enforcing sexual favours to himself.14. It is of some relevance to note G---, when aged 34 in June 1993 died of a drug overdose.Section 293 Criminal Procedure Act 1985 application15. Defence counsel seeks to cross-examine the complainant, Trish, who is presently being cross-examined, upon material appearing in Kim’s statement to police on 11 May 2009 (Exh VD 8). I should note there is an earlier statement from Kim dated 15 November 2001. (Exh VD 3).16. The material sought to be cross-examined upon is material I shall refer to generally as “paragraph 6”: 
     
      
      6, When I was about five or six, my family lived in Glenfield in a flat near Glenfield Train Station. I remember one time I was at home in a room with Trish and Linda. I clearly remember Trish jumping up on the dressing table. She spread her legs apart and showed me her vagina. Trish and Linda started egging me on to have penis-vaginal sex with them. Linda said things like,  
      “come on, stick your dick in here (indicating Trish’s vagina) because that’s what dad does to us”. 
       I think I approached her and showed them my penis. I think we mutually touched each others’ genitalia but there was no penetration. 
      
    17. The defence argues it would be unfairly prejudiced if counsel was not permitted to raise this material in cross-examination. Notwithstanding obvious areas of prejudice to the defence if the material is admitted, Mr Gordon makes argument of unfair prejudice to the accused in the event the material is not available for cross-examination. 18. He argues, two areas of potential loss relate to loss of other areas that the defence can point to in the complainants’ lives that may well account for any guilt and fear each may be experiencing; and other areas that may well explain alternate inappropriate boundaries of sexual behaviour within the family. Mr Gordon has foreshadowed he seeks to cross-examine each of the complainants on the paragraph 6 material. As I understand the defence thesis, assume the jury were of a view any shame and/or fear referred to in the evidence, of say, Trish, existed, it could be explained away by the material in paragraph 6 of Kim’s statement.19. There is no material in Trish’s statements to police, or evidence in the first trial consistent with, or covering the account given by Kim in paragraph 6. Nor has she been made aware, so far as I am aware, of the contents of paragraph 6. So far as I am aware it is not a topic previously canvassed with Trish. In those circumstances, one cannot predict what answers she may give. No doubt the Crown may expect/hope she gives evidence consistent with Kim’s account. However, one cannot rule out the possibility she may give inconsistent evidence. While it is purely speculative, if she failed to support Kim’s account, that failure may potentially reflect upon her credit, or Kim’s, or both. 20. For example, on the Crown case, and indeed in Trish’s evidence, the assertion is that the children did not talk among themselves about what their father was doing to them. There is material in paragraph 6 contrary to that assertion.21. I am satisfied the complainant Trish may have taken part in the sexual activity described by Kim in paragraph 6. I am satisfied the accused may be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant, Trish, could not be cross-examined upon the sexual activity alleged in paragraph 6. The unfairness arises from the loss of the potential to attack the complainants’ credit, to explain away any sense of shame or guilt the jury may find this complainant experienced or experiences, and to point to the potential for other areas of sexual misbehaviour referred to by her in evidence to be telescoped into some concocted account being given by all the complainants against their father.22. The Crown sought to have me satisfy myself the evidence would pass the test set out in subsection 293 (4) Criminal Procedure Act. Does the probative value of the evidence outweigh any distress, humiliation or embarrassment the complainant may suffer as a result of its admission? The starting point is to recognise the entire hearing is in camera. Thus any distress, humiliation and/or embarrassment that may arise, arises in circumstances where issues raised in paragraph 6 will be canvassed only before a closed group of persons. 23. The decision I am making applies only to Trish. I have limited it to her alone, because I have not had any opportunity to assess the character or sensitivities of Linda or Kim. Any decision I made now in respect of either of them would necessarily have an element of speculation in it. 24. Trish presents as a strong, seasoned and mature aged woman who has worked on fishing boats and on the land. While, as it seems to me, she may be finding the giving of evidence in this case trying, she appears to be bearing up strongly, sometimes argumentatively or combatively with defence counsel. Answers have been required of her in respect of numerous unpleasant allegations thus far raised, none of which appears to have caused her any outward emotional distress. That, of course, is not to say her giving evidence is not distressing for her. Her initial embarrassment or sensitivity to deposing to a jury of 12 and courtroom of others appears to have dissipated or been numbed. Again, that is not to say she does not continue to experience embarrassment. I do not perceive on the material in paragraph 6, material that would extend the embarrassment, distress, or for that matter any humiliation she may presently be experiencing in giving evidence.25. On the other hand, the probative value of the evidence, as it relates to the matters discussed above, from the defence perspective is important. The probative value of the evidence, as it touches those matters, outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment she may suffer as a consequence of its admission.26. Finally, and for more abundant caution, I test the proposed evidence against s.135 Evidence Act. There is no potential for s. 135 (b) or (c) to apply. Can the contents of paragraph 6 be unfairly prejudicial to a party? I do not see the Crown case in any way being unfairly prejudiced by it. Indeed, my concern as expressed during submissions was that it is capable of impacting adversely to the defence. But the defence seeks to have it in. In those circumstances, prejudice to the defence, if there be any, can hardly be “unfair”. At the end of the day, Mr Gordon seeks to have it in. He knows, better than I do, what use he will put the material to. I have to rely upon his judgment and selection of tactics when presenting the defence case. I am comforted in doing that in circumstances where counsel has the experience and seniority Mr Gordon possesses.27. The defence may seek to adduce evidence of the conversations and acts referred to in paragraph 6. Likewise the prosecution may re-examine on any evidence so adduced.

    2 GROVE J: I agree with Buddin J. 
     
      
    3 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing nine counts which, in essence, alleged sexual misconduct on his part some 30 years ago. There were six counts of indecent assault upon a child under the age of 16. Each of those counts alleged a contravention of s 76 of the Crimes Act which has since been repealed. A maximum penalty of six years imprisonment was provided at the relevant time for such an offence. The other three counts each involved the commission of an act of indecency by the applicant with a child under the age of 16. Each of those counts alleged a contravention of s 76A of the Act which has also since been repealed. A maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment was provided at the relevant time for such an offence. Sentence was passed on 23 August 2007 and the overall effect of the various sentences which were imposed was to produce a non-parole period of 3 years with a total term of 6 years imprisonment to date from 17 August 2007. His Honour indicated that the applicant would be eligible for release to parole on 17 August 2010. I will refer to the individual sentences which were imposed in respect of the various counts when dealing with a specific ground of appeal which complains about the process by which those sentences were pronounced. 
     
      
    4 The sentence hearing proceeded by way of an agreed statement of facts. The offences occurred between January 1976 and December 1980. At the time of the offences the victim, who was the applicant’s step-daughter, was aged between 9 and 13 years. The applicant, who was born in August 1943, was 64 when he stood for sentence. He was aged between 35 and 39 at the time of the offences. The applicant voluntarily desisted from his criminal behaviour at the end of 1980 although he continued to live with the victim’s mother for about another five or six years after that time. In all, that relationship lasted for about 12 years.  
     
      
    5 The victim complained to her sister in either 1980 or 1981 and then in 1989 or 1990 she informed her mother about what had happened to her. In 1997 the victim telephoned the applicant and spoke to him about the abuse. He admitted his wrongdoing and offered her money. At the request of the victim, the applicant told his then wife about what he had done. In June 2005 the victim reported the matter to police. In December that year the victim made three calls to the applicant which were the subject of lawfully authorised intercepts. During those calls the applicant again admitted that he had sexually abused the victim. In August 2006 the applicant was interviewed by police and made admissions in respect of those matters which he said that he was able to recall. The details of the particular offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty are set out below:

        Count 9: 
         1 January 1979 - 31 December 1980 - Indecent assault- victim 12-13 
         
         
          
           
            
            [the applicant removed the victim’s pants and lay on top of her with an erect penis. The victim thought he was going to penetrate her and said “no”] 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    6 The first offence occurred whilst the family was living in Ballina, offences 2-7 inclusive occurred whilst they were living at Fernleigh and the final two offences occurred after the family had returned to live in Ballina. 
     
      
    7 The sentencing judge was provided with a pre-sentence report as well as a psychiatric report which had been prepared on behalf of the applicant. His Honour also heard sworn evidence from the applicant. From that material it emerged that the applicant had experienced a turbulent and emotionally deprived childhood. He left home at 15 largely because of the difficult relationship that he had had with his mother. He was understandably very affected by the fact that she committed suicide when he was aged 19. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge made a number of findings, that were favourable to the applicant, which served to ameliorate the otherwise appropriate sentences. His Honour extended to the applicant a discount of 25% on account of his decision to plead guilty at an early stage and, in doing so, recognised that it had relieved the victim from the ordeal of having to give evidence. His Honour found that the applicant had what he described as a “palpable sense of remorse”. His Honour noted that the applicant had confessed before police had become involved.  
     
      
    9 The sentencing judge took into account the fact that the applicant had always been gainfully employed and referred, in that context, to a testimonial from his employer, who said that he was prepared to re-employ the applicant upon his release from custody. The applicant had no prior convictions and had led an otherwise blameless existence. 
     
      
    10 The author of the pre-sentence report reported that the applicant had been found, according to the static – 99 actuarial risk assessment, to present a “low risk” of recidivism. The sentencing judge also accepted the opinion of the psychiatrist that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend. The sentencing judge also acknowledged that there had been a substantial delay in bringing the matters to resolution during which time the applicant had completely rehabilitated. It was particularly apparent that the applicant had been left in a “state of uncertain suspense as to what [would] happen to him” from the time the victim first spoke to him in 1997 until his arrest in 2006: see generally R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519.  
     
      
    11 The disclosure by the applicant to his wife about his offending conduct led to the breakdown of that marriage, which was the applicant’s second. The sentencing judge accepted the applicant’s evidence that following the breakdown of that marriage, he had not sought another relationship because of what the applicant regarded as the uncertainty surrounding his future. As a result of the disclosure of his offending behaviour, the applicant also decided to effectively cut himself off from the rest of his family. A further factor which the sentencing judge regarded as having some significance was the circumstance that the applicant was the carer of his 14 year old son to whom he was devoted. The applicant gave evidence, which the sentencing judge accepted, that although his ex-wife was able to look after their son in the short-term, the applicant had real concerns about whether that would remain the case for the entirety of his sentence given that the relationship between his ex-wife and his son was far from harmonious. His Honour took into account the interests of the applicant’s son in having their relationship restored at the earliest possible time, and the fact that this was the applicant’s first custodial sentence, as reasons which warranted a finding of “special circumstances”.  
     
      
    12 The following grounds of appeal were relied upon: 
     
      
       
        
        1 The sentence is manifestly excessive when regard is had to sentencing practice at the time of the offences; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in respect of the non parole period; 
           
           
          (b) in respect of the head sentence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2 His Honour erred in failing to impose a non parole period in respect of counts 3 and 4. 
        
       
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    13 It is convenient to deal with this ground first. It is common ground that the pronouncement of the various sentences by the sentencing judge was attended with confusion and ambiguity. During the course of delivering his remarks on sentence, his Honour pronounced the following sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        In respect of each of counts 1 & 2: a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years; 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of each of counts 3 & 4: a sentence of imprisonment for 4 years to date from 17 August 2008 (which was expressed to be “partly cumulative as to 1 year” on the earlier sentences); 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of each of counts 5 & 6: a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years to date from 17 August 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of count 7: a sentence of imprisonment of 2½ years to date from 17 August 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of each of counts 8 & 9: a sentence of imprisonment of 4 years to date from 17 August 2009 
        
       
      
    14 As will be apparent, his Honour did not set a non-parole period for any of the sentences which he had pronounced. As I have said, his Honour specifically indicated that the overall sentence which he intended to impose was one which comprised a non-parole period of 3 years with an overall term of imprisonment for 6 years. Such a result could only have been achieved by nominating non-parole periods for the sentences which were imposed, in respect of counts 3, 4, 8 and 9. Complaint was made that the sentencing process had miscarried as a result of the uncertainty which had been created.  
     
      
    15 The Crown provided the court with documentation which showed that his Honour had made plain, in written form on the day that he passed sentence, the sentences which he had intended to impose. Customarily the sentencing judge endorses the back of the indictment with the details of the sentences which have been imposed. That procedure was not followed in the present case simply because, as I understand the situation, there was insufficient space on the back of the indictment to record all the relevant information. Accordingly, the relevant information was set out in a typed document which was annexed to the indictment and signed by the sentencing judge. That document records that the following sentences had been imposed: 
     
      
       
        
        In respect of count 1: a 2 year fixed term to commence on 17 August 2007 and to expire on 16 August 2009; 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of each of counts 4 years imprisonment with  
         
        2, 3 & 4: a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 17 August 2008 and to expire on 16 August 2010; 
         
          
         
        In respect of counts 5 & 6: a 2 year fixed term to commence on 17 August 2008 and to expire on 16 August 2010; 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of count 7: a sentence of imprisonment of 2½ years with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 17 August 2008 and to expire on 16 August 2010; 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of counts 8 & 9: 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year to commence on 17 August 2009 and to expire on 16 August 2010. 
        
       
      
    16 The matter was re-listed the following day. Pursuant to the “slip-rule”, which is contained in s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour made the following corrections to the sentences which he had imposed. 
     
      
       
        
        In respect of each of counts 5 & 6: a fixed term of 1½ years imprisonment to commence on 17 August 2008 and to expire on 16 February 2010; 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of count 7: a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 17 August 2008 and to expire on 16 August 2010 
        
       
      
    17 A further document was created upon which those corrections were recorded. The warrants of commitment which were issued, pursuant to s 62 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on 23 and 24 August 2007 respectively, reflect what his Honour had recorded in the documents to which I have just referred. 
     
      
    18 I am satisfied that those documents, being the formal written record of the sentences, effectively remove any ambiguity about the individual sentences which his Honour had sought to impose. In R v Thomas [2004] NSWCCA 291, Handley JA, with whom other members of the court agreed, observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        The first ground relies upon errors in the Judge's remarks on sentence and the inconsistency between some of those remarks and the sentence finally pronounced. 
          
         
        … 
         
         
        There is no doubt that the Judge misstated the effect of his sentences on more than one occasion in the course of his remarks. This could be a serious matter in some circumstances, but in other circumstances it is open to a Court to find that the errors are mere slips of the tongue or errors of transcription. 
          
         
         
        In the present case, the Judge's intention is clear because of the formal written record he signed on 14 March, the same day as the oral sentences were pronounced. 
          
         
         
        This resolves any ambiguity that would otherwise arise and attracts what is known as the slip rule which enables a Court to give effect to its clear intention, and in doing so, to rectify any formal slips or errors. 
          
         
         
        The slips and errors are only in his Honour's oral reasons for imposing the sentences that he did, and the matter is made quite clear, as I have said, by the formal written record signed on 14 March. 
          
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I would reject the first ground. (paras 12, 18-22) 
        
       
      
    19 For the same reasons the ground of appeal which is relied upon in the present case, should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    20 It is now well established that a judge who is sentencing an offender in respect of historical offences, must do so by reference to the pattern of sentencing that existed at the time of the offending. Obviously that requirement extends to the imposition of an appropriate non-parole period: R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368; AJB v R (2007) 169 A Crim R 32; MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261; Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71; Bradbury v R [2008] NSWCCA 93. Each of the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty occurred whilst the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 was in operation. Unlike the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that Act placed no restriction upon the setting of the non-parole period. In AJB (supra) [at 36-9] and in Bradbury (supra) [at 36] this Court observed that non-parole periods imposed under that legislative scheme were usually in the order of between one third and one half of the head sentence.  
     
      
    21 It was contended on the applicant’s behalf that a number of the individual sentences were on their face, manifestly excessive. It was submitted that in respect of counts 3, 4, 8 and 9 which, as I have said, each attracted a maximum penalty of 6 years imprisonment, the sentencing judge must have adopted a starting point of 5 years 6 months imprisonment before allowing the discount of 25% for the plea of guilty. It was submitted in respect of counts 5 and 6, that the starting point must have been the maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment before the discount for the plea of guilty was applied and in respect of count 7, it was submitted that it was plain that the sentencing judge had made no allowance whatsoever for the plea of guilty because he had imposed the maximum penalty. Sentences of that length, it was submitted, could only have been imposed for offences which fell into the worst category of case and there was simply no basis upon which his Honour had, or indeed could have, reached such a conclusion. In my view, the applicant’s submission should be accepted.  
     
      
    22 The applicant also placed considerable reliance upon the decisions of this court in AJB (supra) and Bradbury (supra). In AJB the offender was dealt with in respect of five counts of indecent assault and asked that four offences of a similar nature be taken into account. Howie J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, described the relevant factors in that case in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The offences were committed over a period of three years from 1979 against the applicant’s stepdaughter. She was aged between six and a half and ten years at the time of the offending. Each of the offences was an indecent assault with a child under 16 years contrary to either s 76 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , now repealed, or s 61E(1) of that Act. Each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for six years. 
         
         
        The victim complained to her mother about the applicant’s conduct in 1982. The applicant as a result sought treatment from a psychiatrist and the family remained together for another ten years without any further misconduct by the applicant toward the victim. The victim complained again to a police hotline in 1993 but there was no response. Ultimately she made a complaint in 2005 that resulted in the arrest of the applicant in July of that year. He initially denied the conduct. However, he pleaded guilty before the Local Court and was committed for sentence to the District Court. The Judge gave him the benefit of a discount of sentence of 25 per cent for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty. 
         
         
        The conduct that gave rise to four of the offences for which he was sentenced involved the applicant simulating sexual intercourse with the complainant by rubbing his erect penis between her legs and on her vagina while they were both naked from the waist down. On each occasion he ejaculated but once he was wearing a condom. The fifth offence related to an incident when the applicant fondled the complainant’s vagina beneath her panties while they were in the family vehicle. The offences on the Form 1 involved sexual assaults committed on different occasions and including simulated intercourse without ejaculation, fondling the complainant’s vagina, fondling her breasts, and requiring the complainant to rub cream on his penis. The final assault occurred after the complainant had made complaint to her mother. Throughout the period of the offences the applicant was married to the complainant’s mother and the complainant treated him as her father. After the initial complaint the applicant attended a psychiatrist, Dr Dignam, in 1982 for therapy. He diagnosed the applicant as having an anxiety neurosis and a personality disorder. 
         
         
        The applicant was aged 60 years at the date of sentence, having been born on 23 November 1946. He has no criminal record. He was living on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland with his wife and two children. This was his fourth long-term relationship and commenced in 1998. His wife suffers from Sjogrens Syndrome, an autoimmune disease. The applicant is a retired fireman. There was in evidence a pre-sentence report that set out his background. There was little of relevance other than that the applicant stated that his employment as a fireman led to traumatic incidents that resulted in his use of alcohol to cope with stress. This was particularly so after he attended the Luna Park fire in 1978. The applicant was in receipt of a pension and regular payments of compensation from the NSW Fire Service. The applicant expressed remorse for the offending to the officer preparing the report but was unable or unwilling to recall the details of the offences. 
         
         
        There was in evidence a report from Dr Westmore, a psychiatrist, dated February 2006. When asked about the offences, the applicant told Dr Westmore that he was drinking heavily at the time and having difficulties with his wife who was too concerned with the problems of her neighbours. He said that the victim would sit on his lap and it led him “to do these things”. The applicant acknowledged that the behaviour was wrong and would have damaged the victim. He said that he did not find her sexually attractive but it was a release for him. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he had been drinking alcohol heavily for about 10 years until he sought counselling and attended AA. He was drinking only lightly at the time of the interview. Dr Westmore diagnosed the applicant as suffering from chronic symptoms of depression at the time of the offending. He did not find him to be a paedophile. He thought his risks of re-offending were negligible to non-existent and his prognosis was generally good. (at paras 3-7) 
         
         
        
       
      
    23 A little later, his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        However, it seems to me, notwithstanding due regard being paid to the discretion of the sentencing judge in a matter that presented no simple task, that such a starting point was manifestly excessive in what was an unusual case. It is not so much the fact that the offences occurred over 24 years ago that seems to place this case into a category of its own, because such delays while uncommon are not unknown, but rather the fact that, the offending having been brought to light, the applicant sought treatment and as a result and, most significantly, did not offend again. Over the period of time since offending the applicant had completely reformed and had moved onto other relationships without any suggestion of any similar conduct reoccurring. There is no error that I can discern in the sentencing remarks so far as the fixing of the overall head sentence is concerned. But it is one of those cases where my immediate reaction to the sentence was that it was too severe, given the delay and the applicant’s reform. Having considered the sentencing remarks in detail and the arguments of counsel before this Court, I am convinced that my immediate reaction was correct. 
        
       
       
        
        I think that what I said in Moon at [81] is perhaps even more appropriate in the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ... In a case such as this where there has been such a lengthy delay between offence and sentence and where the offender is rehabilitated, it is the fact of imprisonment rather than the length of the sentence which will be of greatest significance to punish the offender and denounce his conduct. Although general deterrence is important it can never be allowed to dictate a sentence which is not proportionate to the offence committed or appropriate to punish the particular offender before the court. [paras 29-30] 
          
         
        
       
      
    24 An overall sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months was substituted by this court for the original sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years.  
     
      
    25 In Bradbury (supra), Matthews AJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed, set out the details of that offender’s behaviour in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The victim in relation to each offence was the offender’s youngest daughter. The offences took place when she was between 8 and 12 years old. Briefly, the activities covered by each of the four charges were as follows. 
         
         
        The first offence took place when the victim was about 8 years old. At that stage she would often have a bath while her mother was preparing dinner. Her father came into the bathroom, sat down beside the bath and touched her on the outside of her vagina with his fingers. 
         
         
        The second offence took place when the victim was 9 or 10 years old. She was called into the laundry by the applicant. He had his shorts open and his penis exposed. He took the victim’s hands and placed them around his penis and testicles. He then made her rub these areas with her hands.  
         
         
        The third offence took place when the victim was 11 or 12 years old. One day after she had returned home from school, the applicant approached her while she was in the lounge room alone watching television. He started to wrestle with her in a joking manner. During the course of this he put his hand into her underpants and touched her on the outside of her vagina with his fingers. 
         
         
        The fourth offence occurred during this same period. The victim was again approached by the applicant one afternoon after returning from school. He took off her underpants and performed cunnilingus with her. He was masturbating at the time. Her vagina was sore after this occasion. [paras 4-8] 
        
       
      
    26 This court then proceeded to resentence the applicant, who was aged 80, to a head sentence of 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. The original sentence had comprised a non-parole of 1 year 9 months with an additional term of nine months. 
     
      
    27 I should observe that the sentencing judge was provided with no assistance as to the principles which govern the sentencing of offenders for historical offences. Nor was his Honour made aware of the decision in AJB (supra). (The judgment in Bradbury was delivered after the applicant was sentenced). It is of course necessary to proceed with considerable caution when comparing one case with another. Obviously enough there are differences between the cases to which the Court was referred and the present one. The age of the applicant in Bradbury is one such point of distinction. Although it is not easy to now retrieve reliable data as to the appropriate range of sentences for offences of the present kind, the decisions to which I have referred nonetheless provide a useful guide as to that range. They also serve to confirm my own preliminary impression that the sentences which were imposed exceeded the legitimate range of the sentencing judge’s discretion.  
     
      
    28 In my view, it is necessary to proceed to resentence the applicant. Section 76 encompassed a wide range of conduct which now falls within the definition of “sexual intercourse” in s 61H of the Act. Some of the offences that the applicant committed such as fellatio, cunnilingus and digital penetration constituted serious examples of the type of offending that was within the reach of the section. Moreover, the offending conduct extended over a five year span and it was rendered more serious because of the relationship of trust that existed between the applicant and his step-daughter.  
     
      
    29 In resentencing, I have had regard to an affidavit affirmed by the applicant. In it he indicates that he is employed on a full-time basis in the trusted position of clerk for the Superintendant of Industries. The applicant also indicates that he remains concerned about his son who is said to be exhibiting behavioural problems. 
     
      
    30 There is one further matter which requires comment and it arises from the following paragraph which appears in the applicant’s affidavit: 
     
      
       
        
        I am on the waiting list to do the 24 week CORE program. I am happy to do this program and am just waiting for my name to come up. I have been advised that I can not get parole until I have completed this course. 
        
       
      
    31 As I understand the situation, that program is designed, inter alia, to address the all important objective of reducing the risk of recidivism amongst offenders who have been convicted of offences of sexual misconduct. As I have already said, the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant did not represent such a risk. Nor has the court’s attention been drawn to any other material which would suggest otherwise. I recognise that a decision about an offender’s entitlement to be released upon parole is properly a matter which is within the province of the Parole Board. Nevertheless, I can see no legitimate reason why it should be regarded as an impediment to the applicant being able to obtain parole, should it transpire that he has not completed the CORE program at the time that his eligibility for parole arises for consideration.  
     
      
    32 I would find “special circumstances” for the reasons identified by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    33 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2 Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3 Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and substitute the following sentences: 
       
       
      (a) In respect of count 1, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months to commence on 17 August 2007 and to expire on 16 August 2008. 
       
       
      (b) In respect of count 2, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months to commence on 17 August 2007 and to expire on 16 August 2008. 
       
       
      (c) In respect of count 3, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 17 August 2007 and to expire on 16 February 2009. 
       
       
      (d) In respect of count 4, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment to commence on 17 August 2007 and to expire on 16 February 2009. 
       
       
      (e) In respect of count 5, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months to commence on 17 February 2008 and to expire on 16 February 2009.

      (g) In respect of count 7, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 17 February 2008 and to expire on 16 August 2009. 
       
       
      (h) In respect of count 9, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 17 February 2008 and to expire on 16 August 2009.  
       
       
      (i) In respect of count 8, the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 17 February 2008 and to expire on 16 August 2009 and to a total term of imprisonment of 3 years 6 months to commence on 17 February 2008 and to expire on 16 August 2011.  
       
       
      The effective non-parole period is thus 2 years and the total term of imprisonment is 4 years. The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 16 August 2009.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Matthew James Hall appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. When I sentence him for that matter he asks that I take into account two matters on a Form 1. The first of those matters is a further offence of supplying a prohibited drug. It occurred earlier in time than the matter for which he must be specifically sentenced. The other offence to be taken into account is an offence of recklessly or intentionally damaging the side window of a motor vehicle. Also, I am to deal with two related matters of driving whilst disqualified.2 The offender was a drug user living in the northern beaches area. He knew a woman by the name of Suzanne Lenton. She had a relationship of supplier and purchaser with an undercover police officer. She of course did not know that he was an undercover police officer. From time to time when the police officer asked her to supply drugs to him, she would obtain them from Mr Hall, the offender. She did this on two occasions, the first on 29 April 2008, that is the matter on the Form 1 and the second on 5 May 2008, that is the matter for which the offender must be specifically sentenced. On the first occasion the offender supplied 0.14 of a gram of methylamphetamine for $70 and on the next occasion 0.9 of a gram for $450.3 The offender is supported in court today by his father. His parents separated when he was relatively young but he continues to maintain a good relationship with his father. Indeed his father has employed him from time to time and describes him as the best employee he has ever had.4 The offender left school at fourteen years and nine months and has since then worked in various occupations, but as is commonly the case, his drug use got in the way of being a good employee. He first began experimenting with cannabis at the age of thirteen and his drug use escalated until at the age of twenty-four he was using heroin on a daily basis.5 The offences of supply committed by the offender were committed by him in order to obtain his own drugs. The offender would skim drugs for his own use from drugs he bought on credit, before on-supplying them to Ms Lenton and her undercover police officer customer.6 For a while the offender was able to fund his own drug use habit, but after a change in accommodation the money he would have spent on drugs had to be spent on other things. It was in those circumstances that the offender said he was left in the position where he could no longer fund his own drug habit and had to obtain drugs in the way I have described.7 The offender has something of a criminal history but this is his first offence of supplying drugs. He has spent significant periods of time in custody for various offences and as far as the driving offences are concerned it is to be noted that he regularly received gaol sentences for such offences. His willingness to drive whilst disqualified is evidenced by the fact that he is currently disqualified as a driver until 30 September 2027.8 He pleaded guilty, as I mentioned, at the first opportunity and so I will reduce the sentence I would otherwise impose by twenty-five percent to reflect that circumstance. He was on a s 9 bond at the time he committed the reckless damage offence on the Form 1. At an earlier time he received a sentence of home detention but failed to take advantage of the leniency that was offered to him on that occasion, breaching (I gather deliberately) the home detention order with the result that he was required to serve his sentence in custody. 9 Whilst in custody in 2003, he was diagnosed as a diabetic although no evidence was put before me today to suggest that the offender will have a harder time of it in prison because of his condition. I will accept that it is entirely possible that that either is the case or will be the case in the future. 10 Upon his release from custody there is work available for him. His father who is a builder has offered him work as have two other people. It is to be hoped that the offender will take advantage of those opportunities available to him. His prospects of rehabilitation are enhanced by the fact that he has work available but of course much would depend on whether he overcomes his drug addiction. As I mentioned before, he has had problems with work in the past because of his use of drugs. In order to assist him to overcome his addiction to drugs I will enlarge the period of eligibility to parole at the expense of the non- parole period to take account of his need for supervision.11 Ordinarily one deals with the related matters on a Form 166 certificate at the conclusion of sentencing for the major offence. However in this case that would lead to an inappropriate sentencing outcome. The offender needs to receive a significant custodial sentence for his drug supply matter, especially given the circumstances that there is another drug supply matter to be taken into account and to impose a period of custody for the driving whilst disqualified matters accumulative on the non-parole period for the drug supply matter would mean that the period of eligibility for parole, an important part of the offender’s rehabilitation would be reduced. I consider that under s 168 of the Criminal Procedure Act it is possible for me to impose sentence on the driving matters first and then impose a sentence on the drug supply matter which is partially accumulative. That is what I will do.12 For the two offences of driving whilst disqualified the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of twelve months for each of those matters. Those sentences are fixed terms because of the sentence I will impose on the drug supply matter and they are to date from 23 July 2008. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug taking into account the two matters on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment and I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 22 January 2009 with a balance of term of two years. The effective overall sentence is thus two years non-parole period with a four year head sentence. The offender is disqualified from driving on each of the driving matters for twelve months to date from 30 September 2027, that disqualification period in each case being served concurrently with the other.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I have read the judgment of Simpson J in draft. I agree with her Honour’s reasons and the orders she proposes. 
     
      
    2 I wish to add some observations with respect to the reliance placed by the appellant on the decision of this Court in R v Merritt [1999] NSWCCA 29. That was a circumstantial case with an unusually circumscribed set of circumstances. Indeed there were, relevantly, only two circumstances and each was necessary to be established in order to inculpate the accused. 
     
      
    3 The first piece of circumstantial evidence was a glove which contained the accused’s fingerprint and which was found in the carpark near where the armed robbery occurred. The second was the scar on the accused’s body, when he was arrested some four months after the robbery, which expert evidence indicated was consistent with being shot. One of the two persons who committed the robbery had probably been shot during the course of the robbery. 
     
      
    4 The joint judgment in Merritt stated that these facts could be considered as “links in a chain” rather than as “strands in a cable” and that each was therefore “indispensable to a conclusion of guilt” (see at [69]). The joint judgment went on to say at [69]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The importance of the scarring arose because it linked the accused to the robbery. Without it, the Crown may have been unable, in the jury’s view, to disprove the hypothesis that a close associate of the accused (for example) may have used the accused’s gloves for the purpose of the robbery.” 
        
       
      
    5 Wood CJ at CL, one of the members of the Court in Merritt, subsequently described the case as one “where there was a paucity of evidence”. (R v Merlino [2004] NSWCCA 104 at [46].) This was a feature of the case emphasised in Merritt itself: 
     
      
       
        
        “[71] Having regard to the relatively few incriminating facts in this case, we think that it was both desirable and necessary that his Honour should have identified for the jury the crucial factual issues and assisted them to apply to them the legal rule requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt of the Crown case and, in particular, directed them that if they regarded any particular fact as being an indispensable link in the chain of proof, then that fact must be proved to their satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict.” 
        
       
      
    6 Furthermore, as McHugh J said in Shepherd v The Queen (1991) 170 CLR 573 at 593:  
     
      
       
        
        “In a particular case, an inference of guilt beyond reasonable doubt may not be able to be drawn unless each fact relied on to found the inference is established beyond reasonable doubt.  
        This is likely to be the case where the incriminating facts relied on to establish the inference are few in number. But the more facts that are relied on to found the inference of guilt, the less likely it is that each or any fact will have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 
         Consequently, even when guilt beyond reasonable doubt cannot be inferred unless certain facts are proved, it may still be open to infer guilt beyond reasonable doubt even though each fact is not proved to that standard.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    7 The joint judgment in Merritt referred to the well known passage of Dawson J in Shepherd, supra at 579, where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [I]t may sometimes be necessary or desirable to identify those intermediate facts which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. Not every possible intermediate conclusion of fact will be of that character. If it is appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable, it may well be appropriate to tell the jury that that fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn. But where – to use the metaphor referred to by Wigmore On Evidence, Vol 9 (Chadbourn Rev. 1981), par 2497 pp.412-414 – the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so. It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    8 In a case like Merritt, where there were only two intermediate facts, it was, to use the language of Dawson J, neither “unnecessary” nor “confusing” to give such a direction. In a case such as the present where there are numerous separate facts, of varying degrees of probative force, it could very well be confusing to do so. The prospect of confusion is a matter which has been emphasised in later cases. (See eg Minniti v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 30; (2006) 159 A Crim R 394 at [45]; Hannes v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373; (2006) 165 A Crim R 151 at [665].) 
     
      
    9 That part of the reasoning in Merritt which states that a direction of a particular kind is “usually” required may need to be reassessed in the light of subsequent authorities. I refer particularly to the passage at [70] where the joint judgment states, when a trial judge is deciding whether to give directions with respect to matters that are or might be intermediate facts: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge should … ask whether  
        the jury 
         might reasonably regard certain facts as intermediate facts even if, as it happened, his Honour did not regard any of the facts in that light. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        In our opinion, where one or more facts might reasonably be regarded as intermediate facts, it would usually be essential for the trial judge to identify those facts and instruct the jury that if the jury considered that such facts were indispensable links in their chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt, they would need to be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt before convicting.” 
        
       
      
    10 There is an element of redundancy in this analysis. If it be the case that a jury believes that particular facts are “indispensable links in their chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt” then it is unlikely that a jury could come to a conclusion that the offence was established beyond reasonable doubt unless that fact were so established. Indeed, that is so unlikely as to need no specific direction. The very hypothesis, that is, that the jury itself regarded a particular fact as an “indispensable link” would prevent the jury convicting in view of the clear direction always given about the obligation of the Crown to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. There may be circumstances in which a jury needs to be informed of a matter that should be obvious, however, in my opinion the proposition in Merritt at [70] that it is “usually essential” to give the direction therein referred to is not consistent with subsequent authority.  
     
      
    11 In Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4; (2004) 76 ALJR 402 the prosecution relied on certain alleged lies which were said to indicate a consciousness of guilt. With respect to this submission Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[43] It was next submitted that, even if it was permissible to leave the alleged lie to the jury in the way it was, it was necessary, in the circumstances, to give the jury a direction that they could rely upon an intermediate fact as a link in a chain of reasoning only if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that intermediate fact. Stated in that form the proposition is legally accurate but its recitation to the jury would be of no assistance unless its application to this case were explained. How that could have been done in this case was not made clear. It was submitted that the jury  
        may 
         (but need not) have concluded that the telling of the lie settled any reasonable doubt that consideration of the other evidence tendered at trial allowed.  
        If 
         the jury followed this path, it would, so it was said, make the telling of the lie an indispensable intermediate fact. It was the  
        possibility 
         that the jury might reason in this way that called, so it was submitted, for judicial instruction about how it should be undertaken. 
        
       
       
        
        [44] The argument should be rejected. It proceeds from a premise about the way in which the jury might approach the task which is wrong. It assumes that the jury will consider the evidence in separate and isolated compartments. That assumption is not made because the evidence relates to different steps in a chain of reasoning, but solely because it suits the appellant's immediate forensic purposes to isolate one of the pieces of evidence as the critical element that will conclude the issue of guilt. Once it is accepted, as it was, that the telling of the lie was not necessarily an intermediate indispensable fact in this case, it becomes apparent that the jury had to consider the evidence as a whole. The lie was not a separate fact which, together with other facts, would form links in a chain of reasoning.” (Footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    12 Furthermore, in R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 Justices Gummow, Hayne and Crennan said, in their joint judgment (Gleeson CJ agreeing): 
     
      
       
        
        “[46] … It is of critical importance to recognise … that in considering a circumstantial case, all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence.” (Footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    13 Their Honours went on to reject the suggestion that a circumstantial case can “be considered piecemeal” (at [48]). This was re-emphasised in R v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; (2009) 83 ALJR 243 at [128] per Kiefel J with whom Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ agreed.  
     
      
    14 In Keenan supra at [126], Kiefel J referred to a line of authority in the High Court which indicates that a circumstantial evidence direction, namely, that guilty should be the only rational inference that could be drawn from the circumstances, is not always required. The authorities to which her Honour referred indicate that, even in a circumstantial evidence case, such a direction is “customarily given” (Shepherd supra at 578) or is “often called for” (Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 502).  
     
      
    15 Furthermore, in Keenan, Kiefel J reinforced the proposition, well established in previous authorities, that such a direction: “ … is no more than the amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt” (at [126], referring to Shepherd supra at 578, Knight supra at 502). 
     
      
    16 The three matters on which the appellant relied in the present case as the “indispensable” intermediate facts were: 
     
      
       
      (i) That it was the appellant who made the telephone calls to the courier company, the Customs Service and the newsagency; 
       
       
      (ii) That it was the appellant who opened the postal box at Stanmore; 
       
       
      (iii) That is was the appellant who sent the money to China. 
       
      
    17 With respect to each of these matters, as in Velevski, it would be wrong to suggest that “the jury will consider the evidence in separate and isolated compartments” (see [11] above). That is not how the evidence was adduced or how it was relied upon. Nor is it in any way appropriate to regard each of these matters as essential steps which must be separately determined as distinct intermediate facts. They, and the other facts cannot “be considered piecemeal”, to use the terminology from Hillier.  
     
      
    18 The statement in Merritt at [71] set out at [5] above, that a direction “would usually be essential” does not accord with the principle affirmed most recently in Keenan set out at [14] above that a direction of this character is “often” required. Nor does it reflect the basic proposition, also most recently affirmed in Keenan, set out at [15] above, that directions of this character do no more than ‘amplify’ the basic direction of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstances of the case must determine the need for any further amplification, such as additional directions of the kind mentioned in Merritt.  
     
      
    19 For the reasons I have set out at [10], the emphasis always given to the Crown’s obligation to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt will often be adequate, in a particular case, with respect to a matter which the jury may reasonably regard as an indispensable intermediate fact.  
     
      
    20 The way this case was run, and the way it was summed up by his Honour to the jury, was that all of the facts, including aspects of the phone calls and the postal box and the despatch of the money, each of which had elements linking it to the appellant, were separate matters the combined effect of which was such as could satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. This was the approach most recently affirmed in Hillier and Keenan as set out at [12] and [13] above.  
     
      
    21 For these reasons, in addition to those set out by Simpson J, a direction of the character discussed in Merritt was not required in this case. 
     
      
    22 JAMES J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Simpson J and of the Chief Justice.  
     
      
    23 I agree that, for the reasons given by Simpson J, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed and that, although leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.  
     
      
    24 I also agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice in which the Chief Justice gives further reasons for rejecting the second ground of appeal against conviction, including rejecting the attempting reliance by counsel for the appellant on the decision of this Court in R v Merritt [1999] NSWCCA 29. 
     
      
    25 I was a member of the bench of this Court which decided the appeal in Merritt and joined in the judgment of the Court. 
     
      
    26 As is pointed out by the Chief Justice in his judgment, Merritt was an unusual case in that the circumstances from which the Crown contended that an inference of guilt could be drawn were very few in number. In such a case it is more likely that one or more of the limited number of circumstances relied on by the Crown should be identified as an indispensable intermediate circumstance, as discussed by Dawson J in the well known passage in Shepherd v The Queen (1991) 170 CLR 573 at 593. In the present case there were a large number of circumstances from the combination of which the Crown contended that the guilt of the appellant could be inferred and none of the three matters which were identified by counsel for the appellant on the appeal was an indispensable intermediate circumstance.  
     
      
    27 I agree with the Chief Justice that subsequent authorities, to a number of which the Chief Justice refers in his judgment, are not consistent with the passage in the judgment of the Court in Merritt at [70], where it is stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…where one or more facts might reasonably be regarded as intermediate facts, it will usually be essential for the trial judge to identify those facts and instruct the jury that if the jury considered that such facts were indispensable links in their chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt, they would need to be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt before convicting.” 
        
       
      
    28 SIMPSON J: On 21 September 2007, following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three counts of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug (Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), s 307.1), and one count of attempting to do so (s 307.1 and s 11.1(1)). 
     
      
    29 On 8 February 2008 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years on each count. By reason of partial accumulation of sentences, the total term of imprisonment imposed was 8 years, although this was reduced by 3 months and 15 days to take account of time spent in custody on remand. A single non-parole period of 4 years, 5 months and 15 days was specified. The head sentence will expire on 22 October 2015, the non-parole period on 22 July 2012. 
     
      
    30 The appellant now appeals against the convictions and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    31 On the Crown case the offences were committed on or about 15 January 2006, 13 February 2006, 2 March 2006 (attempt) and 5 March 2006. The drug involved was gammabutyrolactone, commonly known as GBL, an abbreviation I will adopt. GBL is a drug that can, by the use of a substance such as caustic soda, be converted to another drug, 4 - hydroxybutanoic acid, commonly known as GHB, which abbreviation I will also adopt. A pH testing kit may be used in the conversion process. 
     
      
    32 Put briefly, the Crown alleged that the appellant arranged for the despatch from China to him (under assumed names) of four packages containing the drug in vials. Each of the packages arrived in Australia, on the dates alleged on the indictment, and was intercepted by Australian Customs Services (“Customs”) officers. The third package, which arrived on 2 March 2006, was damaged and the vial was empty. (This gave rise to the charge of attempt.) In all, 30.5 kilograms of the drug was contained in the intercepted packages. So much was undisputed. The sole issue at the time was whether the Crown had proved, to the requisite standard, that it was the appellant who was responsible for the importations.  
     
      
    33 The Crown case was circumstantial.  
     
      
    34 The relevant facts and circumstances may be outlined as follows. (For completeness, I include reference to facts and circumstances that did not form part of the Crown case, but were relied upon by the appellant.) 
     
      
       
      (i) In early 2002 the appellant occupied a flat at 9/44 Letitia Street, Oatley. He shared the flat with Mr Stephen Wilson. In June 2002 the two men moved to another unit, at 507E Carillon Avenue, Newton. In his bedroom in this apartment the appellant had a fish tank with fish; 
       
       
      (ii) for a time in late 2004 and early 2005, the appellant was in a (homosexual) relationship with a man called Rick Dreske; 
       
       
      (iii) Mr Dreske lived with the appellant and Mr Wilson in the Newtown flat, sharing the appellant’s bedroom. He departed in late 2005. He retained a key to the unit, and had access to it. After moving out, he did not initially visit, but in early 2006 he began visiting approximately once or twice a fortnight; 
       
       
      (iv) Mr Dreske had been a user of GBL. He had a drug conviction in Western Australia in 2000 for possession of amphetamine and supply of the drug known as ecstasy. In respect of these offences he was fined a total of $2,000; 
       
       
      (v) on 27 February 2004 a private mailbox in a newsagency in King Street, Newtown was leased. The application for the lease nominated the lessee as Mr Matthew Davidson (the appellant) and gave an address of Level 18, 347 Kent Street, Sydney. This was the address of a finance company by which the appellant was employed between August 2002 and November 2004. By way of identification, driver’s licence number 14577887 was given. The appellant held a driver’s licence, the number of which was 14577 
      3 
      87. Licence number 14577887 belonged to a Mr John Anthony Callanan. Mr Callanan had never lived in Sydney, and did not lease that or any other mailbox; 
       
       
      (vi) the application also nominated a mobile telephone number. This was a telephone number that had been used by the appellant between February and November 2002;  
       
       
      (vii) in response to the application, post box number 11 was allocated. The mailing address to the box was 11/267 King Street, Newtown;  
       
       
      (viii) the evidence showed that the post box was initially leased for a 6 month period, expiring on 27 August 2004. There was no evidence either that the lease was terminated or that it was renewed. So far as there was any evidence, the records of the newsagency showed that a deposit of $15.00 for a key was paid. The ledger sheet that was in evidence does not show that the deposit was refunded (in respect of another leaseholder mentioned in the ledger, a refund is shown);  
       
       
      (ix) on 15 January 2006 a package, sent from China and addressed to “Bob Sinclair” at 11/267 King Street, Newtown, arrived at Sydney Airport. The carrier was Express Mail Service. The package contained 5.98 kilograms of GBL, with a purity of 98.5%. This was the subject of the first count on the indictment; 
       
       
      (x) on 3 February 2006 an application was made for the lease of a private mailbox in a Stanmore newsagency. (Stanmore is a suburb adjacent to Newtown.) The application named “Andrew Scott” as the applicant, and gave his address as 44 Letitia Street, Oatley (The application form shows that whoever completed the form initially wrote “Leticia”, then crossed that out and substituted “Letitia”.) It gave a contact number, mobile telephone number 0434 217 859. This was a number that had never been connected. The application also gave a driver’s licence number, 73564128. This was a licence which, according to Roads and Traffic Authority records, was held by a Troy B Sutherland of Inverell. Officers of the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) were unable to identify any Troy B Sutherland who had lived at Inverell;  
       
       
      (xi) post office box number 32 was allocated. The mailing address was 32/130 Percival Road, Stanmore;  
       
       
      (xii) on 4 February 2006 a telephone call was made to the Stanmore newsagency from the telephone landline allocated to the appellant; 
       
       
      (xiii) on 13 February 2006 a package sent from China and addressed to “Andrew Scott” at 32/130 Percival Road, Stanmore arrived at Sydney Airport. The carrier was Express Mail Service. The package contained 5.82 kilograms of GBL, with a purity of 96.2%. This was the subject of the second count on the indictment; 
       
       
      (xiv) on 28 February 2006 an application for international transfer of money (to an account in China) was made to the Commonwealth Bank, Newtown branch. The application named “Matthew Davidson” (the appellant) as “sender”, and gave his address as 507E Carillon Avenue, Newtown, and his mobile telephone number as 0417 249 235. This number was registered to a Mr Anthony Toussaint. Mr Toussaint denied ever having visited the Newtown branch of the Commonwealth Bank, or having transferred money to China; 
       
       
      (xv) the application form was shown to have on it fingerprints that could not be identified, but were not those of the appellant; 
       
       
      (xvi) an amount of USD800 was duly transferred; 
       
       
      (xvii) on 2 March 2006 a package sent from China and addressed to “Andrew Scott” at 32/130 Percival Road, Stanmore arrived at Sydney Airport. The carrier was DHL Worldwide Express (“DHL”). The package contained one broken and empty container. An invoice and a “Material Data Safety Sheet” indicated that the package had contained GBL. This gave rise to the third count on the indictment, of attempting to import the drug; 
       
       
      (xviii) on the same day (2 March 2006) three calls were made to DHL from the telephone landline held in the appellant’s name. These were at 10.16am, 10.35am and 11.09am; 
       
       
      (xix) at 1.51pm a call was made from the appellant’s mobile telephone to Mr Wilson. This call lasted three and a half minutes. At 1.54pm a call was made to DHL from the appellant’s mobile telephone. Three further calls were made from that telephone to DHL at 2.13pm, 2.19pm and 3.09pm;  
       
       
      (xx) two days later, on 4 March 2006 at 3.21pm, a call was made to DHL from the appellant’s telephone landline; 
       
       
      (xxi) on 5 March 2006, a package sent from China and addressed to “Andrew Scott” at 32/130 Percival Road, Stanmore arrived at Sydney Airport. The carrier was DHL. The package contained 18.7 kilograms of GBL with a purity of 97.2%. This gave rise to count 4 on the indictment; 
       
       
      (xxii) at 11.00am on that day a call was made to DHL from the appellant’s telephone landline; 
       
       
      (xxiii) the following day, 6 March 2006, at 12.05pm, a call was made to DHL from the appellant’s telephone landline. Three calls were made to Customs from the same landline, at 12.09pm, 12.17pm and 3.23pm. In the second and third calls the caller identified himself as “Andrew Scott”. In the 12.17pm call, the caller said that he was inquiring about a particular consignment, which he identified by consignment number. This was the consignment number of the package that had arrived on 5 March 2006. The caller gave an e-mail address, that included the name “bobsinclair” and an address of 32/130 Percival Road, Stanmore; 
       
       
      (xxiv) on 7 March 2006 at 12.05pm, 12.06pm, 12.07pm and 2.50pm respectively, four calls were made to Customs from the appellant’s telephone landline. The caller identified himself as “Andrew Scott”, referred to the previous call of 6 March 2006, and stated that he was inquiring about a DHL shipment; 
       
       
      (xxv) on 8 March 2006 a call was made to DHL from the appellant’s telephone landline; 
       
       
      (xxvi) on 13 March 2006 officers of the AFP executed a search warrant on the Newtown unit. In a bedside cabinet in the appellant’s bedroom was a scrap of paper on which was written the address “32/130 Percival Road, Stanmore”. Three fingerprints of the appellant were identified on this scrap of paper. Another fingerprint that could not be identified was also found on it; 
       
       
      (xxvii) also located in the appellant’s bedroom were four vials, two of which contained GBL, and two of which contained GHB, and a pH testing kit;  
       
       
      (xxviii) the appellant was arrested that day. Following his arrest, further inquiries were made by police;  
       
       
      (xxix) Ms Rong Fang and Mr Jian Shi were the owners of the Percival Road, Stanmore newsagency where the mailbox was leased in the name of Andrew Scott. Ms Fang had seen the man who arranged the lease and identified himself as Andrew Scott. She was asked to take part in an identification procedure and agreed to do so. Mr Shi had also seen the man and also agreed to take part in such a procedure; 
       
       
      (xxx) the appellant was invited, but declined, to participate in a line up procedure. Accordingly, as an alternative, a photoboard procedure was used. This involved the compilation of a board depicting at least twelve individuals. It ordinarily but not necessarily includes a photo of any person suspected. This was the procedure in which Ms Fang and Mr Shi were invited to participate, in order to identify, if they could, the person who leased the mailbox. Ms Fang and Mr Shi were shown different photoboards, each of which included a photograph of the appellant. Both Ms Fang and Mr Shi nominated a photograph as representing the person who had leased the mailbox. In neither case was that the photograph of the appellant. (Although Mr Shi and Ms Fang took part in the procedure separately, as it happened, each nominated the same photograph. It was accepted that they were in error in doing so); 
       
       
      (xxxi) at a later stage (January 2007) officers of the AFP made inquiries in order to locate Mr Dreske. Federal Agent Winchester, the officer in charge of the investigation, learned of Mr Dreske’s association with the appellant, and with the Newtown unit, from Mr Stephen Wilson. He had a conversation with Mr Dreske on 17 January. Mr Dreske said that he did not wish to make a statement, and did not wish to be involved in the matter. Sometime later unsuccessful attempts were made to serve a subpoena upon him. Further attempts were made to find him, on the eve of the trial, but these also were unsuccessful. On 4 September he was spoken to by police by telephone but declined to give an address and declined to be involved. 
       
       
      The defence case 
       
      
    35 The defence case, put initially by way of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, was that the appellant was not responsible for the importation. In his opening to the jury, defence counsel made it clear – explicitly – that the appellant’s position was that the importer of the drugs was Mr Dreske. The tenor of the cross-examination was to establish that Mr Dreske had the opportunity to do all that was done in relation to the importations, that he had a history of drug use (including GBL) and that the prosecution was not able to exclude him as the importer. 
     
      
    36 The appellant did not give evidence. He called four witnesses. 
     
      
    37 Mr Elki Sanchez was a friend (or acquaintance) of the appellant, and had known and had become a friend of Mr Dreske during the course of his relationship with the appellant. 
     
      
    38 Mr Sanchez recounted an incident that had occurred during a group holiday at Airlie Beach in June 2005. Mr Dreske had consumed a substance that he told Mr Sanchez was a “G” (a short name for GBL), following which his behaviour changed. He became more energetic. (There was other evidence that this was one of the effects of consumption of GBL.) 
     
      
    39 Mr Sanchez said that later that same year he had a conversation with Mr Dreske at the Newtown unit, and that Mr Dreske told him he was using GBL on a daily basis. In response to a question from Mr Sanchez, Mr Dreske said that it was coming from China, that it was a drug that could, for some purposes, be used legally, and that it could be ordered “to a company”, in which case “it should be fine”. 
     
      
    40 Evidence was also given by the appellant’s uncle, Mr Lloyd Parslow, and his mother, Ms Duane Grunzke. Both of these witnesses attested to the appellant’s use of a pH testing kit to keep his fish in good condition. 
     
      
    41 Mr Parslow also spoke of the appellant’s character (he has no criminal history), and gave evidence that the appellant had a habit of leaving his mobile telephone lying around. 
     
      
    42 While they were waiting to give their evidence, Ms Fang and Mr Shi were (separately) approached by the solicitor acting for the appellant. He showed them photographs of Mr Dreske. Each identified Mr Dreske as “Andrew Scott”, the person who had taken the lease of the Stanmore mailbox. Mr Shi said that that photograph was a photograph of the same person as he had identified on the photoboard. (That person was not Mr Dreske. Mr Dreske was not a suspect at the time of the photoboard procedure, and his photograph was not included in either photoboard.) 
     
      
       
      It is plain that in this respect Mr Shi was mistaken. 
       
      
    43 It was accepted by senior counsel for the appellant that the process of identification attempted at court on behalf of the appellant was flawed, and could have little weight in establishing that Mr Dreske was (or might have been) the person who took the lease on the mailbox. 
     
      
    44 It is convenient, in this account of the relevant facts and circumstances, to note some “negative facts”. Except for the fourth of these, all were relied on on behalf of the appellant as casting doubt on the inference sought to be drawn by the Crown.  
     
      
    45 Firstly, although two fingerprints were located on the application for international money transfer, they were not those of the appellant, and could not be identified. No fingerprints of the appellant were identified on that document. 
     
      
    46 Secondly, no documents of any kind were found in the search of the Newtown unit to indicate any involvement in the transfer of money, contact with or knowledge of, DHL, or Customs, or anything associated with importation of goods. 
     
      
    47 Thirdly, although the pH testing kit was found, and this is an item sometimes used in association with the conversion of GBL to GHB, a conversion agent, such as caustic soda, is necessary, and no such substance was found. I have already observed that an innocent explanation for the presence of the pH testing kit was advanced. 
     
      
    48 Fourthly, the unidentified fingerprints on the scrap of paper, and on the international money transfer form, were examined on a national database, and yielded no result. This was significant, because Mr Dreske had a conviction in Western Australia and it would be expected that, in the ordinary course, his fingerprints would have been there recorded. It could be reasonably inferred, therefore, that the fingerprints were not his. 
     
      
    49 One further observation may be made. There was virtually no dispute about the facts sought to be proved by the Crown. There was no direct evidence linking the appellant to either of the mailboxes, to the money transfer form, or to the telephone calls. The Crown case depended entirely upon the inferences that could be drawn from largely undisputed facts. 
     
      
    50 In the absence of any denial by the appellant, the defence case depended firstly, on challenging the adequacy of the facts and circumstances to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was responsible for the importations, and, more particularly, to raise as a reasonable possibility that Mr Dreske was the person responsible – and the only person responsible, or, at least, the person responsible to the exclusion of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    51 The appellant has pleaded three grounds of appeal against the convictions. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The trial judge erred by failing to direct the jury that crucial or indispensable intermediate facts had to be established beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to lead evidence of traces of GBL drugs found in the appellant’s bedroom.” 
        
       
      
    52 In respect of sentence, he pleads that the sentence (in total) is manifestly excessive and a different, less severe, sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Unreasonable verdict? 
       
      
    53 In essence, the argument put on behalf of the appellant was that the Crown had not excluded the possibility that Mr Dreske was the person who had imported the drug.  
     
      
    54 The test in determining this ground of appeal is not in doubt: see M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487. It is whether, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. In answering that question the court must give appropriate weight to the advantage the jury has had in seeing and hearing the witnesses. (In a case such as this where there is little disputed evidence, the significance of that circumstance is limited.) The court must make its own assessment of the evidence; if it concludes that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, it is bound to act to set aside the guilty verdict. In my opinion, where a conviction depends upon inferences drawn from undisputed facts, the role of the appellate court in making its own assessment of the facts becomes considerably more significant. The perceived advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses recedes somewhat. 
     
      
    55 The question is whether a reasonable jury, on the facts outlined, could have returned a verdict of guilty; or, more specifically, in this case, whether a reasonable jury could have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference was that the appellant (and not Mr Dreske, or some other person) was responsible for the importation: see Knight v The Queen [1992] HCA 56; 175 CLR 495. In this case, application of the M test requires the subsidiary question whether the jury could reasonably have rejected as a rational inference the possibility that Mr Dreske was the importer. If there remained open that reasonable possibility, then it was not open to the jury to convict the appellant.  
     
      
    56 On behalf of the appellant it was argued that:  
     
      
       
        Mr Dreske had (apparently unfettered) access to the Newtown unit, to the appellant’s landline and mobile telephones, and to his bedroom. This could explain the telephone calls, the presence of GBL and GHB in the bedroom, and the scrap of paper bearing the mailbox address and the appellant’s fingerprints; 
       
       
        Mr Dreske had a history of use of GBL; 
       
       
        Mr Dreske had disclosed (to Mr Sanchez) an awareness of a means of importing GBL from China; 
       
       
        the evidence linking the appellant to the Stanmore mailbox was “tenuous”, particularly in light of the mistaken identification evidence by Mr Shi and Ms Fang; 
       
       
        the spelling error in “Letitia” as originally written on the application form for the Stanmore mailbox suggested that the application form was completed by a person unfamiliar with the spelling of the name of that street; the appellant, having lived there, had the appropriate familiarity and was unlikely to have made such a mistake; 
       
       
        little weight could be attributed to the appellant’s fingerprints on the piece of paper bearing the address of the Stanmore mailbox. The evidence did not establish when the fingerprints were placed there, and they may have been there before the address was written on it; 
       
       
        the pH testing kit was explained by the fact that the appellant kept fish in an aquarium in his bedroom. There was no caustic soda or other agent that would facilitate the conversion; 
       
       
        Mr Dreske had access to information about the appellant and his affairs that would have enabled him to have leased the Stanmore mailbox and transferred the money to China; 
       
       
        there was no evidence of the source of the USD800 transferred to China, in particular, none showing that it had come from any account operated by the appellant. 
       
      
    57 On behalf of the Crown, however, a number of competing submissions were made. It was, for example, pointed out that Mr Sanchez’s evidence was that, from 2006, Mr Dreske visited the Newtown unit, but only once or twice a fortnight. There was no evidence to suggest more regular visits, and none to suggest that he had entered the unit when the appellant was not present. 
     
      
    58 The most damning point made by the Crown, in my opinion, concerned the evidence of the multitude of telephone calls, each made from the appellant’s landline or mobile telephone, and each to an organisation (either DHL or Customs) which could have had information about the consignment of the packages. 
     
      
    59 Most damning of all is the evidence of the telephone calls of 2 March, made from the appellant’s mobile telephone. At 1.51pm there was a call to Mr Wilson. Mr Wilson’s evidence was that he thought he had never spoken to Mr Dreske by telephone. This telephone call lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Thirty seconds later there was a telephone call to DHL. It is, as the Crown submits, inherently incredible that the appellant used the telephone for the 1.51pm call to Mr Wilson, and another person, unbeknownst to him, made the 1.54pm call. 
     
      
    60 To these may be added the following:- 
     
      
       
        the use (on the application for the lease, of the Newtown mailbox) of the appellant’s name; 
       
       
        the use (on the same application) of an address that was then the appellant’s workplace; 
       
       
        the use (on the same application) of a telephone number that had previously been used by the appellant; 
       
       
        the use (on the same application) of a driver’s licence number that varied from that held by the appellant by only one digit; 
       
       
        the use (on the application for the lease of the Stanmore mailbox) of an address (Letitia Street, Oatley) at which the appellant had previously lived; 
       
       
        the use (on the application for money transfer) of the appellant’s name; 
       
       
        the presence in the appellant’s bedroom of a piece of paper bearing both the address of the Stanmore mailbox, and the appellant’s fingerprints; 
       
       
        the presence, in the appellant’s bedroom, of vials containing GBL and GHB. 
       
      
    61 Of course, some of these items of evidence may take on a different, and innocent, colour in the light of other evidence. The presence of the pH kit is a good example. But the task of the jury in a circumstantial case (and the task of this Court) is not to deconstruct each item of evidence and take it in isolation; it is to examine the whole of the evidence (including evidence elicited in cross-examination, and evidence adduced in the defence case) and to determine whether it proves the guilt of the accused person. Individual items of evidence, on their own inadequate to found a conviction, may take strength from other items. 
     
      
    62 The facts and circumstances I have set out above present, in my opinion, an overwhelming case that the appellant was the person who made the arrangements for the importations. It is true, as was suggested on behalf of the appellant, that, taken in isolation, various of those facts and circumstances could lack persuasiveness; for example, the fingerprints on the piece of paper, alone, would be insufficient to establish a connection between the appellant and the importations. And the application for transfer of money internationally, although, on its face, linked to the appellant (because of the use of his name), might lose strength in the light of Mr Dreske’s presumed knowledge of the appellant’s affairs. 
     
      
    63 However, when dealing with a circumstantial case, it is inappropriate to take each of the facts and circumstances in isolation. All of these facts and circumstances point inexorably to the appellant’s guilt. 64 I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to find that the Crown had proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant was guilty of the offences. Making my own assessment of the evidence, and the inferences that ought to be drawn therefrom, I am satisfied that there is no likelihood (or possibility) that an innocent person has been convicted. I would reject ground 1 of the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Directions 
       
      
    65 At the conclusion of the evidence and immediately before counsel’s addresses, senior counsel for the appellant sought a direction that, in order to convict, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that certain “crucial or indispensable intermediate facts” had been proved. 
     
      
    66 This was drawn from the decision of the High Court in Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573. There, correcting a misapprehension about the proper interpretation of Chamberlain v The Queen [No. 2] [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521, Dawson J with whom Mason CJ and Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … it may sometimes be necessary or desirable to identify those intermediate facts which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. Not every possible intermediate conclusion of fact will be of that character. If it is appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable it may well be appropriate to tell the jury that the fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn. But where … the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Whether it is desirable for a trial judge to identify an intermediate conclusion of fact in his charge to the jury in order to instruct them that it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt will depend upon the particular case. Such an instruction will only be possible where the conclusion is a necessary link in a chain of reasoning. Even then, particularly when that is obvious, the instruction may not be helpful.” 
        
       
      
    67 Senior counsel identified as “indispensable facts” of the character referred to by Dawson J, and calling for such a direction, as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) That it was the appellant who made the telephone calls to the courier company, the customs service and the news agency; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) That it was the appellant who opened the postal box at Stanmore; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) That it was the appellant who sent the money to China.” 
        
       
      
    68 The oral submission made by senior counsel at the trial sought “a Chamberlain Direction”. He provided a draft direction of the kind proposed that was marked for identification number 10. Under the heading “Chamberlain” senior counsel proposed a direction as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Crown must exclude every reasonable rational hypothesis/ inference/ conclusion consistent with innocence.” 
        
       
       
      Under the heading “Intermediate facts”, senior counsel, cited  
      Shepherd 
       and  
      R v 
        
      Merrit  
      [1999] NSWCCA 29. Inter alia, he proposed that the jury be directed: 
       
       
        
        “ … some facts may be essential to a process of reasoning towards being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused (sic) guilt. Such a fact is sometimes known as an intermediate fact … if there is an intermediate fact that is essential to a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that fact must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.”  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [The Crown] seeks to establish three circumstances from which it asks you to conclude that the accused (Mr Davidson) is the importer …” 
        
       
       
      The document then identified the facts I have set out above.  
       
      
    69 After hearing argument the judge declined to give a direction in the terms sought. 
     
      
    70 On the appeal senior counsel took a slightly different direction. He invoked the decision of this Court in Merritt, a joint judgment of Wood CJ at CL, James and Adams JJ. There the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ultimately, of course, it is for the trial judge to determine whether to give directions that relate the standard of proof to what are, or might be intermediate facts ‘which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilty’ … it is important in this regard, we think, to appreciate that the trial judge should, in considering this question, ask whether  
        the jury 
         might reasonably regard certain facts as intermediate facts even if, as it happened, his Honour did not regard any of the facts in that light … in our opinion, where one or more facts might reasonably be regarded as intermediate facts, it will usually be essential for the trial judge to identify those facts and instruct the jury that  
        if the jury considered that such facts were indispensable  
        links in their chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt, they would need to be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt before convicting.”  
        
       
       
        
        “ … we think that it was both desirable and necessary that his Honour should have identified for the jury the crucial factual issues and assisted them to apply to them the legal rule requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt of the Crown case and, in particular, directed them that if  
        they 
         regarded any particular fact as being an indispensable link in the chain of proof, then that fact must be proved to their satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict.” (italics in original; bold added) 
        
       
      
    71 It will be observed that the judgment in Shepherd proceeds on the basis that it is the judge who decides whether an “intermediate fact” is of an “indispensable character” such as to warrant or require a direction of the kind sought. In Merritt it is proposed that the decision of what fact or facts are “indispensable” can be left to the jury (although the judgment also recognises that a judge might in appropriate circumstances, identify these facts). 
     
      
    72 In my opinion, this was not a case in which the jury ought to have been left to determine for itself which fact or facts was or were indispensable to their reasoning. To the extent that the ground of appeal raises Merritt (which it does only obliquely) I would reject it. 
     
      
    73 The ground of appeal, as framed, is focused upon a direction in accordance with Shepherd, and the facts said to be “indispensable” are clearly identified. 
     
      
    74 Whether a fact on which the Crown relies as part of a circumstantial case is or is not “indispensable” may be tested by asking whether, in the absence of evidence of that fact, there would nonetheless be a case to go to the jury. If the answer is in the affirmative, even if the Crown case is weakened, even considerably, the fact is not “indispensable”. Where the answer is in the negative, the fact is “indispensable” and the jury should be directed accordingly.  
     
      
    75 I do not accept that any of the proposed facts was “indispensable” within the reasoning of Shepherd. Certainly, the telephone call evidence was very powerful, especially that of 2 March to which I have referred to above. But that does not make it “indispensable” and, even without that evidence, there was still a case that incriminated the appellant. 
     
      
    76 Nor do I accept that the fact that it was the appellant who leased the postal box at Stanmore was an “indispensable” fact; conceivably, the postal box may have been leased by Mr Dreske, or some other person, and used by the appellant. But if the jury was satisfied that it was the appellant who leased the postal box (even if not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt) then that fact was capable of going into the mix and supporting the other evidence in the Crown case. 
     
      
    77 Similarly, I do not accept that the fact that it was the appellant who sent the money to China was “indispensable” in the sense I have outlined.  
     
      
    78 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: Evidence of GBL and GHB 
       
      
    79 Finally, it was asserted that the judge erred in permitting the Crown to lead the evidence of traces of GBL and GHB drugs found in the appellant’s bedroom.  
     
      
    80 Initially, it was submitted that this evidence was tendered as tendency or coincidence evidence within the meaning of ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act 1995, and that the judge failed, before admitting it, to apply the appropriate tests. 
     
      
    81 However, during the course of argument senior counsel abandoned that submission and relied instead upon s 137 of the Evidence Act, which obliges a court in a criminal proceeding to refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 
     
      
    82 In my opinion the presence of GBL and GHB in the appellant’s bedroom was an important circumstance relevant to the Crown case. True it is that, since none of the drugs the subject of the charges had found their way to the appellant, that evidence was capable of establishing and did establish criminality on another occasion. It did not prove the appellant’s importation of the suspect drugs. However, it also was capable of establishing that the appellant had an interest in having the drug and a willingness to have it in his possession. These were relevant circumstances. In my opinion the probative value was high and was not outweighed by any unfair prejudice.  
     
      
    83 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    84 I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Sentence 
       
      
    85 On sentence, Mr Parslow and Ms Grunzke again gave evidence, as did Mr Clinton Davidson, the appellant’s brother, and a friend, Richard Scenna. Also in evidence were a Pre-Sentence Report, and an expert report prepared by Professor Louisa Degenhardt, a Professor of epidemiology at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of NSW, who has expertise in the use of, and harms related to, illicit drugs in Australia. From all of this material the following concerning the appellant’s personal circumstances emerge. 
     
      
    86 The appellant was born in September 1982. He was twenty-four years of age at the time of the offences. As was mentioned in the trial, he had no prior criminal history. He is the third of three brothers, considerably younger (by 13 years) than his next brother. The family was close, united, stable and supportive. His parents were committed Christians. He grew up in a small rural community in Queensland. 
     
      
    87 When he was 13, his parents separated and the appellant opted to live with his father, with whom he had a close relationship, in Brisbane. He was able to maintain a close connection with his mother and brothers. 
     
      
    88 At an early age, the appellant exhibited considerable talent as a tennis player, and attended a school that encouraged him to develop this skill. By about the age of 17 he represented Queensland in national championships, and shortly after was awarded a tennis scholarship to attend a State University in Mississippi, USA. There he remained for about eighteen months. He returned to Australia and abandoned competitive tennis. 
     
      
    89 In notes prepared for the sentencing hearing, and that became part of the evidence, Ms Grunzke told of the appellant’s work with disadvantaged children, foster children from drug related homes. 
     
      
    90 On his return to Australia the appellant gained employment in the finance industry. Clinton Davidson, his brother, operates his own mortgage broking business, and, with his help, the appellant set up a similar enterprise of his own. 
     
      
    91 At about the age of 23, the appellant began his relationship with Mr Dreske. This was of concern to his mother, because she was aware that Mr Dreske used drugs. 
     
      
    92 The report of Professor Degenhardt went to different issues and canvassed matters concerning the drug GBL, which was described (accurately, so far as I am aware) by senior counsel for the appellant as “a relative newcomer on the Australian scene”. Perhaps the most important part of the report, at the time of the sentence proceedings, was Professor Degenhardt’s assessment of the harmfulness of GBL relative to other, more familiar, drugs. Although Professor Degenhardt was cautious in her assessment, the report might be taken as suggesting that GBL is less harmful than, for example, heroin. 
     
      
    93 However, this evidence was adduced before the decision of the High Court in Adams v The Queen [2008] HCA 15; 234 CLR 143, and it was conceded on behalf of the appellant that the weight that can be given to that report is significantly reduced. 
     
      
    94 In his Remarks on Sentence Nield DCJ made the necessary findings of fact, based upon the evidence in the trial. No challenge was made to any of those findings. His Honour also recounted the relevant personal circumstances, and, again, no challenge is made to his approach in this respect. 
     
      
    95 The sole ground of the application for leave to appeal against sentence is that, in total, the sentences are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    96 It was pointed out that, while the importation of GBL was plainly an offence against Commonwealth law, at the time of these offences, GBL was not a drug recognised in or proscribed by NSW drug law; and that, in some comparable jurisdictions (eg Canada) it is not prohibited. It has legal uses even in Australia. 
     
      
    97 It is true that GBL is not a drug with which the courts of NSW have acquired great familiarity. Two precedents only were provided to this Court. One was R v Califano [2002] SASC 320. 
     
      
    98 That case involved a Crown appeal against the asserted inadequacy of a sentence. The respondent had been released on a conditional discharge under s 19B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), with a 1 year bond, and no conviction recorded. 
     
      
    99 The respondent pleaded guilty to the offence. The court accepted that he had imported it for his own use in “body building”, had done so openly and unaware of the illegality of importing the drug into Australia. He had received the drug from Canada. The report does not disclose the quantity there imported, but he did purchase it for the sum of $300. 
     
      
    100 Like the appellant, Califano had no prior convictions, and was a relatively young man. 
     
      
    101 In those circumstances the Court refused to grant leave to the prosecution to appeal. 
     
      
    102 Notwithstanding that, the Court described the sentence as one which “may seem surprisingly light” and “very moderate”. Ultimately, Doyle CJ, with whose reasons Wicks and Besanka JJ agreed, held that the sentence was lower than it ought to have been, but not in such a way as to justify a grant of leave to the Crown to appeal. 
     
      
    103 In R v Corbett [2008] NSWCCA 42 this Court dismissed a Crown appeal against the imposition of a community service order for two offences of importing a total of about 4 kilograms of GBL. 
     
      
    104 The court held that the sentence imposed was (manifestly) inadequate, but declined, in the exercise of discretion, to intervene. 
     
      
    105 What the appellant has to confront, and this Court has to deal with, is: 
     
      
       
      (i) the appellant committed these offences on four separate occasions, although relatively close in time; and 
       
       
      (ii) the quantity of the drug imported was more than 30 kilograms, with an attempt to import another 19 kilograms. A commercial quantity of GBL is 1.00 kilogram. 
       
      
    106 These circumstances take his offences into a category far removed from those that appear from the reports of Califano or Corbett. 
     
      
    107 No specific error was sought to be attributed to the approach taken by the sentencing judge. I can detect none. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    108 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
       
      (ii) leave to appeal against sentence granted, but the appeal dismissed.

      JUDGMENT (No. 14) (On objection to provision to jury during Crown closing address of list of references to topics in record of interview - see T896) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: The Crown has foreshadowed provision to the jury, during the Crown closing address, of a list of references by topic to the record of interview of each Accused (MFI57). Objection is taken by Mr Molomby SC, for Manju Sam, to the provision of this list to the jury. No objection is made by Ms Davenport SC, for Thomas Sam, in this respect. 
     
      
    2 Following submissions on this issue on 28 May 2009 (T877-880), I ruled that the Crown would be permitted to provide such a list to the jury concerning each Accused. These are my reasons for that ruling.  
     
      
    3 On 9 May 2002, the Accused, Thomas Sam, took part in an electronically recorded interview with police concerning the death of the baby, Gloria, on the previous day. An edited version of that interview is in evidence (Exhibit N) together with a transcript of the edited interview (Exhibit O). On 9 May 2002, the Accused, Manju Sam, took part in a recorded interview with police, an edited version of which is in evidence (Exhibit P) together with a transcript of the edited interview (Exhibit Q). 
     
      
    4 The transcript of the interview with Manju Sam extends to 181 pages and contains 1,268 questions and answers. The transcript relating to Thomas Sam is 189 pages in length and contains 2,045 questions and answers. 
     
      
    5 In the case of Manju Sam, there is both a video and audio recording of the interview. In the case of Thomas Sam, there is only an audio recording given technical difficulties relating to video recording. 
     
      
    6 The document which is subject to the present objection contains, with respect to Manju Sam, seven categories of questions with cross-references to the numbered answers in the interview which relate to that topic. The seven topics are: 
     
      
       
      (a) Gloria’s condition (eczema, weight loss, developmental delay) had been long standing; 
       
       
      (b) she believed that Gloria’s weight loss and developmental delay was as a result of the eczema; 
       
       
      (c) Gloria’s condition in India up until Thomas Sam’s arrival; 
       
       
      (d) Gloria’s condition during the last three weeks in India; 
       
       
      (e) Gloria’s skin condition prior to her admission to hospital; 
       
       
      (f) Gloria’s condition during the last eight days in Australia before her admission to hospital; 
       
       
      (g) her observations of Gloria over the last few days. 
       
      
    7 Mr Molomby SC submits that it would be prejudicial to his client to place this document in the hands of the jury, as it will serve to emphasise aspects of the Crown case which are said to be adverse to the Accused in a documentary form which will remain with the jury. Although acknowledging that the Crown could simply read out each of these topics, at the same time providing the jury with the references to numbered answers in the record of interview, Mr Molomby SC submits that the provision of the document itself is prejudicial and gives undue emphasis to these matters in this form and ought not be permitted. 
     
      
    8 The Crown submits that the provision of such a document to the jury is consistent with the contemporary approach which emphasises assisting the jury in its function, including the provision of documents which serve that purpose. The Crown submits that it would be open to the defence to provide an equivalent document with references to parts of the record of interview to which reference was to be made in the defence closing address. The Crown submits that there is no prejudice to the Accused in the provision of this document. The Crown points to s.48(1)(e)(ii) Evidence Act 1995 which permits the tender of a document that summarises another document or other documents. 
     
      
    9 It has been said that a criminal trial in Australia is essentially an oral process: Gately v The Queen [2007] 232 CLR 208 at 235 [88]. Nevertheless, the Courts have recognised the assistance which a jury may derive from the provision of appropriate summary documents, including charts and chronologies: Smith v The Queen (1970) 121 CLR 572 at 577; Butera v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) [1987] 164 CLR 180 at 190; R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 34) [2007] NSWSC 1462 at [64]. Where objection has been taken to the provision of a chronology to a jury upon the basis that it is likely to be selective and thus prejudicial, it has been observed that it is important not to underestimate the intelligence and commonsense of juries in assessing whether such material is likely to have an undue or inappropriate impact upon the jury’s thought processes: R v Collins (1986) 44 SASR 214 at 249; R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 34) at [65], [73].  
     
      
    10 The question whether the Crown is permitted to provide the list of topics to the jury is a discretionary matter for the trial Judge. I do not think s.48(1)(e)(ii) Evidence Act 1995 bears upon the question as the issue is not one of admissibility of a summary document in place of the primary document. Rather, the question is whether the Crown ought be permitted to provide the list to the jury as an aide memoire for the purpose of closing submissions. 
     
      
    11 As the recital of topics set out at [6] above demonstrates, the Crown document is expressed in balanced terms. It would be open to the Crown, during the closing address, to invite the jury to write down each of these seven topics and the various cross-references to answers in the record of interview. That process would take some time and may involve the risk of error on the part of jurors.  
     
      
    12 The provision of the Crown document will assist the jury in following the address, without possible distraction to take notes. The document will assist the jury as an aide memoire for later consideration in the jury room, when the recorded interview itself is being considered. There is no unfairness to the Accused arising from the provision of this document. In principle, it is open to the Accused to prepare a similar document referring to parts of the interview to which the jury is to be taken during the defence closing address. Subject to any particular area of objection, such a step may assist the jury in following the defence address in the same way as the Crown document will assist the jury in following the Crown address. 
     
      
    13 I bear in mind as well the length of the recorded interview with Manju Sam, and the particular assistance which the jury will receive from grouping of references in an extended interview which contains a large number of questions and answers. 
     
      
    14 I am satisfied that the Crown document will assist the jury in its deliberations, and that the jury would utilise it in an intelligent and commonsense way. I am conscious of the responsibility of the trial Judge to exercise discretion to ensure that such a document does not give rise to unfairness to the Accused: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 34) at [73]. I am satisfied that the provision of this document to the jury will not operate in a manner which is unfair to the Accused. 
     
      
    15 It was for these reasons that I ruled that the Crown ought be permitted to provide this document to the jury during the Crown closing address.

    3 PRICE J: The applicant, Tomu Baleiovalau, seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him by Tupman DCJ in the District Court at Penrith on 30 August 2007. He had pleaded guilty in the District Court on 24 January 2007 to three counts on an indictment which were as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 
      : On 25 February 2005 at Hurstville … when in company with Semisi Kinikini and two other unknown men did rob … of the sum of approximately $40,005, the property of [the] Qantas Staff Credit Union Limited in circumstances of aggravation, namely when armed with a dangerous weapon, being a shortened rifle ( 
      the Hurstville robbery 
      ). This was an offence contrary to s 97(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 which is punishable by a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  
       
       
      Count 2 
      : On 12 April 2005 at Arncliffe ... whilst in company with Semisi Kinikini, Iorangi Pera and Joseph Lesi did rob … of one Holden Commodore motor car registered number HFV-57A and one unregistered Holden Commodore motor car the property of Parkside Automobiles Pty Limited in circumstances of aggravation, namely when armed with a dangerous weapon, being a shortened 12-gauge self-loading shotgun ( 
      the 
        
      Parkside robbery 
      ). This was also an offence contrary to s 97(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      . 
       
       
      Count 3 
      : Between 10 and 13 April 2005 at Sydney … did conspire with Semisi Kinikini, Iorangi Pera and Joseph Lesi to commit a robbery in company on the Qantas Staff Credit Union at Hurstville while armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a shortened 12-gauge self-loading shotgun ( 
      the conspiracy 
      ). As this was an offence of conspiracy, the maximum penalty for the substantive offence of aggravated armed robbery contrary to s 97(2) of 25 years imprisonment was the relevant yardstick:  
      The Queen v Hoar 
       (1981) 148 CLR 32 at 39.  
       
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1  
      ( 
      the Hurstville robbery 
      ): Imprisonment for a term of 6 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2006 and expiring on 11 October 2012 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2006 and expiring on 11 October 2010. 
       
       
      Count 2  
      ( 
      the Parkside robbery 
      ): Imprisonment for a term of 6 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2010 and concluding on 11 October 2016 with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2010 and expiring on 11 October 2013.  
       
       
      Count 3  
      ( 
      the conspiracy 
      ): Imprisonment for a term of 5 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2008 and concluding on 11 October 2013 with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2008 and expiring on 11 October 2011.  
       
      
    5 As a result of partial accumulation and concurrence the total effective sentence imposed by the Judge was 10 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2006 and expiring on 11 October 2016 with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months commencing on 12 April 2006 and expiring on 11 October 2013. The earliest date the applicant is eligible to be released to parole is 11 October 2013.  
     
      
    6 The Judge had reduced the sentence by 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    7 The Notice of Appeal identifies two grounds, namely:  
     
      
       
        
        1. Her Honour failed to have proper regard to the principles of parity when sentencing the applicant. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Her Honour failed to have proper regard to the principle of totality when sentencing the applicant.  
        
       
      
    8 The applicant was sentenced at the same time as Semisi Kinikini (Kinikini) and Joseph Lesi (Lesi). As the parity argument advanced in the first ground of appeal relates to the sentences imposed on Kinikini who was a co-offender with the applicant in each of the three counts it is convenient to detail the sentences imposed upon him by the Judge. Kinikini had entered pleas of guilty for which a 20 per cent utilitarian discount was allowed. Kinikini was sentenced as follows:  
     
      
       
      Count 1  
      ( 
      the Hurstville robbery 
      ): Imprisonment for a term of 6 years 6 months commencing on 12 January 2006 and expiring on 11 July 2012 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 12 January 2006 and expiring on 11 July 2010.  
      
     
     
      
      Count 2 
       ( 
      the Parkside robbery 
      ): Imprisonment for a term of 8 years commencing on 12 January 2009 and expiring on 11 January 2017 with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 12 January 2009 and expiring on 11 January 2014.  
       
       
      The Judge was asked to take into account on a Form 1 when sentencing Kinikini for count 2 an offence of aggravated armed robbery contrary to s 97(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       which had been committed at the Rosehill Hotel ( 
      the Rosehill robbery 
      ).  
      The 
        
      Rosehill robbery 
       had been committed by Kinikini with two other men on 7 April 2005. The applicant was not charged with this offence.  
       
       
      Count 3 
       ( 
      the conspiracy 
      ): Imprisonment for a term of 5 years 6 months commencing on 12 January 2008 and expiring on 11 July 2013 with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing on 12 January 2008 and expiring on 11 July 2011.  
       
      
    9 As a result of partial accumulation and concurrence the total effective sentence imposed on Kinikini was 11 years commencing on 12 January 2006 and expiring on 11 January 2017 with a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 12 January 2006 and expiring on 11 January 2014. The earliest date Kinikini is eligible to be released to parole is 11 January 2014.  
     
      
       
      FACTS  
       
      
    10 The facts of the offences were not in dispute and an agreed statement of facts was tendered. The facts found by the Judge for the Hurstville robbery (count 1) were as follows (ROS at 6-7):  
     
      
       
        
        “ I will deal first of all with the offence jointly committed by Mr Baleiovalau and Mr Kinikini on 25 February 2005. At about 3.50pm on that day three men crossed the road heading towards the Qantas Staff Credit Union in Hurstville. They were all disguised, wearing scarves and caps and also gloves. A fourth man remained outside in the car. Seeing this, staff inside the credit union locked the doors, some or all of the three offenders smashed the glass window near the teller’s area with a sledgehammer, two to them went inside and one remained in the foyer. That person was armed with a sawn-off .22 rifle. Some members of the public saw him and tried to take a photo. He chased them, forced them to lay on the ground in the foyer and threatened them while still holding the rifle.  
        
       
       
        
        There were at least seven staff members inside the bank area. They had retreated to the office area at the approach of the offenders. The three offenders went inside the bank and started smashing drawers, then the third offender went back outside and patrolled the foyer area whilst armed with a shotgun. The other two emptied the cash drawers into bags they had with them. They left quickly through the hole they had smashed in the glass with the sledgehammer. During these events the third offender threatened a staff member who had come from another part of the credit union. In all, the offenders took the sum of $40,005 in cash from the drawers. They were inside the bank for a short period only. They escaped in the black car driven by the fourth man, which was a car which had previously been stolen.”  
        
       
      
    11 The Judge found that although the actual role played by the applicant and Kinikini could not be discerned, they were part of the joint criminal enterprise and were equally liable. None of the stolen money was recovered.  
     
      
    12 The facts found by the Judge for the Parkside robbery (count 2) were as follows (ROS at 15-16):  
     
      
       
        
        Three of them then walked to Parkside Automobiles… Mr Lesi was carrying a shotgun sticking out the back of his jumper and [the applicant] had changed clothes which had been observed during earlier surveillance. Mr Kinikini was waiting with the car but I accept that this was because he had an injured leg at the time. The Crown alleges that the third man who went to Parkside Automobiles was Mr [P]. Mr Lesi and [the applicant] confronted the nineteen year-old James Anastasakis who worked in the car yard with his father and brother who was aged twenty-one. His father owned the car yard. Mr Lesi pulled out the shotgun and pointed it at James and asked how many people worked there. He was told there was one in the workshop and one in another room. Mr Lesi went in search of them. [The applicant] was holding a handgun pointed at the ground when Mr Paul Anastasakis, the twenty-one year old brother, came out from the office. The two young men were forced to the ground by him. [The applicant] pointed the gun at one of them and told him not to look at him. He told them that they just wanted cars.  
        
       
       
        
        The owner, Mr Anastasakis senior, was brought from the nearby office and the offenders demanded keys to two cars. There were some discussions about batteries needing to be connected to the cars and in due course a silver Commodore was started and paper work was demanded and given to the offenders for cars. [The applicant] ripped out the phones and told the owner not to call the police. The offenders left with two stolen cars from the premises, one being driven by [the applicant] and the third man driving another. Mr Kinikini drove away in the car in which they had originally arrived 
        .” 
        
       
      
    13 The Judge accepted that the stolen vehicles were to be used in connection with a planned armed robbery of the Qantas Credit Union at Hurstville later that day which was foiled as the police who had telephone intercepts and surveillance on the offenders moved in and prevented the planned robbery.  
     
      
    14 Count 3 was the conspiracy to commit the armed robbery of the Qantas Staff Credit Union that was foiled by the police. The degree of planning included arranging for the obtaining of a sledgehammer and the planning to steal a car to use in the armed robbery. 
     
      
    15 The facts of the Rosehill robbery (Form 1 count 2 Kinikini) were that on 7 April 2005, Kinikini, Lesi and another man entered the Rosehill Hotel at about 1.40pm. Kinikini was armed with a silver pistol and one of his co-offenders with a shortened shotgun. All three were disguised. During the robbery, the hotel manager was struck a heavy blow to his lower back, knocking him to the floor. Kinikini pulled him to his feet, forced him back to the change booth where he put money into a bag. The hotel licensee was grabbed by the shirt by Lesi and led through the hotel. A hotel patron was confronted by the third co-offender who was holding the shortened shotgun. Other hotel patrons who had been playing poker machines were directed by Kinikini, whilst holding the silver pistol, to get on the floor. Lesi took the hotel licensee to the office where the safe was opened. When the alarms were activated, the offenders fled from the hotel. In all, $3,761 was stolen in this robbery. Both the licensee and manager were injured in the robbery.  
     
      
    16 The Judge described the offence as being (ROS at 13): 
     
      
       
        
        “…probably the most serious of the offences that are before me one way or the other today. “ 
        
       
      
     Subjective circumstances  
     
      
    17 The applicant was born in Fiji on 13 February 1980. He was 25 years old at the time of the offending and 27 years old on sentence. The applicant was an only child who came to Australia in 1993 and lived with members of his family in this country. The Judge said (ROS at 25): 
     
      
       
        
        “ He left high school about half-way through year ten and had had trouble with truancy. He has had a very limited employment history and …has only ever worked for about four weeks. He seems to have survived by committing offences in the past and with help from his extended family. He was a user I accept of heroin fairly significantly from the age of eighteen and he also used cocaine and ecstasy and other drugs.”  
        
       
      
    18 The Judge observed that there was no evidence that he committed the offences to fund a drug addiction or that he was in fact addicted to drugs. Her Honour accepted, however, that he continued or recommenced using drugs when released to parole and that the offences were committed with a view to obtaining funds some of which would have been spent on drugs. Her Honour assessed “his prospects of rehabilitation [to be] only fair given his history.”  
     
      
    19 The Judge remarked that the applicant had a serious criminal record which commenced with a goods in company offence in January 1997 “and then in 1997 aggravated armed robbery and robbery in company offences which gave rise to the sentences for which he was on parole at the time he committed the matter before me.” Her Honour was referring to the sentences imposed upon the applicant in the District Court at Sydney on 15 December 2000 by Sorby DCJ when he was sentenced for three counts of aggravated armed robbery and two counts of aggravated robbery. Further counts of aggravated robbery, robbery in company and stealing a motor vehicle were taken into account on sentence on a Form 1. A total effective sentence of 8 years imprisonment was imposed commencing on 6 October 1999 and expiring on 5 October 2007 with a non-parole period of 5 years expiring on 5 October 2004.  
     
      
    20 The applicant had been admitted to parole on 5 October 2004. The Judge found as a factor of aggravation the commission by the applicant of the Hurstville robbery whilst on parole. Her Honour noted that he had been released to parole “just four months before he committed this offence” and the sentences for which he had been sentenced in 2000 involved “similar offences”. 
     
      
    21 The applicant was arrested on 12 April 2005 when police foiled the plan to carry out a second Hurstville robbery. His parole was revoked on 28 April 2005 to date from 12 April 2005. He was ordered to serve the balance of parole being 2 years 5 months and 24 days. The Judge noted that this sentence did not expire until 9 (sic) October 2007. Her Honour said (ROS at 33):  
     
      
       
        
        “There should, however, be some partial accumulation for the sentences I will impose and that balance of parole. In fact he has now served almost the whole of the head sentence imposed on him of eight years for those earlier offences. Taking that into account and the considerations of totality I propose to commence his sentence from twelve months after the date of his arrest, that is from 12 April 2006.” 
        
       
      
    22 Save for the argument advanced by the applicant for Ground 2, there is no challenge to the commencement date of the applicant’s sentence for the Hurstville robbery. It was conceded that her Honour’s approach was consistent with Callaghan v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 145.  
     
      
    23 Kinikini was born on 14 May 1982. He was 22 years old at the time of the offending and 25 years old when sentenced. He had migrated to Australia from Fiji with his family when he was 8 years old. He completed his Higher School Certificate and commenced tertiary studies hoping to be a physical education teacher but was not able to continue. He worked for a while as a labourer and security guard. The Judge accepted that he had been a significant user of illegal drugs probably since 2002. The Judge observed that there was no evidence that he was a hopeless addict. Her Honour noted that at the time Kinikini committed the offences and was relapsing into drug use he was also acquiring qualifications as a fitness instructor and was considered to be a talented rugby player. Her Honour assessed his prospects of rehabilitation to be reasonable.  
     
      
    24 The Judge said that Kinikini had “a serious criminal record including convictions for similar matters”. Kinikini’s prior criminal history relevantly reveals that in the District Court at Sydney on 9 April 2003 he was sentenced for a count of obtaining money by deception to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment, for a count of robbery to 2 years 3 months imprisonment commencing on 26 August 2002 and expiring on 25 October 2004 with a 12-month non-parole period expiring on 25 August 2003 (an offence of obtaining money by deception being taken into account on a Form 1) and for one count of armed robbery to imprisonment for 3 years 9 months expiring on 8 January 2007 with a non-parole period of 16 months expiring on 8 August 2004.  
     
      
    25 The applicant had been released to parole on 8 August 2004. The Judge observed that Kinikini had been released to parole for little more than 6 months when he committed the Hurstville robbery which was an aggravating factor.  
     
      
    26 Kinikini was arrested on 12 April 2005 and his parole was revoked from that date. No actual period was set for the balance of his parole as by the time it was considered by the Parole Board the sentence had expired. As the Judge explained (ROS at 33): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        He had nonetheless been in custody for these matters bail refused and after having had his parole revoked since 12 April 2005. At that stage he had served only sixteen months of a three year and nine months sentence with eight months out on parole and would have faced one year and nine months balance of parole, albeit that that formal sentence was never imposed. In those circumstances and taking into account issues of totality I propose to commence the sentences for him nine months after he came into custody, so that effectively one year of his earlier sentence will be served concurrently with the sentences I will impose. The commencement date for him will then be 12 January 2006.” 
        
       
      
    27 During the remarks on sentence, the Judge said (ROS at 31): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        So, when looking at the subjective circumstances of all of the three offenders they are a little different, there is in reality, it seems to me, no substantial distinction in sentencing terms in the subjective circumstances of each of the prisoners. Neither is there any distinction argued nor apparent in relation to the respective roles each of them played in the offences which are joint offences. Further, their criminal records are very similar and they were all on parole at the time…” 
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
      .  
      Her Honour failed to have proper regard to the principles of parity when sentencing the applicant. 
      
    28 The first ground of appeal raises the issue of parity relative to the sentence imposed upon Kinikini. The applicant and Kinikini were both sentenced for the Parkside robbery. For this offence the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months. When Kinikini was sentenced for count 2, the Rosehill robbery was taken into account on a Form 1. He was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. The applicant submitted that it can be seen that her Honour considered that the additional period of sentence that was to be imposed as a consequence of the Rosehill robbery was 18 months as there were no relevant differences in either the objective circumstances of the co-offenders’ offending or their subjective circumstances. The sole matter of difference, the applicant contended, was the Form 1 offence which had been adequately reflected by Kinikini’s additional sentence of 18 months. However, the effective overall sentence imposed on Kinikini was a head sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years whereas the applicant’s effective overall sentence was a head sentence of 10 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months. The applicant argued that the structure of the sentences resulted in the applicant’s effective head sentence and effective non-parole period being only 6 months less than that of Kinikini giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    29 It was pointed out that the applicant’s sentence for the Parkside robbery had been accumulated upon the sentence of the conspiracy (count 3) by two years, whereas Kinikini’s sentence for the Parkside robbery had been accumulated upon the sentence for the conspiracy by only 12 months. The applicant contended that there was no justifiable reason for her Honour to have differentiated between those orders of accumulation. Kinikini’s overall sentence did not reflect, it was submitted, her Honour’s recognition of the seriousness of the Rosehill robbery when she sentenced him for the Parkside robbery. The applicant’s sense of grievance, it was suggested, could be overcome by commencing his sentence for count 2 on 12 April 2009. 
     
      
    30 The structure of the sentences arose from the Judge’s careful consideration of the principle of totality in accordance with Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. Her Honour first determined a sentence for each offence. For the Hurstville robbery it seemed to her Honour that absent a plea of guilty this offence would attract for the applicant and Kinikini an overall penalty of 8 years which was then reduced by about 20 per cent for the plea of guilty giving rise to a head sentence of 6 years 6 months. Her Honour then found special circumstances and proposed a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months for each of the two offenders. 
     
      
    31 For the Parkside robbery, her Honour determined that the undiscounted starting point of the applicant’s sentence would be 8 years which when reduced by 20 per cent for the plea of guilty amounted to a head sentence of 6 years 6 months. With a finding of special circumstances, her Honour proposed a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months and then said: “but for reasons I will come to in due course after applying totality and in order to give effect to that I propose a non-parole period of three and a half years for that particular offence”. 
     
      
    32 In sentencing Kinikini for count 2, the Judge said she took the Rosehill robbery on the Form 1 into account “in a significant way” and determined that the undiscounted starting point of the sentence was 10 years which when reduced by 20 per cent for the plea amounted to a head sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years after a finding of special circumstances. Her Honour plainly recognised that the sentence for the primary offence was not to be only slightly increased if the offence to be taken into account on the Form 1 was serious in its own right which the Rosehill robbery was: Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. 
     
      
    33 In sentencing each of the co-offenders for the conspiracy, the Judge determined that the undiscounted starting point of the sentence was 7 years which when reduced by 20 per cent for the plea amounted to a head sentence of 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months after special circumstances were found. The special circumstances her Honour found for the applicant and Kinikini were the same, namely a “longer than normal period of supervision and partial accumulation.”  
     
      
    34 No complaint is made by the applicant about any of the individual sentences.  
     
      
    35 The Judge next considered the overall length of imprisonment for each of the offenders. She calculated that if each of the sentences was ordered to be served entirely consecutively it would give rise in the applicant’s case to an overall head sentence of 18 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 11 years 6 months and for Kinikini an overall head sentence of 20 years with a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months. Her Honour considered that these sentences were [too] excessive to reflect the totality of the criminality involved in each case and said (ROS 37):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        I have concluded that to reflect totality … in the [applicant’s] case an overall term of ten-and-a-half years with a seven-and-a-half year non-parole period [is called for] and in Mr Kinikini’s case an overall term of imprisonment of eleven years with an eight year non-parole period.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I have structured the sentences to give effect to these findings. 
         In the case of [the applicant] I have reduced what might otherwise be the appropriate non-parole period for one of the counts, namely count two, by a year so as to reflect those totality considerations. I acknowledge the need to do this arises from the application of  
        Pearce’s 
         case and that to some extent or other the actual fixing of sentences to charges is somewhat arbitrary 
        .”  
        (italics added) 
        
       
      
    36 The difference of six months both in the head sentence and non-parole period between the sentences of Kinikini and the applicant resulted from the Judge’s assessment of the length of each overall sentence which was just and appropriate to the totality of the criminality of the applicant and his co-offender. The application of the totality principle does not, however, render considerations of parity redundant. The essential question is whether the difference in sentence gives rise to “a justifiable sense of grievance”: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295.  
     
      
    37 It is evident from the whole of the sentencing remarks that the Judge was aware of the parity principle. When her Honour reviewed for each offender the aggregate of the individual sentences which she had calculated and made a substantial downward adjustment to ensure that the overall sentence was just and appropriate to the totality of the offending behaviour, her Honour was not obliged to preserve the 18-month difference in sentence between Kinikini and the applicant. If her Honour had done so, the overall sentence, in my view, would not have adequately reflected the seriousness of the totality of the applicant’s criminality. A preservation of a proper proportion between the applicant’s sentence and that imposed upon Kinikini required a reduction in the 18-month difference in sentence. 
     
      
    38 During oral argument in this Court, it was noted that the downward adjustment by the Judge for the applicant’s sentence was made in almost the same proportion as the downward adjustment in Kinikini’s sentence. The Crown pointed out in written submissions that the ratio of Kinikini’s effective non-parole period to his effective head sentence was 72.7 per cent whereas it was 71.4 per cent for the applicant. In other words, the applicant in fact received a more generous finding on his non-parole period than Kinikini arising from the same special circumstances.  
     
      
    39 Sentencing as has been frequently pointed out is not a matter of mathematical accuracy or analytical certainty and room must be left for discretion: see R v Kollas and Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491 per Wood CJ at CL at [49]. In Postiglione Kirby J said at 341: 
     
      
       
        
        “Obviously, the adjustments for the parity and totality principles, whether performed by a sentencing Judge or appellate court, involve subtle considerations which defy precision either of description or implementation.” 
        
       
      
    40 Although the Judge said in the passage quoted at [27] that there was no substantial distinction in the subjective circumstances of the offenders, there were relevant differences. The applicant was 25 years old and Kinikini was 22 years old when the offences were committed. The applicant’s prior criminal history was more extensive than that of his co-offender which was reflected in the sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 15 December 2000. The Judge’s assessment of prospects of rehabilitation was less optimistic in the case of the applicant. The Judge had also determined that the sentences for the co-offenders had different starting points. The applicant’s sentence was partially accumulated on the sentence that he was serving by 18 months, whereas Kinikini’s sentence had been backdated by 12 months to take into account the sentence that had been served. Whilst no distinction had been argued in the roles of the co-offenders, the part that the applicant played in the commission of the Parkside robbery included pointing a handgun at one of the victims whereas Kinikini remained in the vehicle.  
     
      
    41 The co-offenders were sentenced before the same Judge. Her Honour had the opportunity of assessing the evidence first hand and gave a considered decision on sentence. In my opinion, the Judge’s assessment of the overall length of each sentence that was just and appropriate to reflect the totality of the criminality of the applicant and Kinikini was open to her. I am not persuaded that the overall effective difference in the sentences involves a marked disparity giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. This ground of appeal has not been established. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
      :  
      Her Honour failed to have proper regard to the principles of totality when sentencing the applicant.  
       
      
    42 The applicant argued that in fixing the total non-parole period, the Judge failed to have sufficient regard to the sentence that he was serving at the time sentence was imposed and consequently failed to have proper regard to the principle of totality. It was pointed out that when considered in combination with the sentence imposed by Sorby DCJ on 15 December 2000, the effect of her Honour’s sentencing is that he will have spent almost 14 years incarcerated when he becomes eligible for release to parole.  
     
      
    43 The essence of this submission is the requirement for a sentencing judge to consider “the total criminality involved not only in the offences for which the offender is being sentenced, but also in any offences for which the offender is currently serving a sentence” and to ensure that the aggregation of sentences is a “just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved”: Postiglione per McHugh J at 307 – 308. 
     
      
    44 The Judge clearly considered in the passage quoted at [21] above the fact that the applicant had almost served the whole of his head sentence of 8 years and made reference to considerations of totality. The sentence which her Honour imposed was backdated to commence from 12 April 2006 and was partially accumulated by almost 18 months upon the sentence which was being served. This was properly within the Judge’s sentencing discretion and I do not accept that her Honour failed to have proper regard to the principle of totality. 
     
      
    45 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Yerin Simpson appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at a fairly late stage to a most serious offence. Members of the community greatly value the idea that they are entitled to feel safe in their own homes. When serious offences are committed such as the one for which Mr Simpson must be sentenced, it is important that they are dealt with appropriately. This was a very, very serious offence.2 On 3 November 2002, the victim, who I will not name, was in bed at home alone. She heard her bedroom door open. She looked up and she saw the offender. She said “Who’s that?”. The offender simply ignored the question, closed the bedroom door and walked towards her. She had sat up in bed to look at what was going on. The offender pushed her head back down onto the pillow and laid down on top of her. She was trying to push him off repeating “Who are you? Who are you?”. In response, the offender simply said “Shsh” and began to kiss her. He pushed his tongue into her mouth before licking her face. He threatened her too. He said “Do you want to get hurt?”. In response the complainant said “No” and stopped trying to push the offender away. At this stage he rolled off her, pulled the doona off and told her to be quiet. He had to tell her this because not surprisingly the complainant was crying. 3 It must be remembered that throughout what I am about to describe the complainant was exhibiting great distress. To do what the offender did shows a level of callousness which is of significant concern. The offender thought nothing of the wishes of the victim, barely treating her as a human being. Instead she was an object for him. 4 He used one of his hands to push her onto the bed whilst he used the other hand to rub her vagina and breasts over the top of her clothing. This continued for some time before the offender pushed the complainant’s singlet top up. She, being in bed and intending to go to sleep, was not wearing a bra. He then began to kiss and lick her breasts and kissed her on the mouth again. She was continuing to cry. She tried to get him to go by saying “My uncle will be back home soon”. Although the offender did look around from time to time, he kept going. 5 He then pulled her underpants down before pushing her legs open, kneeling between her legs and putting one finger inside her vagina. He moved his finger around inside for a number of minutes. Not only was this degrading but painful as well. In an effort to stop further assaults upon her, the complainant told the offender that she was menstruating. Again he kept going. This time he performed cunnilingus on her for a number of minutes. 6 He had not finished yet. After a period of time he got up and walked around to the side of the bed unzipping his pants as he did so. He pulled her by the hair so that she was kneeling up and said “Suck my dick”. When she said “No I can’t” he responded “Do you want to get hurt? Go on then”. He pulled his erect penis out of his pants, grabbed the back of her head and pulled her face towards his groin area. He said “Here it is”. No doubt because of the fear that had been instilled in her, she opened her mouth and he put his penis inside. The offender held the back of her head and moved it backwards and forwards. Her efforts did not meet with the offender’s approval. He said “Put a bit of effort into it”.  What he was doing caused the complainant to struggle to breathe. She began to choke and cough which led to the offender removing his penis from her mouth without ejaculating. He then said “Can you do it just one more time?” but when the complainant said “No I can’t”, the offender said “Okay” and put his penis back into his pants and zipped up his trousers. He then got back on top of her and rubbed his body up against hers, pushing his groin area against her vagina. 7 At this stage the complainant managed to pull her pants up from around her ankles. The offender grabbed the back of her hair and pushed her off the bed and dragged her into the kitchen area of the house. He then told her to return back to the bed as he was leaving. He grabbed her by the hair and led her back to the bedroom. He pushed her head down towards the floor and said “Keep your head down”. She got back into bed and the offender said “I’m going now”. 8 Not surprisingly the complainant was still crying. The accused leaned over and gave her a cuddle, he then left the house. She called police who arrived a short time later. She was treated for some injuries, namely a cut to the left corner of her mouth and as usual underwent a sexual assault examination by a doctor, swabs were taken. 9 Some years later, as a result of the offender having committed another offence, a swab was taken from him as well. Analysis of the DNA from the swab taken from the complainant and the DNA taken from the offender revealed a match, so it was on 19 May 2008, that he was arrested in relation to this matter and charged with it.10 He pleaded not guilty at committal and was committed for trial, however after some negotiations a late plea of guilty was entered. It has a utilitarian value, it spared the need for a trial and spared the need for the complainant to give evidence about such distressing events. I will reduce the sentence I would have otherwise imposed by about ten per cent to reflect the plea of guilty. 11 It is important to note that this was an offence committed when the offender was but sixteen years of age, however it cannot be said that he was committing the offence of a child. It was, as I have said, a very serious offence of the type committed by an adult. Nor could it be said that the offender has rehabilitated himself since November 2002. He has committed other serious offences in the meantime, some being dealt with in the Children’s Court because of his age. He is now no longer a child. Although I can deal with him as a child, that would be entirely inappropriate given that a consequence of that would be that his time in custody for this very serious matter would be limited to a maximum of two years. The offender will be spending much more time than that in prison for this offence. 12 The offender was raised in Bankstown and Wooloomooloo by his mother and father until he was fifteen when they separated. His upbringing can be described as of great concern. He first used drugs, cannabis and ecstasy at the age of twelve. He started drinking heavily at fifteen. He stopped school, not voluntarily, but because he was kicked out. He had at one stage showed promise as a rugby league player and was in the Canterbury-Bankstown development squad but, at least partly because of his excessive drug use, he abandoned that career. His drugs and alcohol consumption interfered with his ability to play properly.13 Members of his family attended court today although at his request they were not present at court when he gave evidence. He explained in his evidence that he was ashamed and embarrassed at the position he was in and did not want his family to see it. 14 The offender was currently serving a sentence, the non-parole period of that expired on 3 November 2008. The sentence I will impose on the offender for this offence will commence on 4 November 2008. However recognising that this sentence comes on top of another sentence, the principle of totality applies. The sentence I impose on the offender for this matter will commence on 4 November 2008 but it has been significantly reduced because of the principle of totality. The fact that this sentence is to be served on top of another one is also relevant to the statutory ratio between non-parole period and period of eligibility for parole. There will thus be a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour but I recognise that there is only a slight variation from the statutory ratio in overall terms.15 The offender is a person upon whom a sentence recognising or reflecting a full measure of general deterrence should not be imposed. He has a mental illness although there is no suggestion that that played any factor in the offence he committed on 3 November 2002. As well as a reducing the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence, his mental illness will also make his time in custody harder. On the other hand there remains a very significant need for personal deterrence. 16 Another matter reflecting the offender’s time in custody is this, he said without challenge from the Crown that he had been threatened whilst in custody and that those threats related to the offence for which he is to be sentenced. He will therefore again do his time in custody harder than would otherwise have been the case. 17 If the offence was committed today it would have a standard non-parole period but that does not apply for two reasons, firstly it was committed before the standard non-parole period provisions took effect and secondly because he was a child, that is sixteen, at the time of the offending and I have therefore had no regard to the standard non-parole period in formulating the appropriate sentence.18 It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentence reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. That rule applies even when the offender was sixteen at the time of the offending. To break into someone’s home, even by opening an internal door, then to deprive a woman and commit many acts of sexual assault upon her demands a significant sentence of imprisonment.19 One matter I should deal with as a discrete issue concerns the offender’s eligibility for referral to the Drug Court for consideration for the Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre program. The offender has been convicted of the offence of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious offence, the serious offence is the sexual assault of the complainant. For some time I received submissions about whether that disqualified him for referral to the Drug Court. However as soon as I realised that there was another constraint, another criteria, which the offender did not meet, it became unnecessary to continue consideration of the issue. The length of the sentence I will now announce, precludes the offender’s eligibility for referral to the Drug Court.20 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a head sentence of eight years to commence on 4 November 2008 with a non-parole period of five years, that non-parole period will expire on 3 November 2013 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

   JUDGMENT 1. Literature, poetry and drama have all been used as vehicles to assess issues involving the love between an older man and a significantly younger woman. 2. Adam Peter Fenwick aged twenty-five is before the court for seven counts of sexual intercourse with JMW at a time when she was under the age of sixteen but over the age of fourteen. 3. All of these offences occurred during a six-week period from 1 August 2008 to 15 September 2008. At the time of the offences Adam Fenwick was on bail. A condition of his bail was that he reside at the address of his “uncle” CW. JMW was the eldest of CW‘s six children.4. This case raises issues as to the hallmarks of objective criminality to be discerned in proved s. 66C Crimes Act offences. Adam Fenwick today is to be held accountable by the sentencing options available to the court for his criminal conduct arising from these seven charges.5. Fenwick had known of JMW all of her life. But his interest in her would appear to have commenced when the two “got together in Sydney”. She was staying with family there and “we went to the movies and we kissed and stuff”. Thereafter they did not see each other for a while. Whenever they did see each other they were “together sort of thing”. (record of interview Q&A 42) 6. Further initial events are dated about one year before these offences are said to have occurred. The accused told police before they had kissed, “we were...just mates but I really liked her”. (record of interview Q&A 46) When asked about the relationship since he had moved into CW'S home, Fenwick’s response was “we sort of just see each other and be together whenever we could stealing kisses and stuff while no-one was looking and having a hug.” “When no-one was looking we were together”. (record of interview Q&A 54) He added “We were promised to each other...” that is, as I understood his evidence, neither were supposed to look elsewhere for other attachments.7. The accused gives an account of JMW's attitude towards him. Apparently she had truanted school on a number of occasions to see him. He was not happy about that. It was she who revealed first her love for him before he told her of his love for her. They had been seeing each other for months before any sexual connection. 8. The agreed facts set out the first offences occurring in these circumstances:- a tent was set up in the rear yard of the residence some time early in August 2008. The complainant went out to the shed where the accused slept late one evening. After smoking cigarettes and kissing for a period the accused asked the complainant to walk outside and come into the tent, which she did. He and the complainant then had consensual penile/vaginal intercourse. He used a condom during that intercourse. They returned to the shed and shared another cigarette. The accused placed the used condom in a box containing his personal belongings. He later explained that he did not want to place the used condom in a garbage bin for fear of being caught. 9. Fenwick’s account of this conduct in the record of interview in the tent is worse for recounting. It is to be found in questions 151-185. “We were kissing and stuff and then we got naked”. He was asked whether he touched JMW first and he said, “I really don’t know how to answer that”. Asked whether they were touching each other he said, “we were both happy to be with each other. I know I didn’t force anything on her and she didn’t force nothing on me”. He agreed that he was well aware that she wanted to have sex with him and that he wanted to have sex with her. Having finished the intercourse he was asked at Q181. “What did you do then?” and he answered “We cuddled”. He was unsure how long they stayed in the tent. They just cuddled and whispered and were just happy. While detail of the other six offences is not available to demonstrate the consensual intimacy of each occasion, there can be no doubt that each was a loving encounter. 10. I come to the agreed facts of offences 2 through to 7. The offender’s grandmother who formerly resided in Sydney, moved into unit 7/13 Avoca Street Goulburn. Prior to her moving in the offender had a key to the unit. At around 12.30 on Tuesday the 16th he and the complainant walked from Kerr Place to Avoca Street. He used his key to enter the grandmother’s unit and he and the complainant had consensual penile/vaginal intercourse in the lounge room. Charges 3 and 4 occurred between 1 August and 15 September when the offender took the complainant to Tattersall’s Hotel in Goulburn, paid for a room and there had penile/vaginal intercourse with JMW. Charges 6, 7 and 8 occurred between 1 August and 15 September on three separate occasions in a tent set up in the backyard of the premises he was then bailed to. Objective Criminality 11. The court’s task is to assess the objective criminality of this offence by comparing it with offences of a similar kind. It is in that way that the objective seriousness of this offence can be assessed. The objective seriousness is one of the important determinative factors in the ultimate outcome of a case such as this. 12. At a minimal level the objective criminality requires an acceptance that each of the essential elements of the offence be established; namely sexual intercourse with the complainant being at the time between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years. On the admissions by the accused’s plea, by agreement to the facts and by his interview, all of the elements are proved. Consent of the complainant is not, at least in the circumstances of this case, a defence. That clearly indicates that the purpose of s 66C is about the protection of young children under the age of sixteen, because of a power imbalance existing between the child on the one hand and the mature adult on the other. The mature adult I might add, is usually a male.13. An analysis of the history of s 66C and its equivalent in other jurisdictions gives insight into the purposes of s 66C as it appears in its modern form. In its older form, its predecessor was in England. And in England until the 1880s there had been no statutory sanction against men having sexual intercourse with females above the age of twelve years. Presumably that situation still reflects the common law position. Breathtaking as that may seem to us in New South Wales today, the Attorney of this State in 2003 in his second reading speech to the most recent amendments to this area of the law made this observation:  
     
      
      “The age of consent in France is fifteen. In Italy the uniform age of consent is fourteen. In Germany sixteen, Poland and the Czech Republic have an equal age of consent of fifteen, while in Spain it is thirteen”.  
      
      
    14. In New South Wales in 1883 the Criminal Law Amendment Act made carnal knowledge of a girl of or above the age of ten and under the age of fourteen liable to ten years penal servitude. In the United Kingdom the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 made carnal knowledge of a girl of or above the age of thirteen and under sixteen a misdemeanour.15. It can be seen from a study of the history of these offences, two things; firstly, that our Parliament was well aware of the lower ages in other jurisdictions but nonetheless chose to protect girls under the age of sixteen; and secondly, that there has been a general trend upwards moving the age towards sixteen throughout the world.16. The Government of New South Wales is interested in protecting all boys and girls under the age of sixteen. The age of sixteen has not been plucked from a Ouija board. The history just outlined reveals a rising of the age of consensual intercourse for girls from perhaps as low as twelve in the nineteen century to sixteen in modern times. That can only be because [parliament recognises] judgments would be made by girls under sixteen who were emotionally and psycho-sexually immature - too immature to consent to sexual experiences. 17. The age of consent for sexual activity is a matter that parliament can set and set as an absolute if it wished. Over the past 125 years that rising age from twelve to sixteen for women, and in fact lowering the age from eighteen to sixteen for men, has occurred because after study the general consensus is that sixteen is the very lowest age children are in any position to consent. Even then one has to be careful of power imbalance issues. 18. Whatever may have been the reality, or the reality so far as Adam Fenwick was concerned, in the eyes of the law JMW was too young to participate in sexual activity. Her psycho-sexual development by standards applied today in New South Wales is deemed by the law to be too immature in its development for consensual sex. 19. It may well be the accused in all sincerity differs in this assessment, but he would have to concede he is too biased and too emotionally involved to make an objective assessment. 20. The objective criminality I am dealing with is, the man of goodwill and loving disposition towards the complaint with her encouragement participated in sexual intercourse with her on seven occasions in circumstances where the law says her emotional and psycho-sexual development were too immature. 21. Let us look at that. Fenwick presents in court as a strikingly handsome and presentable young man. It is easy to see how JMW became infatuated with him. Given her youth and for other reasons I shall explain, it would be impossible to find that she loved him in any way reflecting a mature person’s concept of that word. There can be little doubt her girl-like expressions of “love” to him were genuinely and sincerely expressed and understood by the accused as such. As Leonardo Da Vinci’s Last Supper portraits of St John and Judas Iscariot so clearly demonstrate, life experiences and age may work cruelly on the ephemerality of looks, for Judas Iscariot and St John are the same man but so different in their appearance after he had aged fifteen years. 22. While his [Fenwick’s] looks and presence may have suggested mature manliness and strength his past life suggests otherwise. He is a young man with more than normal personal baggage and real problems, including real problems with alcohol. The complainant’s immaturity would have been blind to all this. He is probably an alcoholic. If not, there is no denying he has longstanding massive issues with alcohol that have not resolved during this period. He also has real anger management issues that have not been resolved during this period. He has past and unresolved criminal justice issues. He has been a risk- taker in the past and his risk taking has seen him in trouble with the law. He was about to embark with her upon other episodes of risk taking including occasions of intercourse and drinking with a minor in a public park, when things unravelled for him. It would appear from the evidence that she appreciated none of his personal background issues in any mature way. She was taken by his charm, his deep sense of personal commitment and his body. He did not have the discipline in the circumstances to say “No” to her when she was keen. 23. Nonetheless these are not offences where there was manipulation, grooming, predatory behaviour, reluctance on the part of the under sixteen year old, or any form of callousness. Until brought up by the authority of the parents and the law, while the offender recognised what he was doing was illegal, he did not believe it to be harmful. To the contrary, he thought he was expressing his love for her. That she was immature seems apparent from her school truanting because of a desire to see him and also possibly by the tensions existing between the complainant and the offender on the nights prior to his arrest. There is no evidence of any harm being occasioned to the complainant. Clearly there is tension between her family and the offender. Her attitude to the offender since the arrest has not been revealed. 24. There is an age gap of twelve years between the complainant and Fenwick. There are many rewarding relationships in life between partners having an age difference of that, or sometimes of even greater magnitude. But the law seeks to protect those relationships beginning before a child is sixteen, at least from the sexual component of any relationship for reasons I have already mentioned. Even though the offender may have believed he was acting lovingly towards the complainant, despite his knowledge of the law’s prohibition against his conduct, and because of it, he was breaching the trust the law requires of him towards the complainant.25. The parents of the complainant are secondary victims of his conduct. Although he may not use that label towards them, he seems to realise his acts have caused them consternation. He has expressed regret for this. His conduct was in breach of their trust bestowed upon him when they opened their house to him in circumstances where he was desperate to be relieved of gaol, and to accept his bail conditions. That he had sexual conduct was also in breach of his bail conditions and aggravates the criminality of each offence. Nonetheless I come to a finding that the offences are really towards the bottom of the range, but the repetition of each offence must add to the total criminality. 26. These initial events were not planned. It is likely the hotel incidents were. On five of the seven occasions he had protected sex. It would appear on two occasions he did not. His prior sexual history is unknown to me, or to others concerned here. I have made the point that the law is concerned for the safety of those who are too young to be aware of sexual health issues. On those occasions when the sexual encounter was an unprotected one, the criminality must necessarily be greater. 27. The establishment of the elements of the offences and the proof of those aggravating features I have referred to must be balanced against the circumstances existing between Adam Fenwick and JMW before the overall objective criminality is determined. The Crown does not challenge his intention towards JMW was a loving and well meaning one. At the end of the day the criminality of each offence is towards the lower end of the range. The totality I also regard as still within the low parameters.Subjective Matters28. Adam Fenwick is now a twenty-six year old man, aged twenty-five at the time of the offences. He was born in Goulburn and raised in Goulburn and Bellingen. There is an older brother, five years his senior, and a sister aged ten. His parents separated some years ago; the father moving to Sydney, the mother remaining initially in Bellingen but now I think in Goulburn. She is seriously ill with diabetes and kidney problems. The older brother is not in trouble with the law. Perhaps because of the mother’s illness, Fenwick was not supervised to any great extent during his teenage years. By seventeen he was staying with friends and associates including persons ranging up to thirty years whose primary interests were drinking alcohol and “hanging around the riverside”. At sixteen he came to Sydney to be with his father but that did not work out. He felt unwelcome. The father had a new partner. He moved in with friends at Waterloo. He was drinking heavily. There was an itinerant quality to his life. He lived in Queanbeyan for a couple of months, moved back to Goulburn, then Sydney. He worked in Sydney in a factory or at other jobs earning money but not gaining, so far as I can tell, any work skills. At Goulburn he worked with AFS working on or with aluminium. 29. He has a growing criminal history associated particularly with his alcohol abuse. It would seem to me, from knowledge I have gained in another case, that even perhaps during this period he was abusing alcohol in circumstances where he was involved in a fight. Again, an example of risk taking while consuming alcohol. He has had serious problems with illicit drugs, particularly cannabis and methylamphetamine. He had spent four months in a rehabilitation program up until 2007 but relapsed after leaving the program. He has also gambled extensively but he says did not waste much time on it. 30. I do not gain any sense from his offending conduct that he is a predatory sexual offender. As a consequence of his conviction, as must necessarily happen for these offences, he will be placed on a register. Can I indicate to those overseeing that register that my view is, that close consideration should be given to these offences and the circumstances of their occurrence, as I have set them out, when determining whether to maintain bans that would necessarily be put in place, particularly in respect to his young sister. 31. It is appropriate in my view to give to this offender an opportunity to demonstrate that he can rehabilitate, that is to say stay off or away from alcohol and illicit drugs. For that purpose rather than sentence him today to a further period of incarceration, I intend to place him on a s 11 bond to be of good behaviour for a period of nine months from today. 32. The conditions of the bail will be that he is to be of good behaviour, that he is to abstain from the consumption of all alcoholic beverages for the duration of the bail. Consumption of any alcohol for any purpose, including a celebratory purpose related to birthday or Christmas, will be deemed a breach of bail. He is to abstain from the consumption of any non-prescribed drug other than cigarettes. Any consumption of illicit drugs will be deemed a breach of bail. He is to submit to random urine testing for detection of cannabis or any other illicit drug. Failure to supply urine, or the supplying of urine that is not his, will be deemed a breach of bail. Consumption of those illicit drugs will also be deemed a breach of bail. 33. (Residential requirements were set out in the original judgment). He will accept supervision by Probation and Parole and accept all reasonable directions of his case management with Probation and Parole, and for that purpose he will report to the Probation and Parole office at Chatswood by 5 pm on Monday night. Failure so to do will be deemed a breach of bail.  34. He will seek to do all he can to find and maintain employment hopefully in an industry that will give him work skills. He will need in three months time to show me evidence that he has sought employment by dockets regularly from some employment agency. He will attend a Commonwealth employment agency by Friday 5 pm next week and make an application to have a personal program manager to assist him obtain employment and to deal with such issues as may be impeding his employment. In the event that there is a waiting list for such a person, he will need to get evidence of that next time he comes before me. 35. I wish to be notified of any breach of the bail conditions by police or Probation and Parole within forty-eight hours of such breach.36. I also note on the record that a breach of the conditions in relation to alcohol or drugs will be sufficient, if proved to the satisfaction of the arresting officer, for him to be incarcerated and arrangements made to return him to me.37. If there is any AVO in place he is to abide by the conditions of the AVO, but if he wants to go and visit his mother and grandmother I do not have a problem with that.38. You are going to have to also notify your own solicitor of a change of address and within twenty-four hours, and he, in turn, will have to notify the Crown. It is no doubt that as soon as your address is changed you will be back before me so that I can satisfy myself it is a safe place for you to be.

    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Buddin J. 
     
      
    3 BUDDIN J: This is an appeal by the Crown against the asserted inadequacy of a sentence imposed upon the respondent in the District Court following his plea of guilty to one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent brought pursuant to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation was the infliction by him of actual bodily harm upon the victim. The respondent also requested that two matters on a Form 1 document, of assault police and resist police, be taken into account on sentencing. The respondent was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment with an overall term of 5 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offence is 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment is applicable to the offence. 
     
      
    4 The essential facts in relation to the matter are not in dispute and can be briefly stated. The victim was an 81 year old Korean national who was in Australia on a tourist visa. She had been staying with her niece at West Ryde. At about 6.10 am on Sunday 11 May 2008 the victim went on an early morning walk around Anzac Park. The respondent came across her in the park. He grabbed her from behind and pulled her hair back towards him. He then grabbed hold of her waist and picked her up before throwing her onto the ground, causing her to land face down. He then punched her several times to the left side of her face and straddled her with one leg on either side of her body. He continued to punch her to the face and body causing her to lose consciousness. As a consequence, the victim was unable to provide a detailed account of what had occurred during the attack upon her although she thought that her assailant had been wearing a glove.  
     
      
    5 The attention of numerous persons, who resided in units which overlooked the park, was attracted when they heard the victim screaming out in a foreign language. The respondent was observed on top of the victim endeavouring to pull her pants down from her waist. After he managed to pull her pants down, the respondent was seen to forcefully push his hand in and out from between the victim’s legs on a number of occasions. The respondent then turned the victim over so that she was on her back. He then straddled her waist area and was observed by witnesses, after taking his own pants down, to make thrusting motions with his pelvis. He was then seen to grab the victim’s legs and lift them over his head so that her legs were resting on his shoulders. As he did so he continued to thrust his pelvis towards the victim. 
     
      
    6 In the meantime police were called to the scene. Upon arrival the police observed the respondent lying on top of the victim. He then stopped what he was doing and ran away although his pants were still down around his ankles. The police gave chase and shortly thereafter detained the respondent and placed him under arrest. The respondent struggled and resisted their attempts to handcuff him. During the struggle he kicked out at one of the constables, connecting with his leg. [It was this conduct which gave rise to the Form 1 matters]. Throughout this period of time the respondent verbally abused the officers by repeatedly swearing at them. In due course he was subdued and taken to Ryde Police Station. Upon arrival at the police station he continued to act in an extremely aggressive fashion.  
     
      
    7 The victim was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where she was examined. That examination revealed that she had suffered injuries consisting of soft tissue damage to the left side of her jaw and cheek. She was found to have grass and dirt through her hair, as well as abrasions, tenderness, bruising and other superficial injuries to various other parts of her body. She also complained of soreness to her left abdomen and the rib area. A genital examination revealed that she had sustained red petechial bruising adjacent to her urethra, red bruising across the top of her vaginal opening below her urethra, as well as bleeding and a linear laceration of her vaginal wall on the right side, extending from inside the vaginal wall to the outside. There was also major bruising to the entire area of her vagina which was consistent with penetration. 
     
      
    8 The victim’s niece provided a statement to police. In it she said that she observed that following the incident the victim had been bleeding from her genital region and that the bleeding had continued for a number of days. She went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        After the examinations were completed I went with my aunty and nephew back home to West Ryde. My aunty is a very private person and due to cultural reason (sic) she does not want to talk to anyone about this matter. She will not tell me exactly what has happened and I believe that she remembers more than what she has told me. She does not want anyone to know and does not want to bring shame upon her family in Australia or Korea. I have tried to talk to my aunty about this but she will always ask me to stop talking about it. No other members of my family know about the incident and it is very hard for my aunty and I to talk about it.  
        
       
       
        
        I have noticed that my aunty is not the same woman that she used to be. Even though she is 81 years old, she was very active before this incident happened. She is now scared to leave the house and has not gone past my front fence since the incident. She is scared when someone comes to my front door and does not want to see or speak to anyone. She only speaks to me or my family, even about other matters, only when she is asked a question. She was never like this. I feel that she is depressed and upset about what has happened but I know she will not talk to anyone about it and she will never be the same person as she was before this assault. 
        
       
      
    9 Later that day the respondent was interviewed by police. In it he gave an account of events which had occurred prior to the incident. He said that he had spent most of the preceding day with his girlfriend and that they had been intimate that evening. Thereafter he said that he had gone to Kings Cross with two friends, arriving there at about midnight. He said that he had had a lot to drink during the course of the evening but could not be sure how much he had consumed. He said that he had never previously drunk that much alcohol. He said that he and his friends had then caught a taxi back to his friend’s place which was in the general vicinity of where the attack had occurred. He told police that he recalled walking into Anzac Park and seeing a female there but that he had thereafter “blacked out”. He professed to have no memory of his attack upon the victim. The respondent stated that the next thing he could recall was being in custody at Ryde Police Station. He did say however that he felt disgusted with what he had done. He also said that because he had drunk too much he had not known what he was doing.  
     
      
    10 The respondent also gave evidence at the sentence hearing about the amount of alcohol which he had consumed. The effect of his evidence was that he had spent approximately $200 on purchasing premixed drinks of Vodka Smirnoff that evening. On the other hand, the respondent’s two friends who were with him in Kings Cross provided statements in which they expressed the view that he did not seem to them to be particularly drunk by the time that they arrived back home. Moreover, a blood sample taken some 10 hours after the offence did not reveal the presence of alcohol in the respondent’s system.  
     
      
    11 Reports prepared by a clinical psychologist, Dr Borenstein and by a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Nielssen respectively were tendered in evidence. Dr Borenstein expressed the opinion that the respondent had a sensitivity to alcohol which had led to his “blackout” and that there may have been an interplay between the amount of alcohol which he had consumed and the residual effects of a serious concussion which he had sustained two years earlier. He concluded that there were no obvious psychological or psychiatric grounds for the respondent’s behaviour but he did recommend that the respondent undertake a neurological investigation “to rule out frank organic causes” as providing an explanation for his conduct. 
     
      
    12 In his report Dr Nielssen noted that both an electroencephalogram (EEG) and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain had been performed on the respondent. He observed that those tests had been reported to be normal. Dr Nielssen also said that he could not find “a psychiatric or neurological explanation for [the respondent’s] behaviour”. Nor, he concluded did he suffer from any psychiatric disorder.  
     
      
    13 Having reviewed the evidence, the sentencing judge made the following finding: 
     
      
       
        
        Extensive medical tests and examinations in relation to the offender have been carried out both physically and psychiatrically, but these provide no rational explanation. The only possible explanation, upon the evidence available, is therefore that the offender, was very, very drunk and this somehow triggered in him some aspect of his personality or psyche that led him to behave in this way, particularly as it seems to have been totally out of character, for reasons to which I will come. 
        
       
      
    14 Although the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had overstated the extent of the respondent’s state of intoxication, it accepted that his Honour was nonetheless entitled to have regard to it in reaching the conclusion that it had impaired his judgment and had led to his acting out of character: see Coleman v R (1990) 47 A Crim R 306 at 321; Waters v R [2007] NSWCCA 219 [at para 38]. Nevertheless the fact remains, whatever be his state of sobriety, that the respondent was unable to furnish any explanation as to why he had attacked the victim. 
     
      
       
      
    15 His Honour accepted that the fact that the victim was “vulnerable”, in the sense in which that expression is used in s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, was a matter which aggravated the offence. Her vulnerability, his Honour found, was “evidenced from her age and the obvious frailty that would go with a woman of such age”. 
     
      
    16 As I have said, the respondent gave evidence at the sentence hearing. A large number of testimonials and other reports were tendered on his behalf. The respondent had just turned 18 at the time of the offence. He was living with his parents at the time and had been in gainful employment since leaving school at the end of Year 10. He was also undertaking a TAFE course. His father was described as being a very heavy drinker and a chronic gambler who was abusive towards his mother. That had led his parents to separate for a period of time although they had later reconciled. Indeed, the respondent was working with his father at the time of his arrest. 
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge referred to the factors, which he concluded served to ameliorate the otherwise appropriate sentence, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Clearly this crime was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. The offender has no prior record of any sort and he was previously of good character. Indeed having regard to some of the evidence and the references, it might be suggested that he was of very good character. Having regard to these circumstances, the various reports before me, and his presentation in the witness box, I am satisfied that he is unlikely to re-offend. I am also satisfied that this offender has very good prospects of rehabilitation. Those prospects arise not just by reason of his very young age, he having been just over the age of eighteen at the time of the offence, but there is also significant family support, which is demonstrated in the documentation and references and also by the number of people who have attended here in court today to demonstrate that support. In particular he has shown insight in the sense that he seems to have accepted that the only explicable cause of his behaviour was alcohol, as to which he has vowed never to consume alcohol ever again. I accept that that clearly is his present intention and I can only hope that it will remain so in the future, having regard to what seems to be its potential in terms of affecting him. 
        
       
       
        
        I turn to the question of remorse, which I think plays an important part in these proceedings. I am satisfied that there is genuine remorse of a significant nature, which has been demonstrated from the outset both during the ERISP interview, in the interviews by doctors and in the witness box here today. Specifically he has given evidence, which I accept, that he has accepted responsibility for his actions, even though he cannot remember what he did in precise terms and, secondly, that he has acknowledged the injury and damage caused by his actions. In particular I have regard to his spontaneous handwritten apology, which he wrote whilst in prison some months after the events in question, which he intended to send to the victim but on the advice of his lawyers, for reasons I am unable to comprehend, did not do so. But I accept that letter as a spontaneous expression of genuine regret, remorse and contrition. 
        
       
       
        
        There was pre-trial disclosure and also a plea of guilty at the earliest possible opportunity, in respect of which he is entitled to the full utilitarian discount. The defence argued that I should allow an additional discount beyond the utilitarian 25 per cent, based upon the fact that neither the offender nor the victim has any memory for the episode. Whilst I am not persuaded that that is a relevant factor, I am persuaded that it is appropriate to allow further discount to have regard to the level of his contrition and remorse to which I have referred. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst he is and was at the time of the act technically an adult, his age clearly is a factor which would be taken into account in accordance with the cases which say that in respect of a person of this age the objective of rehabilitation should be more pronounced than that of deterrence. 
        
       
       
        
        Although general deterrence, and even particular deterrence to this offender are important, in setting the sentence, particularly in respect of a crime as serious as this, I will give more weight to rehabilitation than deterrence. I also accept the evidence of the offender’s inexperience with alcohol and for those reasons I am satisfied that the episode involved was something of an aberration in an otherwise unblemished life in the community. 
        
       
       
        
        I am also cognisant that, having regard to the nature of the offence, his time in gaol will be harsher than it would be for others due not just to his age but also to the fact that he will be under a high level of security and protection for most of his period of imprisonment and his access to amenities such as courses and the like will be correspondingly diminished. 
        
       
      
    18 A little later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        In this case there are clear special circumstances which I find, being the fact that this was the first and only offence that this offender has committed, his extreme youth, his potential for rehabilitation, the unlikelihood of his re-offending and the need for an extended period of supervision following the non-parole period in which he will be imprisoned. 
        
       
      
    19 The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. The Crown submitted that there were a number of errors committed by the sentencing judge which led to the imposition of such a sentence. They were described in the following fashion: 
     
      
    · His Honour erred in determining that the objective severity of the offence fell within the middle of the mid range for this type of offence. 
     
      
    · His Honour erred in the application of the standard non parole period. 
     
      
    · His Honour erred in finding that the respondent has very good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    · His Honour erred in finding that the respondent is unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    · His Honour erred in giving undue weight to the respondent’s youth, given the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    · His Honour erred in failing to take into account the matters on the Form 1 so as to reflect the totality of criminality. 
     
      
    20 In Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13, the High Court observed that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [t]he particular principle which the Director sought to invoke in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentence passed upon the present appellant was the last category of case identified in the well-known classification stated in  
        House v R 
        :  
         
          
         
        
       
       … 
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        The Director’s allegation in his notice of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the sentence passed was “manifestly inadequate”, was an allegation of this kind of error. It was not an allegation that the primary judge had acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her, had mistaken the facts or had not taken into account some material consideration. If a case of specific error of any of those kinds was to be made it would have been necessary to identify the asserted error in the grounds of appeal. But as indicated at the outset, no case of specific error was alleged; the sole ground of appeal was manifest inadequacy of sentence. 
         
         
        In support of that ground of appeal the Director submitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal that there were three reasons the sentence was manifestly inadequate… 
        
       
       
        
        …it is as well to point out that none of the three matters identified by the Director was, or was advanced as being, an error of principle or fact such as would have enlivened any of the forms of error identified in  
        House v R 
         other than the last category.  
        Each of the three arguments advanced was put as no more than some explanation for what was alleged to be a sentence which, on its face, was “unreasonable or plainly unjust 
        ”. (at paras 8-9) (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    21 It is apparent from the written submissions relied upon by the Crown that the present appeal falls into the same category as the case with which the court was dealing in Carroll (supra). 
     
      
    22 It is convenient to first deal with the complaint that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence fell into the mid-range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type. In seeking to justify the sentencing judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, counsel for the respondent pointed out, that s61J of the Crimes Act encompasses a wide range of offences. Counsel went on to observe that a number of features which may serve to aggravate the offence, such as a case in which the victim is a child, or in which the offence is committed in company or in which a weapon is used, were absent from the present case. So much may be accepted but that consideration, in my view, does not diminish the fact that the present offence was one of very considerable gravity. The injuries which the victim sustained, including those to her genital area, suggest that considerable force was used by the respondent. Moreover, he was a fit, strong young man who was able to easily overpower the victim who was a small, frail woman in her 80s. One can only imagine the terror and sense of isolation that she must have felt particularly as she was a visitor to this country and unable to speak the language. Moreover, the fact that the offence was committed in full view of members of the public added an unpleasant extra dimension to the offence. The sentencing judge understandably described the offence as involving a “nasty vicious attack” upon the victim. 
     
      
    23 It is well-established that this Court should be loathe to find error in an assessment by a first instance judge of the objective seriousness of an offence: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 [at paras 37, 46]; Deng v R (2007) 176 A Crim R 1 [at paras 69-71]. Even though I regard his Honour’s assessment as being a generous one, I am unable to conclude that the impugned finding was not open to him. Accordingly I would not be disposed to find error upon this basis. 
     
      
    24 The Crown next complains that, even if it was open to the sentencing judge to find that the offence lay within the mid-range of objective seriousness, his Honour nevertheless erred “in the application of the standard non-parole period”. The correct approach to be followed in relation to this question is well-settled: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; Anderson v R [2008] NSWCCA 211. The sentencing judge approached this issue in the following fashion: 
     
      
       
        
        Having found this offence to be within the mid range objective seriousness, I need to deal with the standard non-parole period which the court is required to impose unless it determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard period. The maximum penalty is and remains the primary expression of legislative intention as to the seriousness of a particular offence. The question to be asked is whether there are reasons for not imposing a standard non-parole period, considering both the facts, including those explaining why an offence was committed, and the circumstances of aggravation and mitigation. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, there are in this case factors that do call for a departure from the standard non-parole period, both in respect of the facts which explain or which by inference must explain why this offence was committed, and in the circumstances of mitigation to which I have referred which, when weighed against the circumstances of aggravation, far exceed them. 
        
       
      
    25 Due allowance must of course be made for the fact that the remarks on sentence were made ex-tempore during the course of what was no doubt a very busy list. Nevertheless it does not appear to me that the sentencing judge has sufficiently complied with the statutory requirement to state his reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. Those reasons need to be stated with some specificity and the greater the departure from the standard non-parole period, the more compelling the reasons need to be. That said, clearly enough there were reasons which warranted such a departure. The authorities make clear, as counsel for the respondent pointed out, that the standard non-parole period is not to be treated as either a “straitjacket” or even as a “starting point”. Furthermore, by reason of the plea of guilty, the standard non-parole period operated as a “guidepost” to the imposition of the appropriate sentence. It is also clear that there were other significant features of the respondent’s case which were to be weighed in the balance including his youth, his prior good character and his expression of remorse. But even allowing for those factors to be given their full weight, I am unable to discern how the non-parole period which was imposed could have been arrived at using the standard non-parole period as a “guidepost”. In my opinion the reasons for departure could not justify the difference between the standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment, as a guide, and the 3 years imprisonment at which the sentencing judge arrived. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    26 Complaint was also made by the Crown about the findings which the sentencing judge made about various aspects of the respondent’s subjective case. They included the weight given to the respondent’s youth, the fact that he was said to have “very good prospects” of rehabilitation and that he was unlikely to re-offend. In essence, this complaint is closely allied to the submission with which I have just dealt. It is to the effect that the sentencing judge, in imposing the sentence which he did, clearly gave too much weight to the various aspects of the respondent’s subjective case. In view of what I have already said about the issue, it is unnecessary to deal with the current complaint at any great length. The respondent’s prior good character, his plea of guilty and expressions of remorse, his age, and his stable employment all pointed in the direction of his having favourable prospects of being rehabilitated. Nevertheless, his Honour’s findings about his prospects in that respect and the likelihood of his re-offending must be regarded as somewhat surprising given, as I have said, that no satisfactory explanation was forthcoming as to why he had committed the offence. I do not see how those findings could be made when the sentencing judge found that an aspect of the respondent’s personality or psyche had been triggered. The Crown concedes, and properly so, that the sentencing judge was entitled to give weight to the respondent’s youth in accordance with well established principles. See, for example, R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112; R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; R v AEM Snr [2002] NSWCCA 58; MS2 & Ors v R (2005) 158 A Crim R 93. However, I accept the Crown’s contention that his Honour’s repeated references to the matter suggest that there has been an element of “double-counting”. 
     
      
    27 Criticism is also made of the following finding made by his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        There are other offences that I am required to take into account arising out of the circumstances, namely the assault on the police officer and the resist the police officer during the course of his arrest. However, no one suggested that those matters should be taken into account in the sentencing process so as to increase it. Nevertheless, I take those matters into account. 
        
       
      
    28 The Crown’s representative at first instance quite properly conceded that the matters on the Form 1 were minor matters and “would not vary [the overall sentence] significantly”. It appears to be common ground that the sentencing judge somewhat overstated the position in that passage to which I have just referred. Nonetheless, those matters could not have had any meaningful impact upon the ultimate sentence to be imposed in this particular case. Even if his Honour did err in respect of this matter, it was, in my view, of little moment in the context of the present sentencing exercise.  
     
      
    29 The principles governing the determination of Crown appeals are well-established and do not require repetition for present purposes: see generally R v Wall (2002) 71 NSWLR 692 at 707. Notwithstanding those considerations, I have reached the view that the Crown appeal must be upheld. I do not accept the respondent’s submission that the sentence which was imposed was merely lenient. On the contrary, I find it impossible to escape the conclusion that it was manifestly inadequate. Upon the question of resentencing an affidavit sworn by the respondent’s mother was read. I do not discern in that affidavit, or in any of the other material, any basis upon which the Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene even though error has been established.  
     
      
    30 Given the normal constraints, referred to in Wall (supra), which operate in respect of a Crown appeal, the sentence which I propose should now be imposed is considerably less than the sentence which, in my view, ought to have been imposed at first instance. I would confirm the finding of “special circumstances” for the reasons given by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    31 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Allow the Crown appeal. 
       
       
      2 Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court. 
       
       
      3 In substitution therefore sentence the respondent to a non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment to commence on 11 May 2008 and to expire on 10 May 2012 with a total term of 6 years 6 months imprisonment to expire on 10 November 2014. 
       
       
      4. The respondent will be eligible for parole on 10 May 2012.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The two accused are charged with the murder of their seven year old daughter “Ebony” who died of chronic malnutrition caused by starvation. 
     
      
    2 At the close of the Crown case yesterday afternoon, Mr Austin, counsel for the accused BW, and Mr Stewart, counsel for the accused SW, both made application for me to direct the jury to return verdicts of not guilty on the charge of murder. They both conceded that there was a parental duty of care in the accused in respect of the deceased and that there was evidence of an omission by the Accused to provide nourishment for the deceased or to secure medical attention for her that was a substantial cause of her death. However, they each submitted that there was no evidence capable of establishing the mental element the Crown has endeavoured to establish in this trial, that is that the accused, each of them, by their omission, intended to cause the death of Ebony, or that they realised that she would probably die but persisted with the omission to nourish her or get medical attention.3 Very briefly stated the Crown case is that the accused were the parents of Ebony, who was aged 7 at the time of her death in November 2007. She had been born on 22 March 2000. The evidence is that they lived under the one roof with her at the time of her death and did so at all stages of her life up until that point. The deceased had two older sisters who also lived in the family home. 4 There has been a lot of evidence in the Crown case about contact between the deceased and various medical practitioners during her short life. She had a condition of global developmental delay and in April 2005 was diagnosed with autism. The autism brought about behaviours that were difficult for a parent to manage. In her early years she failed to thrive and was slow to reach various milestones including walking and speech. She was significantly underweight by reference to the normal ranges for girls of her age. She was subjected to a variety of medical testing and investigation that revealed no known medical cause for her small stature and low body weight. By March 2005, however, she was found to have increased in weight to an extent that placed her in the 75th percentile for girls of her age. She was described as well nourished.5 Whilst, as I have said, there was a lot of evidence about the deceased being presented to various medical practitioners, there was also a lot of evidence of efforts by medical professionals that were made to assist the child with programs and interventions, for example speech therapy, that were either not taken up at all or not fully pursued by the parents. There was evidence of a lot of missed appointments and cancelled appointments. Arrangements were made for the deceased to enrol in a special school but she never attended.6 There is evidence that on 14 February 2006, when the deceased was at the Sydney Children’s Hospital for a minor surgical procedure, she was weighed and found to be 20.5 kilograms, which was in the 75th percentile. Dr Dimitra Tzioumi, a paediatrician, gave evidence that if she had maintained her weight in that percentile she would have weighed in the order of 26 kilograms in November 2007. Dr Tzioumi also said that there was no known medical reason why she could not have maintained a weight at that percentile if she had continued to be properly nourished. 7 Dr Stamatios Ktenas was a general practitioner who attended to the deceased from the age of 12 months. He provided various vaccinations and regularly took measures of height and weight and attended to general medical needs. He also provided referrals to various specialists. He noted that the child was underweight when he saw her between March 2001 and September 2003. He did not see her again until February 2006. Other doctors had seen the deceased in the intervening period. When Dr Ktenas saw her again in February 2006 he noted that she had become quite a chubby 6 year old. He saw her again the following month and gave her the final vaccinations required before she entered school. He said she still looked as healthy as when he saw her the previous month. He did not see her again. As far as is known, the next doctor to see the deceased was the forensic pathologist. However, there is evidence of each of the Accused attending upon doctors for their own medical needs in that period. 8 There is no evidence as to when the death occurred apart from what has been disclosed by the two accused. What they have told investigators is to the effect that the child was fine on the evening of Friday 2 November 2007 but that when SW rose on the morning of Saturday 3 November 2007 at around 7.00am she found the child to be dead. 9 Ambulance officer Diamond said that he asked the parents whether Ebony had been unwell or whether there was any reason to expect she was going to pass away. He said that BW told him, “she was playing last night and everything was okay”. SW added, “she hasn’t coped with the move up from Sydney very well. She had vomiting and diarrhoea over the past week and hasn’t eaten well since the move from Sydney”. I should add at this point that the family had lived for most of the deceased’s life at Matraville but that at the end of August 2007 they moved to Hawks Nest. 10 BW told police in an interview on 5 November 2007 that he was out for part of the day on Friday 2 November 2007. Before he left he saw Ebony eat breakfast and she had some milk or juice with it. He said she seemed physically well at that time. He arrived home late in the afternoon. Ebony did not appear to be ill in any way. She was eating her evening meal. He last saw her at about 8 o’clock sitting on the lounge staring at the television with a blank look on her face. His wife then took her to bed. He said that since the family moved to Hawks Nest the child did not appear to be as happy as before. Her eating patterns changed. She was still drinking “a stack of fluids” and eating “a lot of big breakfasts” but did not have as much for lunch or dinner. He said she looked a little bit thinner but not a lot. He said the child had not seen a doctor since they came to Hawks Nest because he did not think there was any need. He said in the last couple of days she was happy, bubbly and smiling. 11 During the course of police executing a search warrant at the Hawks Nest home on 9 November 2007, SW told investigators that, in effect, the child used to eat sometimes “massive meals” but that after moving to Hawks Nest “she started off still with a rather big appetite, and then she just went down, down, down, down and she didn’t, wasn’t really interested (in) anything at all”. She said the child was rarely sick and apart from a few sniffles, the cold or the flu, she had been fine. She described the child as being somewhat lost in the new environment and would be walking around trying to find familiar things. She said the child was just picking at her food. She would eat things like baked beans but whereas in the past she would have a whole bowl, she was just having a couple of spoonfuls and then would push the food away. She was asked whether she became concerned when the child started going off her food and she said that she was not. She thought she was just adjusting to the new environment and that she would pick up and be alright. There had been times in the past when she had lost weight and SW was able to build her up again. She was asked if she noticed whether the child was losing weight and she said it was hard to tell. She said she “had a hell of a lot to drink”. Asked whether the child became quite frail she said, “No, well, she was still walking around. She was still making a sound. She was still gesturing as to what she needed. She was still getting up, going to the fridge … She was still eating, she was still drinking. She was still doing everything she was doing before and everything but not to the extent that she… would normally do”. 12 The evidence of the forensic pathologist, Dr Kasinathan Nadesan, which must be taken into account when taking the Crown case at its highest, was to quite a contrary effect. He said that when he first saw the deceased in her bedroom at the Hawks Nest house on the evening of Saturday 3 November 2007 he saw “a little child dead, obviously, in an extreme degree of emaciation and wasted and dehydrated. It looked almost like a mummy to me”. The body was dressed in clothing and there was a very strong smell of urine and other unpleasant body odours emanating from the clothing and the body. Staining on the clothing and the bedding was, he thought, possibly from a combination of vomit and faecal stains and body fluids. Even after the clothing was removed and the body was washed at the morgue there remained a strong smell of urine. The hair was long and heavily matted with dirt and various solid particles trapped within it. There was an absence of rigor mortis because there were virtually no muscles, they had wasted away. There was little subcutaneous fat. The eyeballs were sunken. Much of the body was just skin and bones. The abdomen was what he described as scaphoid which he explained meant it had “sort of gone inside, that’s usually a common finding in people who have been malnourished, emaciated and wasted and also it gave a bluish green discolouration indicating that decomposition had set in”. On post mortem examination he found some evidence of atrophy of the brain and some internal organs, indicating chronic or long term malnourishment. He found the lungs to be in a state indicative of someone who did not go outdoors and be exposed to the environment. There was a very hard piece of faecal material in the large bowel, a typical finding in a person who has not taken any food or nutrition over a period of time. 13 Dr Nadesan’s opinion was that death was due to starvation and neglect. He said that it was most likely that the deceased would not have been able to get out of bed or move unassisted, not just in the preceding 24 hours but likely in the weeks preceding her death. He then qualified that by saying “maybe a couple of weeks ... I cannot comment to that extreme, but within the preceding few days, certainly she would have”. He very much doubted that she was capable of feeding herself for days to weeks prior to her death. He said that it was very likely that the deceased “would have been in a stuporous, semiconscious, or even unconscious state during the last few days. Maybe semiconscious or drowsy, sort of, during the last few weeks”. 14 In cross examination, Dr Nadesan said that at most he would have expected the deceased to have been capable of little flickering movements but incapable of any real purposeful movements. He was asked about the proposition of the child having been able to walk to a lounge, sit down and watch television the night before her death and he said that was “totally impossible”. 15 Dr Edward O’Loughlin, a specialist paediatric gastroenterologist at the Sydney Children’s Hospital, was also of the opinion that the cause of death was malnutrition caused by starvation and profound neglect. Various features of the body indicated to him that there had been severe vitamin deficiency. The finding on post mortem of faecal material in the child’s matted hair, the pervading smell of urine and the staining of the bedding material supported the finding of neglect. The lack of any food in the gastrointestinal tract indicated that it had been more than 24 hours since any solid food had been consumed. He said that for the child to get to the emaciated state in which she was, it would have taken a couple of weeks if she was getting no food or many months if she was receiving some food. He said, “she was very severely wasted I would have said that would have taken weeks, as a minimum, to get into that state”. The presence of hard faecal material in the large intestine indicated there was very little contribution from dietary input. He said, “It has been there for a long time and it indicates lack of solid food intake”. It would have been there for days to a couple of weeks. Dr O’Loughlin had come into contact with many hundreds of children who were suffering from malnutrition for a variety of reasons in his 25 years of practice but he said that Ebony was the most malnourished child he had ever seen. He said that malnutrition was possible to treat and the patient saved even if only hours from death. The level of muscle wastage indicated to him that she would have been incapable of getting out of bed, walking, feeding or dressing herself and that would have been evident for days or weeks. He thought it very unlikely that in her last days she would have been capable of eating or drinking.16 Dr O’Loughlin was taken to the evidence elsewhere in the Crown case that indicated that in the period March 2005 to February 2006 Ebony appeared well nourished. He said that this indicated that the child did not have a significant acute nutritional problem and she exhibited a capacity at that age to be normally nourished. This suggested to him that she probably did not have an underlying chronic disorder going way back to earlier in life leading to her malnutrition. She had exhibited a capacity to put on and maintain a reasonable weight. The fact that she deteriorated from that appearance to the post-mortem appearance in the space of two or three years, indicated to him that some process intervened to cause her to become severely malnourished, unlikely to be related to a chronic disease. The doctor was of the opinion that because of the severe muscle wasting she would have been unable to sit and even unable to support her own head, let alone be able to stand. Dr O’Loughlin was asked about the photographs taken of the deceased at the house and later at the post-mortem and asked if her appearance in them was something that occurred in the 24 hours or the three to four days preceding her death. He said, “Definitely not”.17 Taking the Crown case at its highest, as I must do in considering an application for a directed verdict of acquittal (see Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207), I must proceed on the basis that the jury would accept the evidence of Dr Nadesan and Dr O’Loughlin. That evidence would show that the accounts given by each of the accused to the police about the appearance and behaviour of the deceased in the period immediately preceding her death were demonstrably false.18 Counsel each submitted that it was necessary for there to be direct evidence of the state of mind of the accused before the mental element of murder could be established. It was submitted that it is not sufficient that any reasonable person in the position of the accused would have the required mental state, and this submission was focussed on the realisation of the probability of death. I accept that. The test is a subjective, rather than objective one: R v Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25.  
     
      
    19 Mr Stewart sought to contrast the facts of this case with those in R v Styman; R v Taber [2004] NSWCCA 245 on the basis that in that case the accused did something that put the deceased in the danger that ultimately led to her death and in this case the danger arose without any positive act by the accused. I understand the submission was intended to be that where there is some act by an accused that puts a person in peril of death, there is no need for there to be direct evidence of the person’s mental state but where there is an absence of such an act it is necessary for the Crown to point to some direct evidence. I do not accept the submission that there is a requirement for direct evidence in any situation in which the Crown must prove an intention or some other relevant mental state. No authority was cited in support of such a proposition. It is often the case that there is no such direct evidence as to what was operating in an accused’s mind at the time the person did some act or failed to do some act. That is why juries are directed in such a situation that the state of mind of the accused can be established by inference from the surrounding circumstances. 20 The suggested direction in the Criminal Trials Bench Book on the subject of proof of intention includes reference to the drawing of inferences from the circumstances attending the event in question and the conduct of the accused before, during and after the event. It includes reference to the person’s acts themselves providing the most convincing evidence of the person’s intention. It also suggests that a jury be directed that “where a specific result is the obvious and inevitable consequence of a person’s act, and where the person deliberately does that act, the jury may readily conclude that the person did the act with the intention of achieving the specific result. With modification of the direction, including to refer to omissions rather than acts, that seems to me a most appropriate direction to give in the present case. 21 The evidence I have reviewed is, in my view, clearly capable of establishing that the appearance and behaviour of Ebony prior to her death was such that anybody, the accused included, would have realised that she was in dire jeopardy and that without nourishment and/or medical attention she would not just probably but certainly die. One need only just look at the photographs of her in Exhibit C to accept that. The description of the body as just a skeleton covered in skin is most apt. The evidence of Dr Nadesan and Dr O’Loughlin that in her last day or days the child would most likely have been incapable of movement, incapable of eating or drinking, and would have been in a semi-conscious or even comatose state is powerful confirmation that any person who had the duty of care that the accused did and who, by the omission to do anything about it, allowed that state of affairs to continue, either intended that the child die or realised that she would probably die. In my view it would be open to the jury, if they accept this type of evidence that the Crown relies upon, to draw the inference that the accused must have known, and did in fact know, that the child would probably die if he or she did nothing to provide her with nourishment and/or obtain medical treatment for her. The jury could thus be satisfied of the reckless indifference element, or be satisfied that with a realisation that the child would die and by doing nothing to prevent it, there was an intention that the child die. There is sufficient evidence upon which each accused may be convicted of the charge of murder: May v O’Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654.22 These are my reasons for refusing the applications made yesterday at the close of the Crown case.

      JUDGMENT (No. 16) (On further application by media interests to publish or broadcast photographs within Exhibit B) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: Following the return of verdicts by the jury on 5 June 2009, application was made by Nationwide News Pty Limited, the Seven Network Limited and the Nine Network Limited for the release of certain photographs of Gloria Thomas, which were exhibits in the trial, so that those photographs may be published or broadcast in conjunction with the reporting of the trial by the media.  
     
      
       
      The Media Application During the Trial 
       
      
    2 The background to the present application may be found in my judgment R v Sam (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 543, a judgment delivered on 6 May 2009. For reasons appearing in that judgment, I declined the media application which was confined at that time to photographs 1 to 6 and 15 in Exhibit B. In paragraph 10 of that judgment, I said: 
     
      
       
        
         “The photographs in Exhibit B, which are the subject of this application, are a selection only of the photographs of Gloria which are in evidence. Photographs 1 - 6 were taken between 18 July 2001 and 14 October 2001 and depict an apparently happy and healthy baby. Photograph 15 was taken on 13 February 2002 and depicts visible signs of the condition affecting the child, albeit with the child sitting on a chair and with the condition not being as graphic as it is in the remaining photographs within Exhibit B. The media do not seek to publish other more graphic photographs within Exhibit B."" 
        
       
      
    3 At paragraph 29 of that judgment, I observed that it remained open to the media interests to make application at a later time after verdict with respect to publication of the photographs. I indicated, however, that in the circumstances of the case and in the exercise of discretion, for the reasons set out in my judgment, I was not prepared at that time to release the subject paragraphs in Exhibit B to the media so as to permit their publication or broadcast. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on the Present Application 
       
      
    4 In the present application, the media interests seek release of all 17 photographs in Exhibit B so that those photographs may be published or broadcast.  
     
      
    5 Ms Chrysanthou, counsel for the media interests, refers to s.314 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and Supreme Court Practice Note SC Gen 2 entitled ""Access to Court Files"" in support of the application.  
     
      
    6 Counsel handed up a letter dated 5 June 2009 from Ms Gina McWilliams, legal counsel for Nationwide News Pty Limited, in support of the application. In addition to submissions advanced in support of the application, that letter stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Media Applicants remain of the view that publication of the photographs is vital to the public's understanding of case: of baby Gloria's condition, the decline in her health, the arguments made during the trial and the verdict reached by the jury. However, the Media Applicants note that should any of the tendered photographs showing baby Gloria's genitals be selected for publication, steps will be taken to either pixillate or obscure her genitals as appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    7 In support of the application, Ms Chrysanthou emphasised the open justice principle, the fact that the trial was over and that the impact of publication of the photographs on the jury (an issue relied upon by me for refusing the application during the trial) had now passed with the verdicts delivered by the jury. Reliance was placed on the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Burrell v R [2008] NSWCCA 276 at [17] to [19] in support of the proposition that the relevant test is whether an order declining the media application is necessary in the administration of justice. Counsel submitted that no necessity had been demonstrated for declining to release all the photographs (or, at least, those in photographs 1 to 6 and 15) and that an order for release ought be made.  
     
      
    8 On instructions from the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, the Crown did not oppose the release of photographs 1 to 6 but did oppose the release of photographs 7 to 17 in Exhibit B. The Crown submitted that it was not appropriate that photographs of baby Gloria, in her afflicted state, be released for further publication or broadcast.  
     
      
    9 Ms Davenport SC, for Mr Sam, opposed the application in its entirety. She sought to distinguish Burrell v R and pointed to the potential negative consequences of publication which may flow to Gloria's three-year old sibling. Mr Molomby SC, for Mrs Sam, opposed the application and submitted, amongst other things, that negative consequences may flow from the type of widespread electronic dissemination of the photographs which might be anticipated in this case.  
     
      
    10 I raised with counsel the relevance of the Victims Rights Act 1996 to this application. The Crown and senior counsel for each Offender accepted that the Act may have some application to this case. I will return to this issue.  
     
      
       
      Determination of Application 
       
      
    11 A number of principles emerge from the authorities.  
     
      
    12 As the trial judge, I have a discretion whether to release the photographic exhibits for further publication in this way by the media: R v Xu (No. 1) (2005) 152 A Crim R 17 at 20 [21]; R v Benbrika (No. 26) [2008] VSC 452 at [4]; R v Sam (No. 5) at [6].  
     
      
    13 As Spigelman CJ observed in John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v Ryde Local Court (2005) 62 NSWLR 512 at 521 [29]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Neither the  
        [media] 
         nor the public at large, have a right of access to court documents. The ‘principle of open justice’ is a principle, it is not a freestanding right. It does not create some form of freedom of information Act applicable to courts. As a principle, it is of significance in guiding the court in determining a range of matters including, relevantly, when an application for access should be granted pursuant to an express or implied power to grant access. However, it remains a principle and not a right.""  
        
       
       
      See also  
      Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No. 9)  
      (2005) 148 FCR 1 at 7-9 [21]-[28]. 
       
      
    14 Practice Notes are important in influencing the practice and procedure of the Court, but they are not rules of court. Their principal function is to provide guidance to the profession as to how the broad discretion conferred on the Court in relation to access to court files is exercised: HIH Insurance Limited (In Liquidation) v General Re Insurance Australia Limited [2006] NSWSC 128 at [10].  
     
      
    15 The entitlement of the media to report on court proceedings is a corollary of the right of access to the Court by members of the public, and nothing should be done to discourage a fair and accurate reporting of proceedings: John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales(2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at 353 [20]; O'Shane v Burwood Local Court (2007) 178 A Crim R 392 at 397-8 [19]-[21]. 
     
      
    16 It has been said that the media are “the eyes and ears of the general public”, not all of who can attend the Court proceedings: Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers (No. 2) (1990) 1 AC 109 at 183; R v Strawhorn (No. 2) [2006] VSC 433 [31].  
     
      
    17 The Victims Rights Act 1996, in my view, has some bearing on the application. Section 5 of that Act defines a ""victim of crime"" as including a person who suffers harm as a direct result of an act committed in the course of a criminal offence. Section 5(3) provides that, if “the person” dies as a result of the act concerned, the definition of “victim of crime” extends to the person’s immediate family. In my view, s.5(3) makes clear that a “victim of crime” includes a deceased person.  
     
      
    18 Section 6 Victims Rights Act 1996 provides for a Charter of Rights for Victims of Crime. Section 6.1, entitled “Courtesy, Compassion and Respect” provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “A victim should be treated with courtesy, compassion, cultural sensitivity and respect for the victim’s rights and dignity.” 
        
       
      
    19 Section 7 of the Act provides that the Charter of Victims Rights is, as far as practicable and appropriate, to govern the treatment of victims in the administration of affairs of the State. Section 7(2) provides that any agency or person exercising official functions in the administration of the affairs of the State (other than judicial functions) must, to the extent that it is relevant and practicable to do so, have regard to the Charter of Victims Rights in addition to any other relevant matter. 
     
      
    20 The term ""administration of the affairs of the State"" is defined in s.7(3) to include “the administration of justice, the provision of police services and the administration of any department of the Government”.  
     
      
    21 Section 8 of the Act provides, amongst other things, that the Charter of Victims Rights in s.6 cannot give rise to any civil cause of action and does not operate to create in any person any legal rights not in existence before the enactment of the legislation. 
     
      
    22 There is little authority on the Victims Rights Act 1996. In Ludwig v Public Trustee (2006) 170 A Crim R 460 at 498-499 [237]-[244], Campbell J (as his Honour then was) considered arguments arising, in the context of civil litigation, with respect to ss.6, 7 and 8 Victims Rights Act 1996. Given the nature of that litigation, and the terms of s.8, it was not necessary for his Honour to resolve the arguments advanced in that case.  
     
      
    23 Because of s.7(2) of the Act, which excludes “judicial functions” from the exercise of “official functions in the administration of the affairs of the State”, it might be said that the Act has no application to a decision by a Court. It might also be said that the thrust of this Act concerns living victims of crime, and not matters which may impact upon the rights and dignity of a deceased victim. I accept that the Act applies most commonly to living victims. The terms of the Act make clear that the Charter of Victims Rights applies to a range of circumstances where a victim of crime comes into contact with the criminal justice system at the investigatory, trial and sentencing stages. 24 That said, I am satisfied that s.6.1 is relevant to the present circumstances, where application is made by the media to publish or broadcast photographs of a deceased child victim of crime, including photographs of that child whilst alive, but in an afflicted state as a result of a condition from which the child was suffering at the time. Those matters it seems to me, are capable of bearing upon the dignity of a victim of crime even after the victim is deceased.  
     
      
    25 I apprehend that considerations of that type affected the position of the Crown in submissions made to the Court, given that the Director of Public Prosecutions is a person exercising official functions in the administration of the affairs of the State, including the “administration of justice” within s.7.(3) of the Act.  
     
      
    26 Although s.6 Victims Rights Act 1996 is to be taken into account primarily by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the exercise of his functions, it is relevant also to the task of the Court on the present application. I apprehend that considerations of this type may arise when application is made by the media in other trials for access to photographs which were exhibits in the trial, for the purpose of further publication and broadcast, where the photographs depict the victim of crime in demeaning and undignified circumstances. In my view, the operation of a contemporary criminal justice system in this State accommodates considerations of this type being brought to bear on an application such as this. 
     
      
    27 I have mentioned (at [9] above) submissions made by senior counsel for each Offender, which referred to Gloria’s three-year old sibling. At the time of argument giving rise to my judgments, R v Sam (No. 1) [2009] NSWSC 542 and R v Sam (No. 5), no reference was made by counsel to a younger sibling of Gloria. It is apparent that the younger sibling of Gloria was not born until years after Gloria’s death in May 2002. It may be that the short answer as to why earlier submissions did not refer to this three-year old sibling is that s.11(1)(d) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 extends to a person who is a brother or sister of the victim of the offence “where that person and the victim were both children when the offence was committed”. In this case, the three-year old sibling was not born at the time of the offence of manslaughter in May 2002. (I note that, if a senior available next of kin, who could not include either of the present Offenders (s.11(4F)), is to give consent to publication under s.11(4)(d) of that Act, that next of kin must take into account the impact of publication or broadcasting on a sibling (s.11(4G)). 
     
      
    28 It seems to me that the potential negative impact of publicity, including reproduction of any of the photographs in Exhibit B, upon the three-year old sibling of Gloria at some later time, is not something that bears, in any significant way, upon the present application. The two Offenders have been convicted of Gloria's manslaughter. I do not think that the negative impact that may occur in years to come from the publication of any photographs, combined with any story with respect to the circumstances of this trial, bears substantially on the exercise of discretion.  
     
      
    29 I determined at the outset of the trial that s.11 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 did not have application to this case: R v Sam (No. 1). In reaching that view, I had particular regard to the open justice principle in assessing what the public interest required in this case. I adverted to the open justice principle again in my judgment during the course of the trial: R v Sam (No. 5) at [14]-[15].  
     
      
    30 The trial having now been completed, the present question is what decision ought be made, in the light of the arguments which have been advanced, with respect to the application for all 17 photographs in Exhibit B to be made available for publication or broadcast? 
     
      
    31 I am satisfied that the photographs 7 to 17 in Exhibit B ought not be released. They depict Gloria, in her afflicted state, at times between February and May 2002. In my view, it is necessary that they not be released, in the sense that non-release is reasonably required in the interests of the administration of criminal justice: Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (1999) 198 CLR 435 at 452 [51]; O’Shane v Burwood Local Court at 401 [33]. Gloria is entitled to dignity and respect, even in death. Accordingly, those photographs ought not be released. I do not regard this decision as being a significant erosion upon the open justice principle.  
     
      
    32 In my view, photographs 1 to 6 are in a different category. The Crown did not oppose the release of those photographs. They depict (a fully clothed) Gloria as an apparently happy and healthy child, in the early stages of her life, before she was afflicted by eczema in the way revealed by the evidence.  
     
      
    33 The media are entitled to make a fair and accurate report of proceedings. At times, a fair and accurate report of proceedings will be assisted by photographs, in particular photographs which were in evidence in the trial. I do not think that the ability of the media to publish or broadcast photographs 1 to 6 will undermine the dignity and respect to which Gloria remains entitled.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    34 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the application by the media interests ought be allowed with respect to photographs 1 to 6 in Exhibit B, but declined with respect to photographs 7 to 17 in Exhibit B.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Buddin J. 
     
      
    2 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant originally pleaded guilty to three offences in the Local Court and adhered to those pleas when he appeared for sentence.  
     
      
    3 Count 1 alleged that the applicant on 3 or more separate occasions during a period of 30 consecutive days did supply methylamphetamine (commonly known as ice). That offence, which constituted a contravention of s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. Two further offences on a Form 1 document of supplying methylamphetamine were taken into account when the applicant was sentenced in respect of count 1. Count 2 alleged that the applicant supplied methylamphetamine by operation of the deeming provisions of the same legislation. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. Count 3 alleged that the applicant possessed a prohibited weapon (namely a Taser gun) without a permit. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years is applicable to it. In respect of Count 1, and taking into account the Form 1 matters, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years with a total term of imprisonment of 6 years 3 months. Fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment were imposed upon the applicant in respect of each of counts 2 and 3. Those sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with each other and with the sentence imposed in respect of count 1. 
     
      
    4 The matter proceeded by way of an Agreed Statement of Facts. It revealed that on 3 May 2007 investigators attached to the Asian Crime Squad of the State Crime Command set up a strike force in relation to the distribution of prohibited drugs. The operation, which had the applicant as its target, commenced following the receipt of information from numerous sources to the effect that the applicant was supplying ice. In due course, investigators were granted authority to lawfully intercept the mobile phone service operated by the applicant. Investigators also commenced physical surveillance of the applicant. 
     
      
    5 As a result of information which was gleaned from the intercepted telephone calls, police were able to ascertain the nature and extent of the applicant’s illicit activities. What emerged was that the applicant obtained the ice from a number of alternative supply chains. He then mixed the ice with cutting agents, before supplying the finished product to an established customer base from a shop front which had been established at his residential address. The information also revealed that the applicant supplied the drugs on a daily basis for the purpose of financial gain. 
     
      
    6 From the intercepted telephone calls, police were also able to ascertain that the applicant supplied or agreed to supply ice on twenty-eight separate occasions during the course of the investigation. During the 30 day period from 20 June 2007 the applicant supplied or agreed to supply ice on twenty-four separate occasions (it was that conduct that gave rise to count 1). 
     
      
    7 At about 8 pm on 27 July 2007, the applicant was arrested in the vicinity of his unit. When police searched him they found that he was in possession of a small plastic bag containing 3.3 grams of ice. Police also seized $4,885 in cash which the applicant maintained he had borrowed from people whom he would not identify. When they searched the applicant’s premises, police seized the applicant’s mobile phone, 54.6 grams of cannabis leaf and 4 ecstasy tablets. They also seized a further 20.18 grams of ice (that seizure together with the 3.3 grams found in his possession gave rise to count 2). The applicant told police that he “smoked” the ice. Other drug paraphernalia, such as digital weighing scales, a large number of clear resealable bags, aluminium foil and various cutting agents were also located. Police also discovered the Taser gun and 47 rounds of live .22 calibre ammunition (count 3). The applicant declined an opportunity to be interviewed by police and was subsequently charged. 
     
      
    8 Based upon what could be ascertained from the intercepted telephone material, police estimated that the applicant supplied a minimum of 115.3 grams of prohibited drugs, predominantly ice, during the period between 20 June and 27 July 2007. The total sale value was estimated to have been a minimum of $28,800. 
     
      
    9 The following schedule, which sets out the various transactions that were discussed in the intercepted telephone material, was provided to the sentencing judge:

        27/7/07 3.5 g cocaine (“Charlie”) – he is supplying it on. He is purchasing it to supply on. 
        
       
       
        
        Total 115.3 gr 
        
       
      
    10 The supplies of 10 grams on 24 July and 7 grams on 26 July respectively, which appear in the schedule, gave rise to the two matters on the Form 1. 
     
      
    11 The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant was supplying “not only ice, but other drugs, and he did so on a scale which is in the scheme of things, fairly large”. His Honour also found that the applicant “was running a regular business for the supply of drugs over a period which he said in evidence was up to six months, and although the quantity of drugs is perhaps not as great as has come before the courts on other occasions it is still significant”. 
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge was provided with information about the applicant’s background in a pre-sentence report and in a report prepared by a consultant psychologist, Stephen Woods. The applicant also gave evidence during the course of the sentence proceedings. 
     
      
    13 That material disclosed that the applicant was 31 at the time of the offence having come to Australia with his family at the age of 15 from Taiwan. He attended high school for several years but found the experience to be unsatisfactory. He married when he was 21 but is now divorced. There are two children from that relationship. The applicant trained as a baker and went into partnership with another man running bread shops. When the business failed, the applicant became depressed. The sentencing judge found that the applicant “started to use ice to deal with his depression [and that] that use developed into a serious addiction … the addiction led [him] into a situation where he began to supply ice to other people in order to get money for his own use of the drug.” The applicant is one of three children. His older brother suffers from Downs Syndrome and now lives mainly in Vietnam with his father who has a business there. The applicant’s mother lives in Sydney and is the primary carer for the applicant’s brother when he is in this country. The evidence before the sentencing judge established that she had recently had a knee operation and that she suffers from macular degeneration. The applicant’s incarceration prevents him from providing his mother with the assistance in caring for his brother which he would otherwise have been able to give. 
     
      
    14 The applicant, who was unemployed at the time of the offence, had no relevant prior criminal history. A discount of 25% was extended to him to reflect his early plea of guilty. The sentencing judge also referred to the fact that the applicant was serving, and was likely to continue serving, his sentence in protective custody. His Honour observed that, as a consequence, the applicant’s access to recreational facilities and educational programs was somewhat restricted. Because he was one of only two Asians in that particular unit of the gaol, his Honour found that the applicant felt isolated particularly as he was also unable to obtain Asian food. His Honour made a finding of “special circumstances” although he did not give reasons for having done so. 
     
      
    15 The applicant notified that he wished to rely upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1 That the sentence imposed by the Learned Sentencing Judge was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offences. 
        
       
       
        
        2 That the sentencing Judge erred in finding that the appellant supplied ice on twenty-eight (28) separate occasions,  
        usually half an ounce or an 
         ounce. 
        
       
       
        
        3 That the Sentencing Judge erred in failing to afford a greater discount on sentence in respect of the appellant’s assistance to authorities in combination with the offender serving his sentence in harsh conditions by virtue of that co-operation and his ethnicity. 
        
       
      
    16 At the hearing of the application, counsel for the applicant indicated that he would not be pressing ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    17 It is convenient to deal with this ground of appeal first. During the course of his remarks on sentence, his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        There is no doubt that he was involved in a commercial operation for financial gain. He was observed to supply ice on twenty-eight separate occasions, usually half an ounce or an ounce between 20 June and 20 July. 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour was then interrupted by the representative of the Crown and the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        HUDSON: I think it was half a gram your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Half an ounce it says in the agreed facts. Between seven and fourteen grams on each occasion. Page two of the agreed facts. 
        
       
       
        
        HUDSON: Pardon me your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: If I am wrong you can correct me later. 
        
       
      
    19 It is common ground that the sentencing judge was merely reciting verbatim what appeared in the Agreed Statement of Facts. It is also agreed that the reference in that document to “the usual amount supplied [being] between 7 and 14 grams (that is half an ounce and an ounce)” was simply wrong. It is axiomatic that an Agreed Statement of Facts should contain information that is completely accurate. It is regrettable that the material which was presented to the sentencing judge in the present case was not. However, in my view, the error did not infect the sentencing process because the schedule, upon which the sentencing judge plainly relied, quite clearly reflected the correct position. The schedule also identifies, where it is possible to do so, the quantity of drugs that were discussed on each separate occasion. The fact that neither representative saw fit to take up the sentencing judge’s invitation to correct any errors which he may have made, confirms my view that the matter was not seen by those appearing at first instance to be of any real moment. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    20 It is now convenient to deal with this ground which, in effect, asserts that the sentences were manifestly excessive. In support of this ground, the applicant’s legal representative placed emphasis upon a remark made by his Honour that “it’s the most serious case of this type that I’ve had to deal with”. In support of his submission that error had been thus established, the applicant’s legal representative referred to frequently cited passages from the decisions in Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447; Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 and R v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120. Those passages however are concerned with an offence which falls within the worst category of case. Nothing in either the remarks on sentence or in the sentence itself could possibly suggest that the sentencing judge regarded the present offence as being in that category. In any event, his Honour’s remarks were made during the course of submissions and formed no part of the remarks on sentence. Furthermore, his Honour’s remarks need to be read in context. What his Honour actually said was that “I’ve dealt with a number of these cases and I think it’s the most serious case of this type that I’ve had to deal with”. I can discern nothing about those remarks which would suggest error. 
     
      
    21 The applicant then drew attention to a further passage from the remarks on sentence in which his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        Ice is increasingly recognised as a drug that causes considerable social harm. I am not suggesting that there is a disregard for community safety which is an element of any drug supply offence. It is not an aggravating factor but it is a factor which explains why this offence is regarded so serious (sic). 
        
       
      
    22 That passage was criticised upon the basis that the sentencing judge had allowed his own personal view about the harmfulness of the drug in question to intrude into the sentencing process. It was also submitted that it fell foul of what the High Court said in Adams v R (2008) 244 ALR 270. In a joint judgement, Gleeson CJ, Hayne, Crennan and Kieffel JJ, in rejecting the submission that ecstasy is less harmful to users and to society than heroin, said: 
     
      
       
        
        Generalisations which seek to differentiate between the evils of the illegal trade in heroin and MDMA are to be approached with caution, and in the present case are not sustained by evidence, or material of which judicial notice can be taken. 
        
       
       
        
        An equally serious difficulty for the appellant’s argument is in seeking to reconcile it with the scheme of the Customs Act in relation to penalties. In fixing the trafficable and commercial quantities of heroin and MDMA respectively, and applying the same maximum penalties to the quantities so fixed, parliament has made its own judgment as to an appropriate penal response to involvement in the trade in illicit drugs. The idea that sentencing judges, in the application of that quantity-based system, should apply a judicially constructed harm-based gradation of penalties (quite apart from the difficulty of establishing a suitable factual foundation for such an approach) cuts across the legislative scheme. This problem was recognised by the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales in  
        R v Poon 
        . A similar problem in relation to Victorian legislation underlay the decision in  
        Pidoto 
         noted above. 
        
       
       
        
        Of course, the fixing of a maximum penalty is not the end of the matter, as was emphasised in  
        Ibbs v R 
        . But there is nothing in the Customs Act, or the evidence, or the demonstrated state of available knowledge or opinion, which requires or permits a court to sentence on the basis that possessing a commercial quantity of MDMA is in some way less anti-social than possessing a commercial quantity of heroin. Furthermore, the sentencing judge’s primary consideration was deterrence. That is not said to involve error. Why there should be a difference in that respect between heroin and MDMA was not explained. (citations omitted) (paras 9-11) 
        
       
      
    23 Since the sentencing judge stated a truism and made absolutely no finding about the relativeness seriousness of the drug ice as compared with any other prohibited drug, I am unable to detect errors of the kind which were asserted. I would reject this aspect of the applicant’s submission. 
     
      
    24 Finally, the applicant called in aid the decision of this Court in R v Kamminga [2003] NSWCCA 337. In that case, a two judge bench of this court intervened and resentenced an offender who had received a sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years for an offence involving a contravention of s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. That offender sold amphetamines on three occasions to an undercover police officer. The gross weight of the drug was about 22 grams and the total price was $2,800. The applicant’s personal circumstances, which were described as being “remarkable”, included the fact that he suffered from a chronic affective disorder. He was also described as “being in straitened financial circumstances around the time of the offence, living in extremely modest circumstances and receiving food from charities. .. he was emaciated, distressed and had a tremor in his hands.” Having considered a number of decisions of this Court as well as statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission Barr J, with whom Miles AJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        This Court has frequently observed the need for caution when approaching such figures, especially where they comprise cases which are so few as to lack statistical significance. However, it seems to me that eighty-one cases is a substantial number and I would regard the statistics as being a reasonably reliable indicator of the available range for the offence. That is not to say that a head sentence of five years is at the top of the range or that a sentence of six years is outside the range. What the statistics do show, I think, in combination with the remarks of this Court in  
        R v CBK 
         is that a six-year head sentence is remarkably high for this offence. One would expect to see particularly serious features in the criminality of an offender receiving such a sentence. (par 18) 
        
       
      
    25 The fact that a 6 year head sentence for that offender was described as being “remarkably high” does not in my view demonstrate that a sentence of a similar length in the present case is therefore manifestly excessive. Moreover, there were many features of the present case which revealed much more serious criminality than was displayed by the offender in Kamminga.  
     
      
    26 On any view of the matter the objective gravity of the present offence was high. The applicant was not a mere “street dealer”. On the contrary, he was part of an organised commercial operation. The seriousness of the applicant’s offending is apparent from the length of his involvement in the enterprise, the number of individual transactions in which he participated and from the overall quantity of drugs that he supplied. Moreover, the fact that the sentences in respect of the second and third counts were wholly subsumed within the sentence imposed in respect of the first count, suggests that a significant measure of leniency was extended to the applicant. That is particularly true of the third count, which concerned an entirely unrelated offence and which would, in the ordinary course of events, have been expected to attract a sentence which was, at least, partially accumulated upon the earlier sentence. Furthermore, it was a serious offence in its own right in respect of which, as I have said, there was a standard non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
    27 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    28 HARRISON J: I agree with Buddin J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    3 HARRISON J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to eight offences of obtaining a financial benefit by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. He was committed for sentence to the District Court of New South Wales. On 31 August 2007 Woods DCJ sentenced the applicant. A further eight offences - four of making and four of using a false instrument - were taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced to a term of 3 years for each offence. The sentences for counts 2, 3, 6 and 8 all commenced on the date of sentence. The sentences for counts 4 and 7 were made fully cumulative to those sentences, commencing on 31 August 2010. The sentences for counts 1 and 7 were ordered to commence 2 years into the sentences for counts 4 and 7. The total effective sentence is accordingly 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. Offences against s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 carry a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment. The maximum sentence for the offences listed on the Form 1 pursuant to ss 300(1) and 300(2) of that Act is imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    5 The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed. Three grounds of appeal are identified:  
     
      
      Ground 1 
      : The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to impose valid sentences in conformity with the requirements if the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999  
      (""the Act""). 
       
       
      Ground 2 
      : The sentencing judge failed to sentence in accordance with  
      Pearce v The Queen 
       [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
       
       
      Ground 3 
      : The sentences individually and in combination are manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    Background 
     
      
    6 At the time of the commission of the offences the applicant was employed as a relationship manager for Westpac Banking Corporation. The total amount of money involved in the offences is almost $3,943,000. Westpac was the victim of the fraud. The applicant obtained the money during the period from February 2003 to January 2005. Approximately $237,000 was recovered leaving a shortfall of approximately $3.7M. The amounts involved in relation to the separate counts are referred to in agreed facts tendered on sentence. 
     
      
    7 The applicant's role as a relationship manager involved obtaining new lending for the bank and managing a large portfolio of business clients. The applicant's position with the bank was one of seniority and substantial trust. It is unnecessary for present purposes to describe in any detail the way in which the applicant perpetrated the frauds. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge found that the applicant had gambled unsuccessfully with most of the proceeds of the crimes on horse racing but had not retained any of the money so that at some time in the future he might have been able to gain access to it for the benefit of others in his family. He said that a major factor in sentencing those who defraud others is whether or not they are in a position of trust. His Honour found that the aggravating factors in this case included that the applicant abused such a position of trust, that the offence involved a series of criminal acts and that the offences were planned. Factors that mitigated the circumstances included the applicant's contrition and remorse, as reflected in the guilty pleas, that he was unlikely to reoffend and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. The sentencing judge found special circumstances as the applicant had a gambling addiction requiring psychological counselling. His Honour discounted the sentences by 25 per cent for the early pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    Grounds 1 and 2 
     
      
    9 The Crown conceded that his Honour would appear clearly to have failed to impose sentences in conformity with ss 44 and 45 of the Act and that he failed to impose an appropriate sentence in respect of each of the eight offences so as properly to reflect the criminality involved in each, contrary to Pearce. The Crown agreed that his Honour purported to apply the totality principle, but that he appears to have failed to evaluate the criminality reflected in each of the offences in as much as he did not differentiate between the sentences imposed. This was so even though the offences involved sums varying between $50,000 at the low end and $1.84M at the high end with a median amount involved of approximately $500,000. 
     
      
    10 The applicant emphasised that his Honour did not set individual non-parole periods in relation to any of the offences. His Honour gave no reasons for this approach. However, that alone did not invalidate the sentences: see s 45(4) of the Act. Commencement dates were not specifically stated although it seems apparent that to the extent that some sentences were expressly stated to be cumulative upon certain others, his Honour's views were made clear. Moreover, an isolated failure to specify a commencement date does not in any event invalidate the sentence: see s 48(3) of the Act. His Honour purported to set a single non-parole period of 5 years. This was longer than any one of the individual sentences imposed. The applicant contended that there was no facility to do so. Nor does the Act contemplate the setting of a ""global"" non-parole period. 
     
      
    11 The applicant therefore contended that the sentence that his Honour apparently intended to impose could not be translated into a sentence in conformity with the Act. In other words, if his Honour properly imposed fixed terms of 3 years for the first group of offences, he could then have imposed terms with a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 1 year for the second group of offences. That would have produced a sentence with an effective non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of term of 1 year. However, this would have meant that the third group of offences would have needed to be sentences of 3 years with no non-parole period. The applicant submitted that the imposition of such a sentence was not possible under the Act. 
     
      
    12 As a result the applicant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to impose valid sentences in conformity with the requirements of the Act. As I have indicated, the Crown accepted that contention. Neither party proceeded to make any affirmative submissions on the significant issue of what, if anything should occur in these circumstances. 
     
      
    13 However, it follows from this that the applicant will have to be re-sentenced. In my opinion it is appropriate for this Court to re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    14 By reason of the success of the first two grounds of appeal, and the corresponding need to re-sentence the applicant, consideration of the third ground of appeal acquires a certain artificiality. The sentencing exercise in this Court must be undertaken afresh having regard to the accepted conclusion that the original sentences that were imposed were contrary to law. However, quite apart from the difficulties that led to that result, the effective period of imprisonment that his Honour intended to impose was clearly a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment with a balance of term of 3 years. The thrust of the applicant's submission must therefore be taken to be that upon a re-sentence by this Court, any sentence that approaches or equates to a similar result but which is imposed according to proper principles would nevertheless remain manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    15 The applicant conceded that the offences were serious. They were acknowledged by him to involve significant breaches of trust. Some of the offences took place over a period of time. The total offending took place over a period of two years. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty. His Honour's approach suggests a starting point of 4 years for each offence having regard to the uniform imposition of 3-year terms for each offence. However, by way of example, the applicant draws attention to the dissimilarity between the circumstances of count 7, an offence involving $50,000 and committed over a relatively short period of time for which his Honour purported to impose the same non-parole period as he did for count 1 involving approximately $1.84M. Count 8 involved the sum of $500,000. Counts 2 to 6 involved amounts ranging from $180,000 to $473,000. 
     
      
    17 The applicant submitted that a total sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years should be seen in the light of the fact that, in some cases, ""it is the fact of imprisonment rather than the length of the sentence which will be of greatest significance to punish the offender and denounce his conduct"": see R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497. In R v McDonald (1994) 71 A Crim R 370, in the context of a gaol sentence imposed in relation to fraud offences, Burchett and Higgins JJ, with whom Spender J agreed, said at 379, 
     
      
       
        
        ""[i]n a case of this kind, a first incarceration may have a very salutary effect, and the prospect that it may do so should not be left out of account when its length is fixed."" 
        
       
      
    18 The applicant contended that the Crown submitted at first instance that the matters did not require a non-parole period ""significantly higher"" than three years. In fact, the Crown submitted, when asked specifically to comment upon a non-parole period of three years, that ""[i]t should be higher than that, whether it's significantly higher than that is a matter for your Honour"". The Crown submitted that it did not bind the sentencing judge in any event, a contention that I did not understand to be contested by the applicant. Either way, whether or not what was said amounted to a concession by the Crown in the court below, the applicant embraced it as an appropriate approach in this Court. The applicant also submitted that a non-parole period of 5 years was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    19 In contrast, the Crown submitted in this Court that it was open to his Honour ""to impose the overall sentence"" and that no error had been established by the applicant as to the overall sentence that was imposed. Alternatively, the Crown submitted that the appeal against sentence should in any event be dismissed on the basis that no less severe sentence is warranted in law having regard to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    20 In my opinion the failure by his Honour to distinguish between or among the various counts, and to impose an identical non-parole period in each case, notwithstanding their significant differences, is an error but not one that has led to the imposition of an effective non-parole period that is excessive. In performing the re-sentencing exercise that is called for, I consider that a lesser sentence is warranted in law, but only to the extent that the statutory ratio should be varied, with the head sentence of 8 years reduced to 6 years and the effective non-parole period of 5 years remaining the same. In this respect I have had regard to what was said by Hoeben J in Dunn v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 312 at [40] – [41] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[40] The submission in relation to s44 is, however, in a somewhat different category. I appreciate that the section does not create a statutory norm in relation to the proportion of the non-parole period as against the total term of the sentence and that special circumstances are required only where the proportion is to be less than three quarters. Nevertheless general sentencing principles suggest that where there is a departure from the statutory ratio there should be some reason provided. It is not clear here that his Honour appreciated that the combined effect of the sentences was to produce a non-parole period in excess of 80% of the head sentence. If he did he failed to indicate why he thought such a departure from the statutory ratio was appropriate.  
         
         
        [41] It has been held by this Court that where one or more sentences are made cumulative upon another sentence so as to produce a non-parole period which is in excess of the statutory ratio that of itself  
        may 
         amount to special circumstances. On the facts of this case that consideration and the absence of an explanation as to why the non-parole period has been increased beyond the statutory ratio, lead me to conclude that this Court ought intervene so that the combined effect of the sentences conforms with the statutory ratio. A reduction of 4 months in the non-parole period in respect of count 3 would substantially achieve that result."" 
        
       
      
    21 Count 1 was arguably the most serious offence. It took place over a period of 22 months and involved the sum of $1.844M. That is to be compared with the sum of approximately $3.7M, which is the total of the bank's unrecovered loss. It alone warranted a significant term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    22 Count 8 was in monetary terms the next most significant offence. It was perpetrated over a period of only three and a half weeks but involved a loss to the bank of $500,000. It was the second most significant offence in monetary terms and in my opinion is deserving of specific treatment for that reason. Alike with Count 1 in particular, it is important that it be specifically marked out as a single offence with a sentence that will operate to deter individuals in positions of trust who have the opportunity or the inclination to defraud those who have their confidence and are vulnerable to its abuse. 
     
      
    23 His Honour was inclined to group others of the offences on bases that were unexceptionable and which were related to the identities of the clients of the bank in respect of whose accounts the frauds were committed. In my opinion the sums involved in Counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 suggest that they are capable of being treated together for sentencing purposes. Counts 2, 3 and 6 all relate to offences committed in respect of the accounts of one particular customer of the bank, as detailed by his Honour. Counts 4 and 7 related to companies, rather than individuals, and his Honour's approach was to treat them together for that reason. I consider that Count 7 ought to be treated separately by reason of the fact that the sum involved is considerably less than that involved in any of the other counts, and in order that reference to it in context does not fail to distinguish it from those offences involving significantly larger sums, for which longer sentences are warranted.  
     
      
    24 The effect of the sentences that I propose is that the applicant will still be required to serve a period of 5 years from 31 August 2007 until he becomes eligible for parole on 30 August 2012, but with the balance of his parole periods expiring on 30 August 2013 instead of 30 August 2015. In the particular circumstances of this applicant I do not consider that an extended period of supervision on parole is warranted or necessary. The special circumstances found by the learned sentencing judge, being the applicant's gambling addiction and his need for appropriate counselling, are matters than can be suitably attended to during the term of his non-parole period and the further single year on parole. The total effective sentence is accordingly 6 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    25 In my opinion the following orders should be made:  
     
      
      1. Grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. 
       
       
      2. Quash the sentences imposed upon the applicant by his Honour Woods DCJ on 31 August 2007. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment:  
       
       
        
       
       
        
         
        (a)  
        On Count 1 
        : To imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 years from 31 August 2007 to 30 August 2010 and a balance of term of 9 months from 31 August 2010 to 30 May 2011. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
         
        (b)  
        On Count 8 
        : To imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years from 31 August 2008 to 30 August 2011 and a balance of term of 6 months from 31 August 2011 to 28 February 2012. The sentence for this offence takes into account the eight additional offences on the Form 1. 
         
         
        (c)  
        On Counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
        : To imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years from 31 August 2010 to 30 August 2012 and a balance of term of 1 year from 31 August 2012 to 30 August 2013. 
         
         
        (d)  
        On Count 7 
        : To imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year from 28 February 2011 to 27 February 2012 and a balance of term of 6 months from 28 February 2012 to 30 August 2012. 
         
        
       
       
      Accordingly, the first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 30 August 2012.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Buddin J. 
     
      
    2 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court following his pleas of guilty to four counts of having sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16 years who at the time was under his authority. The offences, which constituted contraventions of s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, all occurred between 1 April and 3 July 1997. At that time the maximum penalty for each of the offences was imprisonment for 10 years. Counts 1, 2 and 4 involved penile/vaginal intercourse whilst count 3 involved an act of fellatio. In respect of count 1, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment to commence on 24 January 2007, the date upon which he went into custody. In respect of count 2, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment to commence on 24 January 2008. In respect of count 3, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years with a total term of 3 years imprisonment to commence on 24 January 2009. In respect of count 4, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year with a total term of 3 years imprisonment to commence on 24 January 2010. The effective non-parole period is thus one of 4 years with a total term of imprisonment of 6 years. The applicant is eligible for release on parole on 23 January 2011.  
     
      
    3 An agreed statement of facts was tendered before the sentencing judge. It revealed that the victim, who was 14 at the time and in Year 8 at high school, was the applicant’s sister in law. The applicant, who was aged 23 at the time that the offending conduct commenced, lived with the victim’s sister and their infant daughter. The victim moved in with them for a period of about 10 months because of problems she was experiencing at home. She told police that the offences occurred on a number of separate occasions over a period of about 2 months and that they occurred just before she moved back to her parents’ home. She was able to recall the details of four such occasions which were reflected in the counts in the indictment. 
     
      
    4 It is unnecessary to describe the offences in any further detail although is to be observed that the applicant did not use a condom on any of the occasions on which he had penile/vaginal intercourse with the victim. On one such occasion the victim told the applicant that she thought that she was pregnant and expressed concerns that “now everybody is going to find out”. The applicant replied “I want you to go to the next school social and tell Tina [his wife] afterwards that you slept with some-one”. The consequences which the offences had upon the victim were described in considerable detail in a victim impact statement which was prepared on her behalf by a sexual assault counsellor. 
     
      
    5 The sentencing judge was provided with information about the applicant’s background in two pre-sentence reports and in a report prepared by a psychologist, Dr Peter Nelson. The applicant, who was 34 at the time of sentence, also gave evidence during the course of the sentence hearing. The applicant’s father died when he was young. He had a distant relationship with his alcoholic mother who is reported to have been abusive towards him. The applicant left school at the end of Year 11. As I have said, the applicant was married at the time of the offences. That relationship eventually broke down because of the applicant’s abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs. The result was that the applicant made little effort to find employment which caused the couple to experience serious financial problems. The applicant has had no contact with either his ex-wife or his daughter for more than 10 years. He has since had two other relationships of short duration. For many years leading up to his incarceration, the applicant had led an isolated existence. He had only worked intermittently, mainly as a cleaner. However he had not worked at all for about 5 years prior to his arrest. During that time he was on a disability pension because of various issues which related to his mental health. The evidence revealed that the applicant had suffered from depression since his early teens. Dr Nelson reported that the applicant had a long history of substance abuse disorder. He also expressed the opinion that he has “a mood disorder with high levels of depression, anxiety and dysthymia”. He said that the applicant also suffered from borderline personality disorder, a feature of which was a history on the part of the applicant to self-harm. There was other evidence that the applicant had been admitted to psychiatric facilities in both 2003 and 2005 in Queensland.  
     
      
    6 The applicant had a minor criminal record which the sentencing judge quite properly disregarded. His Honour concluded that the applicant was genuinely remorseful and that he had self-harmed because of the shame that he felt arising from his having committed these offences. The applicant was extended a discount of 25% from the otherwise appropriate sentence to reflect his early pleas of guilty. His Honour found “special circumstances” because it was the applicant’s first custodial sentence and because of “his need [for] assistance on parole [given] the matters referred to in Dr Nelson’s report”.  
     
      
    7 The notice of appeal was expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        1 That the sentence is manifestly excessive is based upon the following propositions: 
        
       
       
        
        a. That there was inadequate weight given to the evidence on sentence of the applicant’s mental condition. 
        
       
       
        
        b. That the sentencing judge failed to determine, and failed to find, that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend despite evidence that established each point. 
        
       
       
        
        c. The starting point for the total effective sentence was 8 years and this was excessive in the sense of it constituting an error of law. 
        
       
       
      The sentence was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    8 The sentencing judge indicated that but for the discount for the pleas of guilty the overall sentence would have been a period of imprisonment of 8 years. It was submitted that such a starting point was too high. Counsel referred to statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission which were said to demonstrate that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were either at, or towards the top of the range of sentences imposed for offences of a similar kind. However, counsel acknowledged that because the sample of cases was very small, the statistics were of limited utility. Moreover, it was also recognised that care needs to be taken in sentencing for historical offences and that regard must be had to the sentencing pattern which prevailed at the time of the relevant offending: see Moon v R (2000) 117 A Crim R 497; MJR v R (2002) 130 A Crim R 481. 
     
      
    9 In an endeavour to assist the court to arrive at a more informed view as to that sentencing pattern, the parties referred to seven decisions in which sentences for offences against s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act had been considered by this Court. In R v RJW, (NSWCCA unreported, 2 August 1994) the respondent pleaded guilty to 10 charges pursuant to s 66C(2) which involved acts of fellatio committed upon two boys who were aged 13 and 14 respectively. The activities in each instance were consensual. An appeal by the Crown was allowed and sentences consisting of minimum terms of 2 years imprisonment with an additional term of 8 months were substituted for minimum terms of 12 months imprisonment with an additional term of 4 months which had been imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    10 In R v PBH (NSWCCA unreported 2 May 1996) the respondent pleaded guilty to one offence of penile/vaginal intercourse, laid pursuant to s 66C(2), which was committed upon his daughter who was then aged 14 years 9 months. As a result of the incident, his daughter became pregnant and in due course gave birth to a child. The respondent, who had no prior convictions, was re-sentenced following a successful Crown appeal to a minimum term of 2 years 6 months imprisonment with an additional term of 10 months which was substituted for a minimum term of 18 months imprisonment and an additional term of 18 months which had been imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    11 In Foster v R (NSWCCA unreported 14 July 1998) the applicant pleaded guilty to three counts laid pursuant to s 66C(2) which involved acts of digital penetration, cunnilingus and penile/vaginal penetration respectively. The events all took place on the one occasion. The victim, who was aged 15 years 9 months, was the applicant’s step-daughter. The incident had occurred in circumstances in which the victim had taken ill after drinking wine and had gone to bed naked. The court, after having had regard to the victim’s age and to the fact that the offence was an isolated one, allowed the appeal and substituted a minimum term of 2 years imprisonment with an additional term of 1 year for the minimum term of 3 years imprisonment with an additional term of 1 year which had been imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    12 In R v Gould [1999] NSWCCA 177, the applicant pleaded guilty to one count laid pursuant to s 66C(2) which involved an act of fellatio, to an offence of indecent assault which involved touching the outside of the victim’s vagina and to two offences on a Form 1 of carnal knowledge involving penile/vaginal penetration. The offences, which were committed against the applicant’s step-daughter, continued over a four year period during which time the victim was aged between 12 and 15. The offences were not isolated instances. The applicant had pleaded guilty, was a person of prior good character and had a number of health problems. An appeal against a minimum term of 5 years imprisonment with an additional term of 2 years 6 months was dismissed. 
     
      
    13 In R v CJB [2000] NSWCCA 161, the applicant pleaded guilty to seven counts laid pursuant to s 66C(2) and one count of carnal knowledge. The victim was the applicant’s step-daughter. The offending conduct lasted for a number of years during which time the victim was aged from about 10 until she was 16. Most of the offences involved penile/vaginal penetration. As a result of two of the offences, the victim became pregnant and gave birth on each occasion to a child. Some time after the applicant and the victim’s mother split up, the victim moved in to live with the applicant. She continued having a relationship with him for several years after she turned 16. The application for leave to appeal against an effective minimum term of 7 years imprisonment with an additional term of 3 years was described as one which “entirely lacks substance” and was refused. 
     
      
    14 In R v DJM (2002) 136 A Crim R 269 the applicant pleaded guilty to two counts laid pursuant to s 66C(2). The victim, who was the niece of the applicant’s wife, was just under the age of 15 at the time. She had had a relationship with the applicant, which involved kissing and cuddling him, prior to the date of the offences. On the day in question the victim and a friend had gone fishing with the applicant. The offences involved digital penetration and fellatio respectively. The applicant was of prior good character and suffered from a mental disorder which impacted upon the appropriate sentence. An appeal against a sentence of 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year was dismissed.  
     
      
    15 In R v LTP [2004] NSWCCA 109 the applicant was convicted after trial of one offence laid pursuant to s 66C(2). It involved penile/vaginal penetration of his daughter who was then aged 12. The applicant, who was a man of prior good character and had a good employment record, was on compensation for work related injuries at the time of the offence. This court substituted a sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months for the original sentence of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years which had been imposed. 
     
      
    16 Due allowance must be made for the fact that the sample of cases to which the court was referred was somewhat limited. Furthermore, there are obvious differences between the various cases to which reference has been made and the present one. Nevertheless, an analysis of those decisions confirms my own preliminary view that the sentences imposed in the present case did not exceed the legitimate range of the sentencing judge’s discretion. 
     
      
    17 Clearly the applicant was able to rely upon a number of favourable subjective features. On the other hand, the objective gravity of his offending conduct was significant. Far from being isolated incidents, his offences represented a repeated course of conduct: see R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209 [at par 121]. Three of the four offences involved unprotected penile/vaginal penetration which exposed the victim to the risk of pregnancy and other potential problems. In the circumstances, I would reject the contention that the sentences were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge failed to give adequate weight to the applicant’s mental condition 
       
      
    18 I referred earlier to the evidence concerning the applicant’s mental condition. Of that evidence, the sentencing judge observed that “he has had some mental health issues in the past. They stay to some extent with him, as are set out in Dr [Nelson’s] report, which is very helpful. He is somebody who does need help from the appropriate authorities and I am confident that it will be afforded to him.” A little later his Honour observed that “I bear in mind in reaching the sentence I have the medical evidence about the offender, but nevertheless it still remains, in my view, a serious matter as far as the victim is concerned.”  
     
      
    19 The applicant drew attention to the decision of this court in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228, in which Sperling J said: 
     
      
       
        
        Mental illness may be relevant – and was relevant in the present case – in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced:  
        Henry

        Jiminez  
        [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23];

        Pearson 
         [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43].  
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration:

         (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported);

        Israil 
         at [22];  
        Pearson 
         at [42].  
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person:  
        Tsiaras 
         at 400;  
        Jiminez 
         at [25];  
        Israil 
         at [26].  
        
       
       
        
        A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence;  
        Israil 
         at [24]. 
        
       
      
    20 See also Leach v R [2008] NSWCCA 73 at [par 10]. 
     
      
    21 It was expressly conceded on behalf of the applicant that as there was little in the evidence which could have established a link between the applicant’s condition and his offending behaviour, the first consideration referred to in Hemsley had little application to the present case. Nor, it was submitted, was the fourth consideration of any relevance. On the other hand it was submitted that the second and third considerations were relevant and that they had apparently been given insufficient weight. 
     
      
    22 It is true that the sentencing judge’s reasons were somewhat economical. The extent of the applicant’s mental condition was a matter of some complexity given the interplay between his history of illicit substance abuse, his variable compliance with medication and his neglect, at times, of his mental health. The issue of the applicant’s mental condition required a delicate balancing of the various competing sentencing considerations. It is apparent that the sentencing judge was alive to that requirement and that his Honour sought to give effect to it. I am not persuaded that his Honour, in imposing the sentence which he did, failed to give appropriate weight to this aspect of the matter. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge’s failure to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend 
       
      
    23 The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to find that each of these matters had been established. Attention was drawn to the applicant’s plea of guilty and his expressions of remorse, to the fact that he had a negligible criminal record and in particular to the fact that he had not committed other offences of a similar kind to those in respect of which he stood for sentence. The sentencing judge expressly took each of those matters into account. The applicant also referred to the opinions expressed by Dr Nelson and the author of the pre-sentence report which were to the effect that the applicant represented only a low risk of recidivism. The sentencing judge was not obliged uncritically to accept those opinions. Indeed the sentencing judge would have been amply justified in being somewhat sceptical about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation in view of his unresolved mental health problems, his inability to work and his isolated lifestyle whilst in the community. But I would not, in any event, be disposed to conclude that the sentencing judge failed to take these matters into account or that he failed to give them such weight as they deserved. 
     
      
    24 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    25 HARRISON J: I agree with Buddin J.

      2008/19617 REGINA v Jim MILLS 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender was committed for sentence on a charge of manslaughter arising from the death of the deceased, Peter Hawke, on 17 December 2007. He adhered to his plea of guilty in this Court and is to be sentenced for that offence. 
     
      
    2 The facts are contained in a statement tendered to the Court. No material from the prosecution brief was placed into evidence except for the autopsy report and certificates of analysis of substances taken from the body of the deceased and the accused. At the date of the killing the deceased was aged 44 and the offender aged 40. They were acquainted with one another. The deceased was in a relationship with Melissa Cawood and she knew the offender. 
     
      
    3 On the morning of Sunday 16 December 2007 the deceased went to the unit of a long-term friend, Salvatore Sansone, in Redfern, requesting to stay the night as he wanted company. They drank some wine before the deceased left the unit for a short period. During his absence Ms Cawood arrived and introduced herself to Mr Sansone as the deceased’s girlfriend. She waited in the unit until the deceased’s return at about 2 pm. He brought some wine that the three of them drank together. 
     
      
    4 Later in the afternoon the offender turned up at the unit. At some stage the offender and the deceased became engaged in a heated conversation, apparently arising from an allegation by the deceased that the offender’s son had stolen drugs from the deceased. The two ended up in fisticuffs until Sansone intervened. The deceased had a bloody nose. Sansone told the offender to leave and he apologised. He left the unit, the deceased explained to Sansone that the offender was drunk. 
     
      
    5 The statement of facts continues as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        About 8.30 p.m. [Sansone] took a sleeping tablet and went to bed and fell asleep. The deceased and Cawood continued to drink alcohol and watch television in the lounge room. Sometime during the evening Cawood fell asleep on the lounge. At 2 a.m. the next morning, that is Monday 17 December, Cawood woke up. Cawood told police that when she woke up she was in the lounge room and saw the deceased and the offender eating a toasted sandwich or something in the kitchen and they appeared to be getting on fine. Cawood then said that she heard arguing coming from the kitchen. She went to the kitchen and saw the deceased slumped over on the kitchen floor. The offender was standing nearby. Cawood did not see the offender stab the deceased and did not notice that he was holding anything. Cawood rang 000. The offender at some point, either before or after this, left the unit. Sansone woke up to the sound of Cawood crying. Cawood went into Sansone’s bedroom and said to him something like ""Jimmi stabbed Peter"". Sansone went to the kitchen and saw the deceased lying on the floor between the bin and fridge. The deceased had blood on him. 
        
       
      
    6 Although ambulance officers arrived a short time after they were summoned, they were unable to assist the deceased and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Death was caused by a single stab wound to the chest that injured the heart. 
     
      
    7 While the police were present at the unit, the offender returned. He appeared despondent, upset and dazed. He was intoxicated and, after his arrest, a breath analysis gave a reading of 0.175. Analysis of his blood revealed the presence of various drugs including methadone and cannabis. Ms Cawood was also heavily intoxicated and appeared to be affected by drugs. An analysis of the deceased’s blood returned a reading of 0.304. There was also the presence of drugs including methadone and nordiazepam. 
     
      
    8 Although the offender was initially charged with murder, he pleaded guilty in the Local Court to manslaughter after aborted committal proceedings. The offence is based upon an unlawful and dangerous act being the infliction of the knife wound to the chest of the deceased. The circumstances in which the stabbing occurred are not clear but apparently it was in the course of a drunken argument between the two men. Although a knife was used by the offender, which is an aggravating factor, it seems that he picked up the knife in the kitchen. The offender has no recollection about the circumstances surrounding the killing. 
     
      
    9 The offender has a criminal record dating from 1986 when he was before the Local Court and was fined for an assault. He has been convicted of a number of assault offences sometimes where actual bodily harm has been occasioned. However since 1989 he has been before the court only for, what are often referred to as, street offences. Between 2004 and 2008 he has been convicted of possessing drugs and on each occasion was fined. This record does not seem to me to be of any significance. It is of course the offender’s first time in custody. 
     
      
    10 The offender has a history of drug and alcohol usage from his teens. In the 1980’s he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital as a result of suffering a drug-induced psychosis. On another occasion he was admitted because of a fear of self-harm. He gave evidence before me that he had a period of sobriety for about 8 years until 2002 or 2003. He has been taking methadone for the last 15 years. On the day of the killing he was affected by both alcohol and drugs and this is no doubt the primary reason for his loss of temper and the use of the knife. 
     
      
    11 There is little in his upbringing of relevance given his age and the nature of the offence. His father was an alcoholic and violent. The offender left home at the age of 15 living an itinerant lifestyle “on the streets”. He has had only one significant relationship, as a result of which he has two teenage children. He has a good relationship with them and they have visited him in gaol. The offender has been on a disability support pension since 1992 and has not worked for about 20 years due to his alcoholism. He was living with his 15 year old son at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    12 There is in evidence an affidavit from the offender’s daughter, aged 17. She is working part-time in a bank but is studying to become a primary school teacher. She is distressed by the situation her father is in and finds it difficult to accept that he committed the offence because she has never seen him violent. She supports him, as does her brother, and hopes that he can seek assistance when released from gaol to overcome his drug and alcohol problems. In his evidence the offender apologised to his children as he did to the deceased’s daughter. 
     
      
    13 Neither the prospects of rehabilitation or the likelihood of reoffending are matters of any real import in this particular sentencing exercise. This was a single act of violence arising from a particular situation and no doubt fuelled by the intoxication of both men. Dr Westmore believes that he requires drug and alcohol counselling. If he is not prepared to seek or accept counselling then he will no doubt continue to use prohibited drugs and drink to excess. But these are matters that he will need to address if he hopes to be released to parole at the earliest available date. In evidence the offender said he had not consumed any alcohol or non-prescribed drugs while in custody. He has been having counselling with a drug and alcohol officer once a month. 
     
      
    14 A psychologist who prepared a report on the offender believes that he would benefit from engaging in “offence-specific intervention through the Violent Offender’s Programme”. Again this is a matter for him and his participation or lack of participation will affect his prospects of being released to parole. He is being treated by Justice Health while in custody for mental health issues but the psychologist believes he may also need medication to assist in breaking his dependence on drugs. 
     
      
    15 The psychologist submits that he should be sentenced to allow for his maximum opportunity for rehabilitation. Of course that is not my major concern. I am to punish him for taking a human life by the use of a weapon, albeit while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. However the offender appears to be genuinely remorseful for the killing and if this senseless act that took the life of an acquaintance does not induce him to rehabilitate himself, I doubt that any other motivation could do so. 
     
      
    16 The Very Reverend John McIntyre, a Bishop in the Anglican Church, gave evidence. He had been parish priest in Redfern and met the offender and his wife about 15 years ago. He remembered the offender’s wife leaving the family and the offender’s problems with alcohol. Yet he formed a genuine friendship with the offender. He was shocked that the offender could have killed another person as he had never appeared violent. He hoped to be able through his contacts in the Redfern area to offer the offender support on his release. 
     
      
    17 There is a victim impact statement from the school-aged daughter of the deceased. She lived with her mother but was hopeful that her father might have been given custody of her. They had plans to go on holidays together. She regrets that she did not have the opportunity to share time with him as she grew older and gained her independence. 
     
      
    18 Although the offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court, that was about 12 months after he was charged and after committal proceedings were to be heard, but were aborted when the Crown witnesses failed to attend. It seems to me that a discount of 20 per cent is appropriate. 
     
      
    19 There are special circumstances in light of the assistance that the offender will require to maintain his endeavours to overcome his drug and alcohol dependency. I assume that if he is being released to parole at the first opportunity he will have continued to address these problems while in custody. If he does not, then he is unlikely to be released. 
     
      
    20 The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years 9 months. The sentence is to commence from 17 December 2007 and the non-parole period expires on 16 June 2012 the date upon which the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    2 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Malcolm Gordon Field (“the appellant”) appeals to this Court against a sentence of four years and six months imposed on him by Adams J following his conviction for contempt of court. The contempt comprised a refusal by the appellant to comply with an order of the Supreme Court that he be examined on oath before a registrar pursuant to s 12(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. The appeal is out of time and for that reason leave to appeal is required. The appellant is unrepresented and the respondent does not oppose a grant of leave. In my opinion leave should be granted. 
     
      
    3 The order for examination was made following the arrest of the appellant on 5 January 2001 upon charges arising out of the importation into Australia of approximately 34 kilograms of ecstasy. On 10 January 2001 the respondent obtained a restraining order in respect of the appellant’s property. On 4 July 2001, the respondent commenced proceedings to obtain a further restraining order and at the same time sought an examination order pursuant to ss 10 and 12 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. Simpson J granted the application and made an order requiring the appellant to attend before a registrar of the Supreme Court to be examined. When the appellant appeared for his examination on 13 August he indicated to the court that he would refuse to answer any questions. He took this course, although he had been advised by his legal representatives that he had no valid ground for refusing to answer questions and his refusal could result in his being charged with contempt. 
     
      
    4 The appellant was convicted and sentenced for contempt on 29 May 2003 by Bell J. When considering the appropriate sentence her Honour was mindful of the appellant’s physical difficulties arising from severe adult-onset asthma which had required him to be hospitalised on a number of occasions. However, her Honour concluded that appropriate medical treatment would be available within the prison system and, although imprisonment would impose a greater burden on the appellant than on a healthy person, a period of fulltime custody was required. He was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment to commence on 5 June 2007 and expire on 4 June 2008. 
     
      
    5 By the time the appellant was sentenced by Bell J he had been convicted and sentenced for the drug offence. For that offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years commencing on 5 January 2001 with a non-parole period of 7 years which expired on 4 January 2008. It was for this reason that Bell J determined to commence the sentence she imposed on 5 June 2007. 
     
      
    6 On 17 June 2005 the appellant was again ordered to attend before a registrar of the Supreme Court to be examined on his oath. Although he attended on the day appointed, which was 29 June 2005,when asked to take the oath he said “I refuse to take anything.” Counsel for the appellant indicated to the registrar of the court that the appellant intended to take the same course at any further date to which the examination might be adjourned. He told the registrar that the appellant was “fully aware of the consequences of that attitude.” 
     
      
    7 On 16 December 2005 the appellant was dealt with by Hulme J for this later contempt. Hulme J was aware of the appellant’s health problems and when sentencing the appellant referred to the fact that there was evidence of “some brain damage injury and psychological disturbance or disability”. However Hulme J rejected a submission that the appellant refused to subject himself to examination because of a paranoid belief about persecution by the Crime Commission coupled with an impairment in his reasoning processes. 
     
      
    8 Hulme J concluded that a further term of imprisonment was required. He referred to the fact that the sentence imposed by Bell J did not appear to have affected the appellant’s attitude to being examined and his Honour concluded that a significantly harsher penalty was appropriate. He committed the appellant to imprisonment until further order of the court. His Honour appreciated that the sentence would not have any practical effect until the expiration of the non-parole period imposed in respect of his earlier drug offence which occurred on 4 January 2008. 
     
      
    9 On 10 June 2007 the respondent filed a notice of motion in the Supreme Court seeking an order that the offender be released on a specified date from the imprisonment ordered by Hulme J. This course was taken because it was anticipated that the order which had been made restraining the appellant’s assets would in due course be overtaken by an assets forfeiture order pursuant to s 22 Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 with the consequence that no further opportunity would be available to the appellant to purge his contempt. It was in these circumstances that the matter came before Adams J for consideration of the appropriate determinate sentence. 
     
      
    10 Adams J identified that in sentencing the appellant he was required to proceed in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (see Principal Registrar of Supreme Court of NSW v Jando (2001) 53 NSWLR 527 at 537-538; Principal Registrar of Supreme Court of NSW v Tran (2006) NSWSC 1183; 166 A Crim R 393; R v Bilal Razzak (2006) NSWSC 1366; 166 A Crim R 132). 
     
      
    11 Before Adams J the appellant made three points. He firstly submitted that the restraining order, which was the foundation for the order for examination, should not have been granted since it was procured by the Commission fraudulently and oppressively. Secondly the appellant submitted that he was justified in refusing to assist by participating in an examination because the respondent had acted unlawfully. Finally he submitted that the order for his examination was contrary to his fundamental right not to give evidence that might incriminate him. 
     
      
    12 Adams J received evidence concerning the appellant’s physical and psychological condition. With respect to these matters his Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think it appropriate that I do make some allowance for the offender’s mental condition which has made it somewhat more difficult for him than would otherwise be the case to rationally and calmly consider his position. At the same time I am quite convinced that his refusal to obey the orders for examination is motivated, in essence, by a desire to keep from the authorities any information that might assist them to locate assets of which, he believes, they are presently unaware. To some extent also I accept that this may place him at a disadvantage in dealing with other prisoners and the prison environment. 
        
       
       
        
        I also take into account the offender’s medical condition. I am satisfied that it does make it much more difficult for him to cope with the prison environment than an ordinary prisoner. This is exacerbated by his extreme sensitivity to cigarette smoke which he claims (and I have little difficulty in accepting) is virtually every where in the prison. 
        
       
      
    13 With respect to the appropriate sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        30 An appropriate punishment for the offender’s contempt, taking into account all the objective and subjective features to which I have referred, is of the order of three years. The purpose of this punishment would be frustrated if the term were concurrent with the sentences which he is presently serving. As will have been noted, the term of imprisonment relating to his involvement with the importation of drugs expired on 4 January 2008 though the sentence does not expire until 4 January 2014. The twelve-month sentence imposed by Bell J commenced on 5 June 2007 and expires on 4 June 2008.  
         
         
        31 I bear in mind that it is necessary to have regard to the principle of totality when accumulating sentences. Were it not for Hulme J’s sentence I would have sentenced the offender to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years. If this term is added to the sentence imposed by Bell J, the offender would be entitled to be considered for parole on 4 June 2011. If released on that date, he would be on parole for a further two years and five months to complete the sentence imposed for the drug offence. This would mean that he would have spent ten years and five months in continuous custody. Having regard to the principle of totality, I consider that this sentence of effective imprisonment should be reduced somewhat. Accordingly, I propose to make an order that will permit the offender to be considered for release on parole on 15 June 2010. It seems to me that it would not be appropriate to sentence the offender to a fixed term of three years to commence on the date upon which he was sentenced by Hulme J because this sentence would be almost completely concurrent with those imposed for the drug offence and by Bell J. The purpose of punishing for contempt would, as I have mentioned, be almost completely frustrated. The effect of my order will be to reduce the potential parole period envisaged by the terms of the drug sentence, but this is inescapable. In the circumstances, I do not think that any further reduction in the time to be served by the offender for his contempt can be justified. 
         
         
        32 Accordingly, the sentence I impose is a fixed term of four years and six months commencing 16 December 2005 and ending on 15 June 2010 upon which date the offender will be eligible to be considered for parole in respect of the sentence of thirteen years he is serving for the drug offence which expires on 4 January 2014.” 
        
       
      
    14 The appellant appears for himself. The ground of appeal identified in his Notice of Appeal reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “To appeal conviction and the severity of contempt of court before Registrar Youness. The appeal is expressed to be against the decision of Adams J.” 
        
       
      
    15 The appeal was supported by lengthy written submissions. In those submissions the appellant argued that his conviction for contempt should be set aside. He emphasised that the affidavit which supported the orders that he attend for examination was sworn by Mark Standen, an assistant director/senior investigating officer of the respondent, who has since been arrested and charged with serious offences, making his evidence in the appellant’s proceedings unreliable. He further submitted that because an order has now been made that he forfeit his assets there is no utility in his further punishment for contempt. He further submitted that the sentence imposed by Adams J was excessive and that his Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the appellant’s medical condition, in particular the report of Dr Braune which referred to the possibility that the appellant may have paranoid ideation, be mentally impaired by way of judgment and have some other symptoms of organic brain disease. 
     
      
    16 The charge of contempt was founded on the disobedience by the appellant of the order that he answer questions before the registrar of the Supreme Court. Unless that order was set aside the appellant was required to answer when asked. 
     
      
    17 The evidence before Hulme J, which I do not understand to be disputed by the appellant, was that the appellant indicated to a registrar that he was not prepared to take an oath or affirmation or be examined as required by the order made by Simpson J on 4 July 2001. That order was not appealed and when the matter came before Hulme J no challenge was made to it. The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of contempt. 
     
      
    18 By his plea of guilty the appellant acknowledged both his obligation and his failure to obey the court’s order. He was rightly convicted of contempt. The challenge which the appellant now seeks to make to his conviction by reason of the fact that Mr Standen has been charged is not a matter which can be considered by this Court. 
     
      
    19 In support of the submission that the sentence imposed by Adams J was manifestly excessive the appellant referred to 11 decisions of this Court where, in varying circumstances, custodial sentences and, in some cases, fines were imposed for contempt. The maximum penalty imposed in these cases was imprisonment for a period of 12 months. He argued that by comparison the sentence of a fixed term of 4 years and 6 months imposed by Adams J was excessive. He further submitted that his Honour should have imposed a period of parole and, I infer, submitted that part of the determinate sentence should have been served on parole. He nominated a period of 13½ months as the appropriate period of parole which would have allowed his release from prison in April 2009. 
     
      
    20 The actions of the appellant in twice refusing to submit to an examination before the Supreme Court were serious. It was a contumacious contempt in circumstances where the appellant was fully aware of the possible consequences. This Court has on many occasions considered the correct approach to punishment for contempt in similar circumstances. In Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Maniam (No 2) (1992) 26 NSWLR 309 Kirby P observed at 314-315: 
     
      
       
        
        “A conviction of contempt of court is a conviction of an offence, criminal in nature. Punishment of the convicted contemnor must therefore take into account the considerations normally applicable to the punishment of crime and apt to uphold the purpose of this jurisdiction, viz, the undisturbed and orderly administration of justice in the courts according to law. Thus, in determining the punishment which is apt to the circumstances which have led to a conviction of contempt, it is appropriate to bear in mind the purposes of punishing the contemnor; deterring the contemnor and others in the future from committing like contempts; and denouncing the conduct concerned in an approximately emphatic way: see  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd 
         (1987) 8 NSWLR 732 at 741. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        The most serious class of contempt, from the point of view of sanction, is contumacious contempt. Not every intentional disobedience involves a conscious defiance of the authority of the Court which is the essence of this class of contempt: see  
        Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan 
         (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 500. This class of contempt is reserved to cases where the behaviour of the contemnor has been shown to be aimed at the integrity of the courts and designed to degrade the administration of justice, as distinguished from a simple interference with property rights manifested by a court order: cf  
        Root v MacDonald 
         157 NE 684 (1927) at 688; 54 Am LR1422 (1927) at 1429. In cases where such a measure of wilfulness is established, the court may proceed to punish the convicted contemnor by the imposition of a custodial sentence or a fine or both. In such a case the elements necessary to establish wilfulness, carrying as they do the potential of penal consequences, must all be proved to the criminal standard: see  
        Consolidated Press Ltd v McRae 
         (1955) 93 CLR 325 at 333. The procedures of a criminal prosecution must be strictly observed: see  
        Spindler v Balog 
         (1959) 76 WN (NSW) 391 at 393.” 
        
       
      
    21 In Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Gilby (unreported, NSWCA 20 August 1991) this Court identified the factors to be taken into account when punishing for a contempt in the context of deliberate refusal to give evidence. They are: 
     
      
       
      1. the objective seriousness of the contempt; 
       
      2. whether the contemnor was aware of the consequences of what he proposed to do; 
       
      3. whether the contempt was committed in the context of serious crime; 
       
      4. whether the contempts were motivated by fear of harm should evidence be given; 
       
      5. whether the contemnor had received a benefit by indicating an intention to give evidence. 
       
      
    22 In the present case there was no suggestion that the appellant was motivated by a fear of harm should he give evidence. There was also no suggestion that he had received a benefit by indicating a previous intention to give evidence. The contempt was committed in the context of serious crime, being his involvement in substantial drug offences. It was the second occasion upon which he had refused to give evidence and, compounding his contempt, he made plain that he would continue to do so.  
     
      
    23 The Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 has been provided by the Parliament for the purpose of ensuring that those who seek to profit from major crime are deprived of the benefit of their illegal activity. The legislation provides investigative processes designed to facilitate the recovery of the relevant assets. When, as in the present case, an individual refuses to cooperate and answer questions the purpose of the legislation can be entirely frustrated. 
     
      
    24 Adams J gave careful consideration to the length of the sentence and its relationship to the sentences which the appellant was already serving for his drug offences. His Honour considered the date upon which the sentence should commence, mindful of the need to provide for effective punishment of the appellant for his contempt, and also allow for an appropriate period of parole to be served pursuant to the sentence imposed for the drug offence. After giving consideration to questions of totality his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of 4 years and 6 months. Although his Honour did not expressly refer to the need to consider a non-parole period for the contempt offence, his Honour’s discussion of the relationship between the proposed sentence and the existing sentences make plain that he was mindful of the need to provide for an appropriate period of fulltime custody for the contempt offence. His Honour’s approach was appropriate. 
     
      
    25 It is apparent from the remarks of Adams J that his Honour was mindful of the appellant’s health problems. His Honour indicated that he accepted that the appellant suffers from Churg-Strauss syndrome with associated breathing difficulties. This may make it more difficult for him to cope with the prison environment, particularly if exposed to smoke, but there is no suggestion that his health has been or will be further compromised by his continuing incarceration.  
     
      
    26 It is correct, as the appellant identified, that a forfeiture order has now been made and the coercive component of the sentence is now irrelevant. However, it was because it was contemplated that a forfeiture order would be made that it was decided that a determinate sentence should be imposed, the sentence imposed by Hulme J having failed to persuade the appellant to respond to the order for the examination. 
     
      
    27 Notwithstanding the appellant’s lengthy written submissions I am not persuaded that Adams J failed to have appropriate regard to relevant matters or that his sentencing discretion has miscarried. Having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and notwithstanding the appellant’s health difficulties the sentence was not excessive. 
     
      
    28 In my opinion leave should be granted to the appellant to appeal out of time but the appeal should be dismissed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 20 May 2009, after a four week trial, the offender was convicted of an offence of breaking and entering in company with the intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely to intimidate a man by the name of SA. At the same time the jury found the offender not guilty of a more serious charge, namely breaking and entering in company with intent to kidnap a woman by the name of RM, she was at the time SA’s wife.2 The offender had been involved in the running of mobile telephone stores for some time. It is through that occupation that he met RM and then SA.3 The offender suffers from a condition called dyspraxia which interferes with his ability to speak and comprehend. He has had very few friends in his life, and was a person who could be easily manipulated by others who preferred their interests over his. RM was one such person. 4 She came into his life when she met the offender after being employed by him at one of his stores. They became friends and RM began to require, as part of her friendship with the offender, that the offender would assist her with problems she was having with her family. Perhaps because of the offender’s difficulties in making friends he did what RM required. He helped her to leave her family home on two occasions when RM expressed a desire to run away. 5 A short time after the second of those occasions RM’s father began to take steps to arrange for RM’s marriage. She, without telling her family, then left Australia to go to Jordan, where she immediately married SA who was living over there at the time. The offender assisted her to leave Australia, and also when she later came back. 6 It is clear that on her return to Australia RM complained of domestic violence at the hands of her husband, not only to the offender but to others as well. The offender’s reaction, however, went far beyond what was reasonable. In part that was due to his dyspraxia. It was also due to a series of emails which he received, purported from RM, which became exhibit M in the trial. These emails were the subject of a great deal of evidence in the trial.7 (At one stage the Crown put to the offender in cross-examination that the emails were fabricated by him after his arrest. In the course of that cross-examination the Crown put as a positive proposition something which the Crown later acknowledged should not have been put, but which was never withdrawn. It is probable that no harm was done, however, because in response to what was asserted by the Crown in cross-examination the offender convincingly demonstrated that the emails were received by him well before 22 August 2006, the day on which the offence was committed.) 8 As matters turned out it may well be that the emails did not come from RM but were perhaps an attempt by two men, who knew of the offender’s relationship with RM, to obtain some money from him. The evidence was not sufficient to draw any conclusion at all about who sent the emails beyond this: the emails were received by the offender and he believed they came from RM. I make that finding even in the light of evidence which I learned about only today concerning the offender’s other criminal activities around this time, they including activities involving fraud.9 In those emails the offender was asked by RM for his assistance in order that she may leave her husband. Accordingly the offender transferred $6,000 to a bank account nominated in the emails, but when the offender began to harbour suspicions that SA had become aware of the emails he took steps to recover the money. Contact from RM then ceased.10 The offender was able to discover where RM was living and he hired a private investigator, and asked his other employees to drive past RM’s home from time to time. I am satisfied that the reason the offender did these things was a combination of concern for her welfare and obsession that the offender had with RM, to some extent that obsession being attributable to RM’s manipulation of the offender.11 Most relevantly to a sentence I have to impose upon the offender one of the things he did, after contact with RM ceased, was engaged the services of two men. It was their actions on the evening of 22 August which led to the offence for which the offender must now be sentenced. 12 Many of the events of that evening were undisputed at trial, and as it turns out the issue for the jury to decide was relatively narrow. As far as the alternative count, that is the count on which the offender was found guilty, is concerned there was no dispute that the offender arranged for the two men to intimidate SA, and the only issue for the jury to determine was whether they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender either agreed that the two men would break and enter SA’s home, or thought it reasonably possible that they would do so.13 The offender said that he was present at the time because he was on a rescue mission, that is he was there to allow SA’s wife, RM, to leave her relationship in which she was subject to violence. The Crown case throughout the trial, ultimately rejected by the jury, was that in fact the offender was there to kidnap RM, not rescue her, because he was obsessed with her.14 On 22 August 2006 the offender, Ms Virginie Bond who was an employee of the offender’s, and the two men, went to the home where RM lived with SA. They went in the offender’s own car. The plan was not to take RM against her will but to allow her the opportunity to leave the home voluntarily if she wished, keeping SA at bay in order that she could do so. It was of course part of the offender’s obsession with RM that he believed that she would willingly leave the home and go away with him.15 SA had previously assaulted the offender. Not only for that reason, but others, he was known to be a violent person, and so the only way he could be kept at bay would be through threats of violence, if not actual violence. It was therefore clear that the plan for which the offender was responsible involved SA’s intimidation.16 When the two men got out of the offender’s car leaving him and Ms Bond behind they went to the front door. They knocked loudly on it. It was late at night so SA did not open the door. The two men responded by firstly throwing a paving brick through a large window, and then, having got a machete from the car, waving it about through that open window. It was the actions of one of the two men in waving the machete through the open window which amounted to the breaking and entering of the home. The two men did not themselves enter the home, and after a short time they returned to the offender’s car, which was driven away.17 One of the issues at trial, and one of the issues on the sentence proceedings today, concerned whether the offender was aware of the machete being in the car, and also whether the machete was taken by one of the two men when they first left the car. I am prepared to sentence the offender on this basis: that he was not aware of the machete in the car until, after having left the car, one of them returned to the car, took the machete from a bag, and returned back to the home.18 At trial the issue for the jury to determine was whether the joint criminal enterprise in which the offender was involved encompassed the breaking and entering of the home in which RM lived with SA. Was breaking and entering in company part of the agreement the offender had with the two men, or as an alternative did he think it was reasonably possible that in intimidating SA they would commit the offence of breaking and entering in company?19 I am satisfied, consistent with the jury’s verdict, and consistent with my understanding and findings on the evidence, that although it was part of the plan that SA would open the door, and therefore there would not need to be a breaking and entering, the offender contemplated as reasonably possible that if SA did not open the door then entry to the house would be forced, SA held at bay, and RM invited to leave voluntarily.20 I regard as significant the evidence given by Ms Bond. She, it will be recalled, was one of the people who went with the offender and the two men to RM’s home that evening. She described the offender’s reactions as he and she waiting in the car. Those reactions, I am satisfied, are consistent with the two men doing something which the offender did not actual desire would occur albeit, as the jury found, he contemplated the possibility of something of that nature occurring.21 This trial, more than most, involved Crown witnesses whose evidence was largely unreliable. The main Crown witness, RM, was shown to have told lies in many areas. During the course of her evidence she claimed that because of her suffering from a bi-polar disorder, which was not being treated at the time of the trial, her thinking was irrational. It was my impression that she was anxious to agree that she was irrational because she was concerned that she could be proved to be dishonest. Whether her unreliability flowed from her deliberate deception, which I think is more likely, or her irrational thinking, does not matter, but unreliable her evidence certainly was. 22 Also, SA, and RM’s father JM, gave evidence which was punctuated by regular lies. Their attempts to deny that RM was subject to violence, or restraints on her freedom, were proved in many respects to be false. 23 In determining therefore the factual basis on which the offender is to be sentenced I have had little regard to what those three witnesses said, preferring to base my conclusions on the independent evidence. It would seem that the jury took a similar approach.24 In assessing the criminality of the offender one important thing must be borne firmly in mind: consistent with the jury’s verdicts and consistent with my view of the evidence, the offender was on what he saw as a rescue mission. As far as he was concerned he was not intending to take RM against her will because he wanted simply to be with her. He was, in his mind at least, giving her the opportunity of leaving her husband safely. The offender believed that there was a real risk that RM was trapped, that she was subject to violence, and that she wanted to leave her husband, but that she could not do so without assistance. This is a highly significant matter in assessing the gravity of the offender’s conduct. He was prepared to break the law, even to the extent of committing the offence for which he is to be sentenced, in order to assist RM.25 RM took advantage of the offender, a man easily taken advantage of. The evidence tendered by Mr King in the form of references and statements made by the offender’s friends suggest, without contradiction from the Crown, that the offender is a person who was prepared to go to significant lengths to assist his friends. It is this attitude towards his friends that RM took advantage of.26 His motivation is very important in assessing where in the range of objective seriousness the present offence falls. This offence carries with it a standard non parole period of five years. I am satisfied, in the light of my findings as to the offender’s motivation, that this offence is below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and indeed significantly so.27 This is not of course to in any way forgive or minimise the offender’s conduct. The offender’s relationship with RM culminated of course in actions which were in may respects bizarre and worrying, and showed a significant level of obsession, ultimately concluding in actions which were not only worrying, but seriously criminal indeed. There is no evidence that the offender is remorseful for what he has done. 28 He may have been remorseful that it was necessary, as he perceived it, for the men to actually break and enter the home, but as I have said, and as is consistent with the jury’s verdict, it was a real possibility he was prepared to contemplate.29 This morning I dealt by appeals, one by the Crown and one by the offender, relating to offences of dishonesty. As part of the hearing of those appeals matters relating to the offender’s subjective circumstances were tendered. One important aspect of that concerned the offender’s assistance to the authorities. That assistance directly related to one of the series of offences the offender committed. His assistance remains of relevance in determining the appropriate sentence in this case. Usually I must exercise some circumspection in identifying what it is that the offender has done in order that his time in custody is not made harder as other criminals learn of what he has done, this is no exception, especially as these remarks will be publicly available. All I will say is having taken the assistance into account, the sentence I will impose is approximately fifteen per cent lower than it would otherwise have been.30 The offender comes from a loving family. His parents were able to identify early in his life that the offender suffered from dyspraxia. They took significant steps to, as much as could be done, overcome the disabilities associated with that condition.31 The offender left school before finishing high school and commenced work at Tandy. He opened his own telephone stores where, as I have mentioned, he met RM.32 He spent some time in custody bail refused on this matter, but even after release on bail he was able to obtain some work with J Carr Electronics. This tends to suggest that the offender has an enviable work ethic, prepared to work hard in order to advance himself. One of the reasons he is prepared to work so hard is that, as I understand it, he wants to show others that he can be a success in life. Unfortunately, as I mentioned this morning, that desire was such that it led to him committing offences of dishonesty, and is no doubt related to his willingness to assist RM as she required in the present matter.33 Another matter I have already mentioned this morning concerns his parents’ current medical conditions. Those conditions will mean that they do suffer from having their son in gaol more than most loving parents, but that hardship is not exceptional and must be ignored. Nevertheless it is relevant to the circumstances in which the offender will serve his time in custody, he knowing that his criminal behaviour has caused distress to his family.34 It is also possible that the offender will spend some of his time, if not all of his sentence, in protective custody, and it is possible that this will involve conditions of custody less favourable than those applying to the general prison population. I have taken those risks into account also in formulating the appropriate sentence.35 The offences that I considered this morning are relevant in other ways as well. For a group of those offences the offender was sentenced to full time imprisonment. I must apply principles of totality. I must also consider the effect of accumulation, as there must of course be, on a finding of special circumstances. I am prepared to make that finding not only because of accumulation but also because of the offender’s dyspraxia, and that this is first time in custody. 36 It seems that the offender was not actually on bail for the other offences however he was waiting to be sentenced for those matters. In those circumstances the offender nevertheless committed this offence, that is a matter I will take into account in formulating the appropriate sentence. It demonstrates an attitude towards the law which is scarcely to the offender’s credit. 37 Clearly the gravity of this offence requires a sentence of full time imprisonment. It is a fundamental rule of sentencing that a sentence reflect the objective gravity in the offender’s conduct. The offender’s conduct was significantly criminal indeed. The description of the behaviour of the two men, the breach of the peace that represented, the fear felt not only by SA but by his neighbours, all show how wrong the offender’s conduct was.38 It is appropriate that the sentence I will now impose commence at the end of the non parole period of the sentence I imposed this morning. 39 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period for one year to date from 20 November 2009, and a total term of two years. The offender’s non parole period will expire on 19 November 2010, on which day the offender is to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: I agree with Harrison J, concerning grounds 2 and 3, but give my own reasons concerning ground 1. 
     
      
    2 In R v Ronen [2006] NSWCCA 123, (2006) 161 A Crim R 300 the charges against the Appellants concerned a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of taxation revenue. The maximum penalty under the sections of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) that applied to any such conspiracy was 20 years imprisonment. Those provisions of the Crimes Act were replaced by s 135.4 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), which created a variety of offences connected with conspiracy to defraud, and provided for them a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. It was in relation to the replacement of the 20 year penalty for the conspiracy offences with a 10 year penalty that the Explanatory Memorandum concerning the Criminal Code had stated that the previous penalty was ""far too high"". 
     
      
    3 In contrast, in the present case the offences that the Appellant committed under the Crimes Act were contraventions of s 29D of that Act, which provided: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A person who defrauds the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth is guilty of an indictable offence."" 
        
       
      
    Section 29D provided a penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The offences with which the Appellant was charged under the Criminal Code were against s 135.1(5), which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A person is guilty of an offence if: 
         
        
        
         
        (a) the person dishonestly causes a loss, or dishonestly causes a risk of loss, to another person; and 
         
         
        (b) the first-mentioned person knows or believes that the loss will occur or that there is a substantial risk of the loss occurring; and 
         
         
        (c) the other person is a Commonwealth entity."" 
        
       
      
    The penalty for contravention of s 135.1 is imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    5 The Criminal Code also contains s 134.1, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
         
          
           
          (a) the person, by a deception, dishonestly obtains property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of the property; and 
           
           
          (b) the property belongs to a Commonwealth entity. 
           
          
         
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        (2) Absolute liability applies to the paragraph (1)(b) element of the offence."" 
        
       
      
    6 The Explanatory Memorandum relating to s 135.1 (quoted by Harrison J at par [24]) contains no acknowledgement that the penalty under the former s 29D was too high (let alone ""far too high""). Indeed, it recognised that those cases that fell under the former s 29D that involved deception could be charged under s 134.1 and 134.2, which had an identical penalty to the former s 29D. 
     
      
    7 There is no room for doubt that the appellant deceived the Commonwealth, by making claim for a benefit under a false name, and repeatedly giving the Commonwealth false information to justify his continued receipt of the benefit. For conduct like that, the penalty that could arise under the Criminal Code was exactly the same as the penalty that could arise under the Crimes Act. Ground 1 fails because the premise from which it starts – that Parliament has shown a different policy towards sentencing for such an offence under the Criminal Code to that which it had shown under the Crimes Act – is not made out. That a prosecutor has chosen to prosecute the Appellant for an offence under s 135.1, rather than under s 134.1, does not involve any acknowledgement that the conduct is any less serious than a contravention of s 29D Crimes Act. 
     
      
    8 I agree with the order proposed by Harrison J 
     
      
    9 LATHAM J: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    10 HARRISON J: The applicant pleaded guilty on 21 August 2007 to seven charges relating to fraudulent claims for social security payments over the period from 1978 to 2006. The total amount involved was $203,669.21. The offences were as follows: 
     
      
      1. One offence pursuant to s 29B of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1914 
       (Cth) (""the Act""). 
       
       
      2. Four offences pursuant to s 29D of the Act 
       
       
      3. Two offences pursuant to s 135.1(5) of the  
      Criminal Code Act 
        
      1995 
       (Cth) (""the Code""). 
       
      
    11 The applicant was committed for sentence to the District Court and was sentenced by his Honour Puckeridge DCJ on 21 February 2008 to an effective head sentence of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 21 February 2008 and expiring on 20 August 2012. The sentences were all to be served concurrently. His Honour imposed a single non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months commencing on 21 February 2008 and ending on 20 October 2010 in accordance with s 19AB of the Act. The effective ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence was approximately 60 per cent. 
     
      
    12 The offence pursuant to s 29B of the Act involved the sum of $26,166.30 between about 25 May 1978 and about 24 October 1984. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 2 years. The sentence imposed was imprisonment for 12 months taking into account a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    13 The four s 29D offences were as follows: 
     
     $45,650.20 between about 25 October 1984 and about 11 November 1991. 
     $45,099.60 between about 12 November 1984 and about 30 June 1997. 
     $4,602.00 between about 1 July 1997 and about 4 February 1998. 
     $27,598.00 between about 5 February 1998 and about 23 May 2001. 
       
    14 The maximum penalty for these offences was imprisonment for 10 years. His Honour imposed the same sentence of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months for each s 29D offence. The ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence was approximately 60 per cent. 
     
      
    15 The two s 135.1(5) offences were as follows: 
     
      
     $12,236.65 between about 24 May 2001 and about 10 October 2002. 
     $42,316.05 between about 11 October 2002 and about 19 June 2006. 
       
    16 The maximum penalty for these offences was imprisonment for 5 years. His Honour observed that although these offences were under a different Act, the same criminality was involved. He imposed the same sentence for each offence being imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months. The effective ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence was 82 per cent. 
     
      
    Background facts 
     
      
    17 The applicant was born on 13 November 1932 in the United Kingdom. He emigrated to Australia and later married. In 1967 his daughter Karen was born. In 1972 he commenced claiming a social security benefit due to the fact that he was suffering from a permanent but not total loss of vision. 
     
      
    18 The offending conduct commenced in 1978 when the applicant claimed a second benefit also on account of impaired vision in the name of Gerald Deacon. The applicant was entitled to the first benefit but not the second. This second claim continued to be made from 1978 onwards. On various occasions the applicant supplied documentation as requested by the Commonwealth or engaged in correspondence with the Commonwealth in an attempt to continue to receive these benefits. The payments continued until 2006. Centrelink investigations commenced in 2005. The total amount overpaid to the applicant as a result of the offences was $203,669.21 over a period of 28 years. 
     
      
    19 At the date of sentencing the applicant was aged 75 and he was in ill-health. Evidence before the court demonstrated that he was suffering from progressive optic atrophy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and degenerative changes in his lumbo sacral spine. Dr Pham's opinion was that a period of full time imprisonment would have a grave effect upon the applicant's health and well being. Dr Kelly gave evidence that he was at risk in prison due to his severe renal problems. This is referred to in more detail later in these reasons. 
     
      
    Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
    20 The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the severity of his sentence upon the following grounds: 
     
      
      1. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to consider or take into account the change in the legislature's policy toward the offences under s 29D. 
       
       
      2. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the applicant's disabilities. 
       
       
      3. The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    21 By the time that the applicant was sentenced the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 1999 (Cth) had been enacted. Items 148 and 149 of Schedule 2 of that Act repealed ss 29A, 29B, 29C, 29D and 30 of the Act and substituted various sections of the Code. Relevantly in the applicant's submission, the s 29D offences for which the applicant was sentenced were repealed. In its place were created a series of offences of general dishonesty under s 135.1. Those offences are obtaining a gain, causing a loss and influencing a public official. The maximum penalty for these offences is 5 years imprisonment. The applicant submitted that the provisions of s 135.1 of the Code would now cover the offending conduct and that the applicant should have been sentenced having regard to the reduced maximum penalty for which the new section provides. In particular, the sentences imposed for the s 29D offences were 4 years and 6 months predicated upon a maximum term of 10 years rather than a maximum term of 5 years. The applicant submitted that the sentences should be ""significantly reduced"" in order to take account of what is described as ""the change of legislative policy"". It was submitted that the issue in the appeal under this ground was the obligation of the sentencing judge to take into account the change in the legislative attitude to this type of offending and to reduce the impact of the maximum penalty accordingly. 
     
      
    22 In support of that submission the applicant drew upon the judgment of this Court in Ronen (supra). In that case it was argued unsuccessfully that the sentencing judge had erred in finding that the maximum penalty for offences under s 86A and s 86(2) of the Act was 20 years imprisonment. The Crown contended that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate, arguing that the sentencing judge erred in taking into account the maximum penalty for the offences under the Code or what had been said about the penalty for the repealed offences in the Executive Memorandum. Howie J said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[71] It is unusual in my experience to find a parliament acknowledging by act or statement that a legislatively prescribed penalty was excessive for the criminality inherent in the offence to which it related. Yet that is what occurred in the present case. In the future offenders, such as the applicants, will face a maximum penalty under the Code that is half of that which applied under the Act. The Executive Memorandum contains a clear acknowledgment that the penalty under the Act was ""far too high"". It is impossible in my opinion for a court, sentencing persons such as the applicants for offences under the Act, to ignore these two indications of Parliament's change of mind as to the seriousness with which it views the kind of conduct that was committed by the applicants. 
         
         
         
         ***** 
         
         
        [73] I find it impossible, consistently with this approach, to ignore legislative acts or statements that indicate that Parliament's view of the seriousness of particular criminal conduct, as reflected in the maximum penalty for an offence punishing that conduct, has changed. This is particularly so where the offending occurs at a time relatively proximate to the expression of the change of view. The applicants' criminal conduct came to an end in 2001 the same year that the legislation was amended.  
         
         
         
        [74] In my opinion the Judge was correct to take into account the change in the legislature's attitude to this type of offending and to reduce the impact of the maximum penalty accordingly. Even though the transitional provisions retained the maximum penalty, those provisions applied to all the offences that were being repealed and not simply the offence with which the applicants had been charged. That general provision as it applied to the applicants had to be considered against the specific indications of Parliament's change of attitude with respect to fraud offences such as those with which the applicants had been charged."" 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour had earlier considered the legislative intention at par [25] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[25] When introducing the bill containing the new Code provisions on 24 November 1999, the Attorney General described the amendments as providing ""a wide range of modern offences to protect the Commonwealth Government and public officials from criminals who would cause them financial harm or seek to obstruct, threatened or harm them"". The Attorney also stated, ""The bill…replaces existing Crimes Act 1914 offences with a modern and transparent scheme for preventing and punishing theft, fraud, bribery, forgery and related offences"". He also noted that the bill ""brings about uniformity in penalties for key offences, which have long differed between state and federal jurisdictions, and between different acts"" and referred to the maximum penalty of 10 years for the fraud offence."" 
        
       
      
    24 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill is relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Proposed section 135.1 - General dishonesty 
         
         
        189. Proposed section 135.1 contains a codified equivalent to section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914. Section 29D is not a very transparent offence. It relies on the meaning of 'defraud' which is dependent on case law for its meaning. Indeed most jurisdictions do not have a 'defraud' offence and the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee did not consider it to be suitable for general use. However, the Gibbs Committee favoured retaining it and there is a case for using it to protect Commonwealth entities because of their vulnerability to dishonest conduct. 
         
         
        190. Consistent with decisions such as that of the House of Lords in Scott [1975] AC 819 and Australian cases O'Donovan v Vereker (1987) 76 ALR 97 at 110 and Eade (1984) 14 A Crim R 186, the proposed offence does not require the prosecution to prove that the accused deceived the victim and as such falls below the appropriate level of culpability required for an offence with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. In recognition that the offence is much broader than fraud, it is proposed that section 135.1 should have a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Where there is evidence of deception, the more serious fraud offences should be charged (proposed sections 134.1 and 134.2). Indeed the vast majority of the offences charged under section 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 involve deception and can be charged under proposed sections 134.1 and 134.2. There will be the occasional case where obtain by deception cannot be charged. In those circumstances there may be questions as to whether it is appropriate that the person be charged with a serious offence, but there will no doubt be some cases where it is justified. Human ingenuity is such that schemes have been and will continue to be devised that make it difficult to establish that the accused deceived the victim. In most jurisdictions, including the UK, it has been decided that such schemes should only be dealt with where there is a conspiracy or by specific offences developed to combat the scheme after it is discovered (for example, taxation legislation)."" 
        
       
      
    25 The Crown also referred to Ronen (supra) and relied upon the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[32] In my opinion the argument should be rejected for very much the same reasons as the sentencing Judge rejected it. The simple fact is that the maximum sentence prescribed by the repealed  
        Crimes Act 
         provisions were not reduced in any real sense. It is artificial in my view to describe the repeal of one offence and the enactment of a different offence as a reduction in the sentence for the repealed offence. Although the offences in s 135.4 of the Code may cover the same criminal activity as did the repealed  
        Crimes Act 
         provisions, they are different offences with different elements and are affected by the Code's provisions in relation to criminal responsibility in Chapter 2. The provisions of the  
        Crimes Act 
         were interpreted according to common law principles that are not completely identical to those that apply to the Code offences. For example, there is no requirement under the Code that the prosecution prove that the offender used dishonest means in carrying out the fraud as there was under the provision in the Act: see  
        Peters v The Queen 
         (1998) 192 CLR 493. It is clear from the second reading speech of the Attorney General that the new offences in the Code were not seen by the legislature as being simply a re-enactment of the offences in the  
        Crimes Act 
         and they should not be treated as if they were. 
         
         
         
         ***** 
         
         
        [41] However, notwithstanding that I am of the opinion that the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years for the conspiracy offences, it may not necessarily follow that the fact that the maximum penalty for the fraud offences in the Code is imprisonment for 10 years is totally irrelevant. The Judge in the present case, as a matter of fairness and justice, took into account the change in attitude of the Parliament to the seriousness of the type of offences committed by the applicants when determining the appropriate sentences to impose upon them. The Crown has argued on its appeal that the Judge was in error in his approach in this regard and I will address this matter when dealing with the Crown appeal."" 
        
       
      
    26 The Crown contended that while a sentencing judge is entitled to take that last mentioned fact into account, it is not an error to fail to refer to it. In any event, as both parties were at pains to emphasise, the offending conduct in this case spanned some 28 years and much of it occurred at a time significantly before the changes to the legislation. Moreover, the applicant's submission appears to overlook or to ignore the fact that the applicant was sentenced in relation to a number of offences that were to be served concurrently. That was an approach taken by the sentencing judge that was favourable to the applicant. 
     
      
    27 In my view the sentencing judge did not fall into error. As the authorities reveal, the legislative changes did not have the effect of re-calibrating the sentences for the offences with which the applicant was charged and to which he pleaded guilty. The significant issue in this respect is that for the most significant proportion of the extensive period over which these offences were committed, the penalties that applied were in line with those to which his Honour had regard. I agree with respect that the repeal of one offence and the enactment of a different offence do not operate as a reduction in the sentence for the repealed offence. The legislation does not say so and the implication that it did so is not strong. An argument to this effect is something to which a judge may, not must, have regard without falling into error so that the failure of a judge to do so does not correspondingly bespeak error. 
     
      
    28 This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    29 Section 16A(2)(m) of the Act requires the Court to take into account in addition to other matters the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person. His Honour said this in the course of his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I come now to consider the non-parole period. After discussions with counsel I have determined that it is appropriate in this court in dealing with Commonwealth offences to set the non-parole period in respect of all of the sentences which I have dealt with at this sitting today. The non-parole period must reflect the overall criminality involved. In this case it has been submitted on behalf of the offender that his disability, which has entitled him to the pension, and the frailty as a result of his age would require a significant reduction so far as the non-parole period of imprisonment [sic]. 
         
         
         
         ***** 
         
         
        I have taken those matters into consideration, but the criminality involved in all the offences requires of the court that it impose a sentence of imprisonment which reflects general deterrence. I have taken into account the age of the prisoner, but consider that the only appropriate sentence was a period of full-time imprisonment. Counsel for the offender has not put any submissions contrary to that when I raised that with him earlier this morning. It is also important that the non-parole period reflects the criminality involved, as I have already stated. 
         
         
        The court is aware that imprisonment in these circumstances of a person of this age with these medical conditions does impose [sic] problems for the authorities."" 
        
       
      
    30 The remarks on sentence contain specific advertence by the sentencing judge to the issues under consideration. Part of what he said includes the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is evidence before the court from a Dr Pham of Carringbah. In her report she has indicated that the offender has a long term progressive optic atrophy with loss of central vision, but that he retains peripheral vision. Dr Pham states that he will be handicapped as a result of this but will be able to cope. He also has a hypertensive condition which requires medication. Dr Pham states that the medication required would be daily medication, and he would also require regular checks of his blood pressure and blood test. It is also stated that the offender suffers with degenerative changes in his lumbosacral spine and has had a recent aggravation of his degenerative condition of the spine due to a fall. 
         
         
        In a subsequent report Dr Pham states that, considering his age and current health, she is of the opinion that full-time imprisonment would have a grave effect on his health and well-being. Dr John J Kelly, a consultant nephrologist, who has also been treating the offender, has stated that the potential health risks of imprisonment to the offender would be the risk of significant injury if he were to fall in an unsafe environment, and the concern that his diet may not be able to be appropriately modified if problems with high blood potassium recur. Dr Kelly states that both of these considerations pose a significant health risk to the offender if they are not appropriately managed."" 
        
       
      
    31 However, his Honour also had regard to other material dealing with the care of prisoners in similar circumstances. His Honour's remarks are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The court is assisted by a letter which is [sic, it] has received from a Dr Virginia Knoll of the Justice Health Department. In a report of 19 October 2007, Dr Knoll states that Justice Health is an area health service of the New South Wales Department of Health tasked with providing health care to patients under the care of the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services. She states that the department has salaried nursing staff in all correctional facilities and visiting general practitioners who provide primary health medical care, and in addition employ specialists in the areas of psychiatry and addiction medicine, and also co-ordinate special treatment for patients through the Prince of Wales Hospital for men and local hospitals for women. 
         
         
        Dr Knoll states that the department has close ties with the Aged Care Assessment Team at the Prince of Wales Hospital, and employs a specialist chronic and aged care clinical nurse consultant who is involved in the co-ordination of care for older patients. Further, that an aged care steering committee with members from Justice Health and the Department of Corrective Services meets monthly to discuss clinical issues and co-ordinate the medical and environmental needs of older patients, and at such meetings recommendations can be made on the most appropriate sites for housing individual patients and arrangements made for alterations of cells, purchase of mobility aids and other equipment. 
         
         
        It is stated by Dr Knoll that, in general, older patients are disbursed in sites through the state, but the steering committee monitors their welfare and may, for example, recommend that a particular individual should be housed in a facility with 24-hour nursing staff on duty or within close range of a hospital. She further states that if an older patient deteriorates to the stage of requiring nursing home level care, this will be provided in the inpatient (B) ward of Long Bay Hospital. 
         
         
        In addition, Dr Knoll states that within 28 days of arrival into custody, older patients have a long term health plan completed in which their ongoing health needs are assessed and organised and that, in summary, the Justice Health Service is able to co-ordinate ongoing medical care for older patients suffering from a variety of health problems including physical and mental illnesses and drug dependence. This report of Dr Knoll is of considerable assistance to the court and does not in any way detract from the need for the non-parole period of imprisonment to reflect the criminality involved."" 
        
       
      
    32 In R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589 King CJ said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence of the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. Ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of the conditions of their health. It is the responsibility of the Correctional Services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners. Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse impact on the offender's health."" 
        
       
      
    33 In R v De Vroome (1987) 38 A Crim R 146 at 147 his Honour applied those remarks in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The courts can make some adjustment to sentences to take account of the additional hardship caused to an offender by his condition, but they are necessarily limited in the extent of such adjustment by the necessity of maintaining proper standards of punishment."" 
        
       
      
    34 I can observe no basis for the submission that his Honour fell into error in any way in the manner in which he had regard to the evidence or applied it to the facts of the present case in the light of these authorities. I do not agree that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant's disabilities or that he focused inappropriately upon the problems that these difficulties would present to the correctional authorities. The very nature of his Honour's deliberations was to have regard to the conditions in which and under which it might be expected that the applicant would be required to serve his sentence. The extent to which appropriate care and medical assistance is available, and the nature and extent of facilities that are at hand to care for prisoners with ill health, are factors that are directly related to questions of whether or not the applicant will or might be subjected to an unduly burdensome period in custody. There is no significant weight of medical opinion that suggests that the applicant's indifferent health will impose unique hardship upon him in the circumstances, even if his period in custody might reasonably if not obviously have been thought to be somewhat easier for him if he were well. The balancing exercise that his Honour was required to undertake having regard to the idiosyncratic nature of the applicant's combination of conditions and the need to impose a sentence that reflected the extent of his criminality does not appear to me to have miscarried. 
     
      
    35 Even though the applicant's age, physical disabilities and limited eyesight are in all likelihood going to make his time in custody difficult, they will not in my view make that experience so difficult as to attract the principles to which King CJ has referred. The necessary limitations that are imposed upon the extent to which an individual's health can operate as a factor favouring a lighter sentence apply to this Court's consideration of whether or not the sentencing judge fell into error. In my opinion no error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    36 This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    37 The applicant submitted that the individual sentences were manifestly excessive both when considered objectively and after taking into account the particular subjective features of this case. 
     
      
    38 For the s 29B offence the sentencing judge is said to have chosen a starting point, before a discount for the plea of guilty, of two thirds of the maximum penalty. For the s 135.1(5) offences the starting point is said to have been 87 per cent of the maximum before the same discount is applied. The overall non-parole period is, as already discussed, 2 years and 8 months. 
     
      
    39 These contentions are to be compared with, or considered in the light of, the following considerations. First, the offending persisted over a period of approximately 28 years. Secondly, the sum of $203,000 is not inconsiderable and was obtained in the course of a premeditated scheme involving a false identity. Thirdly, the offences did not cease until the applicant was detected. 
     
      
    40 The Crown emphasised the line of authorities that underscores the heavy penalties that those who defraud the social welfare system might expect to encounter. See, for example, R v Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570; R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405, (2002) 134 A Crim R 286; R v Purdon (Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 March 1997, unreported). The importance of general deterrence when sentencing for offences of this type has also been emphasised: see R v Keir [2004] NSWCCA 106; Bick v R [2006] NSWCCA 408 at [16]; R v Purdon (supra). 
     
      
    41 The Crown also submitted that the applicant's attention to the individual sentences imposed and their relevant starting points should yield as a matter of importance to the overall sentence that was actually imposed: Rutkowskyj v R [2008] NSWCCA 10; SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19, (2007) 168 A Crim R 249; cf TYN v R [2009] NSWCCA 146 at [34]. 
     
      
    42 In my view the sentences imposed by his Honour were within the range of sentences imposed for like offences. The sentences were not in any sense outside what might be expected to apply in cases involving the level of systematic and repeated deception that was the hallmark of the present offences. Comparison with cases such as Bick v R (supra) and Charkawi v R [2008] NSWCCA 159 makes this clear. Having regard to the principle of totality I observe again that the complete absence of any accumulation of the sentences imposed for the individual offences amounted to a significant amelioration of the sentences overall. 
     
      
    43 The sentences imposed by his Honour were not manifestly excessive. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    44 In my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

      2008/10106 REGINA v Elie ZEILAA 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender was charged that on 11 February 2008 he murdered his wife. He was committed for trial to this Court. However shortly thereafter a question arose as to his fitness to be tried. On 20 March 2009, after hearing evidence from a number of psychiatrists, I determined that he was fit to plead to an indictment charging him with murder although he might not have been fit to stand trial on that charge. As a result the offender was immediately re-arraigned on that date and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the indictment. The parties agree that the manslaughter offence is based upon the offender’s responsibility for the killing being substantially reduced by his mental disorder. 
     
      
    2 There was a statement of facts tendered. On 11 February 2008 an argument arose between the offender and the deceased, during which the deceased indicated that she was thinking of leaving him. The offender went to his bedroom and took up a hunting knife from a bedside drawer. He returned to the kitchen where he repeatedly stabbed the deceased. There were 19 wounds inflicted upon her. 
     
      
    3 The offender, while still holding the knife, walked outside his house and yelled, “I killed her, I killed her, I killed the bitch, call the police, call the police”. A neighbour dialled triple 0. When police arrived the offender was still standing outside with the knife. He put down the knife when told to do so. He said, “I think she’s dead. I want her dead. I wanted to kill her.” Later he told police, “I don’t (sic) want to do it, she made me. I want to die.” He was arrested and taken to a police station. During the journey he said, “I don't (sic) want to do it. She made me do it. I swear to God I didn't want to do it. I pray to my God but I had to do it, she made me. Please don't tell my daughter it will kill her too. We have trouble for long time. She hit me. I say please don’t do it. She always out. She have (sic) lots of sisters. Always out. I have nobody. I want to die”. 
     
      
    4 The offender and his wife were married when she was aged 17 and he 23. In the later part of their marriage there were frequent arguments. Although the offender told Dr Nielssen, a psychiatrist who prepared a report on the issue of fitness, that he had never used violence against her, there are accounts from other persons in statements tendered before me indicating that he was both verbally and physically abusive to his wife. He appears to have been very domineering toward her and attempted to control her life to his benefit. 
     
      
    5 The offender is 73 years of age. He was born in Lebanon and came to Australia in 1969. He was a shoemaker. He has no criminal record. None of these subjective matters is of any particular weight in this case because of the undisputed evidence in relation to the offender’s mental state at the time of the offence, his current mental state and its prognosis. 
     
      
    6 The offender is suffering from dementia, probably of the Alzheimer’s type. That is the condition that was operative at the time of the stabbing, that is the condition that gave rise to a question as to his fitness to be tried and that is the condition that will dictate what happens to him as a result of the sentence imposed upon him. It seems that the dementia had been progressing for about a year before the stabbing. 
     
      
    7 Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that, at the time of the killing of his wife, the offender was probably manifesting signs and symptoms of dementia of “some degree of severity”. The result was that there was a reduced capacity for the offender to inhibit his impulses. When he was seen by Dr McMahon in February of this year, the offender was in the “early to mid part of Stage 1 of the condition”. After his arrest he was being treated by Dr Reutens a psychiatrist with Justice Health who specialises in such mental disorders. She was of the opinion that the offender was suffering from “mild cognitive impairment that would result in some defect in his ability to reason”. He was in January of this year suffering problems with his memory, judgment and attention. It was these difficulties that gave rise to the issue of his fitness to be tried. 
     
      
    8 As to his prognosis, Dr McMahon stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Prognostically it is likely that his cognitive functioning will continue a gradual decline if left untreated for a further 18 months……… He will then enter Stage II of dementia which can endure from two to 10 years which includes severe memory impairment, apathy and irritability, the onset of psychotic features, abnormal electroencephalograthy, and loss of over learned skills such as self-care routines. Stage III will then ensue with severe intellectual decline, the onset of sub-cortical features such as limb rigidity, loss of continence and loss of language. This stage usually endures from eight to 12 years after initial onset of the condition until death. 
        
       
      
    9 Dr Reutens stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        This (the dementia) is an irreversible process of worsening cognition occurring over years…… in the long term there will be a continual decline in cognitive abilities and he will eventually require assistance with activities of daily living such as dressing and showering. Ultimately, full nursing care is usually required. [The offender] will require ongoing medical monitoring to follow the rate of this decline, to diagnose any complications and to assess his functional capabilities. While the rate of decline is influenced by individual factors and the type of dementia, the duration of the illness is usually about four to 10 years. 
        
       
      
    10 The appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender therefore must take into account, not only the shortened life expectancy that he has as a result of his dementia but also the deterioration in his ability to relate to the world around him, to care and provide for his own welfare and the loss of any enjoyment of life he might have hoped for on release. 
     
      
    11 As with all persons who commit offences of violence as a result of a mental disorder, questions as to the safety of the community arise, especially where, as here, there is no treatment for the disorder. Dr Allnutt believed that there would be an increased risk of violence as the offender’s mental health deteriorates. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Current and internal factors that are active that are associated with increased risk of violence would include the following: he lacks insight into the fact that he suffers the dementia; he continues to manifest a mental condition that affects judgement and in this sense he could find erroneous justification in other setting to act in an aggressive manner; symptoms of dementia persist; with frontal lobe damage and dementia he is at increased risk of impulsivity; dementia is a mental illness that is unlikely to respond to treatment and thus his functioning will deteriorate and with this his potential risk regression and dependency will increase. 
        
       
      
    12 However it is unlikely that the offender will have the ability to carry out significant acts of violence, either because his physical condition will deteriorate or because of the absence of any personal relationship that is likely to bring him into conflict with any person. It is clear that the killing of his wife was a symptom of his domineering relationship toward her and an example of his history of the use or threat of violence against her to make her compliant. It erupted into actual violence of a most serious kind on this occasion because his ability to control his behaviour or exercise judgment was substantially impaired by reason of his mental condition. He is unlikely to be any threat to the public when eventually released because of the continued and unremitting deterioration of his physical and mental capacities as a result of his mental disorder. 
     
      
    13 Although there are persons in the community who are genuinely in fear of him as a result of the killing of his wife, there is no realistic possibility that he will be in a position, or have the desire, to harm any other person when he can eventually be released. He is therefore unlikely to reoffend in any serious way. But his release will initially be subject to him being able to live a law-abiding life in the community. Any realistic fear of violent behaviour arising because of his mental disorder will no doubt be a very significant factor to be taken into account when his release to parole is being considered. 
     
      
    14 This was a serious offence, as is any manslaughter arising from an act intended to kill or inflict serious harm on the victim. It was a frenzied stabbing in the context of a history of abusive conduct towards the victim. Normally such criminal conduct would require a salutary sentence to punish the offender for taking the life of another human being by violence involving the use of a weapon. However, having regard to the present mental condition of the offender and the prognosis of a continued decline in his mental state the denunciation of that conduct should be substantially moderated. The situation is that there is little prospect of the offender having any real enjoyment of life after his release from custody. The difficulty for those who have to consider his release to parole will be his placement in the community. He has no longer any home and no family support. He will be completely reliant upon community services and it will most likely be the case that he will be released into some type of nursing or palliative care. 
     
      
    15 Normally the consideration of general deterrence would feature strongly in assessing any sentence to be imposed for such an offence, it being a domestic killing in the circumstances of a history of threatened, if not actual, violence against a female spouse. But by reason of the offender’s mental state, both at the time of the killing and at the present time, and in light of the prognosis of continued decline until death, it is not appropriate to make an example of him for the purpose of deterring others from similar conduct. 
     
      
    16 I must take into account the offender’s age. It is trite that old age is not a licence to commit crime and generally speaking a person who commits an offence at an advanced age cannot rely upon his age to mitigate the sentence for that offence. But this case is different because the mental disorder, from which the offender suffers and which impaired his responsibility for the offence, is a result of his age. 
     
      
    17 The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter when first arraigned. The arraignment was deferred because of genuine questions raised about the offender’s fitness to plead. It was not until that issue could be determined, through evidence given at a hearing, that any question of the nature of his plea could realistically be considered. However, the offender has always accepted responsibility for killing his wife, although his explanations may have differed from time to time. One of the difficulties for his legal representatives initially was being confident that the offender understood that, because he killed his wife, it did not mean that he was necessarily guilty of murder. It was not until after evidence was given in the fitness hearing that it became apparent to those defending him that the offender could reliably receive advice and give instructions as to how he should plead to the indictment. As soon as the offender was found fit, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. 
     
      
    18 A plea of guilty at arraignment will not normally result in the maximum discount for the utilitarian value of the plea: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. The Court of Criminal Appeal has expressed the view that a delay in the plea will usually impact upon its utilitarian value whatever the reason for the delay: Tazelaar v R [2009] NSWCCA 119. But the amount to be awarded by way of discount is discretionary and it is accepted that there can be unusual situations where fairness may impact upon the determination of the appropriate discount. The Crown conceded that this was an exceptional case where the discount should be at the maximum level. This seems to me to be a case where there has been a significant utilitarian benefit from the plea that was first foreshadowed in September of last year. I am satisfied that the plea came at the first reasonable opportunity. This would not itself justify the maximum discount where there had been significant delay before the plea has been forthcoming: R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117. 
     
      
    19 In this case there was never a real question about the offender pleading guilty to some offence in relation to the death of his wife, provided that he was capable of making that plea. Early in the proceedings the defence identified that the only real issue was whether the defence of substantial impairment could succeed. There was no question that the offender’s responsibility was impaired. The only issue would have been the extent of that impairment and a trial on that matter, if necessary, would have been very brief. The only reason why that issue could not proceed or why the plea could not be made and accepted by the Crown was the question of the offender’s fitness. In these unusual and exceptional circumstances, and despite the delay of the plea until more than 12 month’s after the offence, I am prepared, to give the offender the benefit of a discount of 25 per cent. 
     
      
    20 It is also an unusual case when one comes to consider special circumstances. Much of the significance of the offender’s mental condition goes to a determination of the overall term of imprisonment. I should indicate that the appropriate punishment has been significantly reduced because of the offender’s mental condition and its impact upon his life expectancy and the hope of some worthwhile life after his release. The court should avoid double counting by refraining from using those matters again to find special circumstances unless for some reason they indicate that the non-parole period should be reduced further. The non-parole period is automatically reduced by a reduction in the overall sentence. It is difficult to justify a finding of special circumstances on the basis of a need for a longer period on parole. Nothing will be achieved by parole supervision because of the effect of the offender’s mental condition and further deterioration while in custody. 
     
      
    21 However, although it is impossible to know the rate of his decline, the longer he is in gaol the less able will he be to cope with the world, to care for himself or to have any worthwhile life in the community. It seems to me that deterioration will probably be more accelerated in a prison environment notwithstanding the efforts of Dr Reutens and her nurse to treat and assist him. I believe that there are special circumstances in this situation so that he may obtain what benefit there is in his being released earlier than later during his sentence. As I have already indicated, there is less need for the minimum period of custody to reflect denunciation and general deterrence than would normally be the case for an offence of this nature. 
     
      
    22 Those that mourn the loss of the deceased in this matter should understand that this is a very unusual case and the sentence that will be imposed on the offender cannot in any way reflect the loss of that life to them. It is of little comfort to them and I would understand that they would think that the sentence imposed does not compensate for the loss of that life generally and the loss of the deceased to them. They must try to understand that sentencing is a difficult task when it is so serious as involving the taking of a human life. It is not simply a case of attempting to value the loss of the deceased’s life and to punish the offender accordingly as if this were a civil proceeding. This is a matter of some complexity, not only because this is an offence of manslaughter, but also because of the unusual situation of the offender, his mental difficulties and the prognosis he has for the remainder of his life which has been diminished by his mental disorder. This is a very peculiar sentence imposed in circumstances of a very unusual case. 
     
      
    23 Madam Crown, I have tried to stress in my reasons that the sentence is a very unusual one for manslaughter in these circumstances. I was much assisted by both your stance and counsel for the accused during the course of the hearing in what was a difficult sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    24 The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years 4 months. The sentence is to commence on 11 February 2008 and the non-parole period expires on 10 August 2010.

      JUDGMENT ON APPLICATION TO AMEND INDICTMENT 
      
     
     
     Introduction 
    1 In this matter the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has commenced proceedings against the Accused, John Eric Cargnello, for offences related to child pornography.2 The Crown now seeks leave pursuant to s 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to amend the indictment by adding further counts. The Accused opposes the application.3 The orders sought are set forth in a Notice of Motion filed on 23 March 2009. They are,  
     
      
      1. If required, leave be granted to amend the indictment in this matter pursuant to section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, 
       
        
         
        
       
      2. Any other orders that the Court considers appropriate. 
      
    4 An affidavit in support of the application sworn by Melissa Catsanos on 23 March 2009 was also filed.5 In light of the arguments advanced opposing the application it will be necessary to refer to the history of the investigation and the resultant prosecution. 
     
     The Development of the Prosecution’s Case 
    6 The Crown alleges that the Accused entered Australia by way of Sydney International Airport on 31 August 2006, carrying a lap top computer and a portable video player/recorder. Customs officers seized these items for examination.7 On 5 September 2006 the Accused attended Customs House at the Sydney International Airport and was charged with an offence contrary to s 233BAB(5) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). This initial charge alleged the intentional importation of prohibited Tier 2 goods, namely, child pornography, in the form of digital images, video recordings, written text, and digital images attached to email, all of which were stored on the lap top computer.8 The investigation undertaken included the submission of the lap top computer and the video player/recorder to Mr Colin Bulloch, described as a Customs forensic expert. He examined and interrogated these items.9 In the Crown submissions in support of this application it is said at paragraph [30] that in the initial report from Mr Bulloch on 18 December 2008 there was reference to a document named “Badgirls.doc” and the file path to its location on the hard disc of the video player/recorder, discovered on 1 September 2006. The date attributed to the report cannot be correct. From the history of this matter it would seem that the correct date was 18 December 2006. I do not have the report in the material tendered on the application from which to confirm this, but I cannot envisage how the first report by Mr Bulloch would have been written so late as December 2008.10 The initial report from Mr Bulloch did not enlarge upon the content of the document so named in the video player/recorder, or make any reference to child pornography or child abuse material stored on that device. There is reference to “objectionable material” on both devices in the statement of Customs Officer Jerez dated 19 October 2006. This notwithstanding, there was no charge preferred in respect of the material on the video player/recorder. I do not have a copy of the statement of that officer, and do not know whether the material so described was there further particularised.11 The initial report of Mr Bulloch on 18 December 2006 included as Annexure F, 4 emails, dated 1, 5, 7 and 8 March 2000 respectively, upon which the Crown would rely to prove counts 8 through 11 in the indictment proposed in the present application. It is said that they were discussed in that report.12 The Accused defended the charge, and on 30 and 31 August 2007 in committal proceedings Mr Bulloch faced cross-examination. The Accused was committed for trial on 26 November 2007. On 28 November 2007 he pleaded guilty upon arraignment, and the proceedings were adjourned for sentence. He was at this time represented by other counsel and solicitors.13 On 18 April 2008 after arranging for other representation the Accused sought to withdraw his plea of guilty. Judge Hulme granted the application and the trial was appointed to 3 November 2008. I do not have the record of the application, but in the submissions of Senior Counsel for the Crown to her Honour Judge Sweeney, in the first application to amend, he noted that the basis of the application was that the Accused was not aware of the images or text discovered on the computer.14 The Crown filed a Notice of Motion to vacate the trial from that date because of the unavailability of Mr Bulloch. On 10 October 2008 the trial was vacated from the appointed date and set down for hearing on 23 February 2009.15 The Crown also gave notice of its intention to file a fresh indictment containing four counts in place of the single count upon which the Accused was committed trial. The four proposed counts were to be in respect of the same subject matter, but each count would be confined to the form in which the child pornography was found on the lap top computer. Thus, the first count would relate to still digital images, the second would relate to video recordings, the third to written text, and the fourth to emails with still digital images attached to them. The application to amend was appointed to 12 November 2008. Judge Sweeney granted the application. Mr Game of Senior Counsel represented the Crown on the application, with Mr Johnstone as his junior. Both counsel have been in the matter since before the committal hearing. Mr Bellanto of Queen’s Counsel with Mr Thangaraj appeared for the Accused. Mr Game and Mr Thangaraj argued the application before me.16 In the course of the argument before Judge Sweeney counsel for both parties referred to the forensic expert retained to re-visit the work of Mr Bulloch, who was unlikely to be available to give evidence. The expert retained to replace Mr Bulloch is Mr Adam Daniel from a leading firm of accountants.17 There are a series of reports from Mr Daniel. I have been provided with copies of reports of December 2008 and 14 January 2009, a file note of 20 February 2009 referring to those reports, and two further reports named respectively as a “Supplementary Technical Report Microsoft Outlook” and “Supplementary Technical Report Download Accelerator Plus” both bearing the date 25 February 2008. It would appear that this is an error, and that the date in each case should have been 25 February 2009. Lastly there is a report named “Supplementary Technical Report S317X03A” of March 2009. It is apparent that the investigation by Mr Daniel was in the nature of a work in progress that extended from the interrogation of the devices leading to his first report of December 2008, through to the most recent in March 2009.18 On 25 November 2008 a Notice of Appeal from her Honour’s judgement was lodged, but this was not pursued. The appeal was to be heard on 17 February 2009 in the Court of Criminal Appeal, but according to the Crown it was abandoned. Before me the Crown pointed to this as an indication that the Accused abandoned his challenge to the first amendment, but Mr Thangaraj refuted this suggestion, explaining that the Accused had not changed his position but chose to defer the challenge to her Honour’s decision after the Crown gave notice of its intention to pursue the present application, to avoid waste of time and expense if there were a need to appeal from the decision required on this occasion.19 In his report on 12 December 2008 Mr Daniel confirmed the child pornography previously found in the laptop computer, and in addition identified child pornography contained in the portable video player/recorder. As I understand matters, this is when the material was first described with any measure of detail, although, as I noted earlier there was reference to “objectionable material” discovered in the initial stages of the investigation. A copy of this first report from Mr Daniel was served on the Accused’s representatives that day. This material was not contemplated in the application argued before Judge Sweeney.20 This report includes Appendix C wherein the internet history of the sites visited by the Accused appears. Although incomplete, it is said to provide a significant history of internet use between 1 March 2005 and 20 August 2006, the period covered by the proposed count 12.21 There are errors in paragraphs [32] and [62] of the Crown submissions where reference is made to the report of Mr Daniel of 12 December 2009, six months from the present. Clearly this should be read as 12 December 2008.22 On the 14 January 2009 Mr Daniel provided his further report with information regarding additional material on the laptop computer. This report was served on the Accused’s representatives that day. This material, described as child abuse material, was unknown before this and was not contemplated in the application argued before Judge Sweeney. Although the Crown adopted the description child abuse for this material, it said that it includes both child abuse and child pornography, both of which constitute Tier 2 goods the importation of which is proscribed.23 On 30 January 2009 the Director wrote to the Accused’s representatives with a copy of a proposed indictment incorporating a further three counts; all seven counts refer to the child pornography alleged to have been found on the laptop computer and the video player/recorder. Before the Crown pursued an application to further amend the indictment with the inclusion of these three additional offences, Mr Daniel provided the two further reports of 25 February 2009 in which he discussed the applications “Outlook Express” and the “Download Accelerator” found on the computer and their use to access child pornography. The discussion includes reference to the emails upon which the Crown would rely for counts 8 through 11.24 Before this, Mr Daniel was unable to open all of the email accounts using the “Microsoft Outlook” program. They were stored with password protection. The Crown wrote to the Accused’s representatives and asked for the password but it was not forthcoming, however Mr Daniel in the interim developed an algorithm to access the protected account and the emails. He could then view the file structure of the email account as the user would have viewed it and access the file “jcpersonal”. The sent items in that file, when sorted by date order, revealed emails sent in the name of the Accused and in the name “John Cutter”, and revealed the setting up by the Accused of email accounts in that other name.25 The “Supplementary Technical Report Download Accelerator Plus” of 25 February 2009 is referred to in paragraph [63] of the submissions with reference to the date 27 February 2009. This appears to be an error. Relevant to the proposed count 12, it also includes a significant history of email sites visited including those that appear to involve child pornography, and reports that there are links between images of child pornography found to sites allegedly accessed by the Accused. Moreover, it is alleged that images and fragments of images recovered from unallocated space on the computer hard drive can be matched to the accessed sites.26 Copies of the additional reports were sent to the Accused’s representatives on 25 February 2009 it is said, although I note that in paragraphs [55] of the Crown submissions the date 27 February 2009 is specified as when the paginated and chronological copy of the email material was served.27 On 4 March 2009 a Notice of Motion to vacate the trial date was filed on behalf of the Accused to allow further preparation to respond to the additional material. This was granted and the trial is now to commence on 20 July 2009.28 On 20 March 2009 the Crown served the further supplementary report from Mr Daniel bearing March 2009. The information provided includes the file paths he discovered. The Crown also provided what is described as a forensic copy of the personal video player/recorder. According to the Crown the video player/recorder appears to have been used to back up data from the laptop computer, but the 30 digital images contemplated in the proposed count 6 are not identical with images on the computer, although there is said to be some overlap. The 524 text stories on the computer differ from the 465 on the video player/recorder. The Crown said at paragraph [69] of its written submissions that a forensic copy of the laptop computer was also provided but I have not been able to determine when that occurred.29 Upon the further discoveries by Mr Daniel and the spectre of offences they raised in addition to the original allegations of importation of child pornography that were until then the essence of the prosecution, the Crown contends that the indictment as presently constructed does not adequately address the entirety of the Accused’s criminality. By letter of 23 March 2009 the Crown notified the Accused’s representatives of its intention to seek leave to further amend the indictment. The letter enclosed a copy of the proposed indictment, particulars in support of the offences charged, and the notice of motion and affidavit in support. 
     
     The Proposed Indictment 
    30 The proposed indictment contains twelve counts.31 Counts 1 to 4 are in those that were allowed by Judge Sweeney, and allege offences said to be contrary to s 233BAB(7) of the Customs Act. I have reviewed the legislation and it appears that the correct provision is s 233BAB(5) of the Act.32 Count 1 relates to digital images depicting child pornography; Count 2 relates to videos depicting child pornography; Count 3 relates to text documents depicting child abuse; and Count 4 relates to emails with still digital image attachments depicting child pornography.33 Count 5 is an additional offence alleged as a result of Mr Daniel’s investigation of the laptop computer in the course of which he accessed the “Outlook Express” application revealing emails to which text stories depicting child abuse were attached. This offence is also said to be contrary to s 233BAB(7) of the Customs Act. I believe that the correct provision is s 233BAB(5) of the Act.34 Counts 6 and 7 are also offences said to be contrary to 233BAB(7) of the Customs Act alleged in respect of digital images depicting child pornography (count 6) and text documents depicting child abuse (count 7) found on the video player/recorder. Once again, I believe that the sub-section has been incorrectly identified, and it should be specified to be s 233BAB(5) of the Act.35 Counts 8 through 11 are for offences contrary to s 50DB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) alleging that on or about 1 March 2000, 5 March 2000, 7 March 2000, and 8 March 2000 respectively, the Accused as an Australian citizen sent email with the intention of encouraging an offence against Part 111A of the Crimes Act, namely, sexual intercourse with a child under 16 outside of Australia, the act of sending the email in each case being reasonably capable of encouraging that conduct. The Crown has provided a summary of the conduct it alleges, the essence of which is that the Accused, using the name John Cutter, participated in a series of email discussions concerning child sex tourism using a code to mask the age of the children the subject of the discussions. The code employed, described in an email dated 10 January 2000, involved the allocation of a number followed by a minus sign to denote the age as 5 years less than the number, or two minus signs to denote the age as 10 years less than the number. The emails were found in the folder named “jcpersonal” in the laptop computer. They included enquiries regarding locations that offer young girls in Asia, meeting up in Cambodia, the differences between children aged 12 years and children aged 15 years, the nature of the sexual activity available, and where the children may be found in specified cities. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive of the emails to which the Crown points in support of these charges in addition to the specific emails upon which it relies for the proposed counts respectively dated 1, 5, 7 and 8 March 2000.36 There is an incorrect reference to the date 8 March 2008 in paragraph [46] of the Crown submissions, that should be read as 8 March 2000.37 Count 12 is for an offence contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and alleges that between 1 March 2005 and 30 August 2006 the Accused used an internet service to access child pornography. 
     
     The Argument Before Judge Sweeney 
    38 It is of course not my task to second guess or review the decision of Judge Sweeney to allow the amendment sought in the application before her and I should not be thought to be doing so, but in light of what was presented in the present application it is appropriate that I refer to the submissions made to her Honour for they provide some indication of what one might infer to be the understanding of the Accused and his representatives regarding the devices that were the genesis of the investigation leading to his prosecution, and whether there is unfairness to the Accused should the present application be granted.39 Mr Game informed her Honour of what he said was intimated to the Chief Judge when the trial date of 3 November 2008 was vacated, namely, that Mr Bulloch was unavailable and was unlikely to be available to give evidence, that there was the prospect that the Crown would not to call him in any event unless required by the defence for cross examination, and that he undertook to qualify another expert in place of Mr Bulloch who would perform the analysis he had undertaken. He added that another expert was retained, not an employee of Australian Customs, and the Crown had undertaken to serve his report before 7 or 8 December 2008. This was later corrected to 12 December 2008.40 Mr Game added that there was no guarantee that the expert would produce the same findings as Mr Bulloch.41 The arguments advanced in support of the amendment covered the following points: 
     
      
      1. Properly construed the term “goods” used in s 233BAB(5) of the  
      C 
      ustoms Act 
       applied to the individual images and text items, and not to the device on which they were stored; 
       
       
      2. There is different criminality involved in respect of still images compared with transmitted or received email with still images, written text, and video recordings that might involve more serious misconduct toward the children depicted; 
       
       
      3. The Crown was entitled to bundle up in one charge images or text items of the same type, with a separate count for each category, to allow the Court the scope necessary to address at trial and on sentence the criminality involved in their importation; 
       
       
      4. One count embracing all of the items discovered would not allow the court the scope to properly deal with the totality of the criminality involved, but the four counts proposed would achieve appropriate balance, providing sufficient identification of the criminality involved in the individual counts without the risk of duplicity;  
       
       
      5. It was within the discretion in the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to select the offences upon which to indict an accused, and the court did not have the power to limit the Director in the exercise of that discretion, although it was recognised that the Court was obliged to ensure that the conduct of the trial was fair to the Accused; 
       
       
      6. The Crown could charge one offence for each individual item of child pornography, but was not bound to do so and should not do so where that course would not facilitate the due administration of justice or would risk oppression; 
       
       
      7. Upon the application to withdraw his plea of guilty it was said on behalf of the Accused that he did not know of the existence of child pornography; if the Crown anticipated correctly that this was to be the position taken at trial, there would be different forensic questions regarding the pathways by which the items were stored and accessed with the computer, depending upon the nature of the item; 
       
       
      8. Evidence of the Accused’s knowledge of the pornography would include the individual pathways to access the categories of child pornography, its storage in different places within the computer’s hard drive, and the times when individual items were created, stored, or accessed; 
       
       
      9. These aspects were the subject of extensive cross examination of Mr Bulloch at the committal hearing. 
      
    42 Senior counsel for the Accused dealt with the following points in his argument: 
     
      
      1. The nature of the documents from the newly retained forensic expert that might differ significantly from the product of Mr Bulloch’s work diminished the value of the cross examination of him at committal; 
       
       
      2. The distinctions drawn by the Crown between the groupings of the type of child pornography were not decisive; 
       
       
      3. Sections 233BAA and following in the  
      Customs Act 
       created offences of importation or exportation of the specified goods, whether as a single item or in multiples, and in either case there is but one offence, the importation or exportation of the proscribed goods; 
       
       
      4. The Crown was looking to facilitate proof of facts at trial and for sentencing by the creation of offences with no basis in law for doing so, with resultant unfairness and oppression; 
       
       
      5. The concerns ventured by the Crown to justify categorising the pornography with regard the pathways to store or access the pornography are apposite whether there is one count or multiple counts as proposed; 
       
       
      6. There is but one offence of importation; 
       
       
      7. It is improper to charge four counts, thereby exposing the Accused to a fourfold increase in penalty when in truth he is alleged to have committed but one offence. 
      
      
     The Present Application 
    43 In support of the inclusion of counts 5, 6 and 7 in the proposed indictment the Crown has repeated the submissions it made to Judge Sweeney, usefully summarised in terms that they avoid the issues of latent duplicity, ambiguity and uncertainty in respect of the jury’s verdict.44 The Crown adds that the images contemplated in the proposed count 6, and the text contemplated in the proposed count 7, all discovered on the video player/recorder, are in most instances different to those on the lap top computer. In the case of the images there is some overlap. The Crown submits that separate charges, including for the identical images appearing in both devices, will not cause unfairness when it comes to penalty, because assessment of the totality of the Accused’s criminality, whether expressed in one count or more, will ensure that if convicted he does not suffer punishment greater than required by the objective gravity of the offending. The Crown submits that the existence of identical images on both devices does not deny the Director discretion to charge separately in respect of this material, stored on separate devices.45 The Crown relies upon the opportunity given to the Accused to investigate the computer and the video player/recorder, forensic copies of which were provided with the particulars of the file paths to the offending material discovered by Mr Daniel.46 With regard to the proposed counts 8 through 11 the Crown outlined the nature and content of the emails upon which it relies, including the specific emails constituting each offence. It provides the relevant legislation and the limitations it imposes upon prosecutions, none of which are engaged here. The Crown has already served this evidence upon the Accused and his representatives. The 4 critical emails were the subject of Mr Bulloch’s report of 18 December 2006 and served as annexure F to that report. They were again discussed in the report of Mr Daniels of 25 February 2009. The emails were found in three locations, namely, the computer, the video recorder, and on discs found in the Accused’s former matrimonial home. The evidence supporting these counts will largely fall from Mr Daniel. It is said that this will not lengthen the trial significantly.47 The Crown submits that the inclusion of counts 8 through 11 will bring to account the criminal activity upon which the Accused is alleged to have engaged, and will meet the public interest in having this serious misconduct dealt with.48 Although the offences were committed in the year 2000, their discovery was not until after the seizure of the devices on 31 August 2006 and their interrogation thereafter by those with the skills to access their holdings, who will be called to give evidence regarding the findings upon which all counts in the indictment depend. It is appropriate therefore that the charges be presented in the one indictment. There would be nothing to prevent the Accused being presented on a separate indictment, if that was an appropriate course, but the same evidence, or at least a significant part of it, would then be required in two separate proceedings. There is no unfair prejudice it is said, in having the evidence called in the one trial embracing all of the offences with which the Accused is charged arising from the material extracted from these devices.49 Although the emails were served on the defence with the first Bulloch report of 18 December 2006, the commission of these offences and the charges upon which to bring them before the court were not property considered until the supplementary “Outlook Express” report of 25 February 2009. The Accused and his representatives have access to that material, and access to forensic copies of the devices provided to the forensic computer expert retained on behalf of the Accused.50 The notification to the Accused and his representatives of the proposed charges on 23 March 2009, with the trial listed for 20 July 2009, provided ample opportunity for the Accused to prepare to meet the Crown case.51 In respect of the proposed count 12 the Crown has provided the particulars of the relevant legislation, and the geographical jurisdiction is demonstrated. Once again the evidence in support of this charge will fall from Mr Daniel. For this reason, the submissions made in respect of counts 8 through 11 are apposite.52 In conclusion the Crown provides the following points in support of its application: 
     
      
      1. It is for the Director to select the charges upon which to proceed; 
       
       
      2. The holdings on the computer and the portable video player/recorder the significance of which the Crown is now aware from the ongoing work of Mr Daniel, provides the measure of the entire criminality upon which the Accused is alleged to have engaged; this was not known or understood in all of its detail at the time of the application before Judge Sweeney; 
       
       
      3. The indictment prepared after the successful application to Judge Sweeney fails to meet the criminality discovered, focused as it is upon the importation of the child pornography found on the computer without regard to the further criminality exposed, which the proposed indictment will properly address; 
       
       
      4. The proposed indictment is upon the material that has already been served by the Crown on the Accused and his representatives. The inclusion of the charges proposed and the evidence to support them will not significantly lengthen the trial; 
       
       
      5. The Accused and his representatives have had notice of the proposed charges since the 23 March 2009, and the material upon which they rest well before that. A forensic copy of the laptop computer and of the video player/recorder was provided for the forensic expert retained on behalf of the Accused; 
       
       
      6. There has been a committal hearing of some limited value, but there is no injustice in proceeding without a further committal hearing; Mr Daniel will be available for cross examination before his evidence is presented to the jury if that is desired, without objection from the Crown; 
       
       
      7. The proposed counts will provide the Court with the scope to deal with the totality of the criminality alleged; and 
       
       
      8. The amendments are not in the circumstances unfair or oppressive. 
      
    53 The Crown also ventured the proposition that it is by no means unusual for the Crown to develop its case, and change direction from time to time within acceptable limits, as evidence is developed and the misconduct the subject of the prosecution becomes clearer, such as in this matter. He referred to R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11 amongst other authority demonstrating the extent to which the Crown will be permitted to present its case differently to its first approach upon the discovery of additional material or a better appreciation of the significance of that which is already within its purview.54 The affidavit of the Accused’s solicitor, Mr Christopher Watson, was read. He was cross-examined. He rehearsed the history of the proceedings, including that other solicitors and counsel represented the Accused in the committal hearing, and the representation attributed to the Crown then that a “complete brief of evidence” was available and to be presented to the court. He referred to the additional material upon which the Crown would rely at trial, and the progressive service of it as the proceedings have continued to evolve. The history of the proceedings to the present application is described, consistent with what I have provided above. There is no need to repeat that here, but I do note that the description provided does highlight the challenges the Accused and his present representatives have faced in their preparation to meet the Crown case as the Crown’s documents have been served progressively over time.55 Mr Watson next refers to the letter received on 23 March 2009 informing him of the Crown’s intention to pursue the present application. He asserts that for the first time the Accused will be required to meet allegations of conduct alleged in respect of periods from 1 March 2000 to 8 March 2000 in the proposed counts 8 through 11, and from 7 March 2005 to 30 August 2006 in respect of the proposed count 12. He asserts the following difficulties: 
     
      
      1. The Accused, through his representatives, must now investigate the availability of evidence of access by others to the laptop computer and other equipment from which the items found on the laptop computer were sourced during the periods identified; 
       
       
      2. The expert retained on behalf of the Accused has not yet completed his work, which must be now more extensive if the proposed amendments are allowed; 
       
       
      3. Cross examination of Mr Daniel cannot take place until the expert reviewing his reports and assessing his investigations completes the task so that the Accused’s legal representatives are properly armed with the information required to properly test Mr Daniel’s evidence; 
       
       
      4. Business records of the company with which the Accused has been associated are destroyed after 7 years; the records for the year 2000 have already been destroyed. These include computer back up records, staff records, and other business records that are now not available to assist the Accused’s case in response to these additional charges; 
       
       
      5. The Accused is now denied entry to Canada and the United States of America since being charged in these proceedings; it is said that Mr Richter QC, who appeared upon the application to withdraw the plea of guilty, advised that travel to those countries is necessary for the preparation of the Accused’s case. As I understand this point, since the Accused cannot enter those countries to carry out investigations for evidence to support his case, the records of the company, if intact, would have enhanced significance. 
      
    56 Submissions on behalf of the Accused have once more addressed the separation of the importation allegations according to the form in which the material was found on the device and the more recent discovery of material in two different forms on the video player/recorder, charged in counts 1 through 7 in the proposed indictment.57 Once more the history of the investigation and the proceedings is outlined. There is no need to repeat it.58 Against that history it is said that for a number of reasons it is now unfair for the Crown to be permitted to proceed on these additional counts. Without wishing to do them injustice, I would summarise the submissions thus: 
     
      
      1. The Crown at first intended to proceed on a single count encompassing all of the alleged child pornography then known, and would have done so but for the need it had to make application to vacate the trial date because Mr Bulloch was ill and could not attend to give evidence. Thereafter, having given careful consideration to the matter, the Crown decided to proceed on four counts, separating the material the subject of the original charge according to the form in which it was found on the computer. Judge Sweeney allowed the amendment notwithstanding that there was no basis in law upon which the Crown ought to have charged four counts in lieu of the single count for the single offence of importation. It is said that it is not permissible to charge more than one offence for the piece of equipment upon which the material said to be child pornography or child abuse material was allegedly found; 
       
       
      2. The trial was set down for hearing on the four counts allowed by Judge Sweeney, but the Crown then served further material that required investigation on behalf of the Accused. The Crown consented to the trial date being vacated to allow the Accused time for further preparation. But for that, the trial would have proceeded on those four counts. Thereafter the Accused was given notice of an additional three counts, and thereafter the Accused was given notice of the indictment as presently proposed leading to the present application. For the Crown to have proceeded in this fashion and then be permitted to prosecute the Accused on this expanded indictment is unfair in itself; 
       
       
      3. The trial was appointed after the amendment was allowed, and the Chief Judge ordered that all material upon which the Crown intended to rely be served by 12 December 2008 so that the Accused would have sufficient time to prepare. With the further application to amend, adding eight counts to the four permitted by Judge Sweeney, there is now insufficient time to prepare to meet the Crown case; the trial date is 20 July 2009; 
       
       
      4. The fresh counts rely entirely upon material of which the Crown was aware in 2006; indeed the Crown asserts that the Accused is not prejudiced, for he has had access to the material for a long time. The same counsel have appeared for the Crown throughout; 
       
       
      5. There is no adequate explanation for the delay in charging the further offences. The explanation offered by the Crown on this application does not provide justification; 
       
       
      6. The fresh charges have not been the subject of a committal hearing at which the Accused would have been entitled to seek the opportunity to cross examine relevant witnesses, and ask the magistrate to consider discharging the Accused at that point in the proceedings; 
       
       
      7. The further charges will extend to unacceptable lengths the trial and the preparation required for the trial; and 
       
       
      8. With regard to counts 8 through 11: 
       
       
       
        
        a. there is a distinctly different time frame, in which offences of an entirely different nature are alleged; and 
         
         
        b. Exculpatory evidence is no longer available leaving incurable prejudice to the accused. 
        
       
      
    59 Submissions were also made in terms challenging the way in which the Crown now proposed to present its case in respect of the third count and fifth count, relying upon the material as child abuse material. The Crown informed me that the material contemplated by these charges could bear either description, but it has chosen to adopt the term “child abuse material” as more appropriate. It is said that the Crown had taken another view in respect of the third count when before Judge Sweeney, but even so, I do not see this as a reason not to grant the application before me.60 The submissions also sought to re-visit the arguments before Judge Sweeney challenging the application for the inclusion of counts 5 through 7. Indeed the submissions include an assertion putting the Crown on notice that it should consider its position regarding the first four counts allowed by Judge Sweeney, for the Accused intends to appeal any conviction upon counts 1 through 5 upon the grounds that there should have been but one charge for the lap top computer, and if allowed, one further charge for the video player/recorder, and for the reasons advanced more generally, that there should not be any further charges permitted at all.61 As indicated earlier, the counts 5 through 7 relate to additional material found on the computer, and images and text found on the video player/recorder.62 I noted earlier that it is not my task to review the decision of Judge Sweeney in this application. However, I am required to consider the arguments in the context of the application made in respect of counts 5 through 7. In addition to the argument that there is inherent unfairness in the Crown wishing to do so, it is submitted that upon the proper construction of the legislation creating the offence charged in these counts there can be but one charge of importation of child pornography for each of the devices upon which it was allegedly found. My attention is taken to the provisions creating the offence.63 Section 233BAB of the Customs Act provides relevantly, 
     
      
      (1) The regulations may provide that: 
       
        
        (h) items of child pornography or of child abuse material; 
        
       
      constitute tier 2 goods. 
       
      (2) The regulations must not specify an item for the purposes of subsection (1) unless: 
       
        
        (a) its importation is prohibited, either absolutely or on condition, by the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations; or 
         
        (b) its exportation is prohibited, either absolutely or on condition, by the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. 
        
       
      (3) For the purposes of subsection (1) an item is taken to be an item of child pornography if it is a document or other goods: 
       
        
        (a) that depicts a person, or a representation of a person, who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age and who: 
         
          
          (i) is engaged in, or appears to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons); or 
           
          (ii) is in the presence of a person who is engaged in, or appears to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity; 
          
         
        and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or 
         
        (b) the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of: 
         
          
          (i) a sexual organ or the anal region of a person who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; or 
           
          (ii) a representation of such a sexual organ or anal region; or 
           
          (iii) the breasts, or a representation of the breasts, of a female person who is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; 
          
         
        in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or 
         
        (c) that describes a person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age and who: 
         
          
          (i) is engaged in, or is implied to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or not in the presence of other persons); or 
           
          (ii) is in the presence of a person who is engaged in, or is implied to be engaged in, a sexual pose or sexual activity; 
          
         
        and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or 
         
        (d) that describes: 
         
          
          (i) a sexual organ or the anal region of a person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age; or 
           
          (ii) the breasts of a female person who is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age; 
          
         
        and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive 
        
       
      (4) For the purposes of subsection (1), an item is taken to be an item of child abuse material if it is a 
        
      document or other goods: 
       
        
        (a) that depicts a person, or a representation of a person, who: 
         
          
          (i) is, or appears to be, under 18 years of age; and 
           
          (ii) is, or appears to be, a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse; 
          
         
        and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive; or 
         
        (b) that describes a person who: 
         
          
          (i) is, or is implied to be, under 18 years of age; and 
           
          (ii) is, or is implied to be, a victim of torture, cruelty or physical abuse; 
          
         
        and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive. 
        
       
      (4A)… 
       
      (5) A person is guilty of an offence against this subsection if: 
       
        
        (a) the person intentionally imported goods; and 
         
        (b) the goods were tier 2 goods and the person was reckless as to that fact; and 
         
        (c) their importation: 
         
          
          (i) was prohibited under this Act absolutely; or 
           
          (ii) was prohibited under this Act unless the approval of a particular person had been obtained and, at the time of the importation, that approval had not been obtained. 
          
         
        
       
      Maximum penalty: A fine not exceeding 2,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years, or both. 
      
    64 Section 4 provides, 
     
      
      (1) In this Act except where otherwise clearly intended: 
       
      documents 
       include: 
       
        
        (a) any paper or other material on which there is writing; and 
         
        (b) any paper or other material on which there are marks, figures, symbols or perforations having a meaning for persons qualified to interpret them; and 
         
        (c) any paper or other material on which a photographic image or any other image is recorded; and 
         
        (d) any article or material from which sounds, images or writing is capable of being produced with or without the aid of a computer or of some other device. 
        
       
      goods 
       means movable personal property of any kind and, without limiting the generality of the expression, includes documents, vessels and aircraft. 
      
    65 The definition of the term “documents” is inclusive. Thus, it is said that the Crown sought to rely upon the meaning attributed to the term in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) wherein s 25 provides, 
     
      
      In any Act, unless the contrary intention appears: 
       
      document 
       includes: 
       
      (a) any paper or other material on which there is writing; 
       
      (b) any paper or other material on which there are marks, figures, symbols or perforations having a meaning for persons qualified to interpret them; and 
       
      (c) any article or material from which sounds, images or writings are capable of being reproduced with or without the aid of any other article or device. 
      
    66 This provision replicates all but paragraph (c) in the definition from the Customs Act. The submission that the definition is therefore wider does not appear to be justified.67 The submissions then continue that the terms “article or material” appearing in paragraph (d) of the definition of the word “documents” must be interpreted to mean tangible items, such as the hard drives of the devices upon which the material was said to be found. The submissions challenge the Crown’s contention that the individual items of child pornography or child abuse revealed upon the interrogation of the devices were in each case an item of Tier 2 goods that could found a prosecution. 68 I have not been provided with authority in which the interpretation of the legislation has been discussed. 
     
     The Decision 
    69 I do not agree with the submission that the provisions should be construed so as to confine the Crown to one count of importation for each device upon which the offending material was found.70 The Customs Act provides for the offence of importation of Tier 2 goods. It also provides for the specification in the regulations of items of child pornography or child abuse material as Tier 2 goods: s 233BAB(1). An item of child pornography or child abuse material must not be so specified unless the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations or the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations prohibit its importation or exportation either absolutely or on condition: s 233BAB(2). Prohibited is the importation of child pornography or child abuse material as Tier 2 goods: s 233BAB(5), whether set down on paper or in an electronic medium.71 “An item is to be taken to be an item of …” child pornography or child abuse material if it is a “document” or “other goods” depicting a person or representation of a person apparently under the age of 18 years in specified circumstances: s 233BAB(3) & (4). The terms “goods” and “document” are defined. “Goods” include “documents”, and “document” in turn includes any article or material from which sounds, images or writing is capable of being produced with or without the aid of a computer or some other device.72 The phrase, “An item is taken to be an item of …” used in s 233BAB(3) and (4) facilitates the proof of the offence in two respects.73 First, those provisions specify what child pornography and child abuse material is to be taken to be. Items with such characteristics may be specified to constitute Tier 2 goods.74 Secondly, of themselves a document or goods are not child pornography or child abuse material, but are to be taken to be so if they depict by sound, image, or in writing, child pornography or child abuse material. It is the depiction that is the gravamen of the offence. In an electronic device, such as a computer or a video player/recorder, the depictions are not readily available. The device must be activated, and the pathways to raise the depiction must be engaged to allow the depictions to be perceived.75 I do not overlook that this is a criminal statute to be strictly construed, but with this in mind, in my opinion the legislation should not be read so as to confine the offence to the importation of the device upon which the offending material is depicted. To adopt the narrower approach is to ignore the terms of the definition given to “document” and its reference to sounds, images, or writing.76 It is each depiction of child pornography or child abuse material, whether by sound, image, or writing, together with the device from which it is capable of being produced that is the item of child pornography or child abuse material. If there is more than one depiction, then each is an item of child pornography notwithstanding that it is capable of being produced from the same device. In my opinion these provisions must be read in this way.77 I am therefore not persuaded that the Crown should for the reasons advanced confine itself to one count of importation for each device.78 As to the argument that there is but one offence of importation, regardless of the manner in which the material is stored on the devices, or the differences in their presentation on the devices and methods to be employed to access them, I have revisited the discussion of the doctrine of duplicity in the selection of charges by the Chief Justice in R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53.79 In the particular circumstances of this case, where there are groups of material identified by their form, and the means of access to them, and in light of the anticipated defence position that the Accused was unaware of the material on the devices, I believe there is merit in the Crown taking the course that it has. To do otherwise would make enormously difficult the task required of the trial judge, in accordance with the principles in decisions such as R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, were there to be returned a verdict of guilty upon one global charge of importation for each device.80 I agree with the Crown submission that it is appropriate to divide the charges in the manner proposed. Although the Accused bears the risk of facing multiple verdicts of guilty for the single importation of the entirety of the material discovered, the principle of totality would require that any sentences imposed be structured to reflect the true measure of the criminality involved, regardless of the number of charges.81 In the application before me the submissions delivered orally focused primarily upon the suggested unfairness in allowing the Crown to expand the indictment as proposed. I do not agree that it is unfair to allow the Crown to amend the indictment. Of course it would have been desirable for the prosecution case to be identified precisely and definitively at the committal hearing, but that is not always possible, and in this case there is a clear explanation for the inability for the Crown to be in that position before it settled upon the indictment now proposed. The commission of the offence allegedly involved use of a computer and a video player/recorder that required interrogation by an expert qualified to do so. The expert first retained fell ill and was not available to give evidence. Another was retained, and in the course of his investigation he identified with greater precision and breadth the material in the devices, with the result that the Crown gained a better understanding of the scope of the criminality indicated by the material recovered. It is apparent that as material was uncovered, and its significance realised, the Accused and his representatives were provided with the product of the investigation, and kept informed of the course proposed by the Crown.82 Access to email accounts was made more difficult, requiring the development of an algorithm with which to bypass the password protection that the Accused or his representatives did not provide when requested. I do not mean to imply that the Accused was obliged to do so, or that he should suffer some penalty for not surrendering the rights he has to put the Crown to proof and require them to provide the evidence. However, it does not follow that the decision taken not to provide that information, if it was available to the Accused, should be added to the factors supporting the argument that the Crown has acted unfairly.83 It is said that there is difficulty for the Accused because he does not now have access to company records to which he might turn in support of his defence, which is of greater significance since he cannot return to the United States of America or Canada to make inquiries directly. However there is no material before me to show what evidence has been lost relevant to the defence case or disruptive to the Crown case, other than in the most general terms, or material to show with any precision how and to what extent the Accused will be disadvantaged thereby. I am not persuaded that actual disadvantage has been demonstrated.84 Even if one were to deny this application, there would be no impediment to the Crown bringing a prosecution for the additional offences charged in counts 8 through 12 in the proposed indictment in further proceedings. This would involve a good deal of inefficiency, with much of the evidence in the first trial to be produced in the second proceedings if they were to be pursued.85 I do not agree that the lost opportunity for a committal hearing upon the additional charges would cause the Accused such prejudice that application should be denied. The Crown will consent to a “Basha” hearing, to allow cross-examination of witnesses before they are presented to the jury.86 Section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides 
     
      
      20 Amendment of indictment 
       
      (1) An indictment may not be amended after it is presented, except by the prosecutor: 
       
        
        (a) with the leave of the court, or 
         
        (b) with the consent of the accused. 
        
       
      (2) This section does not affect the powers of the court under section 21. 
       
      (3) For the purposes of this section, an amendment of an indictment includes the substitution of an indictment. 
      
    87 Section 21 is not relevant to the present application, although in light of the arguments developed it is possible that an application relying upon that provision might be pursued before the trial judge. I express no opinion either way.88 For these reasons I shall grant leave to the Crown to amend the indictment as proposed. 
     
     The Orders 
    89 Pursuant to section 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act the Crown is granted leave to amend the indictment in this matter to included the offences charged in Counts 1 though 12 as proposed in the form of Indictment presented upon this application.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 LATHAM J : The applicant, Benjamin Biermann, seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by GD Woods QC DCJ (the Judge) on 2 May 2008. The application for leave to appeal is out of time. The Crown does not oppose the grant of leave in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    3 The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to five counts of supply a prohibited drug pursuant to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Four of those offences carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment, while the remaining offence, constituted by the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of MDMA, carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and attracted a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment. Three further offences, namely goods in custody, possess prohibited drug and supply prohibited drug, were taken into account on a Form One when the applicant came to be sentenced for the most serious of the five offences. 
     
      
    4 On each of three supply prohibited drug charges (methylamphetamine, ketamine and crystalline methylamphetamine), carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years, the applicant received a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years. A non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of one year was imposed in respect of the fourth supply prohibited drug (cocaine) charge. A sentence of 5 years, comprising a non-parole period of one year with a balance of term of 4 years, was imposed on the supply commercial quantity offence. The quantity the subject of that charge was 35 grams above the commercial quantity threshold. A measure of accumulation resulted in an aggregate sentence of 9 years, comprising a non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of term of 4 years. 
     
      
    5 The applicant contends that the sentences imposed in respect of the individual counts and the aggregate sentence are manifestly excessive, that the Judge's discretion in accumulating the sentences miscarried, and that the Judge erred in failing to sufficiently reflect a finding of special circumstances in the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    6 It should be observed at the outset that the Judge made certain findings in relation to the objective gravity of the offences as a whole, but at no stage did the Judge attempt to place the supply commercial quantity offence in the range indicated by the maximum penalty, so that a non-parole period bearing some relationship to the standard non-parole period might be identified. There is some difficulty with the contention that the sentence imposed in respect of the supply commercial quantity offence is manifestly excessive, given that notwithstanding the existence of a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment, and the offences on the Form One, the Judge imposed a non-parole period of one year. It is therefore necessary to revisit the circumstances of the offending in some detail in order to ascertain where that offence fell, relative to the midrange of objective gravity. 
     
      
       
      The Agreed Facts 
       
      
    7 On 8 June 2007 police executed a search warrant on the applicant’s unit at Surry Hills. As they were about to enter the premises, the applicant opened the front door, whereupon the police identified themselves. The applicant started to struggle and kick at the police. He was handcuffed and the police commenced a search of the premises. 
     
      
    8 Police found a large quantity of prohibited drugs in open view throughout the living area of the unit. The applicant was immediately placed under arrest and cautioned. The applicant was taken to Surry Hills police station and entered into custody. He informed the police that he wished to be present during the remainder of the search. About 9:30 p.m. police returned to the unit with the applicant and recommenced the search.  
     
      
    9 A further quantity of numerous prohibited drugs were found in the course of that search. They were :- 
     
      
      (i) 44.46 g of cocaine, contained within 26 small plastic bags and 5 larger plastic bags. 
       
      (ii) 19.02 g of methylamphetamine located within 8 small plastic resealable bags and 3 large plastic bags (the latter stored within a safe). 
       
      (iii) 155.47 g of ketamine within 46 plastic bags and two larger plastic bags, all contained within a safe. 
       
      (iv) 160 g of MDMA (ecstasy), consisting of approximately 142 tablets within 4 plastic bags and a further quantity of tablets in 4 larger plastic bags stored within a safe. 
       
      (v) 55.76 g of N, N-dimethylamphetamine within 11 resealable plastic bags 
       
      (vi) 13.9 g of N, N-dimethylamphetamine and methylamphetamine in a resealbale plastic bag. (Form One offence) 
      
     
     
      
    10 In all, there were three safes in the unit, together with a total of $6,650 in cash. That money is the subject of the goods in custody charge on the Form One. A large plastic bag containing 19 g of cannabis was also found. That is the subject of the possess prohibited drug charge on the Form One. 
     
      
    11 There were other indicia of the packaging and supply of prohibited drugs, namely plastic resealable bags of varying sizes bearing descriptions of different drugs, and numerous large syringes with measurement markings. Police also found two sets of scales, a calculator, and a number of handwritten documents listing names, amounts and terminology consistent with the prohibited drugs found in the premises. During the search, a mobile phone belonging to the applicant rang a number of times. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Case 
       
      
    12 The applicant was 26 years of age at the time of sentence. He was brought up in a conventional and loving family environment in western Sydney, obtained his HSC and completed a Diploma in Superannuation and Financial Services before obtaining employment with a superannuation fund. He remained in that employment for 7 years, resigning two weeks before his arrest. He left the family home in 2006 following an argument with his parents concerning his drug use. The applicant described a period during his adolescence when he struggled with the realisation that he was homosexual. 
     
      
    13 In 2006, the applicant’s drug use escalated to the point where he was spending $250 daily on methamphetamines. The applicant had also embarked upon an episode of heavy expenditure on luxury items and travel, necessitating a loan of $120,000 which was guaranteed by his parents. It was in these circumstances that the applicant undertook the supply of drugs to the gay community from his rented accommodation. Thus, he was utilising the proceeds of sale of various drugs towards his living expenses, the cost of his own drug use and repayments under the loan arrangement. 
     
      
    14 A large volume of testimonials and other reference materials attested to the applicant’s prior good character. The applicant expressed his remorse through a letter to the court. There were also positive reports of his progress since his arrest, including his attendance at drug counselling sessions and his employment within the prison system. In short, a compelling subjective case was mounted on the applicant’s behalf. 
     
      
       
      The Objective Gravity of the Offences 
       
      
    15 The operation was clearly a commercial one and was acknowledged as such by the applicant’s legal representative on sentence. His Honour said :- 
     
      
       
        
        It is quite plain that the offender was dealing in drugs. The scale was clearly extensive, in that there were multiple contacts that he had. It is obvious that he was above the level of a street vendor. He does not appear to have been a major importer or otherwise at the top of the drug supply pyramid. The quantities found in the premises were in the scale of these sorts of cases, moderate. There are many cases regrettably, where quantities in the amounts of kilograms are found. This is not such a case. Nonetheless, it is a very serious case of drug dealing because plainly, he was selling to a lot of people, doing a lot of damage to a lot of people and it was repetitive and commercial. 
        
       
      
    16 This passage in the remarks on sentence represents the Judge's assessment of the objective gravity of the offences as a whole. The Judge then dealt with the applicant’s subjective features. It is not contended that the Judge omitted to take account of any relevant subjective factor or that the Judge took into account an irrelevant consideration. His Honour went on to indicate the penalty he would have imposed on individual counts, after application of the discount for the pleas of guilty. Shortly thereafter, the Judge pronounced sentence.  
     
      
    17 As I have already observed, there was no attempt made to place the individual offences at a point along the continuum of objective gravity, and then to take account of the subjective circumstances so that the sentences ultimately imposed reflected a reasonably transparent synthesis of all the relevant factors. However, in the light of the comments reproduced at [15] and given the applicant’s strong subjective case, it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that the individual sentences indicate that the Judge placed each of the offences below the mid range of objective gravity signalled by the maximum penalty in each case, although just how far below the mid range is a matter of speculation. In my view, the offences were not significantly below the mid range of objective gravity.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Submissions 
       
      
    18 The gravamen of the applicant's complaint in respect of the individual sentences imposed is that they each appear inconsistent with other sentences imposed for like offences involving greater quantities of the relevant prohibited drug. The applicant relies upon an observation by Blanch J in Mitchell v R [2008] NSWCCA 192 at [12], namely that this Court should strive to achieve some consistency in sentencing, notwithstanding that it is not an exact science. Of the measures available to promote consistency, Blanch J referred to the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission and to the practice of referring to sentences imposed for like offences in other cases. 
     
      
    19 In particular, the applicant complains that the Judge failed to refer to two decisions, namely R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34 and R v Hejazi [2003] NSWCCA 383 in the course of his remarks on sentence, where those decisions featured in the course of submissions. As I understand the applicant’s submissions, some comfort is sought to be obtained from the fact that aggregate sentences in the order of 11 years and 9 years, with non parole periods of 7 and 6 years respectively, were imposed for offences involving much greater quantities of various drugs than the applicant’s case. The failure by the Judge to specifically refer to these cases is said to disclose error in his approach to the individual and aggregate sentences.  
     
      
    20 In much the same vein, the applicant referred this Court to a number of decisions relating to supply cocaine and supply amphetamine offences in order to demonstrate that the applicant’s sentences are outside the appropriate range. It is submitted that this conclusion is reinforced when consideration is given to the failure of the Judge to expressly find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation, that the applicant was addicted to drugs, that he was under emotional stress at the time of the offences and that there had been delay in sentencing. 
     
      
    21 The applicant acknowledges that the accumulation of sentences is an exercise of discretion, subject to the principle of totality and to the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice : R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34. It is nonetheless submitted that the Judge failed to take account of the fact that the offences were part of “a singular enterprise”, by which I take the applicant to mean that the offences arose out of his arrest on 8 June 2007 for the possession of the various drugs for the purposes of supply.  
     
      
    22 Lastly, it is submitted that, although a finding of special circumstances was made, the proportion between the aggregate non parole period and the aggregate sentence did not sufficiently reflect the applicant’s need for supervised release into the community in order to further his rehabilitation prospects.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of the Appeal 
       
      
    23 There is no substance to the contention that the individual sentences or the aggregate sentence are manifestly excessive. The applicant’s reliance on MacDonnell and Hejazi are misplaced, in so far as both decisions related to sentences imposed before the enactment of a standard non parole period for the supply commercial quantity offence, a factor which this Court has held will result in an upward adjustment to sentences for such offences. MacDonnell was a Crown appeal and Hejazi concerned an argument as to disparity with a co-offender, so that very little, if any, assistance can be gained from either case. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that the Judge did not include any reference to them in the remarks on sentence.  
     
      
    24 Of the four decisions of this Court relating to supply cocaine offences cited in the applicant’s written submissions, one (R v Jordan [2002] NSWCCA 228) may be put to one side on the basis that it concerned an argument as to the accumulation of sentences for two offences, one of which was the ongoing supply of cocaine and the other, supply cocaine. No argument was advanced on that appeal that a sentence of 3 years for the supply of 62gms of cocaine, in the sense of possession for supply, was excessive. R v Harmouche 158 A Crim R 357 ; [2005] NSWCCA 398 was a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence imposed for the supply of 200gms of cocaine where the sentence of 2 years and 4 months imposed by the Court was appreciably less than it should have been. R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 was also a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence of 6 years 6 months for an offence of supply commercial quantity of cocaine (just under 1kg), where Howie J (Studdert and Whealy JJ agreeing) remarked that the least sentence the Judge could have imposed at first instance was a sentence of 9 years with a non parole period of 5 years 6 months. Stevens v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 252 related to an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of cocaine (just under 2 kgs). This Court did not regard a sentence of 11 years with a non parole period of 7 years as manifestly excessive. All of these decisions have little relevance to the applicant’s case. 
     
      
    25 In relation to sentences for supply methylamphetamine, the decisions of R v Franklin NSWCCA 11 April 1997 and R v Thompson & Falconer [1999] NSWCCA 50 were a bench of two Judges and contain no matter of principle. In the former, a sentence of 4 years imprisonment was considered unexceptional for the supply of 134gms of amphetamine. In the latter, the Court was concerned with charges relating to the manufacture of commercial quantities of methylamphetamine and tetrahydrocannabinol. R v Loh [2002] NSWCCA 23 was a successful Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentences imposed for four offences, including two offences of supply commercial quantity that pre-dated the introduction of the relevant standard non parole period. R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135 was also a successful Crown appeal against an inadequate sentence of 4 years, comprising a non parole period of 2 years, for an offence of supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (just under 1 kg). R v Emanuel [2004] NSWCCA 267 was a successful Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence imposed for an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of the drug. R v Attard [2004] NSWCCA 376 was a severity appeal in relation to an offence of supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine which pre-dated the introduction of the standard non parole period. None of these decisions allow any meaningful comparison to be drawn with the applicant’s offences. 26 Of some passing relevance is the decision of Hutton v R [2008] NSWCCA 99, although it does not assist the applicant. In Hutton, the applicant had supplied 478 gms of MDMA, just below the large commercial quantity threshold. His role was that of a “bald courier” and he received a sentence of 6 years with a 3 year non parole period after a plea of guilty. Given the applicant’s central involvement in a commercial enterprise, Hutton would seem to suggest that the applicant’s sentence on the equivalent offence is well within the appropriate range. 
     
      
    27 R v Stankovic [2006] NSWCCA 229, another successful Crown appeal, concerned a sentence for the supply of a large commercial quantity of MDMA and does not therefore provide any basis for comparison. Similarly, R v Sciberras (2006) 165 A Crim R 532 ; [2006] NSWCCA 268 was a successful Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentences imposed for various offences, including two of supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The Court held that sentences of 6 years and 6 months, comprising non parole periods of 4 years were manifestly inadequate on these counts, particularly where the offences could not be said to be below the mid range of objective gravity. Hulme J observed in passing at [44], with the concurrence of Beazley JA and Hislop J, that penalties are not proportionate to the quantities of drug supplied. 
     
      
    28 True it is that there is nothing in the Judge’s remarks that refers to the applicant’s good prospects of rehabilitation, although the Judge spent a considerable portion of the remarks addressing the applicant’s “psychological anguish and pain” as a factor in his offending. The Judge also referred extensively to the opinions expressed by the applicant’s family members and friends, to the effect that the applicant’s behaviour appeared to them to be inconsistent with the person they knew. The Judge accepted that the applicant was very remorseful and contrite. Implicit in these remarks and the finding of special circumstances is a recognition of the applicant’s good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    29 The fact that the applicant was addicted to drugs, and was under emotional stress at the time of the offences do not entitle him to any leniency. This Court observed in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 that the motivation of feeding addictions is entitled to, at most, limited weight. There was no relevant delay in sentencing. The applicant remained in custody from the date of his arrest, 8 June 2007. Accordingly, the sentences imposed were to date from that day. The passage of 11 months from the date of arrest to the date of sentence is far from excessive and, given the applicant’s pleas of guilty in the Local Court in November 2007, it could not seriously be maintained that he was left in any uncertainty as to his ultimate fate. 
     
      
    30 The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the sentences imposed on individual counts are manifestly excessive by comparison with other decisions of this Court, and that the aggregate sentence and aggregate non parole period are manifestly excessive. The correct application of the principle of totality should result in an aggregate non parole period that reflects the criminality inherent in a number of offences. Here, the Judge was confronted with a deliberate, commercial course of dealing in a variety of drugs. It is not to the point that the applicant’s offences all arose out of the execution of a search warrant. It was never contested that the Judge’s description of the applicant’s conduct was accurate. In these circumstances, I regard a non parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years as entirely appropriate to the applicant’s offending. 
     
      
    31 It was perhaps unfortunate that the method of accumulation drove the Judge to reduce the non parole period for the only offence carrying a standard non parole period to as little as one year, but there can be no complaint about the final result.  
     
      
    32 The extent to which the aggregate non parole period departed from the statutory ratio was also a matter within the discretion of the Judge. The applicant’s complaint on this ground is not that an error of the House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 variety was committed, but that he would have preferred the discretion to have been exercised differently.  
     
      
    33 For the above reasons, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeals against sentence.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Jeremy Chetty appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to two offences. The first was an offence of supplying a prohibited drug relating to the drug GHB. The second was also an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, this time relating to a quantity of methylamphetamine. When I sentence him for the first of those matters, he asks that I take into account a further offence on a Form One, namely an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime.2 The offences are of course very serious. The quantity of GHB involved was significant; indeed approximately half the commercial quantity. The seriousness of various types of drug is a matter that Parliament has determined when it has set out the various quantities of drugs in the schedule to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 3 The offender must receive a sentence of full-time custody. His counsel very properly did not suggest otherwise. As I will demonstrate in a moment, the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree and there are no exceptional circumstances which would justify anything other than full-time custody.4 The offender began taking drugs as he reached the end of his teenage years. As is inevitably the case, his drug use escalated. He moved out of home and got involved in the drug culture associated with gay nightclubs. He commenced by taking ecstasy but it was not long before he moved on to amphetamines and GHB. He described the effect that GHB had upon him in the witness box. It was an effect which he sought and so continued to use that drug, as it gave him confidence.5 Of course he was not working. He had been, but he was not at the time he was a drug user, and in order to fund his lifestyle, he had to commence supplying the drug. He was supplying for the purpose of funding his own drug use, as is almost inevitably the case.6 Police went to the location where the offender was staying in a hotel. He and others he was with had rented two rooms there. At the time police went to the hotel the offender was not present. He was out purchasing more GHB. They found within the room some drugs, some currency and a large quantity of drug supply paraphernalia.7 In particular they found a tackle box and a set of drawers of the type found in home workshops usually filled with nuts and bolts. In the offender’s case they were filled with plastic bags, smaller envelopes, plastic soy sauce containers in the shape of a fish, (the standard way that GHB is distributed) and other paraphernalia including scales. It is clear that this was a fairly extensive drug supply operation. That much is obvious not only from the drug paraphernalia that I have described, but the two lists of names and amounts also discovered by police.8 The offender said of the quantity of drug police found, that some was going to be used by him and his friends and the rest was going to be sold in order, to supply the offender with more money which he could then spend on more drugs.9 The offender whose family are from Fiji, had an unhappy time at school. He was teased and bullied because of the colour of his skin and not surprisingly he took such teasing and bullying very much to heart. He has had a sad life in many respects and now has low self esteem. He has been sexually assaulted on two occasions in his life; something that he has not told anyone. Certainly as he said in evidence today, his father is only learning about that today. He has suffered from depression for many years and a psychologist says that he has thoughts of self loathing.10 His family were Jehovah’s Witnesses. His drug use of course involved an abandonment of that religion. However of recent times, in fact after having been arrested for these matters, the offender has attempted to rehabilitate himself and has achieved a significant measure of rehabilitation. He has entered into residential rehabilitation programs and it says that he has not used drugs for some time. Urinalysis has detected cannabis use, but nothing of more seriousness.11 The offender was employed before starting his drug use and so there is hope for the future. Indeed there are good prospects of rehabilitation. He now lives back at home, wants to re-enter the church lifestyle and has the support of not only his family, but also good friends, having abandoned his association with the wrong crowd after his arrest for these matters. He has expressed his remorse in evidence today. I am satisfied that that expression of remorse is genuine.12 The offender does not have a clean criminal history, but his previous offending was for drug use and is clearly related to the circumstances which bring him before court today.13 It is important to emphasise that the offender has suffered from asthma for a great deal of his life and has been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions, most recently, about a month ago. A report from a doctor tendered to me today says that the offender will tolerate incarceration very poorly from a medical point of view. It is for that reason that it is my strong recommendation that the offender’s health, both physical and mental, be closely monitored whilst he is in custody. The offender must be punished for what he has done, but it is no part of that punishment that he is denied appropriate medical care.14 There are clearly special circumstances in this case. The offender is still relatively young and will be serving his sentence as his first time in custody and it is also important that the good work that the offender has achieved by way of rehabilitation is continued.15 As I began these remarks, it is necessary that the offender received a sentence of full-time custody. Nothing less would reflect the gravity of the offender’s conduct. He has spent one day in custody and so the sentence I will impose will commence yesterday.16 For the offence of supplying GHB, taking into account the matter on the Form One, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of nine months and a head sentence of eighteen months. That sentence commenced yesterday on 18 June 2009 and so the non-parole period will expire on 17 March 2010 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. For the offence of supplying methylamphetamine, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of six months. That is a fixed term because it is a sentence on the first matter I have just announced.

   Judgment1. On 22 May 2009 I handed down judgment (Larach v Urriola [2009] NSWDC 97) for the plaintiffs awarding damages totaling $20,000 for the first plaintiff (a corporation) for three publications and for the sum of $20,000 for the second plaintiff (a director of the corporation) for one publication. Pursuant to a liberty to restore the parties now seek to determine issues of interest and costs.2. The orders for interest and for the costs occasioned by reason of the vacating of an earlier hearing date are not disputed and I have made orders concerning these matters by consent.3. The remaining issue for determination is the plaintiffs’ application pursuant to s 40 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) for indemnity costs.4. Section 40 provides:  
     
     “ 
     Costs in defamation proceedings 
       
      
      
     (1) In awarding costs in defamation proceedings, the court may have regard to: 
      
      
      (a) the way in which the parties to the proceedings conducted their cases (including any misuse of a party’s superior financial position to hinder the early resolution of the proceedings), and  
       
       
      (b) any other matters that the court considers relevant. 
      
      
     (2) Without limiting subsection (1), a court must (unless the interests of justice require otherwise): 
      
      
      (a) if defamation proceedings are successfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the plaintiff-order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the defendant unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer or agree to a settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff, or 
       
       
      (b) if defamation proceedings are unsuccessfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the defendant-order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to accept a settlement offer made by the defendant. 
      
      
     (3) In this section: “settlement offer” means any offer to settle the proceedings made before the proceedings are determined, and includes an offer to make amends (whether made before or after the proceedings are commenced), that was a reasonable offer at the time it was made.” 
    5. The history of offers, according to the affidavits relied upon by the parties, are: 
     
     (a) a “concerns notice” sent under the provisions of s 14  
     Defamation Act 
      2005 calling for a retraction of the allegations and an apology for making them. It should be noted that two of the three imputations were later conceded by the defendants, during the hearing, to be both conveyed and defamatory, and the third imputation set out in the letter was found by me to be conveyed and defamatory. This letter warned that the response to it would be relied upon in relation to costs as well as damages. The defendants replied asserting that the imputations were all true. 
      
       
      
     (b) An offer of compromise for $49,000 plus costs was served on 15 February 2008. This figure is slightly higher than the sum awarded. No response was ever received. 
      
      
     (c) Although the solicitors for the defendants thought they had sent a “walk-away” offer on 6 July 2007, they now concede this letter was never sent.  
      
      
     (d) The parties did contact each other directly to discuss settlement in July or August 2008 (although just who approached whom is hotly disputed), but nothing ever eventuated. This did, however, give the solicitors for the plaintiffs a chance to remind the solicitors for the defendants of the terms of their offer of compromise and to add “We look forward to your advice as to any offer your client proposes to put in this matter.” 
      
      
     (e) During the hearing, on 11 February 2009, at a time when Mr McHugh said his clients’ case was “at its highest”, the defendants invited the plaintiffs to make an offer. An oral offer to accept $150,000 inclusive of costs was put. There was also a request not to write letters stating that the plaintiffs’ products were copies of the defendants. This was responded to on the following day by a “walk-away” offer. 
      
      
     (f) The hearing was completed and submissions were made by counsel. In the course of these submissions, counsel for the defendants sought leave to reopen the case to call further evidence and the hearing had to be adjourned to 27 March 2009. On 26 March 2009 the defendants’ solicitors sent a letter repeating the “walk-away” offer. I note that in my judgment I formally refused leave to the defendants to reopen and further held that if I had erred in refusing leave I would not have found the additional evidence the defendants sought leave to adduce persuasive. 
    6. The question for determination is whether costs awarded to the plaintiffs should be on a party/party or indemnity basis. I note that the defendants’ position was that costs should only be awarded on a party/party basis, and that there was no “fall back” position that in the alternative some percentage only should be awarded.7. Both parties referred to Davis v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 946, where Ms Davis’ solicitors sent a “concerns” notice and offer of compromise but all the defendants did was to make a “walk-away” offer.8. There are two factual differences between these cases, both of which were relied upon by the defendants. The first is that Ms Davis’ offer of compromise was for a sum less than that awarded at the trial (which entitled her to indemnity costs from the date of that offer), and the second is that the publication was a mass media publication.9. Section 40 is based on s 48A Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), which was introduced following public concerns that the costs of defamation proceedings may inhibit plaintiffs who have a legitimate claim for defamation from pursuing relief (Davis at [26]) and also because of concern that defamation actions were being brought to stifle free speech (Second reading speech, Hansard, p.18518). The history of this section is referred to in Hennessy v Lynch (No 4) [2008] NSWDC 15.10. The reference in s 40 to “the way in which the parties to the proceedings conducted their cases (including any misuse of a party’s superior financial position to hinder the early resolution of the proceedings)” relates more to conduct of the kind that used to be called “sharp conduct” such as repeated failure to comply with orders, repetitious applications or appeals, multiple adjournments, prolix pleadings or cross-examination, in circumstances in which such conduct was designed to inhibit the opponent from bringing or defending a claim. No such conduct can be complained of in these proceedings. Counsel for both sides have conducted the case with courtesy and propriety.11. The basis upon which this application is made is that the defendants’ failure to make an offer other than the “walk-away” offer made orally part way during the trial (followed up by a written offer sent after submissions were completed) is sufficient to trigger s 40(2)(a) in that the defendants “unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer or agree to a settlement offer proposed by the [plaintiffs]”. 12. The first issue for determination is whether the defendants’ “walk-away” offers made orally during the trial and the day before the matter was relisted for the application to reopen the case are capable of being regarded as offers at all, given their timing (in the middle of and at the end of an expensive trial) and on the facts of the case (in particular, in circumstances where the defendants had incurred significant costs on a contextual truth allegation which was later abandoned).13. Whether an offer that is merely designed to trigger a costs advantage (such as indemnity costs) but which does not contain an element of compromise is capable of being an offer was considered in Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green [2004] NSWCA 341 (see also Tickell v Trifleska Pty Ltd (1990) 25 NSWLR 353 at 355). In Leichhardt Municipal Council at [37]-[40] Santow JA indicated the kind of factual matters to be taken into account. 14. The crucial problems for the defendants are, in my view, the very late timing of the “walk-away” offers and the very real likelihood that for all its factual complexity, these proceedings were likely to be awarded damages in a very modest range because of the limited extent of publication. The costs involved in bringing and defending the action were always going to outweigh the damages to a very significant degree. 15. If a “walk-away” offer had been sent by the defendants in July 2007, that might have been able to be established to have been “a reasonable offer at the time it was made” (s 40(3)). However, “walk-away” offers made at the end of a trial, or in the course of submissions, are simply made too late.16. In Davis McClellan CJ at CL took a similar view of the impact of a “walk-away” offer made in that litigation, noting at [27] – [29]:  
     
     “[27] Section 40(2) obliges parties to defamation proceedings to take a reasonable approach to negotiations for the settlement of those proceedings. A party who unreasonably fails to make or accept a settlement offer may be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis. The amount of the offer is relevant for the purpose of assessing the reasonableness of a party’s conduct. The section contemplates that an order for costs on an indemnity basis may be made even if a party making an offer does not do better in the proceedings than the offer which he or she has made. 
      
      
     [28] Ms Davis submitted that the behaviour of the defendant in relation to the settlement offers justified an order for indemnity costs irrespective of the offer which she herself made. It was submitted that by merely offering that each party should walk away the defendant failed to make a reasonable offer. The defendant gave no explanation for its failure to offer a monetary sum in settlement or even perhaps judgment for the plaintiff with an apology. Her counsel emphasised that the defendant merely adopted the attitude that it had a good defence and showed no preparedness to compromise or enter genuine negotiations. 
      
      
     [29] The defendant submitted that a distinction should be drawn between the circumstance of a party “unreasonably failing to make a settlement offer” and “failing to make a settlement offer that the court considers is reasonable.” It was submitted that in this case an offer was made and accordingly it could not be concluded that it had unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer. Furthermore, it was submitted that the reasonableness of the particular offer must be judged at the time at which it was made and that the judgment could not be informed by hindsight gained from consideration of the ultimate resolution of the proceedings. It was submitted that at the time it made the offer that each party walk away it was reasonable for it to hold the view that it could successfully defend the proceedings.” 
    17. In the present litigation, the plaintiffs succeeded on all the issues. The imputations were all conveyed and defamatory and all the defences failed for all three publications. The hearing had to be adjourned to accommodate extensive expert evidence on an issue which the defendants later abandoned. During this whole period, the defendants made no response to the concerns notices or the offer of compromise; their offer during the trial to walk away was not only too late, but was not a true compromise. At least Ms Davis was left with the option of walking away or pursuing her claim (at [40]) but these offers were made so late that the plaintiffs had in fact almost completed pursuing their claim. It was to prevent this kind of conduct that s 40 was enacted, as McClellan CJ at CL notes in Davis at [26].18. I accordingly order the defendants to pay the plaintiffs’ costs of these proceedings on an indemnity basis.Orders(1) Vary order 1 of the Judgment of 22 May 2009 to include interest in the sum of $739.74, making a total of $10,739.74 up to and including 22 May 2009 together with a daily interest rate of $2.65 thereafter.(2) Vary order 2 of the Judgment of 22 May 2009 to include interest in the sum of $369.05, making a total of $5,369.05 up to and including 22 May 2009 together with a daily interest rate of $1.32 thereafter.(3) Vary order 3 of the Judgment of 22 May 2009 to include interest in the sum of $337.40, making a total of $5,337.40 up to and including 22 May 2009 together with a daily interest rate of $1.32 thereafter.(4) Vary order 4 of the Judgment of 22 May 2009 to include interest in the sum of $1,349.59, making a total of $21,349.59 up to and including 22 May 2009 together with a daily interest rate of $5.26 thereafter.(5) Vary the costs order of 22 August 2008 concerning the vacating of the trial date from costs reserved to costs in the cause.(6) The defendants to pay the plaintiffs’ costs of these proceedings on an indemnity basis.

     Judgment 
    Introduction1. The defendants bring an application for the summary dismissal of these proceedings or alternatively an order that some or all of the imputations be struck out. The parties have provided me with written submissions on the issues of capacity and defamatory meaning and agreed that I should determine the issue on those submissions.2. The plaintiffs also bring an application for the lump sum assessment of costs against the solicitors arising from an order I made on 17 April 2009.3. The first issue for determination is the question of the form and capacity of the imputations pleaded as having arisen from the publication of the matter complained of, which is set out in a schedule to this judgment.4. The matter complained of was published on 21 November 2007 and the argument concerning form and capacity of the imputations falls to be considered under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).5. In written submissions the parties have provided me with references to a number of decisions concerning the appropriate test for imputations, with the defendant referring to some of the older decisions setting a very high standard for precision and particularity applicable when imputations were the cause of action. However, the Court of Appeal in Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWCA 37 explains the test for capacity simply and clearly, referring to Favell v Queensland Newspapers Ltd (2005) 22 ALR 186, and I have adopted the tests set out in these judgments as appropriate in these proceedings.6. The matter complained of is a report of proceedings in the Local Court in which the plaintiff was charged with assault, followed by commentary on the plaintiff’s activities as a radio announcer for 2-TEN FM. The issues raised by the imputations argument include: 
     
     (a) whether the matter complained of conveys imputations of guilt, as opposed to suspicion of wrongdoing, by reason of a report of the matters on which the plaintiff has been charged, including interim orders to remain away from the person allegedly assaulted; 
      
     (b) whether imputations of other conduct by the plaintiff are conveyed and defamatory; and 
      
     (c) whether the imputations differ in substance. 
    Form and capacity of imputations7. The imputations pleaded as arising from the matter complained of are: 
     
     (a) that the plaintiff committed an assault upon Mr Curtis (lines 1- 5, 13 – 20); 
      
     (b) that the plaintiff was the subject of a Court Order in regard to an assault on Mr Curtis (lines 13 – 20); 
      
     (c) the the plaintiff was the subject of a Court Order that required an appeal by the plaintiff’s solicitors (lines 13 – 20); 
      
     (d) that the plaintiff used foul language when announcing for 2-TEN FM (lines 66 – 67, 74 – 76); 
      
     (e) that the plaintiff had to be disciplined by the management of 2-TEN FM for using foul language when announcing on 2-TEN FM (lines 66 – 67, 74 – 76); 
      
     (f) that the plaintiff used his position as announcer on 2-TEN FM to make personal criticisms of people (lines 66 – 76, 86 – 88); 
      
     (g) that the plaintiff had to be disciplined by management of 2-TEN FM for making personal criticisms of people when announcing on 2-TEN FM (lines 66 – 76); 
      
     (h) that the plaintiff used his position as announcer on 2-TEN FM to criticize rival media (lines 66 – 70); 
      
     (i) that the management of 2-TEN FM had to discipline the plaintiff for criticizing rival media when announcing on 2-TEN FM (lines 66 – 70); 
      
     (j) that the Hunter New England Health had made a complaint to 2-TEN FM about a personal criticism of one of its employees made by the plaintiff when announcing on 2-TEN FM (lines 70 – 75); 
      
     (k) that the plaintiff knowingly criticised an asbestosis victim when announcing on 2-TEN FM (lines 76 – 81); 
      
     (l) that the plaintiff used his position as an announcer on 2-TEN FM to urge people to inappropriately use a telephone service established by an asbestosis victim (lines 75 – 85); 
      
     (m) that a valid survey found that the plaintiff was disliked by listeners of 2-TEN FM lines 90 – 96). 
    Imputation (a) that the plaintiff committed an assault upon Mr Curtis8. The matter complained of refers to the plaintiff being “accused” of assault after an “incident” and refers to the making of interim orders which were reviewed on appeal. While the article says the magistrate “initially” ordered the plaintiff to avoid any intimidatory behaviour, it goes on to note these orders were “relaxed” by “agreement”. Most refreshingly for a media publication, the defendant goes on to state: “The agreement between the parties is not an admission of guilt on Mr Ainsworth’s part” (lines 19-21). The article goes on to note that both the plaintiff and the person he has been charged with assaulting have “temporarily” departed from the radio station. The publication next states that this is not the first time the plaintiff has fallen foul of management at the radio station, noting a series of incidents involving foul language and personal (but verbal) attacks on politicians.9. In Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison (1982) 149 CLR 293 at 301, Mason J noted: 
     
     “As we have seen, there is now a strong current of authority supporting the view that a report which does no more than state that a person has been arrested and has been charged with a criminal offence is incapable of bearing the imputation that he is guilty or probably guilty of that offence. The decisions are, I think, soundly based, even if we put aside the emphasis that has been given to the process of inference on inference that is involved in reaching a contrary conclusion. The ordinary reasonable reader is mindful of the principle that a person charged with a crime is presumed innocent until it is proved that he is guilty. Although he knows that many persons charged with a criminal offence are ultimately convicted, he is also aware that guilt or innocence is a question to be determined by a court, generally by a jury, and that not infrequently the person charged is acquitted.” 
    10. This publication is more than normally careful to say that the plaintiff has been accused and that the interim orders are an agreement between the parties which is not an admission of guilt on the plaintiff’s part.11. The plaintiff submits that it is enough for the ordinary reasonable reader to read that the magistrate has made “orders” and that in the context of there being an allegation of assault the ordinary reasonable reader would assume that the assault has been proved.12. The ordinary reasonable reader is someone with a degree of common sense and who has lived in the world. The ordinary reasonable reader would note that these orders are interim in nature, and that the agreement is not an admission of guilt by the plaintiff.13. Although the plaintiff does not refer to it, there are other references in the matter complained of which are the context in which these allegations appear. These are as follows: 
     
     (a) The matter complained of tells the reader that the victim of the assault is the station manager, that the “incident that sparked the court appearance took place in the early hours of Monday morning” after the plaintiff had been given his “marching orders” by Mr Curtis. Radio station board member Marion Saxby had delivered a letter to the plaintiff informing him that his long-time stint as breakfast DJ was over. 
      
      
     (b) The matter complained of then outlines the magistrate, in the course of a “brief” appearance in court, “initially” making orders for the plaintiff to remain away but “on an appeal” from his solicitor, then relaxing the requirements of the interim order. It is in this context that we are told that the agreement between the parties is not an admission of guilt by the plaintiff. 
      
      
     (c) The matter complained of then goes on to state that both the plaintiff and the assault victim have “temporarily” left the station and describes a series of problems the radio station board is having. The board’s other problems are outlines and the comment is then made that the “uncertainty about the future” of both the plaintiff and the person who alleges the plaintiff assaulted him need to be “absorbed”. There are then further comments about the financial difficulties of the radio station after auditors who expressed “serious concerns” were replaced. 
      
      
     (d) There is then a series of comments about the victim of the assault, Mr Curtis, noting that he was “trumpeted on his arrival as a real catch for the station” but that there was “some resistance” to some of his reforms from long-term radio station volunteers. 
      
      
     (e) Having made a series of comments critical of the board of the radio station and of the victim of the assault, the matter complained of then notes that this is not the first time the plaintiff has fallen foul of the management of the radio station and goes on to note allegations about “personal attacks” by the plaintiff on local politicians, rival media and “other identities” . However, it is quite clear that these are verbal attacks made on air. They do not have any corroborative value in relation to the assault allegations, partly because the nature of these personal attacks is made clear, partly because the alleged victim and the radio station management have been the subject of critical review and partly because of the structure of the matter complained of. By the time the reader gets to this part of the matter complained of, it is clear that the publication is examining the conduct of everyone involved. 
    14. This is a very evenhanded piece of reporting. The reader is given background information in a clear and succinct way. The ordinary reasonable reader, reading between the lines, would have a very clear picture of what led to the allegations of assault, what the magistrate did during the brief appearance in court, and why. This is a good example of an imputation of guilt failing to arise from the matter complained of, for the reasons explained by Mason J in Mirror Newspapers Ltd. 15. As I propose to strike out this imputation I do not need to consider the argument as to whether the imputation is defamatoryImputation (b) the plaintiff was the subject of a court order in regard to an assault on Mr Curtis16. I repeat the matters set out above concerning whether assault is in fact conveyed. This imputation must also be struck out.17. The defendant submits that such an imputation is not capable of being defamatory. The test on a strike out application in relation to defamatory meaning means that only in the clearest cases would such an issue not go to the jury: Bik v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd [1973] 2 NSWLR 473. It may be that the plaintiff seeks to plead a new imputation about the plaintiff’s conduct warranting an interim order restraining him from approaching a victim pending the hearing of an assault charge. If so, the defendant is at liberty to raise fresh objections at that time.Imputation (c) the plaintiff was the subject of a court order that required an appeal by the plaintiff’s solicitors18. The matter complained of refers to a “brief” appearance in which the magistrate “initially” makes orders but “on an appeal from the defendant’s solicitor, agreed to relax the requirements of the interim order.” This is followed by the statement that this “agreement” is not an admission.19. The real vice in this imputation is that the sting of the imputation is not at all clear. Is the sting the fact that the magistrate was so repulsed by the plaintiff’s conduct that he made orders that had to be set aside on appeal and if so, does this reflect badly on the plaintiff or the magistrate? Is it defamatory to say of someone that they have had to have orders set aside on appeal? Most people would think the judge rather than the litigant would be at fault in such circumstances.20. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the reference to the plaintiff being accused of “shirt fronting and verbally assaulting” Mr Curtis, and repeats the assertion (written submissions, paragraph 8) that to say of someone that they are the subject of a court order in regard to an assault is defamatory. If that is the sting of the imputation then it does not differ in substance from imputation (b), as well as suffering from the same vice that the imputation would include an assertion of guilt rather than suspicion.21. I strike out imputation (c).Imputation (d) the plaintiff used foul language when announcing for 2-TEN FM22. While the matter complained of says that this “is not the first time Mr Ainsworth has fallen foul of management at 2-TEN FM” and goes on to refer to management being forced to intervene after numerous complaints of “inappropriate language on air” and “personal attacks on politicians”. Several examples of this inappropriate language and personal attacks are given. The first is a reference to “attacking” Mr Rolph for being an “absentee councillor” when he had gone to live on the coast because of his asbestosis; the plaintiff also is accused of urging listeners to “abuse the privilege” of using the reverse charges number Mr Rolph set up to enable his constituents to keep in touch with him. The second is a local newspaper, which the plaintiff is asserted to have described as being as good as “toilet paper”. His style is described in the last line as “no-holds-barred”.23. This is not foul language. Foul language is swearing or using obscene language, as the defendant’s written submissions point out. 24. I strike out this imputation.Imputation (e) the plaintiff had to be disciplined by the management of 2_TEN FM for using foul language when announcing on 2-TEN FM25. In light of my ruling concerning (d) this imputation is not conveyed26. I strike out this imputation.Imputation (f) the plaintiff used his position as an announcer on 2-TEN FM to make personal criticisms of people27. While I suspect that what the plaintiff really means is “misused” rather than “used”, the construing of the imputation in terms of the matter complained of makes it clear that the plaintiff has made personal attacks on persons such as an asbestosis sufferer, hospital staff and business rivals and that such attacks are done in a robust, no-holds-barred style that causes a high level of discomfort to some listeners. 28. Whether or not the ordinary reasonable reader would think less of the plaintiff is a matter for a jury to decide. While some members of the community may consider that an imputation of being an abortionist, or a communist, is no longer defamatory, that is not the test. These are matters for consideration by the tribunal of fact when issues of capacity and defamatory meaning fall to be determined.29. This imputation is capable of being conveyed and of being considered defamatory by the tribunal of fact. Imputation (g) the plaintiff had to be disciplined by the management of 2-TEN FM for making personal criticisms of people when announcing on 2-TEN FM30. The defendant submits: 
     
     (a) this is a variation of the previous imputation (which I assume means that the imputation does not differ in substance). I do not accept this submission. The fact that a person has been disciplined for conduct can of itself be defamatory, independently of an imputation that a person has committed that conduct. 
      
      
     (b) “no proper imputation is pleaded and this imputation must be struck out” – this is a rhetorical submission.  
      
      
     (c) this imputation is not defamatory. For the reasons set out above in relation to other imputations, I do not accept that an imputation of discipline by an employer is so obviously not defamatory that this question should be taken from the tribunal of fact. 
    31. The imputation is clearly conveyed. The matter complained of states that the alleged assault incident is “not the first time the plaintiff has fallen foul of management” and that “management was forced to intervene” after “numerous complaints” including “personal attacks” on local politicians, rival media and other identities.32. The matter complained of also refers to “complaints” and that he had been warned about inappropriate on-air language as recently as last month.33. These references all paint a clear picture of the plaintiff having to be disciplined by management for this conduct, the most recent such occasion being the month before publication of the matter complained of.34. The circumstances in which the plaintiff has had to be disciplined is a separate act from the circumstances of his having criticized these persons. It is not a variant of the imputation but an imputation in its own right.35. This imputation is capable of being conveyed. As I have indicated, any imputation of conduct warranting disciplining by an employer is capable of being considered defamatory. Such an issue is a question for the tribunal of fact. Imputation (h) the plaintiff used his position as an announcer on 2-TEN FM to criticize rival media36. At lines 70 and 85 – 90 there are references to criticisms of rival media, with a reference to the Free Times Newspaper and its editor as a “favourite punching bag” and the plaintiff’s unflattering comparison of it to “toilet paper”.37. The objection that this imputation is “a variation of the above imputations” (defendant’s submissions, paragraph 41) appears to be a complaint that the imputation does not differ in substance. However, each of the charges laid against the plaintiff is a matter for which the plaintiff is entitled to plead a separate imputation, since the subject matter is quite different.38. The defendant’s objection that “it is not defamatory to criticize one’s rival” is misconceived. The question of whether what is said is defamatory or not will depend on what is said. The matter complained of makes it clear that the criticism is of the “punching bag” variety and includes insults such as a comparison to toilet paper. 39. This imputation is capable of being conveyed and defamatory.Imputation (i) the management of 2-TEN FM had to discipline the plaintiff for criticizing rival media when announcing on 2-TEN FM 40. This imputation clearly conveys a separate act, namely that the plaintiff was disciplined by his employer who was “forced to intervene” on “numerous” occasions in relation to this and other complaints about the plaintiff’s conduct.41. This imputation is capable of being conveyed and defamatory.Imputation (j) that Hunter New England Health made a complaint about personal criticism of one of its employees made by the plaintiff when announcing on 2-TEN FM42. The matter complained of says that the plaintiff “was the subject of complaints from Hunter New England Health over attacks on one of the authority’s former local employees”. In the context of the plaintiff having “numerous complaints” about his inappropriate language on air and personal attacks, this imputation is capable of being considered as defamatory by the tribunal of fact.43. This imputation is capable of being conveyed and of being found to be defamatory by the tribunal of fact.Imputation (k) that the plaintiff knowingly criticized an asbestos victim when announcing on 2-TEN FM44. This imputation suffers from a lack of clarity, chiefly from the use of the word “knowingly”. What the pleader probably means is that the plaintiff attacked Mr Rolph for being an absentee councillor despite knowing that he had moved to the coast as a consequence of his battle with asbestosis. Even though imputations are no longer the cause of action, this imputation must be struck out in its present form. The defendant should not have to guess what the plaintiff’s imputation means.45. This imputation is struck out. If the plaintiff intends to replead it, the conduct must be identified with more precision so that the defendant knows what evidence to lead if (as is clearly the defendant’s intention, according to the defendant’s submissions) a defence of justification is to be pleaded.Imputation (l) that the plaintiff used his position as announcer on 2-TEN FM to urge people to inappropriately use a telephone service established by an asbestos victim46. The matter complained of described how when Mr Rolph moved to the coast because of his asbestosis, he set up a reverse charge number so that his constituents could stay in touch with him. The matter complained of goes on to say that the plaintiff “urged listeners on air to abuse the privilege”. The inference clearly is that he told them to use this number to ring up Mr Rolph about matters for which the reverse charge number had not been established. If so, that could be an inappropriate use of the reverse charge telephone service. 47. The defendant submits that the matter complained of simply says the plaintiff was encouraging listeners to contact Mr Rolph “in the context of being an absentee councillor”. Such a submission completely disregards the words “abuse the privilege”.48. This imputation is capable of being conveyed and of being considered defamatory by the tribunal of fact.Imputation (m) that a valid survey found that the plaintiff was disliked by listeners49. The matter complained of says that the plaintiff’s style has “divided listeners”, with a 2001 survey of local business people showing a “high level of discomfort” about his on-air style, but noting there is a “core of emphatic support from fans”.50. The matter complained of simply does not say that a survey (valid or otherwise) found that the plaintiff was disliked by listeners. 51. This imputation is not conveyed and is struck out.Concluding remarks52. I have struck out the majority of the plaintiff’s imputations. Some of these imputations are not conveyed, while others, such as (k), are simply poorly drafted and need to be repleaded. However, the plaintiff may prefer to replead the imputations for the whole of the statement of claim as one set of particulars. Consequently, the orders that I will make will be to strike out certain imputations individually, but grant a general leave to file an amended statement of claim to enable the plaintiff to refine the imputations to ensure they cover the field. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs of this application.Costs issues53. The plaintiff also seeks costs of an earlier application by the plaintiff for summary judgment. On 17 April I made an order that the costs of 24 October and 7 November 2008 and 6 February, 3 and 17 April 2009 be assessable forthwith and be paid by the solicitors for the defendant, who repeatedly failed to appear until April 2009. The solicitors for the defendant, according to Mr Kumar’s written submissions, conceded their obligation to pay these costs. 54. The solicitors for the plaintiff claim $8,660.50 legal costs in relation to this application. They sent their bill to the solicitors for the defendant but have received no reply. These solicitors’ costs are in narrative form and I have no information about how their costs and the costs for the city agent are calculated. The sum involved is substantial and appears likely to include a solicitor/client component as the costs relate to 100% of the legal fees for the application.55. While I granted leave for the parties to bring an application for a lump sum costs order, the information I have is insufficient for me to determine what costs are payable in relation to the specific matters provided for in my orders of 17 April 2009. In my opinion the best course is to direct the plaintiff to proceed to have this bill assessed by a costs assessor in the usual way. The costs assessor, who will have access to the solicitor’s file and costs agreements, will be able to determine these issues from that material. Orders1. Imputations (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (k) and (m) struck out.2. Imputations (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (l) are capable of being conveyed and having a defamatory meaning.3. Leave to the plaintiff to file an amended statement of claim in 14 days including a general right of leave to amend in relation to the imputations.4. The plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of the imputations argument.5. Decline to make a lump sum order for costs concerning the plaintiff's costs of the motion for summary judgment and direct the plaintiff to prepare a bill in assessable form in the usual way.6. These proceedings stood over for further directions to Friday 17 July 2009 at 9:00am.

       Curtis. The incident that sparked the court 
       
       
        
       appearance took place in the early hours of Monday morn- 
       
       
        
       ing, after Mr Ainsworth had been given his marching orders 
       
       
        
       the previous Friday by Mr Curtis, who was only appointed  
       
       
        
       to the stations’ top job back in September. In a letter deliv- 
       
       
       10 
       ered by board member Marion Saxby, Mr Ainsworth had  
       
       
        
       been informed that his long-time stint as breakfast DJ was 
       
       
        
       over. 
       
       
        
       In a brief appearance, the magistrate initially ordered Mr 
       
       
        
       Ainsworth, who was accused of shirt-fronting and verbally 
       
       
       15 
       assaulting Mr Curtis, to avoid any intimidatory behaviour, 
       
       
        
       as well as avoid coming within 100 metres of the station 
       
       
        
       premises or Mr Curtis’ current address. However on an 
       
       
        
       appeal from the defendant’s solicitor, agreed to relax the  
       
       
        
       requirements of the interim order. The agreement 
       
       
       20 
       between the parties is not an admission of guilt on Mr  
       
       
        
       Ainsworth’s part 
       
       
        
       With the two key personalities at the station temporarily 
       
       
        
       off the premises in the wake of the incident – Mr Curtis 
       
       
        
       departing until further notice – former manager Alan 
       
       
       25 
       Bennett, who resigned for health reasons, has returned to 
       
       
        
       the station for the interim. Mr Bennett emphasised, howev- 
       
       
        
       er, that he was not acting as interim manager.  
       
       
        
       It has been a bruising two months for the now-captainless 
       
       
        
       station, which is continuing to transmit. The station has a 
       
       
       30 
       strong market presence in Tenterfield and is believed to be  
       
       
        
       the number one media in the federation town based on rev-

       own despite facing competition from Beaudesert-based  
       
       
        
       Rebel FM. 
       
       
       35 
       Beneath the surface, however, problems continue to 
       
       
        
       During the recent, fiery board meeting of 2-TEN FM, sitting secre- 
       
       
        
       tary Clive Graham resigned, citing serious procedural concerns. 
       
       
        
       Now, there is uncertainty about the  
       
       
        
       future of both Mr Curtis and Mr 
       
       
       40 
       Ainsworth at the station as the full 
       
       
        
       implications of the incident are  
       
       
        
       absorbed. The Free Times also 
       
       
        
       understands that financial statements 
       
       
        
       from the radio have not been lodged 
       
       
       45 
       with the state Department of Fair 
       
       
        
       Trading since 2002, and new audi- 
       
       
        
       tors of the station were appointed 
       
       
        
       after the previous auditors expressed 
       
       
        
       serious concerns about the station’s 
       
       
       50 
       books. That decision has now been 
       
       
        
       reversed, following pressure from 
       
       
        
       Tenterfield Shire Council. 
       
       
        
       President of 2-Ten FM Glen Taylor 
       
       
        
       has not been available for comment,  
       
       
       55 
       however a meeting tonight is expect- 
       
       
        
       ed to clarify the situation.  
       
       
        
       Mr Curtis was trumpeted on his 
       
       
        
       arrival as a real catch for the station,  
       
       
        
       with top-level big city experience 
       
       
       60 
       including stints with 3KZ in 
       
       
        
       Melbourne, and holding down the 
       
       
        
       prime position of newsreader at Channel 7 in Perth. He announced that he would be intro- 
       
       
        
       ducing workshops for potential volunteer presenters, and increasing the role played by 
       
       
        
       Stanthorpe. There was some resistance at the station from long-term volunteers to some of 
       
       
       65 
       Mr Curtis’ proposed reforms. 
       
       
        
       It is not the first time Mr Ainsworth has fallen foul of management at 2-TEN FM. 
       
       
        
       Management was forced to intervene after numerous complaints against Mr Ainsworth for 
       
       
        
       use of inappropriate language on air, as well 
       
       
        
       as his personal attacks on local politicians, 
       
       
       70 
       rival media, and other identities. Recently, 
       
       
        
       Mr Ainsworth was the subject of complaints 
       
       
        
       from Hunter New England Health over 
       
       
        
       attacks on one of the authority’s former local 
       
       
        
       employees, and he had been warned again 
       
       
       75 
       about inappropriate on-air language as recent- 
       
       
        
       ly as last month. Notable amongst his previ- 
       
       
        
       ous targets was former Tenterfield councillors 
       
       
        
       Alan Rolph, attacking the latter for being an 
       
       
        
       absentee councillor after Mr Rolph moved to  
       
       
       80 
       the coast as a consequence of his battle with 
       
       
        
       asbestosis. When Mr Rolph advertised a 
       
       
        
       reverse charges number in the Tenterfield Star 
       
       
        
       to allow constituents to stay in touch with him 
       
       
        
       at no expense to themselves, Mr Ainsworth  
       
       
       85 
       urged listeners on air to abuse the privilege. 
       
       
        
       Another favourite punching bag of Mr 
       
       
        
       Ainsworth was Free Times editor Olav 
       
       
        
       Muurlink and the newspaper itself, with Mr 
       
       
        
       Ainsworth claiming on one occasion it was as 
       
       
       90 
       good as “toilet paper”. His style has divided 
       
       
        
       listeners, with a survey of local business peo- 
       
       
        
       ple conducted by board members in 2001 at  
       
       
        
       the behest of the board uncovering a high 
       
       
        
       level of discomfort about Mr Ainsworth’s on- 
       
       
       95 
       air style, along with a core of emphatic sup- 
       
       
        
       port from fans of the no-holds-barred DJ.

     JUDGMENTIntroduction1 The question to be decided in this case is who was responsible for a collision which occurred at about 2.10pm on 11 February 2001 on the Princes Highway, just a few kilometres north of Bega, when a line of trucks, caravans and semitrailers used by people in the side show industry, was making its way to the Bega show. The collision involved two cars which collided head on in a northbound lane. The car coming from the north, just before the collision, crossed onto its incorrect side. It did so by reason of the action of the driver of a truck towing a caravan. That truck had moved across from an adjoining overtaking southbound lane, forcing it to leave its lane and move across to the northbound lane. Mr Veigel, the driver of the northbound vehicle, was very severely injured. He was unconscious for two months afterwards and recalls nothing of the collision. The driver of the southbound vehicle, Mrs Broughton, was seriously injured. She did not lose consciousness. She was able to give evidence about the collision.2 Arising from the injuries Mr Veigel and Mrs Broughton received, each of them commenced proceedings for damages. Each of them alleged the driver of the relevant truck had been either: 
     
      
       
       (a) Mr Jamie Dee; (fourth defendant in Mr Veigel’s case and third in Mrs Broughton’s case) 
        
       (b) Mr Dean Davis; (fifth defendant in Mr Veigel’s case and fourth in Mrs Broughton’s case) 
        
        or 
        
       (c) the driver of another vehicle, the identity of which cannot, after due enquiry and search, be established.  
        
       
      
    The Nominal Defendant (second defendant in Mr Veigel’s case and first in Mrs Broughton’s) has been sued by both Mr Veigel and Mrs Broughton in respect of that third possibility. The Nominal Defendant, through its counsel, Mr R Stitt QC, (with Mr D Wilson) conceded when the trial commenced, that he would not submit Mr Veigel had failed to conduct due enquiry and search. In the course of the trial he announced the same concession in the case of Mrs Broughton. In addresses, no submissions were made about the issue of due enquiry and search. For reasons which later appear, that issue is not one which I have to decide. But had I been called on to do so, I would have found each of Mr Veigel and Ms Broughton had engaged in due enquiry and search. There was ample evidence to justify that finding in each of their cases.3 In Mr Veigel’s case, Mrs Broughton was joined as first defendant. The third defendant was Mr Elwin Bell, owner of the vehicle being driven by Mr Dee. In Mrs Broughton’s case, Mr Elwin Bell was second defendant, and all defendants in her case alleged she had been guilty of contributory negligence. Before me however all three, through their counsel, informed me that that defence would not be relied on.4 In a letter from the solicitors acting for Messrs Dee and Elwin Bell, dated 27 February 2004, they admitted: 
     
      
       
       (a) On 11 February 2001 Mr Dee was driving motor vehicle registration number FG2 993, towing a caravan with the registration number F34-209, in a southerly direction along Princes Highway in NSW; 
        
       (b) On 11 February 2001 Mr E Bell owned the vehicle with registered number FG2 993 and Mr Owen Bell owned the vehicle with registered number F34-209. 
       
      
    A Previous Hearing5 There was an earlier trial, resulting in a judgment against Mr Dee as driver and Mr Elwin Bell as owner, of the relevant vehicle, in favour of Mr Veigel, and a judgment (subject to a reduction of 50 per cent for contributory negligence) in favour of Mrs Broughton. Judgment was entered for Mr Davis and for the Nominal Defendant.6 The Court of Appeal on 20 March 2008 set aside the orders against Messrs Dee and Bell and in favour of Mr Davis and the Nominal Defendant, and ordered all parties have a retrial, to determine only which of the defendants’ negligence had caused Mrs Broughton’s car to move into the path of Mr Veigel’s car. The Court also set aside the finding of contributory negligence the first trial judge had made against Mrs Broughton. As clarified by the High Court of Australia on 26 August 2008 on a special leave application, the issues to be retried do not include any question about Mrs Broughton’s part in the collision. When refusing leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal, Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
      “The retrial is to proceed on the following bases which are implied in order 15 of the orders made by the Court of Appeal: 
       
       
      (a) A vehicle referred to in that order as “the offending vehicle” pulled out into the path of the vehicle driven by Mrs Broughton when Mrs Broughton’s vehicle was overtaking vehicles in the left lane of the highway; 
       
       
      (b) The driver of the so-called “offending vehicle” was at fault in pulling out into the path of Mrs Broughton’s vehicle and that fault was a cause of the collision between Mr Veigel’s vehicle and Mrs Broughton’s vehicle; 
       
       
      (c) The only available answers to the question about the identity of the owner/driver of the offending vehicle are (1) Mr E Bell, (2) Mr Jamie Dee, (3) Mr Dean Davis or (4) that the identity of the vehicle cannot, after due search and inquiry, be established. Consistently with the orders made by the Court of Appeal and implicit in order 15 was that Mrs Broughton herself was not at fault.” 
      
    (Hereafter I shall also call the vehicle responsible for the collision “the offending vehicle” and the driver responsible for the collision “the offending driver”.)7 Mr Veigel’s damages have been agreed and paid. Mrs Broughton’s damages are still to be assessed. I am not required in these proceedings to assess those damages. The Retrial8 On the retrial, Mr Veigel’s counsel, Mr A. J. Black, called Senior Constable Milton, the first police officer to reach the scene of the collision after it occurred. Then he called eye witnesses, viz Mr Hodkinson, Mr Lear and Mr Davis’ former girlfriend, Ms Grey. He tendered the transcript of the evidence of Mr Lear’s daughter, from the first trial, but did not call her. Mr C. T. Barry QC, who, with Mr P. Frame, appeared for Mrs Broughton, called only Mrs Broughton and a former police officer, Mr C. M. Fowler. The Nominal Defendant did not call any witnesses. Mr Maconachie QC, who with Mr C. T. Thompson appeared for Messrs Bell and Jamie Dee, called Mr Owen Bell, his father, Mr Elwin Bell, and Mr Dee. In the case of Mr Davis, for whom Mr R. W. Seton SC and Mr P. Carr appeared, witnesses called were Mr Davis, and his grandfather, Mr L. J. Davis.9 In general terms the plaintiffs allege that the offending driver was in a long line of traffic on a single lane heading south towards Bega. At a point about ten kilometres north of Bega there is a bridge called Stoney Creek Bridge. To the south of that is an overtaking lane for south bound traffic. At that point the road goes up a hill with a right curve then a left. After the line of traffic arrived at Stoney Creek Bridge, Mrs Broughton was in the overtaking lane, when the offending vehicle moved across from her left, forcing her into the path of an oncoming car driven by Mr Veigel.10 Mr Dee, who was driving a Hino truck (Mr Dee’s truck) owned by Mr Elwin Bell, and towing a caravan owned by Mr Owen Bell, says he was not the driver of the offending vehicle, but he was told about the collision when he was ahead of the point of impact, and he stopped his vehicle at the top of the hill, where he found a place to park. His fellow employee, Mr Owen Bell, driving a semi trailer, (Mr Bell’s truck) joined him there soon after, and the two returned on foot to the scene of the accident. Several eyewitnesses later saw Mr Dee’s vehicle at the top of the hill and identified it as the offending vehicle. However several other witnesses (including Mr Bell) identified Mr Davis as the driver of the offending vehicle, which they said had kept going after the accident, driving south. Mr Davis denied he had been there at all that day.11 I shall now summarise the evidence. As will have become apparent, two major issues in the case were: 
     
      
       
       (a) whether an error of identification was made by the witnesses implicating Mr Dee’s truck as the offending vehicle; and 
        
       (b) whether Mr Davis was at the accident scene at the relevant time.  
       
      
    12 Ultimately there was no significant attempt by any party to show the collision had been caused by an unidentified vehicle, and the parties proceeded on the assumption it had been caused by either Mr Dee or Mr Davis. By agreement of all parties, the evidence in each case was also the evidence in the other.Evidence of Senior Constable Milton13 The first police officer on the scene was Senior Constable Milton, who, on 11 February 2001, was stationed at Merimbula, on general duties. 14 On the afternoon of 11th February he received a radio call informing him of an accident on the Princes Highway, north of Bega. By the time he arrived, at 2.37pm, the Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA) personnel from Bega had arrived. Senior Constable Milton observed Mr Veigel’s car, a white Datsun, against the railing, on the western side of the roadway. He observed Mrs Broughton’s car, a green Holden Commodore, facing west. He concluded the two vehicles had had a head on collision. VRA members were trying to remove Mr Veigel from his car. Ambulance officers were treating the injured. 15 He spoke to Mrs Broughton, who, as it happens, he knew. Mrs Broughton told him she had been overtaking two trucks. When she got halfway past the first one the second had pulled out to overtake. She braked and swerved. She had nowhere to go. 16 He received no information while he was at the scene which assisted in identifying the offending vehicle. His primary concern was to control the traffic and record the details of witnesses. He appreciated, by reason of the seriousness of the injuries to some people, that he was dealing with a crime scene, and that specialist accident investigating police would later come to the scene and carry out their own investigation.17 He estimated the point of impact as being less than 500 metres, perhaps 400 metres, to the south of the Stoney Creek Bridge on the Princes Highway. Immediately to the south of that bridge, he said, the southern carriageway became two, providing an overtaking lane. At the point of impact, the distance from Bega, could have been 10 kilometres. At a point about 500 metres to the south of the point of impact was the turn off to the Snowy Mountains Highway, which led to Cooma via Brown Mountain, and then to Canberra. 18 He travelled to the scene at a speed of up to 140 kilometres per hour. He did not recall what vehicles had driven past him from the north on his way to the scene. It took him fifteen to twenty minutes to drive to the scene from where he had been when he received the call. At the top of the hill before reaching the scene, but about 400 metres from it, he observed two vehicles parked on the eastern side, one with a silver coloured trailer, and two men standing at the front of the vehicles, apparently talking. There was exploration in the course of the trial about whether these could have been Mr Dee’s truck and Mr Bell’s truck. He was shown photographs of the caravan Mr Dee said he was towing that day. The following evidence was then given: 
     
      
      “Q [A]re you able to comment on whether that does or does not appear to be the trailer that you have described as being attached to the rear of one of the trucks? 
       
      A. I remember – and it being a long time ago – a silver and – I would say no.  
       
       
      Q. All right. And in terms of this trailer that you remember was it a trailer height wise that went up to the height of approximately the cabin of the truck or was it something that was only approximately half the height, or-- 
       
      A. The caravan for the – the trailer going up as high as the back of the truck. 
       
       
      Q. That’s your recollection? 
       
      A. Yeah, yeah, they were about level, yeah.”  
       T49.8-21 
      
    19 He was also shown a photograph Exhibit J of the semitrailer Mr Bell had parked at the top of the hill just after the accident but he said he did not remember seeing a truck like that.20 Senior Constable Milton had travelled on the same stretch of road on 26 April 2009 and had noticed that the point of impact could be observed from Stoney Creek Bridge from the perspective of someone travelling south in a car.21 It was not submitted to me that I should not accept Senior Constable Milton as a witness of truth and accuracy, and I do so. Evidence of Mr Hodkinson22 Mr Hodkinson lived on a farm near Bega. On this day he was driving south, on his way to Eden. He was in a line of vehicles which included vehicles ahead of him which he said were connected with “the show circuit”. The line ahead of him included several trucks. Some of the vehicles ahead of him were cars. As Mr Hodkinson approached the overtaking lane to the south of Stoney Creek Bridge, he saw two cars collide head on. He was momentarily puzzled. Then, seconds later, as he got closer, he observed that a truck towing a caravan appeared to be sprawled across both southbound lanes, with the caravan mainly in the slow lane and the truck mainly in the fast lane. Earlier, this truck and caravan had been in the convoy three vehicles in front of him. When he saw them after the accident, the vehicles were either stopped, or moving at a slow speed. They were slightly past the point in the road where the impact had occurred.23 He described the truck as of less than five tonnes, whitish in colour, with a vertical exhaust on the left hand side, and a greyish, canvas type canopy rather than a metal structure on the back, roughly level with the top of the cabin. It was not a pantechnicon. The caravan, he said, was whitish in colour, with one wide red/orange stripe along both sides, seven to eight metres in length, with four wheels and dual axle. It was similar to the old Department of Main Roads caravans – an older style. He did not recall its having any rear windows. Its height was about the same as that of the truck. It was not a tall caravan. He was shown photographs of the caravan Mr Dee said he was towing that day. But the caravan Mr Hodkinson saw was a different style. Though its colour was similar, he thought Mr Dee’s looked purpose built. He said the one he saw was “more a production type caravan. A much more common sort of van”. The truck towing the caravan he saw was not like Mr Dee’s truck. 24 Mr Hodkinson agreed with Mr Seton that his evidence about the truck and caravan came mostly from his observations while travelling behind them, and at a considerable distance. He agreed that at the first trial he had said he could not dispute that Mrs Broughton had passed the truck and caravan without incident, and that having done that, she was faced with another truck and caravan pulling into the overtaking lane, causing her to take evasive action. He agreed he had said at the first trial when asked if the description of the caravan and truck he had given had possibly not been of the truck and caravan he had seen travelling three vehicles in front of him, and that there had been another truck and caravan which had caused Mrs Broughton to take evasive action. He had answered, “Look I just don’t know”. That, he said to me, had been a truthful answer. However in re-examination he gave this evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. When you saw the truck and caravan combination, very shortly after you observed the impact between the two cars, was that the same truck and caravan that had been travelling two cars in front of you as you had been travelling in the convoy before you got to Stoney Creek Bridge? 
       
      A. Yes, to my recollection.” 
       T86 
        
      
     25 He stopped his car briefly, before the point of impact. He estimated that between eight to ten other people had also stopped. One, a man, told him he knew first aid, and that the man in the white Datsun should have his head tilted back. Then he observed that the man’s head had been tilted back. He did not see who had done that. He found his experience stressful.Credit Of Mr Hodkinson26 I formed the view that Mr Hodkinson was a careful and attentive witness. He readily made concessions, such as that his memory for relevant events would have been better at the first trial, and that he had refreshed his memory for this trial by reading the evidence he had given at the first. I formed the view he was honest, and doing his best to be accurate.Evidence Of Mr Lear27 Mr Lear was travelling south with his eleven year old daughter. He found himself caught behind slow moving traffic. He recognized it as traffic associated with the then, soon to commence, Bega show. In front of him was a prime mover with a carnival ride on the back of it, followed by a truck and caravan, then a Toyota Land Cruiser, and finally a green Commodore. The vehicle slowing all the traffic down, he said, was the prime mover, which, he thought resembled the truck in Exhibit J. (Mr Bell’s truck.) When he observed that, it was the focus of his attention, and he was unconcerned with what was further up the road, although he saw no other vehicles travelling immediately in front of it. The truck behind that, he described as like a “pantech …[of a similar size and length to a pantech] … and it was towing a white creamy caravan … fairly long … dual axle.” The truck towing that caravan, he said, had a metal box on the back. The cabin was creamy white in colour. He did not recall a vertical exhaust. As to the caravan, it did not appear to have any rear windows. There was some writing on the back but he could not recall what it said. In cross examination he agreed he had later told Detective Senior Constable Fowler that the writing had been about 20 cm high and had said something like ‘majesty’ or ‘majestic’. He said the caravan had small turning indicator assemblies with tail lights combined in the assemblies, rectangular in shape (“smaller than the size of a tissue box”) and a small, black and white, number plate.28 After the vehicles in front of him had crossed Stoney Creek Bridge, they began to accelerate. At the point where the southbound lane became two, the Land Cruiser took the fast lane. Then the Commodore sped up. There was a gap of 50 to 100 metres between the Land Cruiser and the Commodore as the two vehicles went up the hill. The Land Cruiser disappeared from sight. As the Commodore went into the overtaking lane, he saw the right hand indicator on the caravan flashing. Then the truck and caravan pulled out into the overtaking lane in front of the Commodore. They blocked the Commodore’s path. The Commodore veered onto the opposite side of the road and collided with an oncoming car. Then the truck pulling the caravan accelerated past the prime mover and disappeared from his view.29 He drove for a short distance past the point of impact, found a place to park, and stopped for a few minutes to render assistance. Then he drove off again. When he reached the top of the hill he “noticed the prime mover and the truck and caravan parked on the side of the road.” They were side by side, the prime mover being the vehicle closer to the road. He saw two men standing at the front of the prime mover. He stopped his car and wrote down the registration number of the caravan parked there. He later provided the number to police. To me he said the truck towing the caravan had been “very similar” to Mr Dee’s. He told me the number plate from which he took the number had been old – black, on a white background, and with no state identification. He could not recall the number, but it had begun with an “0”. He could not recall whether the caravan had had an orange or red stripe down its side. T102 He was shown photographs of the caravan Mr Dee later told me he had been towing. He said that was not the caravan whose number he had written down. He could not recall its having two windows, and its indicators and tail light assemblies were much larger that on the one he had seen. Further, it did not have the “box” at the back. T100 Nor did it have three axles. The number plate seemed lower, and he could not recall the lights at the top. He could not recall the words: “Caution Long Load” on the rear. On the question of the identification of the truck and caravan and whether he had made an error of identification, in cross examination by Mr Maconachie he gave this evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. Because you had only seen one semitrailer and one caravan, you assumed, did you not, that they were the vehicles that you had seen further down the hill?? 
       
      A. I was fairly certain that they were the caravan and truck involved in the accident because they were similar and looked the same as the ones that were going up the hill. 
       
       
      Q. But I am putting it to you that when you saw the semitrailer you recognised that as being the semitrailer involved in the accident in the sense of being present at the time of the accident. Is that correct? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You saw a caravan and truck combination largely obscured by the trailer of the semitrailer and made the assumption that that was the caravan and truck combination that you had seen earlier. Will you agree with that proposition? 
       
      A. It was because the rear of the caravan I could see looked the same as the rear of the caravan that was going up the hill.” 
       T112 
      
    (It was put in closing addresses by Mr Seton that Mr Maconachie had never put to Mr Lear that he had been wrong in identifying the caravan at the top of the hill as the one being towed by the offending vehicle. But I am satisfied Mr Maconachie’s cross-examination, though it did not include a direct suggestion he had been wrong, did squarely raise the correctness of his identification evidence. Further, Mr Seton did not submit that by reason of Maconachie’s not having put squarely to Mr Lear he had made an error of identification, that it would not be open to me to find he had made such an error. Indeed, I took him, ultimately, to concede such a finding was open to me. Although he urged me not to make it.) 30 Another eye witness, Ms Grey, who said she had been a passenger in Mr Davis’ truck and that Mr Davis had been the driver of the offending vehicle, said that shortly before the accident Mr Davis had been engaging in a somewhat foolish manoeuvre, involving his driving a little onto the other side of the road as if to pass, then pulling back to where he had started from. However Mr Lear recalled nothing of any vehicle in front of him engaging in such a manoeuvre. He said however that from time to time, on the road leading up to Stoney Creek Bridge, vehicles in front of him would be lost from his view. Further, from his experience, someone hauling a caravan may perform such a manoeuvre to look up ahead. T348.45 31 Mr Lear was cross-examined extensively about the circumstances in which he had recorded the caravan’s number. He agreed that if at the time he observed the caravan at the top of the hill its number had been F34209, then he had not observed it accurately.Credit of Mr Lear32 Mr Lear impressed me as a man who took care. He made appropriate concessions, such as that mistakes of observation are made with the best will in the world, and trying as hard as one can. I conclude that Mr Lear was honest, and did his best to be accurate, but I shall return later to the issue of whether his recollection was in fact accurate.Evidence of April Lear33 Mr Lear’s daughter, April, gave evidence at the first trial. She was not called at the second. By consent of all parties, a transcript of her evidence was tendered. Exhibit N I was told when the transcript was tendered that no submissions would be made by any party about her veracity, although submissions would be made about her accuracy. To the limited extent that submissions were made about April Lear, they did only deal with her accuracy.34 She was eleven at the time of the accident, and had been travelling in the front of Mr Lear’s car. At the point where the overtaking lane commenced, she saw cars moving into the overtaking lane. Then she saw a caravan being towed by a truck, with its right hand indicator on. It was behind a large truck. As it was being overtaken by the car in front of her, the caravan began to move into the overtaking lane, causing the car to swerve to the opposite side of the road and hit an oncoming car. She and her father then stopped to help the victims. After a short time they continued on. As they got a bit further along she saw a caravan on the left side of the road. It looked the same to her as the one she saw “going to overtake the truck.” Her father did not stop, but he slowed down, remaining on the bitumen roadway. Her father asked her to write down its number. She did so, checking with him that she had recorded it properly. She was shown a photograph of the caravan Mr Dee said he was towing, but she said it did not look the same as the one on the side of the road. She referred to the ‘box’ on the back, and the rear windows, in that context. But she did not explain further. The caravan’s colour had been a bright one, she said, yellow or white. She said of its size: “It wasn’t a really short caravan, it probably was one of the normal ones”. She could not recall the colour of the number plate. In cross-examination she maintained she was ‘certain’ the caravan on the top of the hill was the one involved in the accident. She agreed that she had later discussed what had happened, with her father. She also agreed that most of the things she had been asked about she was not sure about. 35 I shall return later to consider the question of her accuracy. Evidence of Stacey Grey36 Ms Stacey Grey was, at the time of the collision, in a relationship with Mr Davis. She said they had been together since she was fifteen. They travelled around together, going from show to show. He had several games he carried on the truck. She helped him with his business. At the time of the accident they lived in a 27 foot caravan. It had stripes along both sides, with windows on both sides but not at the back. Mr Davis had a truck which was used to tow the caravan. He had no driving licence, but invariably drove the truck, including on the highway. According to her, on the day of the accident, they were either heading towards Bega or leaving Bega: she could not recall which. His sixteen year old employee, Brian, was in the truck with them, in the seat next to the passenger door. She knew Mr Bell. There came a point when they were travelling behind Mr Bell’s truck, with Mr Bell driving. It was then Mr Davis engaged in the foolish manoeuvre I have referred to earlier, when he acted as though he was about to pass by pulling out a little on the opposite side of the road, then pulling back in behind him. As she put it: “He was mucking around laughing like he was going to overtake, yes I am, no I’m not, yes I am, no I’m not.” As she said that, she moved her right hand backwards and forwards from left to right. At the time of that manoeuvre she saw a car behind them. It was a blue or grey Commodore, an older model.37 Then there came a time when Mr Davis pulled out to pass Mr Bell’s truck as they were going up a hill: “[T]he car behind us must have pulled out to overtake or look…to see if they could overtake and Dean’s quickly pulled back in and the collision occurred right beside the driver’s side window.” T128 She said Mr Davis did not use his indicator. She did not see a collision. But she heard a very loud noise. She and Mr Davis kept going up the hill. She asked him to stop so that she could see if anyone had been hurt. But he said: “No I can’t love. I’m on my Ls. The coppers will be down there.” T129.16 After travelling ten to fifteen kilometres they did eventually stop. While they were stopped he spent some time on his mobile telephone. She did not hear what he was saying. Then they changed course and drove to Canberra and stayed at the Canberra showground for several days, although there was no show on there at the time. They did not go to Sydney, although that is what Mr Davis said they did on 11th February. 38 Ms Grey did not give evidence at the first trial. Mr Seton made a vigorous attack on her credit. By the time of this trial she and Mr Davis had been apart for some years. Each had formed new relationships. She had had three children, including Jordan, her eldest, of whom Mr Davis was the father. Early in 2008 her youngest child died. Soon after, Mr Davis took proceedings to obtain custody of Jordan. She did not contest the application. An order for joint custody was made, with day to day care of Jordan resting with Mr Davis. He has had day to day care ever since. In the course of the custody proceedings Mr Davis and his de facto partner made some significant allegations against Ms Grey. There was also a period late last year when Ms Grey was only permitted access to Jordan if supervised. Mr Davis’ application for custody was served on Ms Grey at about the time she first gave a statement to insurers implicating Mr Davis in this case. Mr Seton put to her that she hated Mr Davis, having lost custody of her child to him, and had been motivated by revenge to give false evidence against him in this case, so he would be prosecuted for a serious offence, and be imprisoned, so she would thereby regain custody. She rejected those propositions. She did concede however that she had recently said to him: 
     
      
      “You’re fucked… and this is all going to come back on you and you’re going to end up in gaol.” 
       T281.40 
        
      
    Ms Grey’s Credit39 Ms Grey’s part in this case was highly significant. For reasons which appear below, the other witness who said Mr Davis was at the scene, Mr Bell, is a man whose credit was so impaired, I am reluctant to accept anything he told me for which there is no corroboration. And if I were to accept Mr Seton’s submissions about Ms Grey, that would involve my finding that she came to court and gave evidence about matters she did not witness, making her a perjurer, and someone who was attempting to pervert the course of justice. 40 In deciding what credit to give Ms Grey’s evidence, I accept Mr Seton’s submission that there were many unsatisfactory aspects of it. There were certainly matters which gave me pause: 
     
     (a) I have referred to her relationship with Mr Davis, her loss of day to day custody of their son and her providing a statement about his alleged part in this matter for the first time, at about the same time as documents were served on her for the purpose of a custody application by Mr Davis; 
      
      
     (b) There is her admission set out at the end of paragraph 38. I infer if he were found guilty of an offence arising from the collision, he may receive a sentence of imprisonment, and that that was her opinion when she made that statement;  
     
     
     (c) While giving her evidence, Ms Grey was not good at recalling peripheral matters about the accident. For example:  
      
       
        she said she did not know which direction they had been travelling in at the time ; 
        
        she did not recall leaving a showground before the accident; 
        
        she did not recall whether at the time of the accident they had been on their way to or from Bega, or whether they had recently been to Nowra; 
        
        despite her evidence in [36]-[37] above, in the course of cross-examination she said she had no idea what had caused the accident 
        T215.36 
        or whether there had been one 
        T221.47 
       ;  
        
        she said she did not recall an overtaking lane at the scene where she heard the crash, saying she was  
       “95% sure” 
        the accident had not occurred in an overtaking lane 
        T150.48 
       ;  
        
        she told me she did not see the other vehicle (i.e. the oncoming vehicle) before the accident. 
        
       
      
    Yet, as Mr Seton noted, some things she seemed to recall well. For example, she said Mr Davis had not been using his mobile phone at the time of the accident. T144.46 This was the evidence: 
     
      
        
       
        
        “Q. And as he was driving along on this day of the accident, was he using the mobile phone? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         T144.35 
          
         
         
        Q. And did you see him using the mobile phone while the truck was proceeding down the highway? 
         
        A. No. 
         T144.39 
          
         
         
        Q. But was he using the mobile phone as he was driving along? 
         
        A. To my recollection he was on the phone when we pulled over. He could have been but I, too, I was in shock myself directly after the accident, so I couldn't be positive. 
         T144.44 
          
         
         
        Q. Well I'm actually interested in the circumstances before the accident. Do you recall whether or not Dean was on the mobile phone before the accident? 
        
        
        A. No, he wasn't.” 
         T144.49 
          
        
       
      
    That, as Mr Seton pointed out, seemed an odd thing to recall, given all the things she could not recall. She was also adamant in an assertion that he had not had his indicator light on when passing Mr Bell. That is also an odd thing to recall, considering the things she did not recall. 
     
      
     (d) Although Mr Seton asked Mr Lear, Mrs Broughton, Mr Dee and Mr Bell, none recalled any conduct of the kind Ms Grey said Mr Davis had engaged in when pretending to pass Mr Bell, then moving back behind him. 
      
      
     (e) There were troubling aspects of her evidence about how well she could see Mr Bell while Mr Davis was playing the overtaking game. For example, she said she could see that Mr Bell was getting agitated, and had his head out of the vehicle window to see what Mr Davis was doing 
      T149.16 
     ; this, she then corrected, to say,  
     “Well, turning around, looking to see what he [Mr Davis] was doing.” 
      T149.20 
      She said at one stage she could see him shaking his head in apparent dismay. 
      T210.33;212.23 
      She said Mr Davis had engaged in the manoeuvre fifteen or twenty times for ten to fifteen minutes. 
      T150.21 
       
      
      
     (f) (i) She gave, at times, unresponsive answers, in such a way as to take the opportunity to be critical of Mr Davis. For example, she said (unresponsively) she knew he had given at least three different stories. 
      T115.19 
      As Mr Seton put to me, there was no evidence before me he had given three different stories. When asked whether she had been living with him in 2002, instead of saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’, she said she would  
     “be stuck with Dean for a week before I could get out of the caravan. I had black eyes every week.” 
      T218.30 
       
      
      
      (ii) Mr Seton submitted Ms Grey could be mischievous and not easily intimidated. As an illustration he relied on the following exchange in cross-examination: 
       
        
        “Q. This vehicle that you say you saw the glimpse of, you said you thought it was a Commodore, but you agreed, I think, on the first day you gave evidence that you couldn’t be positive about it, it might have been another kind of car. Is that right? 
         
        A. That’s right. Are you having fun? 
         
         
        Q. Beg pardon? 
         
        A. Are you having fun?” 
         T292.35-38 
          
        
       
      
      
      (iii) Mr Seton submitted her apparent characteristics of mischievousness and lack of a sense of intimidation, threw doubt on any suggestions she was or may have been intimidated by Mr Davis in the past, accounting for why she had made no earlier statement to investigators or police about Mr Davis’ involvement in the collision.  
       
        
       
      (iv) Mr Seton referred me in further support of that submission, to evidence showing that on one occasion in the past she had been convicted of disobeying an apprehended violence order.  
      
     
     
      
      (v) However, while I accept Ms Grey could not be described as a shrinking violet, I am perfectly satisfied she could have been intimidated by Mr Davis. She began her relationship with him when she was only fifteen. At the time of the accident she was aged nineteen. While they were together, as he conceded, he was physically violent to her. He has a number of convictions for violence on others. I shall say more about him later, but having seen him give evidence over an extensive period, I can readily imagine someone living with him finding him extremely intimidating.  
      
     
     
     (g) (i) Mr Seton drew my attention to Ms Grey’s evidence that after the accident she had seen Mr Bell’s vehicle stop. 
      T220.5 
      That, he put to me, was something I would find difficult to accept occurred, if Mr Davis passed his truck when the accident occurred and kept going, not stopping for ten to fifteen kilometres. The inference was that someone else must have told her that Mr Bell had stopped his truck on the top of the hill. Ms Grey did tell me she had spoken to Mr Bell’s brother, Elwin Bell Junior, some years ago, when he told her:  
     “Dean was trying to blame it on Owen.” 
      T137.34 
      She said this contact came about when she rang him after receiving an anonymous call asking her about the accident. She said she asked Mr Elwin Bell Junior if Mr Dee “had had to go to court or something.” 
      T180 
      I infer it would have been possible for her to have received information from at least that source, sufficient to enable her to come to court to give false evidence. Further, she followed the show circuit around for some months after the accident, too, so may have had opportunities to discuss the accident with other Bell family members; 
      
      
      (ii) Mr Bell’s evidence to me (supported by others, such as Mr Lear and his daughter) was that his truck was parked on the side of the road some 500 to 1000 metres to the south of the accident site. So I agree with Mr Seton that it is hard to see how, if Mr Davis had kept going after the accident, he could have passed the truck so far ahead.  
      
      
      (iii) Ms Grey’s evidence on the issue 
      T219-220 
      was this: 
      
       
        
        “Q. After Dean's truck pulled back in behind Owen's semitrailer and you then heard the impact you say, do you, that your truck travelled on for some distance and then pulled up by the side of the road? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. How far approximately do you say that Dean drove on before he pulled over? 
         
        A. I think he drove for about another 10 to 15 minutes before he pulled over. 
         
         
        Q. When you pulled over was Owen Bell still in front of you? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. What happened to Owen Bell, or his truck, do you remember? 
         
        A. We passed him. He was parked on the side of the road. 
         
         
        Q. So you, as you sit there now you can recall, can you, passing Owen Bell's truck parked by the side of the road after the accident? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. So I take it therefore that after the impact your truck, Dean's truck, continued to travel behind the semitrailer, did it, until the semitrailer had pulled over and parked so that you could see the semitrailer having parked as you passed it? 
         
        A. Immediately after the accident? 
         
         
        Q. It doesn't matter when but the semitrailer and Dean's truck continued along the road after the accident, is that right? 
         
        A. Dean continued, immediately after the accident,  
        immediately after I heard the noise Owen pulled over. 
         
         
        Q. And you saw him stop? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And you're able to say that because you recall Dean's truck passing the semitrailer stopped by the side of the road, is that your evidence? 
         
        A. Yes, I can - passing Owen, yes. 
         
         
        Q. You remember passing Owen's truck which was stopped by the side of the road, is that correct? 
         
        A. I can remember passing Owen, yes, I'm pretty sure it was his truck or could've been his Dad's or one of his brothers or something, yes. 
         
         
        Q. As you passed that truck, whether it was Owen's or Owen's father's truck it was stopped on the side of the road, is that correct? 
        
       
      A. Yes.” 
      
      (iv) Although he did not say so, it is possible Mr Bell, immediately after the accident, stopped briefly, or at least drove so slowly that he may have appeared to have stopped. He was driving a semitrailer which had the effect of slowing down other traffic. It is to be recalled that when Mr Hodkinson saw the offending vehicle at the scene of the collision, he thought it might have stopped, although on no account by any other witness was it, in fact, stopped. So an error of that kind by Ms Grey would not necessarily be surprising, especially given the event I conclude must have been a shock for her if she was there. But as the above exchange shows, in the end Ms Grey was not even sure it was Mr Bell’s truck she had seen ( 
     “Could’ve been his Dad’s or one of his brothers or something, yes.” 
     ) There is another possibility, viz that the vehicle she saw parked and remembered passing was Mr Dee’s. That was owned by Mr Owen Bell’s father, Mr E Bell (“Could’ve been his Dad’s”). That is consistent with evidence of Mr Dee and Mr Bell that Mr Dee was well ahead of Mr Bell, and of evidence of Mr Dee that he had reached the top of the hill for at least a minute before Mr Bell reached him. It is also consistent with evidence I shall come to later, that of Mr Dee, that when he was waiting at the top of the hill he heard, then saw, a truck pulling a caravan, fly past him, heading south. Ms Grey did however say later she did not see Mr Dee 
      T152.1 
     , but that is not inconsistent with her seeing his truck and identifying it as Mr Bell’s or Mr Bell’s father’s. It is of course to be noted however that she agreed the truck passed had been a semitrailer, whereas Mr Dee’s truck was not a semitrailer. I conclude that if she was there, honest error may have accounted for Ms Grey’s evidence about passing Mr Bell. 
    41 Mr Seton put to me other discrepancies and apparent contradictions in her evidence: 
     
      
      (a) She said an investigator had told her ‘approximately the year’ and ‘about that time of year’ of the accident 
       T179.26 
      , whereas she later said it had been ‘youse’ (meaning Mr Stitt) who had told her the date of the accident. However I do not see the two as inconsistent, given the early references seem not to have been specific. 
       
       
      (b) She told me she had last discussed the accident with Mr Davis ‘last week’, i.e., the week before the trial began 
       T136.37 
      , whereas on the following day, she conceded she had spoken to him on the first day of the trial. However she told me the conversation on the first day of the trial had not been about the trial, but had been an attempt to talk to her son on the telephone. I do not see that as contradictory.  
      
     
     
      
      (c) Although she claimed things had ‘got better’ with Mr Davis after May 2003, when they separated, she asked police to help her by taking out an AVO. However it is not unusual for parents to have an improved relationship after separation, yet for there to be inflammatory episodes, such as when one of them acquires a new partner. Events such as these can lead to heated exchanges between parents, leading to applications for apprehended violence orders. So I do not see the apparent contradiction as carrying great weight. 
      
     
     
      
      (d) Mr Seton queried why neither Senior Constable Milton, nor Mr Lear had seen Mr Davis’ truck parked by the side of the road. But Ms Grey said they did not stop for ten to fifteen kilometres. There was no reason for Senior Constable Milton to have noticed the truck as he sped towards the accident site. Since the turn off to the Monaro Highway is just after the accident site and Ms Grey said that at one point they turned off, and Ms Grey was not specific about roads, it is possible Mr Davis, if Ms Grey was telling the truth, had turned off onto that road. Thus Mr Lear would not have passed him. Even if Mr Davis did not take that road, other roads in the area are connected with the Monaro Highway. Mr Davis may have turned off onto one of those. 
      
     
     
      
      (e) When Ms Grey was shown a photograph of Mr Bell’s semitrailer she agreed it showed the trailer part of his vehicle but denied the ride shown in the photograph was the ride he carried on the day of the accident. Mr Bell said that was the ride he carried that day. As will appear, I have difficulty with Mr Bell’s credibility. Mr Seton said one of them must be lying on this issue. But I think it conceivable Ms Grey was in error. It is a long time since the relevant events.  
      
    42 Mr Seton drew my attention to other matters which did not reflect well on her. For example, she admitted to having used illicit drugs. Further, she had been convicted of failing to abide by an apprehended violence order.43 I have considered carefully the extensive and helpful submissions Mr Seton made about Ms Grey’s credit. My overall impression of Ms Grey however was that she was a compelling and truthful witness. She made concessions readily, such as that she might not have been observant about the stripes on the sides of Mr Davis’ caravan. She conceded to Mr Seton that the caravan might have had two tyres on the back, although her best recollection was that there had been none – just a bar. When apparently unsure of something, she would ask for a question to be repeated. It is to be recalled too that until interviewed by an investigator in early 2008 she had never been interviewed about the accident. By then seven years had gone by. It would not be surprising if her evidence contained some apparent contradictions or lacked precision.44 Although it is true that her statement to an investigator implicating Mr Davis was given at about the time she was first involved in custody proceedings with Mr Davis, there is no evidence any investigator had ever previously visited her to get a statement. The evidence is that the police never spoke to her about the accident. That is not to say people have not tried to speak to her over the years. She said she had received a number of phone calls from people wanting to talk to her about the accident. But this appears to have been the first time anyone ever took the trouble to visit her to request a statement. Further, she told me this was the first time she learned people had been seriously injured: “When the private investigator first came round, I gathered that people must have been injured for it to be still going on and coming to me.”  T288.34 There is no evidence she actually came forward to speak to police or insurance investigators about Mr Davis’ involvement, or that she initiated the interview with the investigator.45 From evidence given by Mr Fowler, to which I shall refer in more detail later, it appears that having spoken to Mr Davis in 2002 in Canberra, police decided not to pursue him, and were satisfied with the alibi he gave them. That, I infer, would explain why they did not speak to Ms Grey. The visit from the investigator in May 2008, which co-incided with the custody issue, also occurred within days after the Court of Appeal had ordered a new trial. It is not surprising the Court of Appeal’s order prompted the insurer for the Dee/Bell interests to make renewed (or perhaps new) efforts to find and speak to her. There was evidence that insurer’s solicitors instructed loss assessors to go to see her at that time. There was no evidence they or any others had been to see her or had sent others to see her before the first trial.46 On the important issue of the motive to lie, it is to be recalled that when the custody proceedings began, Ms Grey had recently lost a child. She was asked in cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “And you must have been very, very disappointed when you learnt that [Mr Davis] was applying for custody of Jordan?” 
        
       
      
      She replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “No, I wasn’t because everything that he said was based on lies and there was plenty that I could’ve thrown back at him. I was just mourning for about six months so I just, yeah.”  
         T239.46-48 
          
        
       
      
     She said further: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I haven’t made an effort to get Jordan back in the last 12 months considering what’s been going on in my house and my life.”  
         T290.31 
         
        
       
      
    Ms Grey told me, and I accept, that until that time Mr Davis had shown little interest in his son, and a positive side of his custody application was that it showed her he was interested in him. She did concede that his application had shaken and upset her and that she still wanted Jordan to live with her. 47 I formed the distinct impression from observing Ms Grey give her evidence over several days, that she did not wish to be involved in giving evidence. At one stage she said, “I wish I wasn’t even here.” Although that was an answer in cross-examination, that was my impression of her from the time she first began giving evidence. 48 It is of course not at all uncommon for men and women to do terrible things to people they purport to love, but when Mr Seton put to Ms Grey that she had been driven by enmity to give evidence against Mr Davis she said, “I still love the bloke…I feel sorry for the life he’s had…We have a child together. I could never be back with the man, but I still love him to a certain extent, yes.”  T287.12 That, to me, had the ring of truth.49 I was troubled by occasions when in cross-examination she said she was not convinced Mr Davis had in fact caused the accident. For example she said: “After thinking about it, I don’t think he actually caused the accident; if he wasn’t there and on the road it wouldn’t have happened; but after thinking about it, the car behind us was being impatient and shouldn’t have pulled out either, at the same time.” T291.44 However, when contemplating the significance of what she had told the investigator, and then what she told me, it would not be surprising, given her previous closeness to Mr Davis, if she had such thoughts. 50 Although these things can be feigned, there were moments in her evidence when what she said and the way she said it had all the appearance of spontaneity and truth. For example, when she was cross-examined to the effect she had first heard of the accident in February 2002 she said: 
     
      
        
      “No, that was not what I – I thought an accident had occurred when Dean— 
       
      Q. When it happened?  
       
      A. Yes, I wasn’t positive but from the noise, yes, an accident did occur, yes.” 
        
       T219.22 
       
      
    There was also this evidence:  
     
      
      “I was pretty much in shock really. I didn’t know what – yeah, I just couldn’t get that noise out of my head.”  
       T222 
       
      
    Those statements, to me had the ring of truth.51 It is true no-one other than Ms Grey gave any evidence about Mr Davis’ engaging in the overtaking game. But it is possible that from the perspective of a passenger in the vehicle, the manoeuvre may have been far more obvious, especially if (as Ms Grey said occurred) accompanied by sound effects such as loud laughter from Mr Davis. That may be, too, I infer, why she said it would have been obvious to trucks behind when it may not in fact have been obvious. Further, it may have been that from the perspective of other drivers, the manoeuvre would have been seen as no more than an attempt to see what vehicles were coming from the opposite direction. For example, Mrs Broughton acknowledged she would not have recalled such an unremarkable manoeuvre. (This evidence came up after Mr Hodkinson and Mr Lear had given their evidence. Mr Lear was recalled for further cross-examination on that issue after it arose. Mr Hodkinson was not recalled. But it was not submitted the failure to recall him had any significance.) Evidence Of Christine Broughton52 On 10 and 11 February 2001 Mrs Broughton, with her children, stayed with friends in Narooma. On the afternoon of 11 February she and her children left Narooma to return to their home in Merimbula. She was driving a dark green Commodore, registered number WMD 973. She came up to a group of vehicles consisting of sideshow trucks. At a point near Bega, her side of the road became two, with an overtaking lane on the outside. (I infer this was on the Bega side of Stoney Creek Bridge.) She had not been paying close attention to the vehicles in the convoy in front of her. She overtook a semitrailer, then had to pass a small truck towing a caravan. A semi was in front of the small truck. (At the first trial she had said the vehicle combination she had overtaken had been a truck towing a caravan.) She said that once across Stoney Creek Bridge she found there were three trucks towing caravans. She passed one of those combinations, but it was the next, or second, combination, which pulled out in front of her. Asked whether she had seen it before Stoney Creek Bridge she said: “Not that I took any notice of, no.” T258.253 She moved into the overtaking lane and drove up the hill, following another car. As she did so she saw “a small truck towing a caravan” T263 come across from her left. The manoeuvre forced her onto the other side of the road, where her car collided with Mr Veigel’s car. She did not see indicators on on the caravan. She recalled that the caravan did not have a rear window. But she recalled it had a bar across the back. She recalled nothing written on the back. She recalled that the caravan had been all white. She saw no stripes on the side. She recalled no windows on the side. Shown exhibit ‘L’, (Mr Dee’s caravan), she said that it did not resemble the caravan. Nor did the truck in Exhibit ‘K’ (Mr Dee’s truck) resemble the truck towing the caravan.54 Mrs Broughton’s statement to police became an exhibit, as did transcripts of part of the evidence she gave at the first trial. There was general consistency between her evidence at both trials and in her statement. In her statement she spoke of having seen “a lot of trucks towing caravans [at Cobargo]. They looked like trucks and caravans that you see at shows and carnivals.” Further, according to her statement, at one stage after leaving Cobargo and before the accident scene there were, ahead of her, in her estimate, about five trucks towing caravans. 55 Mrs Broughton was in court when Ms Grey gave her evidence. She recalled seeing no manoeuvre by any truck and caravan combination of the type Ms Grey said Mr Davis had engaged in: “I can’t recall prior seeing it pulling in and out mainly concentrating on the blue Ford that was in front of me because we kept on slowing down, speeding up, slowing down, so I was watching it, concentrating on it.”  T272.5 But in any event, she conceded, in her experience as a driver she had noticed when in a slow line of traffic that vehicles do pull out to a point where the driver can see past a slow vehicle to see whether it is safe to pass and she would not have taken any interest had that manoeuvre occurred that day, and she would not have remembered it eight years later.Mrs Broughton’s Credit56 It is to be recalled that Mrs Broughton was injured, as were her children, in an accident which occurred over eight years ago. As the Court of Appeal found over a year ago, she was not in any way responsible for the accident. Mrs Broughton has not received any compensation. This dispute was essentially between two insurance companies and an entity financed in large part by insurers. So she could not be blamed if (as she appeared to be, at times) a little impatient with the litigation system. However, I had the clear impression she gave her evidence carefully and honestly. She conceded her recollection at the first trial would have been better than it was before me. There were some variations between the three versions of the accident she had given. That, I thought, was entirely consistent with the passing of so much time since the accident and the number of times she has had to tell the story about what, I consider, must have been a most frightening event for her, given especially that her children were with her in her car and she had been forced into the path of an oncoming car.Evidence of Jamie Gary Dee57 Mr Dee used to work for the Bell family. At the time of trial he had not worked with them for six or seven years. In 2001 he was working for them. (I was told he attended court in response to a subpoena.) He was at the Nowra Show in February 2001. He left the showground to go to Bega, driving Mr Owen Bell’s truck, and towing his caravan. On the way, he stopped to check the tyres on his vehicles. So did Mr Bell, who was travelling in a semi trailer behind him. 58 Mr Dee gave evidence that he recognized the vehicle in Exhibit ‘J’ as the one, with the same load, that Mr Bell drove that day, and said the truck and caravan in Exhibit ‘K’ were the truck and caravan he drove that day. Both were in the condition in those photographs in which they were on the day of the accident. The equipment shown on the back of the truck in Exhibit ‘K’ was the equipment he was carrying that day. As at the day of the accident he had driven that truck and towed that caravan for between four and five years. He did not recall any relevant registration numbers. 59 He recalled the accident in February 2001. At the time, Mr Bell had been travelling behind him. Mr Dee drove over Stoney Creek Bridge and then up a hill. At that time he had no visual contact with Mr Bell. Then Mr Bell called him on the CB radio and said, “I think my car’s been in an accident.” Mr Dee pulled up on the left hand side, at the top of the hill. After a while, Mr Bell arrived and stopped, got out, and spoke to him. They and Mr Bell’s then girlfriend then ran down the hill to the accident scene. When there, Mr Dee climbed into an injured man’s car and talked to him. (This, I infer, was Mr Veigel.) Later, VRA personnel arrived. Fifteen minutes or so after that, they left, returned to their vehicles, and drove to the Bega showground, where he stayed and worked for five days while the Bega show was on.60 As Mr Dee sat in his truck at the top of the hill waiting for Mr Bell to arrive, he saw a small white truck towing a caravan drive past him in a southerly direction. He heard it first. Then he saw it. Its speed was eighty to ninety kilometres per hour, or perhaps a little slower. Though he knew Mr Davis and his girlfriend, and the fact that they lived in a caravan, and had a truck, he was unable to say whether the truck and caravan were Mr Davis’. 61 Mr Dee maintained that he always travelled ahead of Mr Bell between half a kilometre and a kilometre distant, though usually they had visual contact. Sometimes he would stop to let Mr Bell catch up. 62 When stopping at the top of the hill he pulled over to the left to ensure Mr Bell could park his semi alongside his vehicle. He could not recall if he and Mr Bell had stood together talking in front of the trucks before going down the hill. Nor could he recall a police car coming from the south at any such time.63 Mr Dee denied when it was suggested to him that Mr Bell had suggested he, Mr Dee, had caused the accident. Mr Dee did not recall any car stopping at the rear of the semi, or seeing people appearing to write something, while there. He recalled no vehicles passing him in the overtaking lane on his way up the hill. He denied having any knowledge before returning to the accident scene, that someone had written down the registration number of the caravan. 64 Mr Seton contended that Mr Dee had been the driver of the offending vehicle. Mr Dee’s credit was the subject of an understandably intensive attack. In the course of the attack (in which Mr Seton was not the only attacker) a matter explored was whether after the accident Mr Dee had taken away the caravan and put its number plate on a different caravan. Given the evidence of Mr Lear and his daughter, and the evidence from most eye witnesses that the caravan in Exhibit K was not the one towed by the offending driver, such an exploration was understandable. It is important to set out in detail some of Mr Dee’s evidence on that issue:

      Q. Was it the case that the caravan that you were pulling had some writing on the back? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Did the writing start with an ""M""? 
       
      A. I don't think so, I can't remember. 
       
       
      Q. It had a word like ""majesty"" or ""majestic"" on the back? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Well six months later after this accident, you were up at Mt Isa, weren't you? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You were spoken to by the police, weren't you? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. About this accident, yes? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. That was the first time you had been spoken to by the police about this accident, wasn't it? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You understood, didn't you, that they were investigating who was responsible for this accident? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. It was your understanding, wasn't it, that there had been a very serious injury or injuries suffered by the occupants of the car? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. In short, it had been a serious accident, hadn't it? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. I suppose you were keen to assist the police as best you could, is that right? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. With any information you could provide them so as to ascertain who was responsible for the accident? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. When you were interviewed, you were asked, weren't you, for a description of the caravan that you say you were towing? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You were asked by the police if you[r?] caravan that you were towing on the day of the accident had any windows in its rear, weren't you? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You told the police that the caravan had no windows in its rear, didn't you? 
       
      A. Yes, I did, but that was [an?]honest mistake. 
       
       
      Q. Well step by step you agree, don't you, that that was what you told the police, that it had no windows in the rear? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Prior to you telling them that, do you accept that they had asked you several other questions about the description of the caravan? 
       
      A. Possibly, yes. 
       
       
      Q. They, I suggest, asked you about the colour [of?] the van? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. They asked you if there was anything in particular about the back of the caravan? 
       
      A. I can't remember. 
       
       
      Q. I suggest that they asked you, for example, how long the caravan was? 
       
      A. Possibly. 
       
       
      Q. They asked you how many axles the caravan had, didn't they? 
       
      A. Possibly. 
       
       
      Q. They asked you what colour it was? 
       
      A. A possibility, yes. 
       
       
      Q. I am reading from page 969 of a [the?] blue book, and I would read out the questions. I suggest this question was put to you, page 969, point E, question 74 of the record of interview: 
       
       
      ""Q. Can you just describe the caravan to me, you said it's approximately maybe 25, 26 foot long"" 
       
       
      Like, you accept what I'm reading out is accurately recorded in the record of interview. 
       
       
      ""A. Yep. 
       
       
      Q. How many axles? 
       
      A. Yeah, it has three. 
       
       
      Q. What colour? 
       
      A. It's white. 
       
       
      Q. Any stripes? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Out the front of the caravan is there anything particular about it, like is there anything stored on it, do you know what I mean? 
       
      A. It has two gas bottles at the front, it normally has a clothesline that sits at the front side of the gas bottles. 
       
       
      Q. Okay, what about the rear of the truck, is there anything in particular about the back of the truck? 
       
      A. No, it only carries, it's sort of normal, it only has a ticket box on the back of the truck. 
       
       
      Q. What's a ticket box? 
       
      A. For the actual kids' ride. 
       
       
      Q. Okay, is it on the back of the caravan?: 
       
      A. No, it's on the back of the truck. 
       
       
      Q. On the back of the truck, all right? 
       
      A. Yes"". 
       
       
      Over the page, question 84: 
       
       
      ""Q. What about the caravan, is there anything particular about the back of the caravan, does it have like anything attached to the back of it, like any boxes or anything like that"". 
       
       
      If I could just stop there. By that point in time it was obvious to you, wasn't it, that the police were wanting to know what your caravan looked like because they were trying to work out whether the caravan you were pulling was or wasn't involved in the accident? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. And they were being quite particular, weren't they, about [the?] description of the truck and caravan? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You knew, didn't you, it was important to be as accurate as possible in giving these particulars of description? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. In answer to the question I just read which was 84, you said: 
       
       
      ""A. No, no we don't have anything attached to it. 
       
       
      ""Q. Okay, what about windows, is there a window at the front of the caravan? 
       
      A. No, there's not. 
       
       
      Q. What about the back? 
       
      A. No"". 
       
       
      Firstly, you accept today, don't you, that that was wrong? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You say that was a wrong answer, do you? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. The caravan later on that day was photographed, wasn't it, by the police? 
       
      A. I think so, yes. 
       
       
      Q. Was it the situation that you were not expecting to be interviewed on this day? 
       
      A. I didn't even know the police were coming to interview us. 
       
       
      Q. Even today you have no trouble telling his Honour, do you, that the caravan had two windows at the rear, one above the other? 
       
      A. That's correct. 
       
       
      Q. Are you able to explain if it was wrong how you got that so wrong when you answered the question at Mt Isa? 
       
      A. An honest mistake. 
       
       
      Q. Was it, in fact, the truth Mr Dee, that the caravan you were towing that day in fact did not have any windows? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. On the rear? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Was it the case that the caravan you were towing that day had a black and white number plate? 
       
      A. I'm not sure, but it had windows at the back of the caravan. 
       
       
      Q. Did you and Mr Bell at the top of the hill, before you went back down the hill, have a discussion about what had caused the accident? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Did you have any discussion at all about what you should or shouldn't say about the accident if you were asked by anyone? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. And you've never had such a discussion with Mr Bell since that time when you got out of the truck? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Question 138, page 976 of the volume, Mr Dee you were asked these questions and answers: 
       
       
      ""Q. Okay, did the police advise you how the accident was caused? 
       
      A. Well nobody sort of said anything to me, not even after the fellow was taken away. 
       
       
      Q. Yes. 
       
      A. They didn't say anything about the accident at all. 
       
       
      Q. Since that time have you found out how the accident was caused? 
       
      A. No, I haven't heard anything at all"". 
       
       
      Was that the truth? 
       
      A. That's correct. 
       
       
      Q. This record of interview took place in August 2001, so six months approximately after the accident, you say that by that time that was the state of knowledge that you had about this accident, namely you'd found out nothing about what had caused the accident? 
       
      A. That's correct. 
       
       
      Q. And that remains, does it, your state of knowledge about this accident? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Question 141, you were then asked: 
       
       
      ""Q. Okay, all right, a witness to the accident has said that a truck and a caravan pulled out into the overtaking lane which forced the lady's car onto the incorrect side of the road. Did you see that happen at all? 
       
      A. No, I didn't see any of that happen"". 
       
       
      Over the page, question 142: 
       
       
      ""Q. Have you heard that story before 
       
      A. No, I haven't heard no stories or anything"". 
       
       
      You say that was the truth that you gave to the police? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. And that remains, does it, the case? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. That you have heard no stories or anything in relation to how the accident happened? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Question 145, you were asked this, ""No one's told you that a truck and caravan was involved in the accident"" and you answered, ""No, nobody told me""? 
       
      A. That's correct. 
       
       
      Q. You stand by that answer, do you, that you gave the Mt Isa Police? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Mr Dee, can I take it that you understood that the police were trying to ascertain the identity of the truck and the driver that had caused this serious accident? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. And you would have given them whatever information that you thought might have helped them to answer either of those two questions, namely the identity of the truck or the identity of the driver, is that correct? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You agree that you were unable to give them any information at all? 
       
      A. Yes.” 
      
    65 Mr Dee said he had noticed that the Bell group vehicles were registered in Victoria. He thought some of the number plates on the vehicles had been black and white, and some green and white: the trucks and caravans had always had number plates.66 He was asked about how long he had spent at the accident site. He thought it had been twenty to twenty five minutes. He agreed he and Mr Bell might have stood at the front of the trucks on their return, and that a police car with sirens on might have passed them while they stood there.67 Mr Dee said the registration number on the caravan as shown in Exhibit L was the same as was on it on the day, and that had police come to the Bega showground over the next five days, that caravan with that number plate would have been there for them to see. However he had no recollection of having seen police at the showground either the day of the accident or at all over the next several days.68 He denied he had been travelling behind Mr Bell, rather than in front. He denied having pulled out and overtaken Mr Bell’s vehicle. 69 As will appear when I come to consider Mr Bell’s evidence, Mr Bell says the accident occurred when Mr Davis, who was driving a truck towing a caravan, passed his semi. He originally told police only that he had seen a small truck towing a caravan going up the hill after the accident, without mentioning Mr Davis’ involvement. His description of the vehicle was in some respects similar to the one Mr Dee gave police and to me. Thus the possibility Mr Dee and Mr Bell had got their heads together to give false information to police to throw suspicion onto someone else, and take it away from Mr Dee, was a matter Mr Seton and other counsel continued to explore in depth. The following evidence T393-394 was given in cross-examination concerning the van Mr Dee said he had seen go past while he was up on the top of the hill: 
     
      
      “Q. You told the police at Mount Isa, didn't you, in relation to the van - were asked this question, 202, blue page 984, you were being asked about this truck and caravan that passed you. You were asked, was it from Bells Amusements, you said, ""No"", that's question 201. Then 202: 
       
       
      ""Q. Did it look like something that had come from another show? Was it another show van or just a person travelling? 
       
      A. Well, I'm not quite sure, I think it might have been personal, I just seen it that quick it just flew past"". 
       
       
      When you said, ""I think it might have been personal"", did you mean by that, that you thought it was not a show van? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. I asked you, ""Was it another show van or just a person travelling?"", when you said, ""I think it might have been personal"", you meant by that, didn't you, it was not a show van, it seemed to you to be just a person travelling? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You were then asked this, 203: 
       
       
      ""Q. Okay, all right. 
       
      A. There was a lot of people travelling the roads, you got all horse people and everything. 
       
       
      Q. And prior to that truck and caravan going past, did you see any other cars go past? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Your car? 
       
      A. No"". 
       
       
      Your memory of these events, Mr Dee, would be much better in August of 2001, than it is today? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. From those answers and questions, it would certainly appear, wouldn't it, that in August 01, you were saying that, apart from the truck and van, no other vehicles had passed you? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Whereas today you say, do you, that other vehicles, in addition to the truck and van, did pass you? 
       
      A. No, I don't think so. I can't remember any one passing me.” 
       
       
      
    70 Mr Stitt drew Mr Dee’s attention to an apparent difference in the quality of the lettering of the words ‘Caution Long Load” in the photographs at pages 1043 and 1044 of Exhibit L as compared with the one at 1038 of Exhibit L. It was suggested to him that the three photographs were not all of the same caravan. He maintained they were, and that the writing had faded when the one at 1038 had been taken.71 As will later appear, Mr Bell has made various claims over the years of having told other people at about the time of the accident that he had seen Mr Davis at the scene of the accident. One of the claims he made, (at the first trial) was that as he and his girlfriend and Mr Dee walked back up the hill after visiting the accident scene, he told his girlfriend and Mr Dee of Mr Davis’ involvement. Mr Dee told me however that Mr Bell never told him that day that he had seen Mr Davis there that day.72 Evidence from Messrs Owen and Elwin Bell was that the registration plate on the caravan at the time was as shown in Exhibit L. There it appears to be green or blue on white. Mr Dee agreed that if the caravan on the day had had a black and white number plate attached, and if, six months later, it had a plate of a different colour, plates must have been changed. But he denied having changed them or of having seen them changed.73 As will later appear, within days of the accident’s occurrence, police began receiving anonymous telephone calls suggesting they investigate the involvement of Mr Davis in the collision. Mr Dee denied he had made any such anonymous telephone calls. And he denied any knowledge of who had made them. 74 Mr Dee denied any proposition that he had been the cause of, or involved in, the collision. He denied having been a party to any arrangement to cover up any such involvement. Credit of Mr Dee75 I found Mr Dee to be an impressive, straightforward, witness. He readily made concessions. He told me of having stopped to check the loads and tyres after leaving Nowra. He conceded later he had based that evidence on practice rather than recollection. He conceded his recollection would have been better in 2001 as to what Mr Bell’s caravan looked like, than at the time of trial. He seemed to me to pay close attention to questions. He conceded there were things he might have forgotten. 76 He is obviously a man who when working for the Bell family, was close to and friendly with, Mr Owen Bell. So it could be a plausible scenario that if there were some sort of cover up, he and Mr Bell had been parties to it. There were matters in his evidence which caused me concern, such as: (a) He originally said he thought the caravan had a black and white number plate on the day but later said it might have been green and white.  T341.1;T453.24(b) He initially said Mr Bell had “sort of” pulled up behind him on the top of the hill T356.50 whereas he later said he had pulled up beside him. T370.21(c) There were differences in his evidence at the two trials as to whether he had been getting out of his truck or had been out, when the small truck and caravan had passed him. T387.34;T389.20(d) In his evidence in chief he said he had not seen anything while waiting for Mr Bell at the top of the hill T357.4, with the evidence of the white truck and caravan coming out in cross-examination by Mr Seton. T386.26-32 (e) He told police at Mount Isa the caravan he had been pulling had had no rear windows, whereas he told me it did, although he must have been familiar enough with it when speaking to the police to have been able to say what it looked like. He insisted to me that had been an honest error on his part.(f) There were differences in his evidence about whether or not he had seen Mr Davis’ caravan before the day of the accident. Originally he said he had not previously seen Mr Davis’ caravan T395.25 whereas he said later he had seen it. T413.34 However the first question T395.25 was: “You saw the caravan they lived in?” (speaking of Ms Grey and Mr Davis). In its context it is possible he interpreted that question as referring to the inside of the caravan.(g) Although Mr Bell said Mr Dee assisted the driver in the Datsun by keeping his head back, Mr Dee denied he had touched him: (though this perhaps reflects more on Mr Bell than on Mr Dee).(h) It does seem odd that the only discussion he told me he had with Mr Bell on the day or later concerning the accident’s cause was what Mr Bell said he had seen in his rear vision mirror. But if Mr Bell told me the truth about Mr Davis’ involvement and decided to keep that involvement from the police, he may not have been disposed to discuss matters of causation with Mr Dee; (i) Mr Dee said he did not know his own description to police of a little white truck towing a small caravan fitted the description of Mr Davis’ truck and caravan. If he had been familiar with Mr Davis’ rig, that may have been surprising, especially knowing, as he did, that Mr Davis had been at Nowra. But if he was not especially familiar with Mr Davis’ rig, and Mr Bell did not tell him of Mr Davis’ involvement, that evidence is not necessarily remarkable. It was not suggested he was especially familiar with it. (j) Mr Dee told me T446.50 he did not discuss the accident with Mr and Mrs Hodgkin. I find that strange when Mr Hodgkin was his boss within the Bell organisation, and Mr and Mrs Hodgkin were travelling ahead of Mr Dee in the convoy, and they must have seen each other to talk to at the Bega showground over the next few days.(k) Counsel for Mr Dee did not call Mr Bell’s then girlfriend, Melissa, or Mr and Mrs Hodgkin. I infer each of them could have given evidence about the caravan Mr Dee was towing when he arrived at the Bega showground on the afternoon of the 11th February. I infer each of them could have given evidence about whether in fact Mr Dee arrived at the Bega showground on that or some later day, and as to what vehicles he was then driving or towing. There was no evidence any of them was not available to be called. I regard all three as having been witnesses one would normally have expected Messrs Dee and Elwin Bell to call. The failure to call Mr Bell’s former fiancée on this issue was not attacked by Mr Seton. I conclude however nothing Mr and Mrs Hodgkin could have said would have assisted their case: Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v Tormey [2009] NSWCA 135 at [72] per Ipp JA (Giles and McColl JJA agreeing); (l) Obviously, Mr Dee had a motive to lie to police, to Judge Coorey, and to me, because his involvement in the accident would expose him to the possibility of prosecution for a serious criminal offence such as s.52A(3)(c) Crimes Act, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment.(m) Mr Dee’s defence to the action rests to a significant degree on the fact that none of the witnesses to the accident accept that the caravan shown in the photographs in Exhibit L was the one towed by the offending driver, whereas that is the one Mr Dee claims he was towing that day. As appears below, a significant witness who supports Mr Dee on that issue is Mr Bell. As I have already noted, for reasons I shall come to, I have great difficulty in accepting anything Mr Bell says, absent independent corroboration. 77 Despite the above matters I note that Mr Dee has not worked for the Bell family for some years. His knowledge or recollection of some matters, such as number plate colours, and his conversations with Mr and Mrs Hodgkin may well have faded with time. Further: (a) To my observation, Mr Dee is not a well educated or sophisticated man. He was cross-examined vigorously and thoroughly by a number of highly experienced counsel.(b) In general terms there is consistency in the versions of the accident and its aftermath that he has given. It is to be noted in that context that he voluntarily submitted to a searching record of interview by experienced police officers, and gave evidence at two trials. (c) His evidence that he was travelling in front of Mr Bell is: 
     
      
      (i) not inconsistent with Mr Lear’s evidence that he saw only one truck and caravan combination on the hill, viz the offending vehicle; in other words Mr Dee could have been so far ahead that Mr Lear did not see him;  
       
       
      (ii) consistent with evidence as to the position of the two vehicles at the top of the hill, with Mr Dee’s truck and caravan being further from the road and Mr Bell’s semi closer, suggesting Mr Dee stopped first. 
       
      
    (d) Mr Dee’s returning to the accident site with Mr Bell, and getting into Mr Veigel’s car through a broken window to comfort him before the VRA personnel arrived was, I thought, the mark of a person who had no concern that he might be under suspicion. Further, he did not claim to have given him any physical assistance, although Mr Bell said Mr Dee held his head back so he would not choke. He must have known police would soon come. Although it was suggested by Mr Seton in cross-examination that Mr Dee did not in fact go back down the hill with Mr Bell after the accident, Mr Seton did not in the end submit he had not. Though Mr Hodkinson said he did not see anyone helping Mr Veigel, it does not follow that Mr Dee was not there. Though Mr Lear said he saw a middle aged man seeing to Mr Veigel, and Mr Dee could not have been accurately described as middle aged at the time, that also does not mean he was not exactly where he said he was and doing what he said he was doing. 
    (e) Although, as later appears, police went to the Bega showground to look for the caravan whose number Mr Lear had given them, there were four police officers involved, and only Mr Fowler, one of the four, gave evidence. The fact police did not find the caravan Mr Fowler said they were looking for does not mean Mr Dee hid it or covered it over or took it somewhere else. One would need to know a great deal more about what the other three police officers did and over what period of time before seeing great significance in this piece of evidence. Mr Dee’s counsel submitted the inconclusiveness of the search was, at best, neutral, and I agree.78 My overall assessment of Mr Dee is that he is a person whose evidence I accept on relevant matters. I accept his evidence he made an honest mistake when he told police at Mt Isa the caravan had no back window. I am not persuaded he saw or was a party to any changing of number plates or caravans. Further, as later appears, I conclude that Mr Lear incorrectly recorded the number of the caravan Mr Dee had, shortly before, left on the top of the hill, and also, for reasons I shall come to, made a significant error of identification, in saying the caravan with that number belonged to the offending vehicle.Evidence of Mr E Bell79 He has been a travelling showman all his life. His group normally worked at Christmas time at Batemans Bay. Then they returned their equipment to their depot, which is a farm near Queanbeyan. Then they took three or four “machines” to the Berry show, then to Nowra show, then Bega and then Canberra. He said the Gundagai show was usually on at the same time as the Bega show, and that his son, Mr Elwin Bell Junior, sometimes went to that show. That son had a truck and caravan at the time of the accident. Mr Bell said he could not recall whether he drove a pantech or a truck with a tray. He thought he might have had both kinds. Mr Bell said there were several caravans kept at his Queanbeyan property and usually “a truck or two.” He identified the rig in Exhibit “J” as his “Cha Cha” ride and truck. He said he bought the Cha Cha ride in 1968. The truck was bought to carry that ride. He still has both ride and truck. In 2001 the truck was usually driven by his son, Mr Owen Bell. 80 He identified the truck in Exhibit “K” at page 1037 as one he had owned since about 1994-5. He had had the tray built on it to carry the “children’s truck ride” shown in the photograph. He said the ride had never been covered by a tarpaulin while on the truck. The caravan attached to it had been bought in about 1997, purpose built, from GT Caravans of Melbourne. It was bought for his son Mr Owen Bell to live in, and he had lived in it since it had been bought. The square section at the back with the words “Royal Flair” is a “”pull out”, or room extension. For the first 10 years when Mr Owen Bell lived in it, his child lived in the “pull out”. The caravan was sold some years ago.81 Mr Bell confirmed Mr Dee used to work for him till 2002 or 2003. His duties included driving the truck which pulled Mr Owen Bell’s caravan. (The caravan, he said, is that shown in all three photographs in Exhibit “L”). He said when the vehicles were on the move there was a usual order in which vehicles would travel – smaller trucks, including with caravans, ahead of semis. 82 Mr Bell was cross-examined about the changing of number plates on the caravan Mr Dee said he was towing on the day of the accident. He recalled that the number plate on the caravan had been changed. In 1996 he signed a Vic Roads Declaration to have a new plate issued. The new plate had green numbers. He thought he would then have handed back the old plate to Vic Roads, but conceded he may not have. After that, the caravan continued to be insured under its old registration number. Exhibit ED7, ED6 He said he now has, but did not have then, a caravan with a black and white number plate. It is an antique caravan. He could neither confirm nor deny that in 2001 he had a caravan with a black and white number plate with the number O34209. T498.23 He said Mr Owen Bell’s caravan had never had a black and white number plate.83 He has known Mr Dean Davis for most of Mr Davis’ life. On the day of the accident his son Owen rang him from Bega and told him a serious accident had occurred when Mr Davis had been passing his (Owen Bell’s) vehicle. But he said it had not been Mr Davis’s fault. Mr Bell later became aware it was alleged that Mr Dee had been responsible for the accident. David Hodgson, his manager, rang him about the accident, on the afternoon of the accident. He was aware at the time that his son Owen (as Owen Bell admitted to me) gave a statement to the police without telling them of Mr Davis’ involvement. He told me he knows of, but does not think he has ever spoken to, Stacey Grey.84 Mr Stitt put to Mr Bell inter alia that a realisation of Mr Dee’s involvement in the accident by reason of his caravan’s number plate having been recorded as belonging to the offending vehicle could have been an incentive to remove or alter the plate. He denied such a thing had occurred, T510.5 or that he had wanted to shift the focus of the police investigation way from Mr Dee.Mr E Bell’s Credit85 Mr Seton submitted that Mr Bell was an unimpressive witness who was unreliable on contentious matters. (a) I observed that Mr Bell seemed to take considerable care when answering questions; (b) He appeared to listen carefully to what was put to him.; (c) When apparently unsure of something he would ask for it to be repeated; See for example T487.7 (d) To my observation he is a man of considerable shrewdness; (e) It was his obligation within his business to deal with vehicle registrations and the replacement of defective number plates. He conceded it possible that he had kept an old number plate when getting new ones. T494.38 It is to be recalled that Mr Lear and his daughter wrote down the registration number of the caravan they had seen at the top of the hill, and which they both recognised as the caravan involved in the collision. The number they recorded was O34209. The number on Mr Owen Bell’s caravan on 11 February 2001 was F34209, the plate’s colour green on white. Mr Lear, however, recalled the colour of the plate as black on white. When it was suggested to Mr E Bell he had changed the number plate on the caravan to put the police off the track, he conceded he had changed number plates on vehicles on more than one occasion T499.45 but denied the proposition that he had changed the caravan’s number plate after the accident. In fact there was no evidence Mr E Bell or anyone else ever did change the number plate on the caravan after the accident;(f) As appears below, where I deal with the evidence of Mr Owen Bell, there was a great deal of conflicting evidence about what Mr Owen Bell first told people about the alleged involvement of Mr Davis in the accident, and when he first told them. There were conflicts in Mr E Bell’s evidence about when and by what manner his son first told him of the accident and Mr Davis’ alleged part in it. When he gave evidence to me Mr E Bell, in cross-examination by Mr Barry, gave the following evidence, (over Mr Seton’s objection,) of a telephone call he received from Mr Bell on the afternoon of the accident: 
     
      
       
       “Q. What did he tell [you?] were the circumstances of the accident? 
        
       A. Like Owen told me, when he rang me that there had been an accident along the road going to Bega, not far out of Bega, and I asked him, you know, what happened, and was it our vehicles, what’s happened to them, and he said that he was going up a hill, a fairly steep hill and there was an overtaking lane on that hill and Dean Davis, when his truck was passing Owen, and Owen said that he seen in his rear view, he seen that there was two cars had an accident behind him and Owen, he said he thought it was his car. He said that he told Jamie Dee, he was ahead of Owen with a truck and caravan, he said, “Jamie, I think my car’s been in accident, will you just pull up” So Jamie pulled up, Owen went up to the top of the hill and pulled up and they went back down the hill, run down the hill thinking that it was his car that was involved in the accident. When they got down, it wasn’t his car, it was somebody else and they give assistance there to the people that was involved in the accident until the police and that arrived and after that, they went to Bega show. 
        
        
       Q. What your son Owen told you was, that the accident occurred between two cars while Mr Davis was overtaking Owen’s vehicle? 
        
       A. That’s correct.”  
        T505.1-21 
         
        
       
      
    (He later made it clear that his son had said Mr Davis had not caused the accident.)Although there was objection by Mr Seton to this evidence going in for all purposes I considered it was admissible under section 64(3) of the Evidence Act, and by section 60 was admissible for all purposes, and could see no reason to limit the purpose of the evidence. I could see no unfair prejudice. Mr Owen Bell was to be called.(g) Mr Bell said the call from his son had been on a mobile phone and from the Bega showground. However at the first trial when asked when his son first told him of the accident he said: “[I]t may have been that day or the next”. He told me he “stood by” that answer. (h) Although Mr Bell told me he first heard about the accident from his son Owen, he said at the first trial it had been Mr Hodgkin who had first told him about it. When challenged about that at this trial, he qualified his evidence by saying he first heard of the accident from “David Hodgson and Owen”. (i) It was put to him by Mr Seton that he had never heard from Mr Hodgkin or Mr Bell about Mr Davis’ alleged part in the accident and that his evidence that he had was a creation on his part. He replied: “I’d say you were right off the ball”. (j) Mr Bell said he had a conversation with Mr Hodgkin on the afternoon and evening of 11 February, T512.30 and that Mr Hodgkin had given him a description of the accident as relayed by Mr Bell. That description was the subject of objection and, having conditionally admitted it, I now reject it.  
     
     These are my reasons:  
      
     (a) Mr Seton attacked Mr Owen Bell’s credit, and the evidence could have been admissible to restore credit under s.108(3),  
     Evidence Act 
     ;  
      
     (b) I could not see its admission adding unduly to the trial’s already considerable length;  
      
     (c) But I could see some unfairness to Mr Davis, if Mr Hodgkin were not called; 
      
     (d) I did not consider the evidence could have any but minimal weight; 
      
     (e) I could not see the evidence as having any importance in my re-evaluating Mr Owen Bell’s tattered credit; 
      
     (f) I took into account that the evidence was hearsay on hearsay, but that no jury was involved, so as a judge deciding relevant issues I would not give the evidence undue weight if it went in.  
      
    (k) My observation when dealing with Mr Dee about the failure of the Dee/Bell interests to call Mr Hodgkin, applies equally to Mr E Bell’s evidence. As to what Mr Hodgkin told Mr E Bell on the day of the accident, and in particular whether there was any reference to Mr Davis’ involvement, I infer Mr Hodgkin’s evidence would not have assisted the case of Messrs Dee and E Bell. (l) Mr E Bell said that he had not been aware at the time that Mr Dee had been identified as the offending motorist by reason of the number plate on the caravan and had not become aware of that until he had been talking to the solicitor acting for him. T507.10 There was no evidence to contradict that. (m) Mr Bell admitted he had in the past falsified documents to obtain a financial advantage. T512.10 86 Mr Bell denied he had been the anonymous police informant. 87 While he has been dishonest in the past in order to obtain a financial benefit, it does not follow that I should reject all that Mr Bell has to say. Nor do the other matters I have referred to, whether alone or in combination, cause me to reject his evidence on significant matters. On most significant matters, I accept Mr Bell’s evidence. I shall return later to consider whether I accept what he told me about being told of Mr Davis’ involvement at the time of the accident, after I have considered the evidence of Mr Owen Bell. Evidence of Mr Owen Bell88 Mr Bell is a son of Mr E Bell. He was at the Nowra show in February 2001. At about 9.00 am on the day of the accident he left Nowra, driving a semi trailer carrying a “Cha Cha” ride. Mr Dee left before him, driving a Hino truck, towing the caravan then used by Mr Bell as his home. It had been his home for ten or more years. Mr Bell told me that his caravan was always hauled by the Hino and that Mr Dee was always the dedicated driver. 89 Mr Bell identified the truck and caravan in Exhibit ‘K’ as the relevant truck and caravan. He said the show ride carried on the back of the truck was made especially for that truck. After 11 February 2001 he continued to use the caravan as his home for four or more years. Then he bought a smaller one. The old one was then renovated and sold. 90 He told me that the truck in Exhibit ‘L’ is the Hino which at the time of the accident pulled his caravan. The ride shown on the back is the one it carried at the time. The caravan is the one he lived in before and after the accident. The photographs on pages 1038, 1043 and 1044 in Exhibit “L” show the same caravan. 91 On 11 February 2001, Mr Dee left Nowra approximately five minutes before him. Mr Dee always went on ahead of Mr Bell. They stopped at a point 10-15 kilometres out of Narooma to check the tyres and loads. Then they proceeded towards Bega, with Mr Dee still in front.92 He came to Stoney Creek Bridge. There were cars behind him. He recalls only Mr Dee being in front of him. He was in the left overtaking lane after the bridge. Mr Dee was 100 metres in front of him when he moved into the left lane. Six to eight cars passed him in the right lane. 93 As he drove up the hill he changed down gears and reduced speed. The cars were travelling at 90-100 kilometres per hour and his semi at 70. Most of the cars passed him. He saw a white Isuzu truck and cream coloured caravan go past him. He noticed Mr Dean Davis was the driver of the truck. When the truck and caravan passed him, they returned to the left lane and kept going, eventually disappearing from his sight. Mr Bell described the Isuzu truck as having been smaller than the Hino, with a body on the back made of aluminium or steel, with a “square” shape, white in colour. The body was “fully covered”. The caravan, he said, was twelve to sixteen feet in length; he thought it had side windows but no back windows. Through his rear vision mirror, he saw a car go across the road and collide with an oncoming one. He called Mr Dee on his CB radio and asked him to stop. He owned a green coloured Holden Commodore at the time. It was being driven from Nowra by a Bell employee. He thought the car he had seen behind him had been his. 94 His then fiancée Melissa, was his only passenger. She had been asleep, but awoke when he began to speak on the CB. He stopped at the top of the hill where he saw Mr Dee’s truck with caravan parked on the side of the road. 95 He parked his truck behind Mr Dee’s. All three ran down to the scene of the accident. He then realised the green car he had seen was not his. While they were there, Mr Dee got into the injured man’s car, while he, Mr Bell remained on the roadside, talking to Mr Dee through the car window. While he was there he also spoke to a lady (who I infer was Ms Broughton.) 96 Police arrived. He gave them his name and number and said where he could be contacted. He and Mr Dee and Melissa then walked back to the trucks. 97 He got straight back into his truck. Mr Dee left first. Mr Bell then travelled to the Bega Showground, where he set up his caravan next to Mr and Mrs Hodgkins’ caravan. 98 The day after the accident he spoke to police. He did not tell them of Mr Davis’ involvement in the accident. But he told them of the involvement of a truck pulling a caravan. He gave police a description of the truck which was different from the description he gave me. For example he told police the truck was a small truck like a Toyota Dyna. 99 He told police the truck had passed him just before the accident, and that he did not know whether the truck was a pantech. He admitted to me that by giving that description and by not telling police he had seen Mr Davis, he had withheld important information from them. 100 In a signed statement he gave Bega police on 13 February 2001 Exhibit BJ he said, amongst other things, the following: 
     
      
      “…[A]bout halfway up the hill, …I looked in my rear vision mirror and saw a small truck like a white Toyota Dyna which was towing a caravan had moved up beside me and was passing me in the right lane. The Toyota Dyna was moving a lot quicker than me. He passed me and I had another look in my rear vision mirror and saw a white Datsun station wagon, which was going the opposite way to me, skidding along the guard rail, probably for about 20 to 30 metres. I looked back ahead and looked back into the rear vision mirror and saw a dark green Holden Commodore, that was travelling south going across to the wrong side of the road and it hit the front of the Datsun”. 
       
      
    101 Another description of the truck and caravan he gave police at the time was: 
     
      
      “The Toyota Dyna truck that passed me just before the accident was an older model, probably around the 1980 mark somewhere. It was white and had a white body. I don’t know if it was a pantech. The caravan it was towing was only a short one, about 12 foot long, from what I remember about it. I think it was white, or a light colour and it might have had a green and brown stripe on it.” 
      
    102 In cross examination by Mr Seton he gave me the following description of what he observed of Mr Davis’ truck when it was still behind him: 
     
      
      “Q. Mr Bell, some few questions ago I asked you whether when you first saw the truck whether it was in the overtaking land and you said it was. Was it all in the overtaking lane? 
       
      A. No, not till I got it round back of my trailer, coming from the left lane into- coming like driving up the side of me, when it’s overtaking you. 
       
       
      Q. Very well. So when you first saw the truck, the first time you laid eyes on this truck, firstly you were looking in the rear view mirror, correct? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. And was any part of the truck in the overtaking lane? 
       
      A. When I first looked into my rear vision mirror, when he was coming out from the left lane half his truck was in the- going in the right land, with the blinker— 
       
       
      Q. Half his truck was in the overtaking lane and the rest of it appeared to be, did it, in the lane behind you which you were in? 
       
      A. Yeah, coming on an angle like he’s going to pass you. 
       
       
      Q. It had its indicator on, you say? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. That was the first time you were ever aware there was a truck behind you for the last 10 to 15 kilometres? 
       
      A. Yes.”  
       T558 
        
       
      
    103 Later he was asked 
     
      
      “Q. It didn’t seem that his truck and caravan was in any way preventing the white Datsun from coming into the correct lane? 
       
      A. No”  
       T560 
       
      
    104 Later he agreed he had given the following evidence at the first trial: 
     
      
      “Q. At the time that the green Commodore crossed the double unbroken lines, where was Dean Davis’ rig? 
       
      A. He was gone around the corner, he was gone”.  
       T561 
        
       
      
    He told me he stood by that answer. Then he was asked:  
     
      
      “Q. So he was actually out of sight, was he, when you saw the green Commodore cross over? 
      
      
      A. He was out of sight, I can’t remember.” 
       
        
      
    105 Later when cross-examined by Mr Black he gave the following evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. At the time that you made [your?] statement to the police, you knew that if you withheld information from the police or told lies to the police, that you were exposing yourself to the risk of getting into serious trouble, correct? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. You say that at the time of this accident, you understood that Mr Davis didn't have a driver's licence, correct? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Do you say that that's the reason that you chose to mislead the police about Mr Davis being there? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Isn't it the case that you thought that Mr Davis might get into trouble that was a lot more serious than simply not having a driver's licence in respect of this accident? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. That's because you knew that Mr Davis had been driving his truck in such a way that he had caused the accident, didn't you? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Well, why would you expose yourself to such serious trouble when the worst that could happen to Mr Davis, if your account was correct, was that he might get into trouble for driving without a driver's licence? 
       
      A. I don't know. I've got nothing to say. 
       
       
      Q. It's because you knew that he would get into a lot more serious trouble than that because he'd in fact caused the accident? 
       
      A. He didn't cause the accident because he was up past me. 
       
       
      Q. He wasn't past you at all, was he, he was at the back of your truck-- 
       
      A. No, he was past me up the front of my truck. 
       
       
      Q. He drew out as the Commodore was attempting to overtake your truck and the manner in which he drew out was such that the Commodore had to go on to the wrong side of the road. 
       
      A. Dean was up past me truck, he was up past me truck and the Commodore was still coming over the bridge. 
       
       
      Q. The reason that you tried to conceal Mr Davis's presence at the time of the accident was because you knew that he might get into a lot of trouble because he caused the accident. That's right, isn't it? 
       
      A. He didn't cause the accident at all.”  
       T610.37-T611.30 
      
      
    When he was cross-examined by Mr Barry this evidence was given: 
     
      
      “Q. Then taking your mind back to the accident you did see the green Commodore for a very short period of time before the collision with the car coming in the other direction, didn't you? 
       
      A. Yes, I seen him up on the other hill. 
       
       
      Q. But I'm talking about when you were going up the hill, just before the accident and before it actually had the collision with the white car you had seen it before that, hadn't you? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. I think you saw it going across the wrong side of the road? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. And I think at the time you saw it going across the wrong side of the road the vehicle that was being driven by Dean Davis was partly in the overtaking lane and partly in the inside lane? 
       
      A. No, he was overtaking, yeah, like coming out from behind me. 
       
       
      Q. He was coming out, at the time when you saw the green car going over the wrong side of the road Dean Davis' vehicle was in the process of moving out to overtake you? 
       
      A. No, Dean Davis was already overtaking me, he was up where my truck— 
       
       
      Q. But he was partly in the overtaking lane and still partly in the other lane, wasn't he? 
       
      A. No. No, he was in the right lane. 
       
       
      Q. When you gave evidence on 9 December 2004 what you said at page 1289 line D of the transcript before the judge on that occasion was, before you saw Mrs Broughton start to go out that he was still coming into the left lane? 
       
      A. Still coming in the left lane? 
       
       
      Q. That's what you said? 
       
      A. Can't remember that.”  
       T613.46-T614.30 
      
      
        
      
    106 The proposition that Mr Bell was lying to cover up for Mr Dee appears from the following cross-examination by Mr Seton: 
     
      
      “Q. Was it not the case that in fact Jamie Dee was travelling behind your vehicle? 
       
      A. No, Jamie Dee was in front of my vehicle. 
       
       
      Q. Was it not the case that he in fact overtook your vehicle as you went up the hill? 
       
      A. He never overtook me once, he was in front all the time. 
       
       
      Q. Was it the case that you saw the collision and formed the view that Mr Dee had caused it? 
       
      A. Jamie never caused it because he was in front of me 100 metres. 
       
       
      Q. Was it the case that you then got on the CB radio and told him about the accident and told him to pull over? 
       
      A. I got on the CB radio and told him that my car’s been in an accident, to pull up top and we’ll run back down and see if it was my car.”  
       T565 
      
    107 Mr Bell told me that he had been trying to cover up for Mr Davis, by not telling police about his involvement, and giving them misleading descriptions of his vehicle. He said:  
     
      
      “I didn’t want to get him in trouble or anything like that because we’d been best mates since we were little.” 
       T550.33-34 
       
      
    (As later appears, Mr Davis had a different version of the closeness of the relationship.)Credit of Mr Owen Bell108 It is hardly surprising that Mr Bell’s credit became the subject of attack. There was very good reason. For example: (a) He conceded to me that he had knowingly withheld from Bega Police important information. T550.33 He said he had done so as he and Mr Davis had been “best mates since we were little”. T550.33(b) Having made that claim he told me he could not remember and did not know what Mr Davis could be blamed for.(c) Mr Bell admitted when cross-examined by Mr Seton that he had lied when telling Bega police “I don’t know if it was a pantech”, because in fact he knew it had been a pantech. However when cross-examined at the first trial on this issue he denied that statement to police had been a lie.(d) He told me he had first seen Mr Davis driving Mr Davis’ truck when the truck was alongside him, when he had seen Mr Davis through the passenger side window of Mr Davis’ truck. T549 But at the first trial he told Judge Coorey he could only see the passenger in Mr Davis’ truck when it went past, and that he had seen Mr Davis in his rear vision mirror T555; this had occurred before Mr Davis’ truck had come alongside. He told me he did “not really” stand by the answers he gave to Judge Coorey. But he maintained he had seen Mr Davis driving the truck.(e) (i) He was cross-examined on whether the Bell interests had been a party to swapping number plates or caravans to divert police attention from Mr Dee, once they knew someone had given police the registration number of his caravan. At the first trial Mr Bell gave this evidence about a bystander’s taking his registration number and passing it on: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. When we were down the bottom at the accident a man pulled up and got my rego number off my caravan and come down and said to a lady, ‘Here you are, this is my number, I seen it all happen’, and he took off. 
         
        Q. So this is the situation. You knew that that man had gone up the hill in his car, correct? 
         
        A. No, I didn’t see him do it. 
         
         
        Q. Isn’t this the— 
         
        A. My girlfriend was standing there when he gave the number and the rego number and that to the lady and she give it to the police.” 
         T570 
          
         
          
         
        
       
      (ii) He told me he could not remember that. What he said to me on the topic of number plates having being recorded was: 
       
        
         
        “My fiancée was standing right next to him and she seen him write his name and number down and said, I seen everything. Nothing about a numberplate or anything like that.”  
         T570.20 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (iii) He went on to tell me he knew nothing about a man’s having given his registration number to someone at the accident site. But at the first trial he gave this evidence: 
       
       
        
        “Q. So is this the position. You were down at the scene, you became aware that a witness had written out a registration number which you understood had been taken from your caravan? 
         
        A. Yes.”  
         T571 
         
          
         
        
       
      
    Asked if he stood by that answer he told me: “No, I stand by- can’t recall”. (iv) Then he gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Bell, by the time you left the site, the scene up at the top of the hill, by the time you drove away, it was your belief wasn’t it, that someone had got the registration number of your caravan, do you agree with that? 
         
        A. I do not know. I don’t know if anyone got my rego. 
         
         
        Q. It was your belief when you drove away from the top of the hill that that witness, that there was a chance that that witness thought that your caravan had caused the accident? 
         
        A. Yeah, he probably thought that my caravan caused the accident, but my caravan was in front of me all the time. 
         
         
        Q. Was it the case that as you drove away from the top of the hill that you were concerned that there was a witness out there who might have thought that your caravan was to blame for the accident? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Was it the case that that was something that troubled you or concerned you? 
         
        A. It didn’t concern me at all”  
         T571 
         
          
         
        
       
      
    (f) Police spoke to Mr Bell at Mount Isa, some six months after the accident. He told me that although he knew at the time he should have told them of Dean Davis’ having been in the truck, (as he should have told Bega police about it,) he had not done so, and had therefore knowingly misled them.(g) He told me he would be willing to lie to police to protect a friend T574: but that although Mr Dee had been a friend, he would not have lied to protect him T574: (h) The first time Mr Bell told anyone involved in investigating the case of Mr Davis’ involvement, was in January 2004, when he was interviewed by an insurance investigator. T575 He said his understanding of what would happen if the claim against Mr Dee succeeded was “I just thought it’d – be in a bit of trouble, that’s all”.(I) Although he told me the only person he told about Mr Davis’ involvement, on the day of the accident, was his father, at the first trial he said that after the accident he had told David and Sharon Hodgkin. He told me that he could not remember if that had been “the truth” but then said that what he had said at the first trial had been “all the truth”. At the first trial he said he had also told his fiancée Melissa, and Mr Dee, as the three of them were walking back up the hill after going back to the scene of the accident. However he told me he could not now recall telling anyone apart from his father. T578 But at the first trial he was asked whether he had told his father on the day of the accident and his answer was “No, I never told me father”.(j) Although he said at the first trial he had told Mr David Hodgkin of Mr Davis’ involvement on the day of the accident, when insurance investigators spoke to him on 29 January 2004 he said: “I did not mention that it was Dean Davis in the vehicle that overtook me to David”. He told me that statement had been a truthful statement. T581 Although he said at the first trial that he had told Mr Dee of Mr Davis’ involvement as they had walked back up the hill, he told the investigators he had never told him. He told me that what he said to the investigators was true, and that until he signed the statement for the investigator, he had in fact only told his father. When Mr Seton put to him that he had told Judge Coorey of having told Mr Dee about Mr Davis on the day, he said, “I can’t recall but Jamie was there with me all the time so he knew who was driving the truck.”  T578.26(k) Although he told me that the first time he had mentioned Mr Davis’ involvement to his father was on the day of the accident and by telephone, he told Judge Coorey that he had first told his father when he had seen him at the Canberra show, which is the show the Bell family went to after the Bega show.(l) He told me he had not been trying to put police off the track by giving them a false description of the truck, although he conceded he had given them a false description.(n) He agreed in cross-examination that show people stick together. Asked if he was sticking to Dean Davis in the witness box he said, “I hope so.” Later he was asked, “You know that you’re sticking to your mate, even now, don’t you?” and he said, “No.” Then when he was cross-examined by Mr Stitt this evidence was given: 
     
      
      “Q. Not only did you know that Dean Davis was not licensed at the time of this accident but you also knew that he wasn't licensed to drive a truck, didn't you? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. So that you knew that he was driving the truck because he was not licensed and that that was an offence? 
       
      A. Yes, it was. 
       
       
      Q. That was one of the reasons that you were keeping his identity concealed, wasn't it? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Did it also occur to you that another reason to keep his identity concealed was because he was directly involved in this accident? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. But he was directly involved in the accident, wasn't he? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Well he was pulling out beside you at the time the green car collided with the Datsun? 
       
      A. He was in front, he was up the front of my truck. 
       
       
      Q. Do you think that by saying that he was up the front of your truck that you're still protecting Dean Davis? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. I beg your pardon? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. But if your version is correct that he was up the front of your truck and passed your truck, then on your version Dean Davis had done nothing wrong, had he? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. So on your version there was nothing to protect him about, so far as this accident was concerned, from the police was there? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. But that's exactly what you did, wasn't it? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Protect him? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. From the police? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. But you did because you didn't reveal his identity to the police, you've told us that? 
       
      A. All right. 
       
       
      Q. Isn't that the truth, Mr Bell? 
       
      A. It's got to be the truth, yes. 
       
       
      Q. It's got to be the truth, hasn't it. You see, what you're doing, I suggest, is that you know that Dean Davis caused this accident and you know that it was his driving which forced the green car off the road, onto the other side of the road, and that you are still doing your best to help him, aren't you? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. Well do you think that if your version of the accident was accepted by the judge that that would help Dean Davis? 
       
      A. I don't know. 
       
       
      Q. Come on, Mr Bell, you do know? 
       
      A. No, I don't. 
       
       
      Q. You don't know, is that what you're saying to his Honour? 
       
      A. Yeah. 
       
       
      Q. If your version of Dean Davis's action is correct then he had nothing to be concerned about so far as the accident was concerned, isn't that so? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. But you were concerned because you wanted to protect him? 
       
      A. I'm not protecting him. 
       
       
      Q. I thought you just told us that the showmen stick together? 
       
      A. Yeah, we do. 
       
       
      Q. Well aren't you sticking with him now? 
       
      A. I'm always sticking with him. 
       
       
      Q. You're always sticking with him? 
       
      A. Yeah. 
       
       
      Q. You're sticking with him right now, aren't you? 
       
      A. Yeah.” 
       T621.46-T623.34 
       
        
      
    (n) When he was cross-examined about the fact that he told me the first person he told about Mr Davis’ involvement was his father, and he was reminded that at the first trial he had said he had told Sharon and David Hodgkin on the day, he said somewhat unresponsively: “They knew Dean was coming to Bega and they seen him at Bega.”  T577.15 (see also T589) There was no direct evidence that anyone ever saw Mr Davis at Bega at that time. Ms Grey gave no evidence they went to the Bega show ground after the accident. I infer Mr and Mrs Hodgkins’ evidence would not have given support for Mr Bell’s evidence about what, if anything, he told them, on the day of the accident, concerning the accident. I draw the same inference from the failure of the Dee/Bell interests to call Mr Bell’s former fiancée, Melissa, as Mr Seton urged that I should. I give no weight at all to the hearsay concerning Mr Davis’ having been seen at Bega that day. That evidence has the hallmarks of something Mr Bell made up on the run to give support to his assertion of having told Mr Hodgkin of Mr Davis’ involvement. I find Mr Bell did make it up. (o) At the first trial when he was cross-examined about the possibility number plates had been swapped he was reminded he had been aware someone had given his caravan registration number to a lady at the scene. He was reminded of his earlier evidence then cross-examined about it by Mr Seton: 
     
      
      “ ‘Q. It was at that point when you realised that maybe there was someone out there suggesting that the vehicle carrying your registration number was to blame for the accident. Is that right? 
       
      A. No, me and Dean had the same numberplate but there's one number different in it.’ 
      
      
       
      Do you stand by that answer that you gave on that occasion? 
       
      A. Like I said yesterday, my girlfriend told them, told me that a fellow did give a piece of paper with his name and phone number and said, I seen everything. That's all I'm saying, that's all I can say about that. 
       
       
      Q. But Mr Bell, what I'm asking you is simply about the evidence you gave at the first trial. The answer that you just gave, no, that I just read to you, I should say, ""No, me and Dean had the same numberplate but there's one number different in it""? 
       
      A. I can't recall that. 
       
       
      Q. Was that answer that you gave to Judge Coorey correct? 
       
      A. Like I said, my wife told me that a fellow give her a phone number, and his name to the lady, that's all I know. 
       
       
      Q. I'm asking you about your evidence on the last occasion. Was that answer that you gave before his Honour Judge Coorey, correct? 
       
      A. I can't recall. 
       
       
      Q. You know as you sit here, don't you, that the answer you gave that I just read out, was false? 
       
      A. I can't recall. 
       
       
      Q. You were lying when you gave that evidence on the last occasion, weren't you? 
       
      A. No, I wasn't lying.” 
       T594.9-40 
       
      
     There was no other evidence Mr Davis had a similar number plate to Mr Bell’s. The issue was explored further T595 when the following evidence was given: 
     
      
      “That evidence that you gave on the last occasion at the first trial was totally made up by you, wasn't it? 
       
      A. I can't remember saying that at all. 
       
       
      Q. Because you said whatever came into your mind if you thought it would help your story, didn't you, when you gave evidence on the last occasion. Next question, line I. 
       
       
        
        ""Q. So is this the position, you were down at the scene, you became aware that a witness had written out a registration number which you understood had been taken from your caravan? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. You thought there and then, did you, 'well, wait on, that might be a problem because my number is very similar to Dean Davis''? 
         
        A. Right. I didn't know that to this year when I see him in Bendigo show, he told me about that."" 
        
       
       
      That answer that I just read out was entirely false, wasn't it? 
       
      A. No. 
       
       
      Q. You never had a conversation with him at Bendigo about number plates, did you? 
       
      A. No.”  
       T595.5-28 
       
      
    (p) At the first trial Mr Bell said he had had a conversation with Mr Davis at the Bendigo show, when Mr Davis told him his caravan registration number was very similar to his. But Mr Bell told me he had never had such a conversation.The precise reason Mr Bell told the many lies he has told may have been one I heard nothing about, although some were explored. He may well have lied to help stop Mr Dee from being falsely accused of having caused the accident. He may have lied so he would not be correctly accused. However, people lie for all sorts of reasons – sometimes apparent and sometimes not: R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520 at 542 (Sperling, J). 109 Despite the above, some of Mr Bell’s evidence struck me as honest. For example the following evidence was given: 
     
      
      “…you were there when the accident happened and you tell us that you brought your truck to a halt as soon as you safely could and went back to help the people in the accident? 
       
      A. I didn't go back to help the people, I went back to see if it was my car. 
       
       
      Q. Okay, but when you went back you stayed there for a while and you were there even before the police arrived and you did, in fact, help people who were hurt in the accident? 
       
      A. Yes. I never helped, Jamie did. That's why I had to stay back because Jamie was in the car.” 
       T606.35-44 
      
    110 Further, Mr Bell stayed at the scene of the accident for a considerable time after it occurred and gave his telephone number, name, address and registration number to Senior Constable Milton when he arrived, and said he would be at the Bega show. This does not strike me as conduct of someone keen to get away from police and police investigation. However it is probable that it was only after he had arrived back at the scene of the accident when he learned someone had apparently taken down the number of Mr Dee’s caravan.111 Mr Seton submitted Mr Bell gave me an “outrageously wrong version of the accident”. Although I agree with Mr Seton it seems unlikely the truck and caravan he associated with the accident were already virtually out of sight, and ahead of him, when the accident occurred, I thought his description of the course of Mr Veigel’s car as skidding along the Armco railing for twenty to thirty metres quite feasible. See for example photographs 1, 2, 7 and 9 in Exhibit B. He described Mrs Broughton’s car as ‘up on two wheels’, which description Mr Seton attacked, but to an observer of a fast moving event that does not seem an unlikely perception. Mr Seton also submitted Mr Bell had no reason to give an exculpatory version of the collision, given he had gone to the lengths of letting down one of his friends. However I consider Mr Bell may well have felt guilty about informing on someone he regarded as a friend, so offered a sanitised version. 112 Mr Bell is aged thirty-eight. He went to boarding school between the ages of eight and sixteen. To my observation he is, notwithstanding those years of schooling, not well educated. To my observation, too, he does not have the good fortune to have a high mental acuity. By reason of the many matters I have outlined, and my observations of him, I treat his evidence with the utmost reserve, and would not accept it on any significant matter without some corroboration. Indeed, I took Mr Maconachie, who called him, to concede that to be the only appropriate approach. Did Mr Bell Ever Tell Anyone About Mr Davis’ Involvement Before He told Insurance Investigators on 23 January 2004?113 Before I leave Mr Bell’s evidence, I shall consider further the issue of who Mr Bell allegedly told of Mr Davis’ involvement, and when.(a) Mr Dee said he was never told, although Mr Bell at the first trial said he had told Mr Dee as they walked up the hill. It is not the sort of thing I would have expected Mr Dee to have forgotten, given he was the person independent witnesses claimed (through the caravan registration number) to have been to blame.(b) Mr Bell said at the first trial he had told Mr and Mrs Hodgkin on the day of the accident, whereas on 29 January 2004 he told investigators he had not told them. I have referred above to the reason for drawing a relevant inference by reason of their absence.(c) At the first trial Mr Bell said he told his father at the Canberra Show the following week, whereas he told me he phoned his father and told him on the day of the accident. In the end I took Mr Bell’s evidence to me to be that the only person he had ever told before the investigators had been his father.(d) Mr E Bell told me his son had phoned him on the day, and told him, and this had been the first time he had known, but at the first trial he said Mr Hodgkin had phoned on the day of the accident and had been the first to tell him.(e) Mr Bell’s fiancée, Melissa was not called, although at the first trial Mr Bell said he had mentioned Mr Davis’ involvement to her as they walked up the hill to their truck. (f) There were no telephone records in evidence on this or any other issue.(g) I take into account what I have said about the credit concerning Mr Dee, Mr Elwin Bell and Mr Owen Bell, and the absence of Mr and Mrs Hodgkin and Mr Owen Bell’s former fiancée.Conclusion 114 I accept Mr Elwin Bell’s evidence that he learnt of Mr Davis’ involvement on the day of the accident. I find it probable he learnt of this from Mr Owen Bell. I find that he accepted the truth of what he was told. I am not persuaded Mr Owen Bell told anyone else at the time. That is not to say it was not the subject of discussion between Mr E Bell and Mr Hodgkin. I think it probable there was such a discussion, given Mr Hodgkin was Mr E Bell’s overseer. It is probably not necessary to resolve the question of how the information came to Mr Hodgkin, but I consider it probable it came to him from Mr E Bell.Evidence of Dean Davis115 Mr Davis bought an unregistered Isuzu truck in Coffs Harbour at a time when he had only a car driver’s permit. The cabin of the truck was white. It had a white pantech on the back. It was registered in Queensland on 10 May 1999. It was sold after the accident. 116 Mr Davis bought a caravan in 1999. He had the registration transferred to his name on 11 May 1999. Its registration number was 001 QCM. The caravan was 22 feet in length, and cream in colour. At front and back was written the word “Scenic”. It had three windows on each side, one at the front and none at the back. At the back was a steel rack with two tyres mounted on it, about 1 to 2 feet apart. The caravan had 2 or 3 stripes on the side, but he did not recall the colours. A bucket game and a ladder game operated by Mr Davis at shows were carried in the truck. 117 He used the truck to pull the caravan. Stacey Grey was his girlfriend at the time he bought the caravan. They had been together then for about two years. Before that he had travelled with his parents.118 Mr Davis told me he and Ms Grey separated at the end of 2001 or in early 2002. Then Jordan, their child, lived with her. They continued to communicate until one or two years ago. He said Jordan has lived with him since April 2008. In mid 2008 Ms Grey had two conversations with him and told him that private investigators had been to see her and that she would do anything to make sure he goes to gaol. On occasions she has called him some offensive names. He told me he had not socialised with Mr Owen Bell since 2001, and he has never had a vehicle with a registration number similar to F34209. 119 He said he did not go to the Bega show in 2001 and never had any intention of going. He did go to the 2001 Nowra show. It finished on Saturday 10 February. On 11 February at 7am he drove his truck to Sydney. He left the caravan at Nowra showground, as the road to Sydney was hilly and he wanted to get to Sydney quickly. There was nowhere to park the caravan in Sydney. He had an employee at the time called Michael, who worked with him for two months. He did not know his surname. Michael was in his mid twenties and was his driver. On the 11th February, Mr Davis, Ms Grey and Michael, were in the truck. They got as far as Blakehurst, having crossed Tom Uglys Bridge. He received a phone call. The event in Sydney had been called off because of rain. They turned around, returned to Nowra, packed up the caravan and drove to Canberra, where he had intended to go after his trip to Sydney. He stayed at the Canberra showground for two nights. While there he bought some show prizes. At that time he saw at least ten people he knew, also staying there. Then he went to the Gundagai show, which was on at the same time as the Bega show. After the Gundagai show he returned to Canberra for the Canberra show. 120 On 11 February 2001 he was nowhere near Bega, and was unaware of any accident having happened near there. 121 Mr Davis’ denial of any involvement in the collision was the subject of substantial challenge.Mr Davis’ Credit122 There were matters about Mr Davis’ credit I found troubling. (a) Driving:  
     
     (i) In her evidence Ms Grey said Mr Davis always drove his truck, although unlicensed, and had been driving it at the time and place of the collision. Thus one can readily see that Mr Davis had a motive to lie about being both present, and driving, at the accident scene. 
      
      
     (ii) In February 2001 he only had his learners permit 
      T658.40 
     , and he knew that did not permit him to drive his truck. 
      T659.11 
       
     
     
     (iii) Mr Davis told me that before he got the truck registered, his father got a friend’s “staff” to drive it to Queensland, 
      T659.31 
      whereas he told Judge Coorey his brother had driven it there. 
      T659.44 
     
     
     (iv) Asked whether he had ever driven his truck between 1999 and 2001 he told me, “ 
     I think I drove it once.” 
      T661.36 
      That had been in Queensland and a distance of sixty kilometres and at a time when he had the caravan attached to the truck.  
      
      
     (v) Later he said he had not driven it at all in 1999, 2000 and 2001, and that the one occasion  
     “Might be 2002, 2003, something like that.” 
       
     
     
     (vi) Then he admitted that in 1999 to 2001 he had driven it:  
     “Maybe round the showgrounds or something like that.” 
       
      T662 
       
     
     
     (vii) When he gave evidence to Judge Coorey he told his Honour that as at February 2001 he had driven the truck  
     “short distances, not very far though’  
     and  
     ‘short distances on the road,’ 
      including, on at least one of those occasions, while towing his caravan. In cross-examination by Mr Black when giving evidence to me he said: 
     
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So on the assumption that what I have read out to you accurately reflects what you said in 2004, it is now your evidence that you may have driven your truck sometimes with the caravan attached between 1999 and 2001, is that correct? 
         
        A. If that’s the evidence I gave back then, well, yes.”  
         T663.41-45 
        
       
      
      
     (viii) Mr Davis said he could not remember when he actually obtained a truck licence. This evidence was given: 
      
      
       
        
        “Q. Can I suggest to you that you first got your provisional truck licence in August 2004? 
         
        A. I can't remember off the top of my head. 
         
         
        Q. And between 2001 and 2004 you drove the truck with or without the caravan from time to time, didn't you? 
         
        A. 90% of the time - 99% of the time I wouldn't have drove it. 
         
         
        Q. How many times do you say constitute the other 1 or 10%? 
         
        A. I couldn't tell you. 
         
         
        Q. More than once? 
         
        A. Maybe twice. 
         
         
        Q. Before you were prepared to swear that you had only driven it once after 2001, do you now concede that it was more than once? 
         
        A. Yes, I do. 
         
         
        Q. Were you lying when you said once a few moments ago? 
         
        A. Well, no, to my recollection that's all I can remember. 
         
         
        Q. What's come about in the last few minutes that has improved your recollection so that you can remember that you drove it more than once? 
         
        A. Well, you're sitting there reading the statement, not me.”  
         T664.25-48 
        
       
      
     
     
     (ix) Then there was the following evidence: 
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you say that from time to time both before and after February 2001 you drove the truck on occasion? 
         
        A. Yeah, very rarely. 
         
         
        Q. And that included driving it on the highway? 
         
        A. Might be out in the middle of nowhere, yes. 
         
         
        Q. That included towing a caravan? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. When you were towing the caravan normally that would be when you were travelling from one show to the next? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. So it was your practice that sometimes when you were travelling from one show to the next you would drive your truck and caravan, is that right? 
         
        A. I guess so.”  
         T665.14-30 
        
       
      
     
     
     (x) Mr Davis agreed he had been caught driving without a licence in 2002, and in 2006 he had been caught without an appropriate licence.  
      
      
     (xi) Mr Davis maintained he always had a driver who drove his truck and if he did not,  
     ‘I used to get my dad’s employees to drive it.” 
      T666.15 
      At the first trial he had said if he did not have someone employed to drive he would get his brother to drive. 
      
     
     (xii) Mr Davis had good reason to be dishonest about having been at the accident site as he lacked a driving licence and had, if Ms Grey is to be accepted, been the cause of the collision. 
    (b) Bega Show: Mr Davis told me he had not been at the Bega show in 2006. But when it became apparent there was evidence to the contrary (as there was) he said “Well if I was there and you’ve got evidence of it I was obviously there, mate.”  T667.34(c) Book Keeping and Income Tax: Mr Davis agreed that in 2001 he paid no tax on his income, paid employees in cash, kept no wages books, made no tax deductions from wages, kept no workers compensation insurance, and used his pockets as his principal bank account.(d) Caravan: At the first trial he said his caravan had three stripes, but to me he said it had two. (e) Attitude To Tax Laws: Mr Davis expressed amusement when it was put to him by Mr Maconachie that in 2001 he decided what laws to obey and what not to obey, in particular, tax laws T816. Then he admitted convictions for a number of offences including assaults occasioning actual bodily harm, in 1997 and in 2001. He admitted that in 2001 he was a man given to violence and had been violent to Ms Grey – though he said she had been violent to him, too.(g) Demeanour: To my observation, at times Mr Davis treated these court proceedings with some levity. When cross-examined on a document which he considered irrelevant to the case; he laughed and spoke over the cross-examiner T694-697 and displayed signs of volatility. But I do consider that a witness, especially as Mr Davis is, poorly educated, and unused to court proceedings, may well have a natural inclination to laugh in such a situation. 
    123 There were some positive, and some neutral, matters: 
     
      
      (a) There was evidence before me that in September 2001 the police learned that Mr Davis was working at the Young show, and in police uniform travelled to Young to interview him about the accident, but were told, when they got to Young, that he had left. That evidence was relied on by the interests who were attacking Mr Davis as evidence of flight, consistent only with a guilty mind. I am not satisfied the failure of the police to find him, and being told he had left, is necessarily significant. They were in uniform and it is not unknown in tightly knit circles for people to lie to police when they go looking for a member of that circle. I infer show people may have misled police by giving them false information, without Mr Davis necessarily having had any involvement. 
       
       
      (b) Although Mr Davis sold the truck and caravan after the accident, he did not do so for quite some time. He still had them when police interviewed him in February 2002. Nor did any of the parties opposed to his interests, suggest the vehicles were incapable of being traced. 
      
     
     
      
      (c) Mr Davis’ accounts at the two trials were reasonably consistent with each other and with what he told police. 
      
     
     
      
      (d) I agree with Mr Seton’s submission that Mr Davis gave his evidence in a confident fashion. However I reject Mr Seton’s description of him as ‘non-evasive’. I consider he was evasive, especially about his driving history. 
      
     
     
      
      (e) I agree with Mr Seton Mr Davis seemed appropriately indignant when propositions were put to him which (if he were truthful) were incorrect and/or illogical. Though Mr Seton submitted he had not been caught out or shown to have been a contradictory witness, I disagree for the reasons shown above. 
      
     
     
      
      (f) I agree with Mr Seton that Mr Davis made a number of admissions against his own interests, such as: 
      
     
     
      
       (i) Conceding he knew it was possible before the Five Dock function was called off that it might be called off; 
       
       
      (ii) conceding that Mr Melonas had facilities at Hoxton Park which offered a convenient place to park his caravan; 
       
       
      (iii) acknowledging his vehicles were not garaged at addresses at which they were registered;  
      
     
     
      
      (iv) acknowledging advantages there would have been to him by taking his caravan to Sydney, such as fuel costs, and having better roads to travel on. 
       
       
      
    124 Overall, I was left with the clear impression Mr Davis, while in some ways apparently quite a straight forward witness, was not to be trusted in areas of importance. Tender of MFI#27: Extracts From Mr Davis’ Evidence at the First Trial125 At the conclusion of the trial, Mr Seton tendered MFI 27. I rejected the tender but said I would give my reasons now. These are my reasons. MFI 27 consists of seven pages of transcript from the first trial. Three pages (1500, 1501 and 1503) are from Mr Davis’ evidence in chief and the other four are from his cross-examination. Some parts were tendered as “context” evidence and others as prior consistent statements. The first section, lines 40 to 43 on p. 1500 were said to be context evidence. They followed 32 lines of examination concerning the route Mr Davis said he took to Sydney on leaving Nowra. At line 29 he described a shop he saw after he crossed a bridge when coming into Sydney. He said, “there’s a blue bait and tackle shop and a fish and chip shop just over a bridge”. The four lines tendered I rejected as they amounted only to counsel’s asking him to repeat an answer earlier given and added nothing, in particular, to “context”. In any event I consider the time to tender that and other “context” material was when the witness was in re-examination.126 Next, it was said lines 49 on p. 1500 to line 26 on p. 1501 were a prior consistent statement. But in the evidence Mr Davis merely gave a description of some roadway he said he was on when he received the telephone call telling him of cancellation of the event in Five Dock. There was nothing in his evidence to me significantly different from it. Counsel for the other parties did not suggest his evidence at the first trial of travelling to Sydney by a route which took him over a bridge near shops (as described in the passage) was inconsistent with evidence he gave me. In fact the two versions are consistent. Further, although counsel for other parties did suggest that evidence was fabricated, and that he was really on his way to Bega at the time, the statement said to be ‘consistent’ with the one he made to me, was made in his evidence to Judge Coorey almost four years after the event. The exercise of the discretion under s.108(3) depends on the effect of the evidence on the witness’ credibility: R v DBG [2002] NSWCCA 328 at [50]-[51]. I am unable to see how that evidence can assist me to decide whether Mr Davis’ evidence to me is fabricated. In other words, I do not think it has any effect on the suggestion of fabrication. It lacks importance: s.192(c) Evidence Act.127 Next, Mr Seton tendered lines 15-57 on p.1550 to and including lines 14 on p.1551 as a prior consistent statement. It is part of his cross-examination at the first trial. It shows a consistency in Mr Davis at both trials in asserting that though he initially said he travelled by the F5, he really travelled all the way to Sydney on the Princes Highway. Mr Seton submitted this evidence put in context Mr Davis’ apparently adamant attitude that he was on the M5, though he clearly was not. However I rejected this evidence for the same reasons I rejected the previous portion of evidence said to have been context evidence. 128 Finally, Mr Seton tendered lines 19 to 44 on p.1575 from the first trial, as a prior consistent statement. But for the same reasons I rejected the other passage said to be a prior consistent statement, I reject this portion. 129 I shall return later to say more about the issue of Mr Davis’ credit. Evidence of Mr Leslie John Davis130 Mr L. J. Davis brought up Mr Davis and is his grandfather, though he apparently is treated as and called by Mr Davis, his father. He was at the Nowra Show in 2001. As at 2001 he recalled Mr Davis had owned a truck and caravan for a year or so. Mr L. J. Davis had been to the Bega show in the past. When Mr Davis bought the truck and caravan, Mr L. J. Davis said he ceased to work for him and had to find thirty-five foot of “space”. That was said to be the position in 2001-2003 and prior years. 131 At Nowra in 2001 he had quite a bit of space. In February 2001 Mr Davis took some of his space.132 On the morning of 11 February Mr L. J. Davis left Nowra to go to Bega. On the Wednesday or Thursday before 11 February 2001 Mr Davis told him that after being in Nowra he intended to go to Sydney to do a festival with a Mr Peter Melonas and then travel to Gundagai. In cross-examination he was not challenged about that statement of intention.  
     
      
    Credit of Mr Leslie John Davis133 It was not submitted by any party that I ought not accept Mr Davis’ evidence. He gave his evidence by telephone. In support of the application to have his evidence given by telephone, Mr Seton tendered medical evidence to show he could not travel from his home in Yatala, Queensland. Ironically, on the day he gave evidence, he was in Grafton, and said he had recently driven to Wollongong, towing a caravan.Evidence of Colin Michael Fowler134 He is a retired police officer who in 2001 was stationed at Dapto. He received a call about the accident and visited the scene. He was given the number Mr Lear had taken from the caravan he had identified as the offending vehicle. Two days later he went to the Bega showground to see if he could identify the caravan whose number had been passed on to him by Mr Lear. Neither he nor those officers with him had been able to find the caravan. Over the next few months some anonymous telephone calls were received by the Bega police or by him, suggesting Mr Davis’ involvement. Mr Fowler followed them up. 135 Mr Barry, who called Mr Fowler, tendered notes of the anonymous calls made by police personnel. Mr Seton objected but I allowed them in because I considered them to be relevant to the issue of “due search and enquiry”. They strongly suggested a legitimate line of enquiry as to the identity of the driver responsible for the collision and were thus highly probative on that issue. They were not tendered for the truth of the assertions. So I could see no prejudice to Mr Davis. Mr Barry tendered, and I admitted, a document sent to Queensland police on 8 August 2001 with MFI ‘1’, Mr Lear’s statement to police. I admitted the documents, not for the truth of their contents but as proof of what documents were sent. I reserved the question of whether Mr Lear’s statement would go in for all purposes, or whether its admissibility should also be limited. I admit Mr Lear’s statement only as to the fact of what he said. He identified his signature on it when he gave evidence. But it was not put to him that it was inconsistent with his evidence to me. One inconsistency in it, relating to whether he had stopped or merely slowed down when recording the caravan’s number, was put to him. But another, that he had not said to police when first questioned by them, the caravan’s number plate was black on white, and that he was not sure of the actual colour merely that it was “dark”, was not put to him. While it does not follow that a prior inconsistent statement must always be tendered after a witness has been asked to respond to inconsistencies in it, there is an unfairness to Mr Davis if I let it in for all purposes, when the number plate evidence is, as I find, so significant. 136 Mr Fowler said he had tried to find Mr Davis on several occasions. He eventually spoke to him on 24 February 2002, when he denied any involvement in the collision. On that occasion Mr Fowler looked at the caravan Mr Davis identified as his but Mr Fowler did not consider it fitted the description of the one he was expecting to see, based on what he had been told by others he had spoken to about the accident. T795 Mr Fowler arranged for Queensland police to interview Mr Dee and Mr Bell. Ironically, a variation in the caravan’s registration number appeared in his written request to Queensland police. But that I consider was a typographical error and had no bearing on the enquiry’s outcome or in this case. Messrs Dee and Bell were interviewed on 9 August 2001. Mr Dee denied any involvement in the collision, save for confirming he had been present. Neither mentioned to police the presence of Mr Davis at the scene of the collision. Mr Fowler’s Credit137 No question arose about Mr Fowler’s credit. But insofar as it is relevant, I consider he gave his evidence honestly, and doing his best to be accurate. He seemed to me not to have a clear recollection of anything associated with his investigation however. He had long ago left the police service and I did not find it remarkable his memory of some matters was vague. He did have a clear memory for some things, such as having had printer problems when taking a statement from Mrs Broughton. 138 I shall now deal with some particular factual issues of significance.Mr Davis’ Alibi139 It is to be recalled that Mr Davis said he left his caravan in Nowra, drove to Sydney to attend a fair at Five Dock, got a substantial way there, received a telephone call saying the event had been cancelled because of rain, turned around, returned to Nowra, hitched up the caravan, drove through the Kangaroo Valley to Canberra, where he obtained some toys for show prizes, stayed several nights, and went to the Gundagai show. Thus he was nowhere near the accident site at the time it occurred. (a) I accept Mr L. J. Davis’ evidence that Mr Dean Davis told him during the week before the accident that he intended to go to Sydney after Nowra; he was not challenged on that evidence; I accept Mr Seton’s submission that having finished at Nowra and if he had no other show till the Gundagai show and intended to go to the Gundagai show the following weekend, it made sense for him to go to Five Dock for a day to earn some extra money;(b) Mr Davis said, and I accept, that Mr Davis had been to the fair at least once before the one on 11th February 2001; Ms Grey’s evidence was to similar effect;(c) Canada Bay Council records and meteorological records show very extensive rain fell in Ashfield (near Five Dock) on 6, 7 and 11th February 2005 and that games of the type Mr Davis had, were then excluded from the area where the fair was held; Mr Melonas had booked some space for sideshows; the decision to call off sideshow access was at 9.30 am on 11th February.(d) Mr Davis conceded to me however he knew prior to 11th February that there was a prospect the fair might be called off; Nowra had had heavy rain that week too;(e) Mr J. L. Davis said that he had less lettable space at the Bega show than he had at the Nowra show;  (f) Mr J. L. Davis and Mr Dean Davis, said that since Mr Dean Davis had acquired his own truck and caravan and no longer travelled with his parents, he had not travelled to the Bega show. But as the evidence shows, he did not stop going altogether; (g) Mr Melonas sublet a substantial part of Mr L. J. Davis’ space at Bega showground;  (h) He was in 2001 a close family friend of Mr L. J. Davis;  (i) He had also made arrangements to have games at the Five Dock fair on 11th February. I infer that once the Five Dock show was in doubt Mr Dean Davis would have been prepared to travel to Bega to see what work he could find, although there was not necessarily space available to him. There was no other near show before the Gundagai show;  (j) Apart from Mr Melonas’s significant presence at Bega, Mr Davis’ family had close connections with the Bega showground; further, his brother was to be there; (k) It does seem puzzling that he would go to the Canberra showground at a time when there was no show being held and no way of earning any income there. Though Mr Davis maintained he had to go to Canberra to get his game prizes, he conceded these prizes were usually ordered and delivered to show sites.  (l) There were no receipts for any of the goods Mr Davis says he purchased at Canberra; (m) However Mr Seton tendered a photocopy of a receipt made out to Mr Davis on 14 February 2001 for accommodation at the Canberra showground. Ms Grey said they were at the Canberra showground for several nights. There is thus no disagreement between her and Mr Davis on this issue. However Mr Seton put to me that the receipt is evidence he was not conducting himself in a way suggestive of an attempt to hide. Mr Davis told me he paid some money to a friend when he left Canberra, and asked the friend to pay for his accommodation. There is some substance in the argument; (I also note this has some relevance to Ms Grey’s credit, because of her suggestion Mr Davis was in effect hiding out at the Canberra showground.)(n) It was argued that it was somewhat illogical, if Mr Davis intended driving from Nowra to Sydney then to Canberra, to leave his caravan in Nowra, drive back to Nowra from Sydney, and then drive to Canberra on a much less agreeable road, the Kangaroo Valley route. It would have been so much easier, it was put to me, that he take the caravan to Sydney, where he could have camped at Mr Melonas’ home at Hoxton Park, and driven on the F5 from Sydney to Canberra. Both Mr Davis and Ms Grey said they had previously stayed at Mr Melonas’. Though Mr Davis said there would have been a charge for staying with Mr Melonas, and he had prepaid for the night at Nowra, the fuel costs involved in returning to Nowra then proceeding to Canberra via the Kangaroo Valley were, I infer, less than any such accommodation charge would have been. In any event I am not persuaded Mr Melonas would have charged him anything, given the close family relationship;(o) There was evidence that the Kangaroo Valley route was not the longest route from Nowra to Canberra: travelling down the south coast to Batemans Bay, then up the Clyde Mountain, to Braidwood, and along the Kings Highway to Canberra, is the longest route – 270 kilometres. The shortest is via the Nerriga Road, 202 kilometres, and that via Kangaroo Valley is 212 kilometres. If Mr Davis was being truthful about not wanting to take the caravan to Sydney, the route he says he took, through the Kangaroo Valley, does not seem to me, on the evidence, to have been an unreasonable route;(p) There were no receipts for fuel bought on the journey, or of any relevant truck servicing. The absence of contemporaneous documents is not necessarily significant, however, given Mr Davis paid no tax and kept no business records. Further, if he was not the driver of the offending vehicle and did not know this was alleged for quite some time, why bother to keep such documents if he ever had them? (q) Other Considerations: There was no explanation for the absence from the witness box of Mr Melonas. As Mr Stitt put to me, this was a central part of Mr Davis’ alibi case. Mr Seton put to me however that others could have called Mr Melonas. Mr Barry that he could not necessarily have improved Mr Davis’ case. I decline to draw the inference Mr Stitt invited me to draw. Apart from the fact that he was available to all, I am not persuaded he could have assisted to throw more light on the alibi case than there is.(r) The entrance to the Snowy Mountain Highway was conveniently located near the accident site, making it a simple and logical way for Mr Davis to get away from the accident scene and escape early detection. Even if he did not go straight onto it, there were other roads in the Bega area which connected with that road.(s) The evidence given by Mr Davis about having travelled to Sydney from Nowra via the M5 is, as I see it, a neutral factor. The journey as described by Mr Davis was consistent with his having travelled on the Princes Highway all the way. Although Mr Davis said at the first trial he travelled on the M5, I consider that could be an error on his part in describing the route through southern Sydney after travelling along the Princes Highway. Although it was put by Mr Black that Mr Davis had been adamant at the first trial he had travelled via the M5, I do not accept that description. Rather, as I see his evidence, he was adamant in describing the route he took, whatever the route was called. Overall I do not consider there is compelling evidence to reject the alibi, without regard for other evidence, such as that of Ms Grey.The Identification By Number Plate Evidence 140 There was a substantial body of evidence concerning number plates. (a) The number recorded by Mr Lear was what linked Mr Dee to the accident as the driver of the offending vehicle and led to there being a substantial case against him as the offending driver. Mr Lear and his daughter (both of whom were completely independent) said the caravan whose number they recorded, and which was at the top of the hill, was the one they had earlier seen being towed by the offending vehicle. Yet that evidence is puzzling, because both denied the relevant caravan had been the one Mr Dee said he was towing that day. (b) Mr Lear was adamant when giving evidence before me that the number plate on the offending vehicle had been black and white, had begun with an ‘O’ and had no state identification; whereas the Dee caravan, while it had the numbers and sequence ‘34209’, did not have an ‘O’, was not black and white, but green or blue on white, and had a state identification, namely that of Victoria. Further, evidence tendered by Mr Veigel’s counsel showed that at the time of the collision there was no current issued number plate in any Australian State or Territory, carrying the number which Mr Lear and his daughter say they recorded. (c) I have considered what explanation there may be for what on its face seems a series of errors: a) recording of the wrong number; and b) identifying the caravan at the top of the hill as the one towed by the offending vehicle, when they said it was not the one Mr Dee says he left on the top of the hill. Mr Lear told me that after he noticed what he took to be the relevant caravan, he stopped to take down the number. However his daughter told Judge Coorey he had not stopped but had simply slowed down. It was put to Mr Lear by Mr Maconachie that at the first trial he had said that he had just slowed down. His reply was, “Did I? I can’t recall.” But he maintained to me that he had actually stopped. Given his earlier evidence of having only slowed, and that of his daughter to like effect, I think it probable they only slowed – and did not stop. Given Mr Dee’s caravan had the last five of the six numbers Mr Lear recorded, and that those five were in the same sequence as on Mr Dee’s caravan, I consider that between father and daughter, they made an error, and wrote down ‘O’ instead of ‘F’ as the beginning of the sequence.(d) Quite apart from the fact that, as I am satisfied was the case, Mr Lear did not stop, the collision, I am satisfied, was a most dramatic event for both of them to have witnessed. Further, given Mr Lear and April Lear saw two vehicles had stopped just after the accident site, I consider they each incorrectly jumped to the conclusion that there was a greater connection of the stopping, with the accident, than there was in fact. That is, they each assumed the driver of the truck towing the caravan they saw, had stopped precisely because he had caused the accident. It is to be recalled they only saw one caravan and truck on the hill;(e) As Mr Lear acknowledged, mistakes can occur, with the best will in the world. (f) I have considered the possibility that Mr Lear and April Lear were not in error. Mr Lear was very confident in his evidence that the caravan whose number he took was the offending one. April Lear was also apparently quite confident, at least in her evidence in chief.(g) If they were not in error, someone must have changed the number plate after the caravan left the top of the hill. But there is a further difficulty. That is that both Mr Lear and April Lear said the caravan Mr Dee said he left at the top of the hill was not the offending one. What follows from that is the possibility that Mr Dee, after he left the top of the hill, took the caravan somewhere and got another, and later passed it off as the one he had been towing that day, persuading loss assessors and police that was the one involved so they would take photographs of it. But as I have earlier observed, there is no evidence the number plate was changed. Nor is there any evidence Mr Dee swapped caravans and passed off a different one as the one he was towing that day. Further, there was a repair account in evidence showing a caravan insured in the name of Mr Owen Bell, with the registration number F-34209, received some repairs on 29 November 2000. It was described as a “Royal Flair Caravan” in the account. That I think gives support to Mr Dee’s evidence that the one he parked at the top of the hill was the one in the photograph in Exhibit ‘L’. It is possible Mr Bell owned more than one caravan. But there is no evidence he did. There was also evidence a comprehensive insurance policy on the caravan had been in force for some years. The policy showed the pre 1996 registration number (D94306) but it was not suggested that caravan was other than the one Mr Dee said he was towing.(h) It is to be recalled that Mr Lear said the offending truck had a pantechnicon assembly taking up about a third of the truck’s tray. There is no evidence the truck Mr Dee drove had such an assembly on it. Its tray had been modified for the children’s ride and carrying that ride was its only purpose. When asked what it was about the truck/caravan combination to cause him to say he had had no difficulty in identification, he said: “I was fairly certain that they were the caravan and truck…because they were similar and looked the same as the ones that were going up the hill.”  Mr Lear did say however Mr Dee’s truck was very similar to the one towing the relevant caravan.(i) There was no evidence the Bell group had a caravan with a black and white number plate at the time, though it has one now. What the number is was not in evidence. (j) Although Mr Dee initially said the caravan had a black and white number plate, he later said it might have been green and white.(k) The dangers of convicting people for criminal offences based on identification of people, have long been the subject of warnings to juries. The dangers in a criminal trial of identification evidence concerning a motor vehicle have been said to be even greater. They were discussed in R v Clout (1995) 41 NSWLR 312. There the Court of Criminal Appeal (Kirby A-CJ) at 320-321 said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The fundamental problem is the same, and in one sense more acute, in the case of the identification of objects as in the case of identification of humans. Every human is distinct and unique in appearance. Differences exist even between identical twins. But objects, such as knives or trucks will typically, today, be mass-produced, bearing similarity to thousands of other virtually identical objects.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    (l) Of course this is not a criminal case, but even where, as here, the burden of proof is the balance of probabilities, identification dangers are similar. As the above considerations show, there is reason to have disquiet about such evidence here.The Submissions141 Mr Black ultimately made no specific submission about the party I ought find was the driver of the offending vehicle. Mr Barry submitted that there was an overwhelming case against Mr Davis. Neither Mr Black nor Mr Barry sought to argue for a case against the Nominal Defendant.142 Mr Stitt submitted that the evidence supports a finding that the owner and driver of the truck towing the caravan is known and identified: if Mr Lear and April Lear are accepted, the owner was Elwin Bell and its driver Jamie Dee. But if Owen Bell and Stacey Grey are accepted, the owner and driver was Mr Davis. He submitted that the court must decide which version is more probable. 143 Mr Stitt submitted that the evidence does not permit a finding that some other truck towing a caravan was present on the hill and involved in the accident. On no available version, he submitted, is there scope for a finding that an unidentified vehicle was causally involved in the accident’s occurrence. He referred me to Howell v The Nominal Defendant (1961-2) 108 CLR 552 for the proposition that s.34 Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 authorizes the enforcement of a claim against the Nominal Defendant only where the identity of the motor vehicle cannot be established, in the sense that the vehicle cannot be found: it has no application where a plaintiff is unable to decide which of two vehicles, both or one being known, caused the injury.144 For Messrs Dee and Bell, Mr Maconachie submitted that I would find Mr Davis was the driver of the vehicle at fault. First, two witnesses, Ms Grey and Mr Bell, identified him as the driver at fault, and gave evidence of flight. Ms Grey’s evidence was exculpatory of Mr Dee: I should accept her as a credible witness, and, with reservations, I should accept significant parts of Mr Bell’s; further, I should accept Mr Dee. The assumption by Mr Lear and April Lear that the truck and caravan combination they saw at the top of the hill had been the offending combination was incorrect. They had made honest mistakes. Finally, the description of the offending truck and caravan given by witnesses, accords closely with the appearance of Mr Davis’ truck and caravan.145 Mr Seton, for Mr Davis, submitted that if the evidence of Mr Bell and Ms Grey is rejected, (as he submitted it should be) there is no evidence to support a finding that Mr Davis’ truck and caravan caused the accident. Mr Seton referred to what he described as the dilemma: there is “compelling evidence from Mr Lear that identified a vehicle that is not the Dee caravan and…compelling evidence from Mr Lear and…his young daughter it is the vehicle that caused the accident and…not inconsistent with that is Mr Hodkinson’s. The dilemma is though you have Mr Dee’s evidence that he was in front of Mr Bell…[I]f you accept Mr Dee as a truthful witness then Mr Lear has made an error in his recalling of the number…[and] in the description of the van up the top. But it doesn’t mean that Mr Lear has given any evidence that identifies Mr Davis’ vehicle.” He urged me to reject Ms Grey, Mr Bell, Mr Dee and Mr E Bell, and to accept Mr Davis. He urged me not to draw adverse inferences against Mr Davis for not having called Mr Melonas. He submitted Mr Davis had given a plausible reason for leaving his caravan in Nowra, and that the documentary evidence from the Canada Bay Council supported his alibi case and was compellingly consistent with his version of events.Consideration146 If I accept Mr Seton’s submissions, it would follow that Ms Grey and Messrs Dee and Owen Bell perjured themselves and attempted to pervert the course of justice. If I were to accept Mr Maconachie’s submissions, it would follow that Mr Davis perjured himself. Whichever party I find was driving will, potentially, be exposed to a criminal prosecution for (at least) a breach of s.52A(3)(c) Crimes Act, 1900. 147 This is an unusual case. There is strong evidence pointing to the involvement of Mr Dee. And there is strong evidence pointing to the involvement of Mr Davis. 148 Mr Seton began his submission as follows: 
     
      
      In our submission there are two basic ways to approach the factual dispute. One is to go straight to the kernel of the issue of, do I believe the Bell/Grey evidence or do I believe the Davis evidence. Look at that and then at the same time keep in the background the other evidence of the various eye witnesses. The other way is to start in perhaps a more typical police way, in an investigative way. Go to the eye witnesses who saw the accident, take the information from them and then to work backwards. 
      
    149 I have considered the case from both perspectives. However, whichever of those routes is taken leads me to find (as I do) that on the balance of probabilities the offending vehicle was driven by Mr Davis, and that his negligent driving caused Mrs Broughton to cross to the other side of the road and collide with the oncoming car of Mr Veigel, causing the injuries to both plaintiffs. These are my reasons: (a) What Eye Witnesses Said About the Caravan And Truck Driven By The Offending Driver: There is a consistency of descriptions by eye witnesses of the offending vehicle, and there is some consistency of those descriptions with descriptions of the caravan and truck Mr Davis had at the time. The following description of Mr Davis’ caravan and truck comes from evidence he gave or which came from police or registration authorities: CARAVAN: 
     
      22 feet in length; 
      
      cream in colour; 
      
      registration number 001 QCM; 
      
      the word “Scenic” on front and back; 
      
      steel rack on back with two tyres attached; 
      
      two or three stripes on the side; 
      
      no rear windows but windows in front; and 
      
      trafficator assembly with tail lights, 10”x24”, horizontal mounting. 
      
      
     TRUCK 
     : 
      
      White cabin; 
      
      white pantech on back; 
      
      registered in Queensland. 
      
      
     The following is a summary of descriptions of the offending vehicle (I have excluded Mr Owen Bell’s observations): 
     CARAVAN:  
     
     MR HODKINSON 
     : 
      
      Whitish in colour; 
      
      not tall; 
      
      a distinctive reddy/orangy coloured stripe down the sides approximately half way between top and bottom; 
      
      seven to eight metres in length; 
      
      four wheels; 
      
      dual axle; 
      
      similar to old Department of Main Roads caravan; 
      
      an older style; 
      
      could not recall if it had rear windows; 
      
      similar colour to Mr Dee’s caravan but a different style; 
      
      more a production type caravan than Mr Dee’s, which he thought looked purpose built. 
      
      
     MR LEAR 
     : 
      
      white/creamy; 
      
      fairly long; 
      
      dual axle; 
      
      no rear windows; 
      
      some writing on the back 21 centimetres high saying, “Majestic” or “Majesty”; 
      
      small turning indicator and tail light combined, rectangular in shape, smaller than the size of a tissue box; 
      
      small black and white number plate, no state designation, began with an ‘O’. 
      
      
     APRIL LEAR 
     : 
      
      Bright colour such as yellow or white; 
      
      not really short; 
      
      a normal one. 
      
      
     STACEY GREY 
     : 
      
      27 feet long; 
      
      dual axle; 
      
      cream colour; 
      
      dark brown stripe along the side with a lighter stripe below;  
      
      a tail light on each side at rear; 
      
      no rear window. 
      
      
     MRS BROUGHTON 
     : 
      
      No rear window; 
      
      a bar across the back; 
      
      could recall something written on the back; 
      
      all white; 
      
      saw no stripes on the side; 
      
      recalled no windows on the side; 
      
      
     TRUCK 
     : 
       
      
     MR HODKINSON 
     : 
      
      Not a pantech 
      
      small, less than 5 tonnes; 
      
      white or light in colour; 
      
      vertical exhaust on left hand side, greyish, canvas type canopy rather than a metal structure, roughly level with the top of the cabin; 
      
      similar to pick up trucks common in the city; 
      
      
     MR LEAR 
     : 
      
      Metal box on back; 
      
      creamy/white cabin; 
      
      could not recall vertical exhaust; 
      
      like a pantech but not a full pantech truck; 
      
      some sort of box at the back, made of metal. 
      
      
     No eye witness recalled seeing a bar at the back of the offending caravan with two tyres attached to it, although Mrs Broughton recalls a bar. I take into account that tyres on the bar would have been distinctive. I also take into account that when investigating police saw Mr Davis’ caravan and truck in Canberra a year after the accident it did not fit the description of what Mr Fowler was hoping to see, although he had spoken to witnesses and obtained descriptions from them of the offending vehicle. Mr Fowler did recall when giving evidence that the caravan was pale in colour and dual axle.  
      
    (b) Despite variations in recollection, I consider the events would have been dramatic and shocking for witnesses.(c) Every eye witness shown photographs of Mr Dee’s caravan said the caravan depicted in those photographs was not or did not look like the offending caravan; (d) Despite an apparently thorough investigation by police and insurance investigators, there is no evidence Mr Dee or anyone else changed the number plate on his caravan, or that he passed off to the police or insurance investigators a caravan as the one he towed that day which was other than the one he towed that day; (e) No caravan identified as having involvement in the accident had a stripe except Mr Davis’; (f) Mr Dee said he saw a little white truck towing a small caravan pass him when he was at the top of the hill; that is consistent with Mr Davis’ description of his own truck and caravan;(g) Although I have expressed some reservations about Mr Dee’s evidence, I accept his evidence that he was at the time of the accident ahead of Mr Bell, and that his vehicles were not involved in the accident;(h) I accept Ms Grey’s evidence that Mr Davis was at the scene of the accident and involved in the accident; (i) I accept Mr E Bell’s evidence that his son Owen lived at the time of the accident in the caravan Mr Dee said he was towing that day;(j) I am satisfied (and so find) Mr Lear and April Lear, probably because they did not stop at the top of the hill, made an error when they: 
     
      (i) recorded the number of the caravan they saw parked at the top of the hill; 
      
     (ii) described the caravan they saw at the top of the hill as the offending caravan. 
      
     Their evidence is the only evidence connecting Mr Dee’s vehicle to the accident; (k) Mr Lear was adamant the number plate on the offending caravan began with an ‘O’; Mr Davis’ caravan had a registration number beginning with an ‘O’; (l) The fact that Mr Owen Bell and Mr Dee (as I find they did) returned to the scene of the accident for a period of at least twenty minutes;(m) The fact that Mr Owen Bell, the caravan’s owner, while at the scene gave his personal details to Senior Constable Milton;(n) The fact that Mr Owen Bell (as I find he did) owned a green Commodore at the time, and it was travelling behind him on its way from Nowra to Bega, and it was Mr Dee’s evidence (which I accept) that Mr Bell told him at the time of the accident he thought his car had just been involved in an accident, so they should stop and go back;(o) Consistent with the above, but having minimal weight, is Mr Own Bell’s history to police of seeing the offending vehicle being a small truck towing a caravan, and his evidence to me Mr Davis was the driver, and his telling his father at the time of Mr Davis’ involvement;(p) Mr Davis’ propensity, which I find he had, to drive his truck on the highway, whenever it suited him, and, as I am satisfied occurred when he gave evidence before me, to lie about his propensity to drive without a licence;(q) The fact that (as I do) I reject Mr Davis’ evidence that he was not present at the time and place of the accident;(r) Mr Davis’ motive in lying and fleeing, as I find he did, to escape detection and prosecution for significant offences;(s) I have considered why Mr Bell gave no details to police about Mr Davis’ presence at the accident site. The evidence of Messrs Owen Bell, Elwin Bell, Jamie Dee, Dean Davis and Ms Grey persuades me there is an ethos among sideshow people which involves protecting each other from law enforcement authorities. Further, I have referred to the general difficulty in theorising about why people lie;(t) In dealing with Ms Grey’s evidence I have referred to the fact that she gave evidence which both inculpated and exculpated Mr Davis. Mr Bell’s evidence was also both incriminatory and exculpatory of Mr Davis. I have taken account of that;(u) As I have observed, there was no evidence which corroborated that of Ms Grey as to Mr Davis’ overtaking game. But I accept, having seen Mr Davis give evidence, that conduct of that kind on the road is quite within his capacity and inclination. He is a larrikin character, with little regard for rules, and a ready inclination to engage in disinhibited conduct of that type. The probability I think (and I so find) is that he was behind Mr Bell’s vehicle, and about three quarters of the way up the hill. He could see he might lose an opportunity to pass if he did not pass soon. I find he failed to check to see what cars were in the overtaking lane, and made an impulsive decision; he put on his indicator, but before ensuring it was safe to do so, just began to move into the adjoining lane. (v) There is a consistency in the sequence of events, i.e. that Mr Dee, as he and Mr Bell both said, was travelling ahead of Mr Bell. None of the eye witnesses recalls seeing a truck and caravan fitting the description of Mr Dee’s rig going up the hill. But a number recall Mr Bell’s semi. 150 A matter Mr Seton spent a great deal of time exploring was the sighting, at the top of the hill, of two men standing near two trucks, apparently talking. In the end I am not persuaded they were Mr Bell and Mr Dee. They could have been anyone. That evidence is not evidence I find helpful in any way in resolving any issue. Mr Seton submitted Mr Bell had been one of those men: that he knew someone had taken the caravan’s number, so must have seen Mr Lear at the top of the hill recording it. But Mr Bell said his then girlfriend or fiancée had learned at the accident site such a thing had occurred. I consider it more likely Mr Bell learnt of this at the site and not at the top of the hill. 151 There was also exploration and speculation in cross-examination and in addresses, about the series of anonymous telephone calls to police suggesting the involvement of Mr Davis. I do not see it as necessary for me to make any finding as to who made the calls. In any event I have not had regard for their contents in any way except as part of the history given by Mr Fowler when describing the steps taken by police to investigate the collision. 152 Although there were different accounts by eye witnesses about the number of trucks with caravans in the vicinity of the accident site at the time of the accident, I do not regard that as a material matter or necessary for me to resolve. That is precisely the type of issue about which versions might differ in the circumstances of a dramatic incident.153 Finally, it is necessary to say something about the way in which the collision was caused. In one version given by Mr Bell, there was this evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. And at the time I think you saw it going across the wrong side of the road, the vehicle that we [was?] being driven by Dean Davis was partly in the overtaking lane and partly on the inside lane? 
       
      A. No. He was overtaking, yeah, like, he was coming out from behind me.” 
      
    154 Ms Grey said of the overtaking game and its relationship to the accident: 
     
      
      “As he was mucking around he – like the last time he done it before the accident, he must have seen the car coming and he’s – I know he really quickly pulled back in because the caravan jerked as we pulled in.” 
        
       T152.25 
       
       
      
    155 She was asked whether she had seen the car behind Mr Davis’ truck and van and she said, “Yes, I did in the rear vision mirror. In my mind I’ve got a glimpse of an either grey or blue commodore.” Then, she said, the accident occurred ‘closer to the pantech on the side.’ [i.e. next to the tray of the truck]: The ‘crash’ occurred she said, almost at the instant he moved back to the left. I accept her evidence that she later asked him to stop but that he said he could not because he was on his Ls and that the police would be everywhere. I find she was in error when saying the Commodore’s colour was blue or grey.Flight Evidence156 As I have observed, I have relied in part, for my finding that Mr Davis was liable for causing the collision, on his subsequent flight. The evidence that Mr Davis immediately after the collision, as I find, changed course and headed for Canberra, was put to me by Mr Barry and others as evidence of flight. Thus, it was said, there was corroboration, since Mr Davis had a guilty mind. 157 When a jury in a criminal trial is asked to attribute consciousness of guilt to post offence conduct, the judge must direct the jury to consider alternative explanations for the conduct which would not lead to the inference: R v Edwards (1992) 173 CLR 653; R v Renzella [1997] V.R. 88.158 When Mr Davis changed course and went to Canberra, his flight may have been simply from panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence extraneous to the offence: Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 211. But accepting, as I do, that he made the statements to Ms Grey about the need to get away because he was on Ls and police would be everywhere, I find his departure was probably due to his knowledge that he had just been responsible for an accident, and, especially if caught by the police without a licence, would be in serious trouble with the criminal law. Collision Findings159 I make the following findings of fact:(a) the accident occurred at approximately 2.10pm on 11 February 2001;(b) the accident occurred on the Princes Highway, about 10km north of Bega, just south of Stoney Creek Bridge;(c) the Princes Highway crossed Stoney Creek Bridge and comprised one lane in each direction at that point;(d) Mrs Broughton was driving a Holden Commodore registered number WMD 973;(e) Mr Veigel was driving a Datsun 200B stationwagon registered number VSJ 755;(f) the accident occurred when the front of Mrs Broughton’s vehicle collided with the front of Mr Veigel’s vehicle at high speed;(g) At the time of the accident Mrs Broughton was travelling in a generally southerly direction;(h) At the time of the accident Mr Veigel was travelling in a generally northerly direction;(i) approximately 25 metres beyond Stoney Creek Bridge, the Princes Highway widened into an overtaking lane for vehicles travelling south, as the highway ascended a hill;(j) the highway deviated slightly to the right and then curved to the left for southbound traffic;(k) at the point where the accident occurred, there were two lanes for southbound traffic and one lane for northbound traffic;(l) the northbound and southbound lanes were separated by a double white unbroken line;(m) the accident took place on Mrs Broughton’s incorrect side of the road;(n) the point of impact between the two vehicles occurred 2-3 metres into the northbound lane;(o) skid marks caused by Mr Veigel’s vehicle were seen by police who visited the scene soon after, in a straight line wholly within his lane, leading to the point of impact;(p) at rest, Mr Veigel’s vehicle was raised on the guard rail on its near side;(q) prior to the time when the traffic which was travelling south reached Stoney Creek Bridge, it had banked up in a long convoy behind Mr Bell’s slow travelling truck, a Kenworth semi-trailer;(r) Mr Bell’s vehicle consisted of a prime-mover of approximately 18 feet in length, to which was affixed a semi-trailer of approximately 32 feet in length;(s) on the tray of the semi-trailer was carried an amusement ride called the “Cha Cha”;(t) the prime-mover and the trailer were owned by the Bell Amusements Group;(u) behind the prime-mover were a number of other vehicles including a truck towing a caravan owned and driven by Mr Davis, a Landcruiser, a green Commodore (Mrs Broughton) and a Holden Commodore station wagon (Mr Lear);(v) Mr Lear was travelling with his daughter, April Lear, directly behind Mrs Broughton’s vehicle;(w) the truck towing the caravan was registered number 497 EZM and the caravan was registered number 001 QCM;(x) on 11 February 2001, Mr Dee was driving motor vehicle registration number FGZ-993, towing caravan having registration number F34-209 in a southerly direction along the Princes Highway in New South Wales;(y) on 11 February 2001, motor vehicle registered number FGZ-993 was owned by Mr Elwin Bell;(z) on 11 February 2001, caravan registered number F34-209 was owned by Mr Owen Bell;(aa) at all relevant times prior to the collision, there was only one truck towing a caravan behind the vehicle being driven by Mr Bell;(ab) the truck towing the caravan which was involved in the accident, was:(i) a single axle rigid truck which seemed old;(ii) like a Pantech;(iii) a light colour with a vertical exhaust pipe near the cabin on the passenger’s side;(iv) flat-fronted, like a small delivery truck; (ac) the caravan was:(i) white, long, dual axle without a rear window;(ii) large, white in colour with a stripe or stripes down each side;(iii) with dual wheels, an older style caravan;(iv) fitted with a horizontal light mount which was rectangular;(ad) as the Princes Highway widened into an overtaking lane, the following events occurred: (i) Mr Bell pulled into or remained in the left hand or slow lane in his Kenworth semi-trailer;(ii) at this time he was travelling at a speed of approximately 70kph but his speed was dropping as he climbed the hill and as he went down through the gears of his truck;(iii) at this point, the vehicles behind the truck and caravan began to overtake the semi-trailer;(iv) the green Commodore driven by Mrs Broughton crossed into the right hand overtaking lane;(v) Mrs Broughton’s vehicle began accelerating up the overtaking lane;(vi) at a point part way up the hill the truck towing the caravan pulled into the overtaking lane to overtake the slower semi-trailer;(vii) at some point during this manoeuvre, and as a result of it, Mrs Broughton steered her car to the right across the double unbroken lines and into the single lane for traffic going north, where she collided head-on with Mr Veigel’s car;(ae) the collision occurred next to the Kenworth semi-trailer at some point which was still visible to Mr Owen Bell in his rear vision mirror;(af ) the overtaking truck and caravan and Mr Bell’s semi-trailer continued up the hill;(ag) Mr Bell directed Mr Dee to pull up, as he thought that his car was the green Commodore involved in the accident;(ah) Mr Dee and Mr Bell pulled their vehicles over on the eastern side of the roadway at a point south of where the accident occurred;(ai) the two trucks were then parked in that area off the highway;(aj) Mr Lear was about 100 metres behind Mrs Broughton at the time of impact. He then stopped for a short time to provide assistance and his details to Mrs Broughton or her son before returning to his vehicle and continuing his journey south with his daughter;(ak) upon reaching the top of the hill, Mr Lear and Miss Lear saw a truck and a caravan which they each believed had been involved in the accident, parked on the eastern side of the roadway;(al) Mr Lear read out from the back of the caravan and Miss Lear recorded on a piece of paper, the registration number of the caravan which he believed was involved in the accident; Mr Lear did not stop his car to make that record; he merely slowed down;(am) that registration number was later provided by Mr Lear to police;(an) the vehicles pulled over on the side of the road and observed by Mr Lear and Miss Lear were the vehicles driven by Mr Jamie Dee and Mr Bell;(ao) Mr Lear and Miss Lear was each mistaken both in the number they recorded and as to the caravan’s having been the one which had caused the accident;(ap) Mr Hodkinson was driving a red Falcon utility along the Princes Highway at the time of the accident;(aq) there was a white vehicle in front of him which was Mr Lear’s vehicle;(ar) Mr Hodkinson saw a green vehicle in front of Mr Lear’s vehicle which was Mrs Broughton’s vehicle;(as) Mr Hodkinson observed a truck and caravan in front of the green vehicle which was the subject truck and caravan.(at) the subject truck and caravan were owned, driven and towed by Mr Davis;(au) the collision between Mrs Broughton’s vehicle and Mr Veigel’s vehicle was caused by the negligence of Mr Davis. 
     
      
    160 It follows that the proceedings against Messrs Dee and Bell, and the Nominal Defendant, should be dismissed, and that judgment should be entered for each of Mr Veigel and Mrs Broughton, against Mr Davis.161 I propose to make the following orders, but will defer making them until I hear submissions:PROPOSED ORDERS:8279/02

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Johnson J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Jodi Cian Ryan, seeks leave under s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Coolahan in the District Court on 9 September 2008. 
     
      
    3 The Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (300 grams of amphetamines) contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years or a fine of $385,000 or both, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The Applicant pleaded guilty as well to one count of possession of an unregistered firearm contrary to s.36(1) Firearms Act 1996, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 10 years.  
     
      
    4 The Applicant requested that no fewer than forty offences be taken into account on a Form 1 when passing sentence on the drug supply charge. The offences on the Form 1 comprised 26 offences of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime, three offences of possession of a prohibited drug (cannabis, amphetamine and methylamphetamine), two offences of not keeping a firearm safely (a pistol), possession of ammunition without a permit, four offences of possession of prohibited weapons (being a Taser, a mace, an extendable baton and a modified sword capable of being worn on the arm), possession of an explosive for other than a lawful purpose (detonators), possession of an unauthorised prohibited firearm (described as a .38 special/.357 magnum calibre single shot power head), possession of a prescribed restricted substance (Oxazepam) and an offence of affray. 
     
      
    5 In relation to the drug supply count, taking into account the 40 matters on the Form 1, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment by way of a non parole period of five years and six months to date from 12 March 2008 and to expire on 11 September 2013, with a balance of term of three years and six months. For the offence of possession of an unregistered firearm, the Applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for two years and three months to date from 12 September 2007. 
     
      
    6 Accordingly, the Applicant was sentenced to a total effective non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of three-and-a-half years. The earliest date upon which the Applicant is eligible for release on parole is 11 September 2013. The sentencing Judge found special circumstances and the effective non parole period was 63 per cent of the effective total sentence. 
     
      
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    7 An agreed statement of facts was tendered by the Crown at the sentencing hearing and formed the basis for his Honour’s recital of the facts (ROS2-3). The facts were as follows. 
     
      
    8 In February 2007, Newcastle Police, together with the New South Wales Crime Commission, began an operation targeting the supply of prohibited drugs in the Newcastle area. The operation commenced on 22 March 2007, when investigators were granted a telephone intercept warrant in relation to a mobile telephone service known to be used by the Applicant. This service was monitored until 28 April 2007. On 29 May 2007, police investigators were granted a further telephone intercept warrant relating to a mobile telephone service, also known to be used by the Applicant. This service was monitored until 23 August 2007. 
     
      
    9 The monitoring of both of these services showed that they were used almost exclusively by the Applicant. In total, police intercepted in excess of 15,000 telephone calls and a similar number of SMS messages. These records, together with physical surveillance by police, established that the Applicant was a medium scale supplier of prohibited drugs, including amphetamines and methamphetamines, otherwise known as “ice”. Throughout the telephone recordings, the Applicant is heard on many occasions to discuss “ice”, also referred to as the “cold stuff” or the “normal” or the “other”, which are coded references to different forms of amphetamines. The Applicant also discusses weights, including “eight balls” (3.5 grams) and “full ones” (an ounce). 
     
      
    10 During the course of this police investigation, the Applicant supplied over 300 grams of amphetamine. On 12 September 2007, the Applicant was arrested outside her home. A search warrant was later executed at the house. In the house, police located drug supply paraphernalia, including small amounts of drugs, resealable plastic bags and electronic scales. 
     
      
    11 In addition, found under the bed in the Applicant’s bedroom, was a bag containing a .22 calibre pistol loaded with a live round in the firing chamber, together with a hand made mace, a Taser, detonators and a number of rounds of live ammunition. Also found in the bedroom was an extendable baton and a sword which was modified to be strapped to an arm. These items (other than the pistol) were contained in the charges set out in the Form 1. 
     
      
    12 A search warrant was executed on 13 September 2007 on a storage unit rented by the Applicant, in which were found large amounts of stolen jewellery, power tools and other items which had been previously stolen and traded for drugs. These items formed the 26 offences on the Form 1 with respect to dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime. 
     
      
    13 A later search of the Applicant’s computer revealed that she used the password “Drug lord” to access the computer. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Features 
       
      
    14 The Applicant was 34 years old at the time of the offences and thirty-five at the time of sentence. She has a lengthy criminal history, including offences of supply and possess prohibited drugs, assault, stealing, obtaining money by deception, possessing a prohibited weapon and ammunition and other matters. She has served a number of prison sentences, the longest being a sentence of imprisonment for three years with an 18 month non-parole period imposed in 2002 for an earlier offence of supplying a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    15 The Applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings and a pre sentence report was tendered, together with a psychological report by Mr John Taylor dated 22 March 2008. The pre-sentence report confirmed that overall, there had been a poor response by the Applicant to past supervision as intervention had produced limited results. However, the pre-sentence report recorded that the Applicant had developed considerable insight into her addiction since her incarceration in 2007, and had demonstrated a capacity to learn and respond well to counselling. She had enrolled in the Self Management and Recovery Training Program (the SMART Program). Mr Taylor expressed the opinion that the Applicant had a moderate risk of recidivism. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    16 Mr Bellanto QC, for the Applicant, relies upon three overlapping grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ground 1 - the learned sentencing Judge erred by failing to take into account and apply the principle of mercy, otherwise known as the crossroads principle, in sentencing the Applicant. 
       
       
      (b) Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred by taking into account matters that were not in evidence before him, in assessing the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation.  
       
       
      (c) Ground 3 - the sentencing Judge erred by failing to give proper weight to the Applicant’s remorse and contrition. 
       
      
    17 To place these grounds in context, it is appropriate to refer to certain observations and findings in the remarks on sentence. After setting out parts of the pre-sentence report and the report of Mr Taylor, his Honour referred to the Applicant’s evidence and said (ROS11-13): 
     
      
       
        
        “The overall impression I have gained is that the offender is very reluctant to take any real responsibility for the gravity of the supply charge in particular.  
        
       
       
        
        In cross-examination she maintained that the main motivation in engaging in the sale of drugs was to support her own habit. She said that she did not live an extravagant lifestyle and was in fact collecting social security benefits during the course of her dealing. She confirmed that the goods found during the course of the search of her storage facility were supplied to her in exchange for drugs. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In general, I find it difficult to accept some parts of the offender’s evidence. In my view she did tend to minimise at least the extent of her dealing. The reality is that the facts disclose that the extent of her dealing was far more than would have been possibly required to support her own drug habit but I do not think that I need to say any more about that. However, I am prepared to accept, and it seems to be supported by the evidence including her criminal history, that she was a person who for some time now has been subject to a drug addiction. Further, I think on balance that the offender does have some resolve to deal with that problem. She seems to have taken steps in this regard since she has been in custody and I take into account the course that she has been completing and the fact that she has not committed any institutional offences and is working within the prison system. I am also satisfied that she has the support of her family which will no doubt be of assistance to her if she maintains her resolve upon her release from custody to continue to deal with her drug problems. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Having said this, of course, it would be fanciful to think that she did not make the same promises when she was dealt with in this court in Sydney for the similar offence to which I have referred which no doubt in part led to the finding of special circumstances on that occasion. Further, it is clear that the sentence imposed on that occasion did not provide sufficient personal deterrence to prevent her from not only re-engaging in the supply of drugs, but doing so at a commercial level.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      His Honour’s mention of the earlier occasion when the Applicant had been sentenced for a similar offence was clearly a reference back to the 2002 sentence for supplying drugs. 
       
      
    18 After referring to the submissions of counsel, his Honour said, relevantly to the present application (ROS14-15): 
     
      
       
        
        “… I think that the offender has some prospects for rehabilitation. As to whether they will ultimately bear fruit, only time will tell, but, as I said, on balance I think that she presently has a resolve to deal with her drug problems. I accept that she is remorseful to some extent and that she has accepted responsibility for her actions, but with some reservations. As I said earlier, I am of the view that she is reluctant to take full responsibility for the serious nature of the supply offence.” 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour found special circumstances (ROS15): 
     
      
       
        
        “I am prepared to make a finding of special circumstances. This is based on the fact that I do accept on balance that the offender currently has some resolve to deal with her drug problems.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions on Application 
       
      
    20 On behalf of the Applicant, it was submitted that the evidence before the District Court, and in particular the pre-sentence report and the report of Mr Taylor, provided a foundation for the learned sentencing Judge to apply the principle in R v Osenkowski (1982) 5 A Crim R 594, which he referred to as the principle of mercy, or the crossroads principle. Reference was made to decisions of this Court and other courts where this principle has been applied, including R v Micallef (1990) 50 A Crim R 465 at 467 and R v Lenthall [2004] NSWCCA 248. 
     
      
    21 Mr Bellanto QC submitted that the evidence before the District Court demonstrated that the Applicant had reached a point in her life where she was ready to turn the corner and address her offending and drug issues, and that there was no evidence to the contrary placed before the sentencing Judge on this topic. In these circumstances, it was submitted that the Court should have fixed a significantly longer period on parole to allow the Applicant an opportunity to reform at this point in her life. 
     
      
    22 Complaint is made in Ground 2 concerning comments by the sentencing Judge with respect to the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. I have mentioned these earlier (at [17]). They involve the specific observation by his Honour that “it would be fanciful to think that she did not make the same promises” when she was dealt with on an earlier occasion for drug supply. Senior Counsel for the Applicant submitted that this observation was not open to the sentencing Judge, as his Honour did not have before him the material relating to sentencing of the Applicant on that previous occasion. It was submitted that there was ample evidence before the District Court on this occasion that would allow a favourable finding concerning the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, including the evidence of the Applicant, the pre-sentence report and the psychological report. 
     
      
    23 The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge in this case did not form the view that the Applicant was at the crossroads. Taking into account the seriousness of the offences, his Honour did not extend mercy to the degree that the Applicant sought. It was submitted that error had not been demonstrated in this respect, and that it was significant that the sentencing Judge had the opportunity to observe the Applicant giving evidence. 
     
      
    24 With respect to the impugned comment which is the subject of Ground 2, the Crown submitted that this comment reflected his Honour’s experience of the reality of sentencing proceedings, where often an offender, in an attempt to gain a lesser sentence, will seek to demonstrate contrition and rehabilitation prospects. The Crown pointed to evidence in the District Court before his Honour which supported this observation. The Applicant had acknowledged under cross-examination (T7-8, 22 August 2008) that she had, on an earlier occasion, indicated to the Probation and Parole Service an intent to maintain a drug free lifestyle but that she had reverted to her old ways of drug use thereafter. 
     
      
       
      Determination of Application 
       
      
    25 This Court is bound by findings of fact of the sentencing Judge, unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504: R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [61]. 
     
      
    26 Having considered the evidence, including that of the Applicant, the sentencing Judge made findings concerning the Applicant’s remorse, level of insight and prospects of rehabilitation. Those findings were understandably guarded, given the Applicant’s criminal history and recent level of protracted serious offending. 
     
      
    27 In approaching each of the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to bear in mind the observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Hunt [2002] NSWCCA 482 at [29]-[30] where his Honour observed that a level of scepticism, sometimes described as “wishful thinking” or “the triumph of hope over experience”, is appropriate where an offender claims to have changed his or her ways against a long history of criminal offending. Claims of this type are often made in circumstances where there have been past opportunities extended to the offender to reform which have not borne fruit. 
     
      
    28 In R v Govinden (1999) 106 A Crim R 314 at 319 [35], Dunford J (Greg James J and Smart AJ agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing judges must be vigilant to ensure that they do not accept uncritically at face value all submissions to the effect that the person standing for sentence is ‘at the crossroads’, ‘has seen the error of his ways, is at the turning point in his life’, or ‘has excellent prospects of rehabilitation’. Often such submissions have no justification in fact and are based on no more than wishful thinking, but there are exceptional cases where such submissions do have validity and the court should be astute to recognise them.” 
        
       
      
    29 In my view, considerations of this type operate strongly against the Applicant on the present application. His Honour’s observations about what may have been said on an earlier sentencing occasion (Ground 2), may be regarded as a reasonable reflection of the level of scepticism which is required when a claim of this type is made. 
     
      
    30 His Honour’s findings concerning the Applicant’s remorse, insight and prospects of rehabilitation, were both open and appropriate. Indeed, a more favourable finding and sentence, by reference to the crossroads principle, would have been, in the circumstances of this case, unduly lenient. 
     
      
    31 The Applicant stood to be sentenced for serious offences, including, on the drug supply count, the taking into account of a substantial number and variety of other offences for which it was necessary to reflect the need for personal deterrence and retribution arising from the additional criminality included in the Form 1 offences: Attorney General’s Application Under s.37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42]-[43]. 
     
      
    32 A substantial period of imprisonment was imposed in this case, but that reflected the objectively serious crimes for which the Applicant stood to be sentenced. Issues of personal and general deterrence were of significance, as well as the protection of the community and the need for punishment. A finding of special circumstances was made in the Applicant’s favour so as to vary the non-parole period to 63 per cent of the total sentence. This reflected his Honour’s acceptance that the Applicant had “some resolve to deal with her drug problems”. This approach was open to the sentencing Judge and was appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    33 To the extent that some of the Applicant’s submissions assert that insufficient weight was given to one factor, or that proper or appropriate weight had not been given to another factor, it is timely to refer to the observation of Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] to the effect that “questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge” and that “the circumstances in which matters of ‘weight’ will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined”. 
     
      
    34 In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that no error has been demonstrated on the part of the sentencing Judge. The sentences which were imposed upon the Applicant were both open and appropriate, having regard to the serious level of criminality involved. There was a finding leading to a variation of the percentage relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term, being a finding made in the Applicant’s favour, which, in my view, was open and reasonable and reflected his Honour’s acceptance that there was some resolve on the part of the Applicant to deal with her drug problem. 
     
      
    35 The Applicant has not demonstrated error, either patent or latent, on the part of the sentencing Judge. None of the grounds of appeal have, in my view, been made good.  
     
      
    36 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but the appeal ought be dismissed. 
     
      
    37 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree and would only add one observation with respect to Ground 2. His Honour’s statement to the effect that it would be fanciful to think that she did not make the same promises when earlier dealt with does have some support in the evidence. 
     
      
    38 During the course of her cross-examination, she was asked about the offence and the conviction in November 2002 and was specifically asked whether she had indicated to the Probation and Parole Service that she was going to maintain a drug free lifestyle then, to which she answered, “For a long time I did”. That is a basis for an implicit acceptance, although it is not explicit, that she did make that statement at the time. That is a further reason for supporting his Honour’s observation and rejecting Ground 2. 
     
      
    39 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and the additional remarks of the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    40 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are that leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Coolahan in the District Court on 3 September 2008. 
     
      
    2 The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a commercial quantity of amphetamine under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the Act”). There were also two Form 1 offences taken into account for supply and possess a prohibited drug, namely 28 grams of cocaine contrary to s 25(1) and s 10(1) of the Act respectively. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 25(2) of the Act is 20 years imprisonment or a fine of $385,000 or both. There is a standard non–parole period of 10 years. The maximum penalties for the Form 1 offences are 15 years imprisonment and/or a $220,000 fine for supply and two years imprisonment and/or a $2,200 fine for possession. 
     
      
    4 His Honour found the plea was entered at the first opportunity and applied a 25 percent discount on sentence on the basis of its utilitarian value for the administration of justice. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of seven years to date from 13 October 2007 and to expire on 12 October 2014, with a balance of term of three and a half years to expire on 12 April 2018. 
     
      
    6 The hearing on sentence proceeded on the basis of an agreed set of facts which were summarised by his Honour. With respect to the retail drug supply business that the applicant had conducted, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender operated this business in a joint criminal enterprise with his brother and they utilised complicated strategies and techniques in an attempt to conceal their drug supply business. Some of these methods included the use of mobile phones registered in fictitious names and false addresses, the use of multiple mobile phone services in an attempt to prevent telephone interception by authorities, the use of code words when organising drug transactions, using the Italian language when arranging to source drugs and money, discussing with co-offenders various methods to avoid being stopped by police when transporting drugs, such as using taxis. 
        
       
       
        
        In addition, the offender discussed with co-offenders methods of secreting drugs in his motor vehicle to avoid police detection; also arranging drug transactions with clients in shopping complexes, registered clubs, hotels and public streets, to reduce vehicular and pedestrian traffic to his home; and the offender also used electronic monitoring and surveillance equipment at his residence. 
        
       
       
        
        … [T]he offender operated a business of supplying prohibited drugs, including amphetamines and cocaine. The offender had more than 3,000 relevant telephone calls intercepted on eight different telephone services which relate to his drug activities. The drug supply business operated by the offender was a daily operation between October 2006 and September 2007, involving many different clients who used well over sixty different telephone services. 
        
       
       
        
        … The offender was engaged in the business of supplying drugs, not just to street users, but to other suppliers. The business was extremely active, extensive and sophisticated … He was a mid to higher level drug supplier … and the supply was … for profit.” 
        
       
      
    7 On the issue of gambling and drug use, it is pertinent to note his Honour’s specific observations. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On his own admission, he is not a drug user and the supply was, obviously, therefore, for profit, perhaps to fund a gambling habit, but, in the absence of specific evidence of this, I cannot say.” 
        
       
      
    8 After referring to the importance of general deterrence and the protection of the community in sentencing for drug offences, his Honour indicated that a full time custodial sentence was required for this kind of offence, except in the most exceptional circumstances.  
     
      
    9 With respect to subjective matters his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … His criminal history begins in 1969 when he was fined for being the keeper of a common gaming house. In the 1980s and 1990s there are a number of convictions for similar types of offences. He was also dealt with for some serious driving matters. In 2001 he was placed on a s 9 bond for having goods in custody, fined for possessing a prohibited drug and ordered to perform community service for supplying a prohibited drug other than cannabis. On 22 April 2004 at this Court he was sentenced to periodic detention for twelve months with a non-parole period of six months for supplying a prohibited drug other than cannabis.” 
        
       
      
    10 The applicant did not give evidence, but a pre-sentence report (Pre-Sentence Report, 21 August 2008) was tendered which his Honour characterised as “… of no use whatsoever. … none of the subjective material is relevant to the issue of sentence and, in any event, it is not supported by any independent evidence”. His Honour referred particularly to the following statement as a “salient feature of the report”: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Martinelli reports that he agrees with the police facts in relation to the offences currently before the Court. He stated that the illicit drugs were for both he and his partner’s personal use and he would on occasions sell illicit drugs to close friends.” 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour added in this regard: 
     
      
       
        
        “This assertion is patent rubbish and I have no doubt that it was a deliberate lie.” 
        
       
      
    12 In this regard it is relevant to refer back to his Honour’s particular findings as to the nature of the business that the offender had conducted: receiving some 3000 relevant telephone calls intercepted on eight different telephone services which relate to his drug activities and other such findings that his Honour made and which I have set out earlier in this judgment. 
     
      
    13 His Honour also referred to the applicant’s medical history and accepted that he had prostate cancer which was currently in remission. His Honour observed that it could adequately be managed in custody, and made a “small allowance” on the basis of the illness. 
     
      
    14 His Honour also observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … given the extent and sophistication of the enterprise being operated by the offender and others, the objective seriousness falls to be determined at or above the mid point for a case such as this.” 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the offender’s record is not sufficient to constitute an aggravating factor under the section, the two previous convictions for supply raise to prominence issues of specific deterrence and the protection of the community. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, it seems to me that the degree of planning and organisation involved in the commission of this offence, over the extended period of time over which it was committed, was more extensive than that contemplated by the legislature. 
        
       
       
        
        The offence was committed in company. This is relevant, not so much as an aggravating factor, in that the actions of the offender were emboldened by the presence of others, but is relevant, in my view, to the nature and extent of the operation. 
        
       
       
        
        The offence involved a series of criminal acts. 
        
       
       
        
        The offence was committed for financial gain. 
        
       
       
        
        As to mitigating factors, the only real mitigating factor I can find is the offender’s plea of guilty. This was entered at the first available opportunity and should attract the discount of 25 per cent. 
        
       
       
        
        There is, in this case, absolutely no evidence of remorse. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the standard non-parole period, this, of course, is not strictly applicable because of the offender’s plea, but it is, nonetheless, a useful reference point. 
        
       
       
        
        The Form 1 matters are serious in themselves but, in reality, they form part, in my view, of the extensive and sophisticated drug dealing operation which was being conducted by the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        This is, as I said earlier, a very serious example of this type of offence. The operation was sophisticated, extensive and on-going. It was conducted for profit. It calls for, in my view, a very significant full time custodial sentence, notwithstanding the age of the offender and his ill health, neither of which seem to have had any effect upon his commission of these offences.” 
        
       
      
    16 Certain aspects of the pre-sentence report are pertinent to issues raised on the appeal. 
     
      
    17 With respect to drug use the pre-sentence report said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Martinelli stated that his only period of illicit drug use was for a twelve month period in 2003. He stated that he would consume such orally once to twice a week. He cited ongoing emotional issues and accessibility via his then de-factor partner as compounding factors relating to his use of amphetamines. He stared that around the period of the loss of his parents he was formally diagnosed with cancer and this sent him into a period of emotional turmoil which he claims was a catalyst for his drug use. However the influence of his then partner who has been identified as having a long term dependence on illicit substances appears to have also been a factor. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, the inmate has made disclosures to this Service in the past that he used amphetamines for approximately 3 years prior to the commission of the offence of ‘Supply Prohibited Drug’ in 2003. This raises the concern that the offenders most recent disclosures regarding his illicit drug use may not be indicative of his actual levels of use; nor the extent to which it has impacted on his lifestyle and consequently his offending behaviours.” 
        
       
      
    18 With respect to gambling the pre-sentence report said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Community inquiries and perusal of the offender’s prior criminal history indicate that there may be some long term issues relating to the offenders gambling habits. It is of concern that should this be the case the consequent financial pressure that this would have created may have further compounded Mr Martinelli’s offending behaviours. Further investigation in this area may be prudent.” 
        
       
      
    19 The report also said, “the offender may have an unaddressed gambling and loss and grief issues which would further compound his offending behaviour”. The report went on to make recommendations for strategies including “drug and alcohol assessment”; “monitor illicit drug use” and “assessment of gambling issues”.  
     
      
    20 It is also pertinent to note the following statement in the agreed statement of facts: 
     
      
       
        
        “Police enquiries at Western Suburbs Leagues Club indicate the offender was gambling significant amounts of money on the poker machines throughout the surveillance period.” 
        
       
       
      The Appeal 
       
      
    21 The applicant contends that His Honour fell into error in imposing the sentence that he did on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      1) His Honour erred in failing to give due weight to evidence in relation to the applicant’s gambling habit; 
       
       
      2) His Honour erred in failing to give due weight to evidence in relation to the applicant’s prior and current drug use; 
       
       
      3) The sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive.  
       
       
      Ground One 
       
      
    22 The applicant contends that his Honour failed to give due weight to what the ground refers to as “the applicant’s gambling habit”. The applicant relied upon the references in the agreed facts, the pre-sentence report and on his convictions in relation to gambling, as a foundation for an inference “that gambling has been a longstanding problem for the applicant”. The applicant submits that his Honour failed to give due weight to the evidence before him in this regard. 
     
      
    23 None of the evidence which I have set out above reaches the level of addiction. Nor is there any suggestion in the evidence that the applicant was involved in the drug trade for purposes of funding his gambling. As the Crown submitted there is no persuasive evidence of a relationship between the offending and any gambling. In the absence of any evidence of any kind from the applicant in this regard, his Honour was not obliged to speculate about any such relationship. The evidence went no further than suggesting that the applicant chose to gamble money he had obtained as a lifestyle choice. 
     
      
    24 As his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “His criminal history bears out that he was a person who facilitated gambling by others and, whilst the police say that he gambled heavily at a club during the course of his criminal activity which gives rise to this offence, this does not necessarily mean that he had an addiction, simply that he had plenty of money with which to engage in an activity which he enjoyed.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour was entitled to make that finding and there is no reason for this Court to review it.  
     
      
    26 There was no evidence with respect to gambling that could impinge upon his moral culpability or otherwise affect the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. There was no evidence of compulsion or obsession. 
     
      
    27 Mr A J Bellanto QC, who appeared for the applicant, submitted in oral submissions this morning that his Honour “was entitled” to take a further step and find that the applicant did have a gambling problem. To submit that his Honour “was entitled” to make a further finding is not a sufficient basis for this court to intervene. In my opinion, there was no evidence with respect to gambling that could impinge upon the applicant’s moral culpability or otherwise affect the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Specifically, there was no evidence of compulsion or of obsession. 
     
      
    28 In another case, the level of addiction may be found to be such that, on the basis of proper evidence of that addiction and of a direct link to the offending, this consideration will be relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. (See eg R v Petrovic [1998] VSCA 95 and R v Cavallin (Victorian Court of Appeal, 24 July 1996, unreported) quoted in R v Molesworth [1999] NSWCCA 43 at [24]; R v Novak (1993) 69 A Crim R 145 at 148-149.) This is not such a case. 
     
      
    29 This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two 
       
      
    30 The applicant contends that the pre-sentence report referred to prior use of drugs and that it contained a ‘suggestion’ that there had recently been use of drugs. His Honour rejected the suggestion. His Honour held and I repeat: “this assertion is patent rubbish and I have no doubt that it was a deliberate lie”.  
     
      
    31 His Honour was entitled to reject the particular statement upon which counsel for the applicant relied before him. In any event, as quoted above the pre-sentence report had also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Martinelli stated that his  
        only 
         period of illicit drug use was for a 12 month period in 2003.” 
        
       
      
    32 Furthermore, the agreed statements of facts included the following express statement, attributed to the applicant at the time of his arrest:  
     
      
       
        
        “The offender stated that he was not a user of the drug.” 
        
       
       
      This related to cocaine. 
       
      
    33 There was, in my opinion, no proper basis upon which his Honour could take into account evidence of drug use as affecting the objective seriousness of the offence with which the applicant was charged, or as affecting the moral culpability of his conduct in committing the offence.  
     
      
    34 This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three 
       
      
    35 The sentence imposed was a significant sentence. However, it was a sentence imposed by the sentencing judge in the overall context of a pattern of offending and, particularly in the context of the retail drug supply business that had been conducted by the applicant, on his own admission, for a significant period of time and on a significant scale.  
     
      
    36 The offences to be taken into account on the Form 1 entitled his Honour to add a factor to the admitted offences. The overall criminal history of the applicant indicated that personal deterrence was a matter entitled to weight.  
     
      
    37 For the reasons as set out above, the reliance in this Court on the alleged gambling addiction and the alleged personal drug use were not matters entitled to weight of any significant degree in the sentencing exercise, if any. As his Honour said, the only matter of a mitigating character was the plea of guilty for its utilitarian value. 
     
      
    38 His Honour assessed the offending in this case as being in the mid range, or higher, of offending of this character. This discretionary judgment was open to his Honour and there is no reason for this Court to interfere with it. His Honour clearly set out the relevant facts and articulated the weight he attributed to the full range of relevant matters. 
     
      
    39 As the Crown submitted, the facts of this case are reasonably similar to the facts in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, where the Court re-sentenced the offender to a total term of nine years and four months with a non parole period of seven years. In that case as in this there was a plea of guilty.  
     
      
    40 Furthermore, the organised nature of the business within which the particular act of supply occurred was similar. 
     
      
    41 None of the other cases referred to suggest that the sentence imposed was outside the range of the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion, ground 3 should also be rejected. 
     
      
    43 Leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    44 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    45 JOHNSON J: I also agree.

     Crown Appeal Dismissed:  
      
      
    JUDGMENT1. Yetta Dhinnakkal is a correctional facility located 65 kilometres from a small north-western township of Brewarrina. Set on about 10,000 hectares it has no security fence. Young prisoners, frequently first time prisoners, usually Aborigines, are the main source of inmates. Prison routine is generally abandoned for a more therapeutic type of custody geared towards learning skills ranging from literacy, driving knowledge tests to driving farm equipment, fencing and the like.2. Leigh Smith, Steven Dates and Darren Hookey were selected to be inmates at Yetta Dhinnakkal. It would seem none of them applied and none of them were asked whether they would like to go.3. On 2 November 2008 each escaped together, driving in a white utility belonging to the Department of Corrective Services from the grounds of the facility. It goes without saying that none had permission to drive or be driven in the vehicle. 4. Today each is to be held accountable for his escape from Yetta Dhinnakkal and offences that occurred as a consequence thereof. As the sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence, before this court, committed by these offenders, in this community. That task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the court. I will need to have regard to matters personal to each of the offenders. The starting point for such assessments requires me to make findings of fact from evidence before the court relating to both the offence and offender. Each of the offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly.5. Before any sentence can be made there are technical questions relating to deterrence, discount, whether special circumstances are to be found, parity, s 166 matters and finally of course the ultimate term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of that can be embarked upon until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as it primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740. Facts6. Two of the staff had seen the utility vehicle as it drove from the detention centre, down its driveway into the distance with its lights off. Those staff entered the office and noticed a cabinet containing the keys to the vehicle had been broken into. Police were immediately contacted. They spotted the vehicle at about 10.45pm near Brewarrina. By this time the escapees had been out for less than half an hour. By the time police turned around they had lost the vehicle.7. It was next spotted by Walgett Police about an hour later. They followed at a distance. A second police vehicle arrived, activated sirens and pursued the vehicle through the streets of Walgett until it stopped in Wee Waa Street. Dates and Smith exited the vehicle. Hookey remained in the vehicle hiding. Once confronted by police Hookey immediately surrendered. On the other hand, Dates and Smith made good their escape from the Walgett police.8. Early on 4 November the owner of Birdwood, situated on the Kamilaroi Highway, Walgett, heard his car started and saw it driving off past the house, down the two kilometre driveway to the Kamilaroi Highway. That vehicle was intercepted ultimately near Burren Junction and pursued until it ran out of petrol. Dates was the driver of the vehicle. Whilst driving that vehicle it had travelled at excessive speeds, sometimes on the incorrect side of the road and through two small townships without reducing speed.9. Both Dates and Smith were arrested and returned to Corrective Services custody. On my calculation both had been absent from Yetta Dhinnakkal for no more than 36 hours. Dates was in possession of small quantity of cannabis when arrested. More importantly though he had never held a New South Wales drivers license and is currently disqualified from driving until 2016.10. Steven Dates was serving a total sentence of eighteen months with a twelve month non parole period due to expire on 22 February 2010. Thus at the time of his offending he had fifteen months to serve before his earliest release date. Significantly he was serving imprisonment for driving whilst disqualified.11. Leigh Smith was serving a total of one year and four month with a twelve month non parole period. His non parole period was due to expire on 11 July 2009. At the time of his escape he had about eight months to serve. His sentences were for assault.12. Darren Hookey was serving a total sentence of three years, six months with a non parole period of two years, four months. His earliest date of release was 10 October 2009. At the time of his escape he had almost two years of custody left. He has a ride in stolen conveyance taken into account on a Form One as impacting upon the sentence he too is currently serving.Objective Criminality13. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of each offender. So that is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this offence with criminality of offences of a similar kind, that is, other escapes. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.14. Escaping from Correctional Services custody is in essence an offence against the proper administration of criminal justice. To effect this escape damage, albeit minor damage, was done to government property. The mechanism used to achieve the escape namely, driving off in a motor vehicle, involved the commission of a further offence namely, riding in a stolen conveyance. 15. None of the prisoners was at large for any length of time, although both Smith and Dates committed further offences whilst at liberty, including driving riding in a stolen conveyance, a theft of another motor vehicle and entering inclosed lands.16. Escaping from minimum security is a selfish self-centred offence. It puts pressure on prison authorities to toughen up the admission criteria to minimum security centres and rehabilitation programs available at those minimum security centres. Escapes have created a new classification, E, for prisoners who have escaped which denies them access to therapeutic rehabilitation programs. Each of these offenders will now have his classification marked accordingly.17. While the offenders took car keys and vehicles, I do not from that fact alone, regard that as establishing that the offence was a planned one. The offender Hookey says he was uncomfortable being housed in such a remote location. His family is closer to the large population hub. He had not applied for classification to Yetta Dhinnakkal. He has an escape from juvenile custody on his record.18. Dates had lived in Newcastle and Brisbane. He had not applied to go to Yetta Dhinnakkal. He too found it remote. His father had passed away in Brisbane as a result of a motor vehicle accident. His application to attend his father’s funeral was rejected. The Department asserts that the death of the father was unable to be confirmed by it, despite what it claims was extensive inquiries. At the time the offender was acting on a report from TV and information supplied by his mother.19. I dwell on the issue because Dates still apparently holds some resentment towards the Department. Loss of liberty brings with it many problems such as Dates experienced, even though, had the inability of the Department to confirm the death of his father not been the problem, others would have been. Jurisdictional issues by taking him interstate, or possibly issues arising from an early escape on his juvenile record may well have prevented him from going in any event.20. On 19 October 2008, three days after arriving at Yetta Dhinnakkal, Dates had failed a prescribed urine test. 21. The details of the event had not been disclosed in evidence, but I note the disciplinary hearing relating to the matter had not been finalised when he departed Yetta Dhinnakkal. I do not rule out that Dates appreciated that a potential consequence of this breach of prison discipline was a return to a more secure form of custody.22. Smith’s family are from Victoria. He also felt remoteness from his family at Yetta Dhinnakkal. He says he would sooner be housed in Sydney. Again loss of liberty creates a lot of problems, including where a prisoner is likely to live.23. In theory the punishment component of sentencing to imprisonment is meant to be restricted to a loss of liberty. In reality there are other components to punishment, including loss of choice as to locality of prison accommodation. There is no evidence before the court, other than coming from the offenders, as to the circumstances of their movement to Yetta Dhinnakkal. I have put to one side such knowledge as I think I have about prison classification and access to minority security prisons, on the basis that it may be outdated and is not of general knowledge, such as, for example, any undertaking made not to escape.24. No prison officer was personally confronted by any of the offenders to effect the escapes, nor was any other prisoner recruited for any purpose associated with the escape. The offence was committed whilst in company, that adds to the criminality in that potentially more resources would have been needed to find and capture the offenders, and police may well have regarded themselves as being at greater risk from three escapees than from one.25. These escapes fall though towards the lower end of the range. Some upper adjustment of criminality will need to be made to the sentences of Smith and Hookey for the extra time they were out of custody. There was further offending whilst they were out, but that has been separately charged. While there are s 166 certificates the sentence imposed in respect of the further offending will be concurrent, but the sentence for the escape must be cumulative to them. Subjective MattersDarren Hookey, Family Background and Relationships26. Darren Hookey is a 22 year old Aboriginal raised in Parramatta. He is one of five children. His parents separated when he was eight. The father was a drug abuser and violent towards his partner. This offender had no contact with his father for the past six years. Upon separation the mother raised the five children. He is well supported by his mother and siblings. Education, Skills and Employment History27. He left secondary school at the age of fourteen while still in year nine. He truanted and was expelled. It would appear he has no trade, or other vocational training. His income stream, when released, is a government pension.Drugs and Alcohol28. Darren Hookey is a second generation drug abuser. His drug of choice is heroin, using daily since fourteen. Given his absence of vocational skills or experience, his primary method of funding drug use comes from criminal activity. Today he claims to have limited his consumption to heroin by smoking only. Interestingly he claims neither to smoke cigarettes, nor consume alcohol. Given that level of self-discipline, particularly within a prison environment, his prospects for rehabilitation from heroin would appear to be reasonable provided he was properly motivated. There are two prior attempts at drug rehabilitation, and his persistence in seeking rehabilitation must be a positive rehabilitation indicator.General Health 29. So far as one can tell he presents as a relatively fit young man without any serious physical ailments that would impeded his rehabilitation progress.Mental Health30. There is nothing before the court giving any insight into Darren Hookey’s mental health situation. There is a mention though in the criminal history of the possibility of ADHD. I raise that only for those who may be interested in exploring it. I cannot take it into account on the material before me.Character31. For a twenty-two year old Darren Hookey cannot point to much he has accomplished. He presents as a young man who is a risk taker. He exhibits poor judgment skills, and is distracted from enjoying a full or rewarding life by serious drug abuse issues.32. His first court appearance appears in 2002 at the Campbelltown Youth Drug Court. Thereafter he is before courts of summary jurisdiction frequently, including for serious criminal offences such as armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. The sentences he was serving at the time of his escape were for steal from the person and aggravated break and enter in company. They were the first instances of first instance penalties being imposed by the District Court.Rehabilitation Prospects33. There are two positive ones, the support of his family, and as I say his past interest in rehabilitation, although that may have been at the behest of the Drug Court. Whilst ever he is serving sentences in custody his rehabilitation prospects are poor. His antecedent record, to the extent that it can be regarded as a predictor of future behaviour, points towards recidivism. 34. His best prospects for rehabilitation are to be found in highly supervised structured programmes in the community, and his willingness to comply, or co-operate with administrators of those programmes. At the moment both appear to be remote possibilities. The first because of a lack of government funding, and government’s willingness so to do, and the second because of his risk taking personality, and his own personal unwillingness to do so. Frankly, his prospects of rehabilitation if not bleak are certainly clouded. It would appear his mother and family members are his strongest source of comfort in terms of rehabilitation.Attitude to Offence35. The offender has expressed contrition. It is clear, as with most risk takers, he did not think the escape through. His re-capture was inevitable, although not guaranteed to be as speedy as it was. He was always going to pay a substantial price for it. It is likely he now understand this, and that that is the basis of his regret. He classifies his acts as disrespectful. As I said, they are better classified as an offence against the administration of criminal justice.Leigh Smith, Family Background and Relationships36. Leigh is a single twenty-three year old Aborigine. His mother and younger brothers live in an inner city suburb of Sydney. He was born in Shepparton, one of five children. His parents separated when he was seven. He grew up in Redfern. He is close to his mother and siblings, although regularly they have disagreements. He too has not seen his father for seven years.Education and Employment Skills37. He left school aged fourteen. He appears to have no employment history. It would appear he has done no vocational training to enhance his skills in any area. His principal source of regular income is a government pension of some kind.Drugs and Alcohol38. He was drinking at the age of thirteen. He was binge drinking weekly. He was also using drugs at this age. His primary drug of choice is heroin, which he used daily until twenty-one. He has experimented with methyl-amphetamines. He claims his alcohol consumption is now monthly. He has experienced blackouts. Prior to his incarceration he was admitted to a detoxification unit in Surry Hills for seven days. This is another case of a young man distracted from leading a full and rewarding life by habitual drug abuse.General Health39. Leigh Smith presents as a young twenty-three year old male. Again so far as I can tell he enjoys reasonable physical health.Mental Health40. There is no material before me which permits of any mental health assessment.Character41. He is a young Aboriginal man who should have the world at his feet. Instead he presents with little education, no work skills, no work experience, well ingrained drug and alcohol problems, not yet motivated to deal with them. 42. He was first before the courts in 2000, when a fourteen year old, with steal from the person, and later the same year for possessing house breaking implements and goods in custody. The following year he was in trouble for car theft, as he was in 2002 and 2003. In 2004 he added break, enter and steal to his criminal repertoire. He continued his driving and car theft offences before the Local Court at Waverley, and in 2004 he was imprisoned for twelve months for resisting an officer in the execution of his duty, stealing motor vehicle, and receiving stolen property. He received nine months non parole from the Newtown Local Court for driving a stolen vehicle, and driving in a manner dangerous in 2006. That is in the past 60 months, or five years since he has been an adult, Mr Smith has spent, on my calculation, 35 months of those 60 in adult custody. That equates to fifty-eight percent of his adult life. By this time next year, assuming he is released when he is eligible, he will have spent sixty-one percent of his adult life thus far in custody. It seems to me this is an appalling and devastatingly empty way for a young man to spend his adult years. From where I sit it seems to me there must come a point where Leigh Smith will be prepared to take responsibility for the lifestyle he is leading and do something about it. Just in case he does not know, the lifestyle he is living is in gaol.Rehabilitation Prospects43. If this offender’s prior record is any indication of future behaviour his rehabilitation prospects will not be good. Added to that his long term drug and alcohol use habits, his lack of general education, vocation training and employment history, He does not seem at this point motivated to change. He has a poor history of co-operation with the only public funded rehabilitation resource, namely Probation and Parole, that he has used to date. There is nothing before me that suggests any commitment to change whilst in custody. Without any change in attitude by him his future prospects seem bleak. He needs intensive work by those skilled in rehabilitation programmes preferably within a community based setting. The only factor I can find in his favour is his strong support from mother and siblings.Attitude to the Offence44. Probation and Parole suggest he has no insight into the seriousness of his offending. That may be a difficult concept for him, as I earlier remarked, it is an offence against the administration of criminal justice. It is easier for someone in his position to understand the wrong of murder, rape and armed robbery, than it is of offences of this kind. He has pleaded guilty. He gave evidence of accepting responsibility for his offending behaviour. He understands that he will pay for his risk taking behaviour. He is not defiant, he is not recalcitrant about the offence.Steven Dates, Family Background and Relationships45. Steven Dates is the youngest of the three offenders, he will be twenty in just a couple of weeks. He has three siblings. His parents separated when he was four. His mother remarried and there are a further six children. Steven Dates complains that his step-father was physically and emotionally abusive towards him, another brother, and his mother.46. He left home aged sixteen and resided with friends. He claims an influence upon his attitudes was witnessing his grand-father being assaulted by police. His own father is now deceased, an event that occurred at Bathurst in September or October 2008. I earlier noted he was denied access to the funeral.Education and Employment Skills47. In his evidence Dates said he had completed his Year 10 certificate, had obtained certificates in bricklaying, hospitality, and land management. There is no evidence of any work history, but he does want to go to Windsor where programmes are available.Drugs and Alcohol48. Dates reports drinking when aged fifteen to the extent of binge drinking several times a month. With the drinking he was consuming cannabis, which soon escalated to daily use. He does not report amphetamine, heroin, or cocaine abuse. Positively he expresses an interest in addressing his alcohol or drug issues.General Health49. He appears to be a fit young man of twenty. There do not appear to be any health issues that could complicate his rehabilitation.Mental Health50. There is no mental health profile, or personality profile before the court.Character51. He is a young, strictly speaking nineteen, but let us say a twenty year old man, spending his youth in single sex custodial accommodation. Within three months of his eighteenth birthday he was serving a non parole period of twelve months. He has finished his minority years serving time in juvenile detention. While he is still young, and still has some of his youth, he needs to wake up to what he is losing. He appears to have no employment history, limited social life, limited social skills, limited education and few, if any, acquired skills.52. His criminal history began in 2004 with break and enter offences. There are many of his offences related to driving and car thefts. I understand he never held a driver’s licence yet he is disqualified from holding one till June of 2016. That date may well fade further into the future if there are habitual offender declarations still outstanding. Even though there is an extensive record most of his offending appears to have been dealt with by courts of summary jurisdiction. In March 2007 however he was before the District Court for an assault with intent to rob. For some reason not clear to me he appears to have been dealt with at law for this offence even though he was then fifteen going on sixteen when charged with the offence. He appears he was transferred to Kariong Juvenile Detention.Rehabilitation Prospects53. Again there is a history of re-offending, particularly by way of driving offences. The offender admits he is still resentful of the treatment of his grand-father received at the hands of police. He attributes his behaviour to this, and there does not appear to be any addressing of that issue by anyone through counselling of him, or him with them. He told Probation and Parole he was not sorry for his acts in escaping, again consistent with a lack of insight. He lacks work experience.54. He has done the bricklaying certificate, the hospitality and land management courses and Year 10. In that sense he is better equipped than the other two, at least as a starting point.55. He has real drug and alcohol issues. On the other hand he does have family ties to his mother and siblings. The absence of a driver’s licence will impede his employment prospects. His rehabilitation prospects are clouded, but given, at the least the course and eduction base, there is in my view some hope.Attitude to Offence56. He pleaded guilty to it. He gave evidence giving the reason for his unauthorised leaving of Yetta Dhinnakkal. While it would have been useful to explore the other potential reason, his departure is capable of explanation. At the time of the offence his emotions were raw about his absence from his father's funeral. That matter also does not appear to have been worked through by departmental officials, who, it would appear, may not have explored with him the work that they had done to try and confirm the father’s death, and explore with him the other issues which may have impeded him attending the funeral.57. He did not present in the witness box as truculent or disrespectful. There appears to be a deal of honesty in his approach with the author of the pre-sentence report, and with that honesty it would appear a tinge of courage in expressing his view.Plea Status58. Each of the offenders pleaded before the Local Court, each is entitled to a full twenty-five percent discount for the utilitarian value of that plea.Setting the Sentence59. These are offences calling for deterrence. The incarcerated community takes a keen interest in sentences given for escape. It is important prisoners clearly understand any sentence given will be cumulative, not only upon existing non parole periods, but also upon any sentence given for offences committed whilst at large in the community. Parliament has prescribed this as a strong deterrent to would be escapees.Maximum Penalty60. The maximum penalty for escaping is ten years cumulative upon any existing non parole period and new offences being dealt with in any sentence hearing.Section 166 Matters61. I have determined to finalise the s.166 matters first. It appears to me from my reading of Division 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act that I may deal with s 166 matters at any time once the plea of guilty has been indicated to the charge before the court. In this case it is appropriate to do so because the indicted escape charge sentence must be cumulative to them.Special Circumstances62. In respect of Dates and Hookey the sentences they were serving appeared to be constructed so as to reflect a finding by the then sentencing judicial officer of special circumstances. That finding should be kept in place with subsequent cumulative sentences. In respect of all offenders the sentences are cumulative upon their existing sentences. To those existing sentences are added sentences for the s.166 matters. It is important the overall sentences therefore be adjusted by use of special circumstances so at very least a “normal” ratio between the minimum term and the balance of term are preserved. Further, all offenders are young men who will have served extended periods in custody. 63. Courts are required for young offenders to give weighting to rehabilitation where appropriate. Each of these is desperate for rehabilitation. Each of these offender’s prospects at rehabilitation are at best clouded. Full time custody while it may well serve other functions in sentencing is contra-indicated so far as rehabilitation is concerned. Rehabilitation is best achieved in a community setting, that can best be achieved by a finding of special circumstances.Parity64. Proper regard needs to be paid to parity making due allowance for the fact that Dates and Smith were out longer than Hookey. Since each offender is to be sentenced for offences committed whilst out that will be cumulative to the escape sentence, weighting of the sentence for escape on account of offences being committed will be more muted than it would be before such a requirement was imposed.65. Steven Dates you are convicted of each of these matters that I am dealing with pursuant to s.166, that is being carried in a conveyance - that is the ute from the gaol - without consent, entering inclosed land - that is Birdwood - taking and driving the conveyance at Birdwood, possessing the prohibited drug cannabis, driving in manner dangerous, and driving whilst disqualified.66. For the carried in conveyance these sentences have been reduced by twenty-five percent. I am not going to tell you what the original ones were, but these are they: carried in a conveyance, six months; enter inclosed lands, six months; take and drive conveyance, six month minimum term with a one month additional term; possess prohibited drug - that is the cannabis - one month; drive in a manger dangerous, six months minimum term with a three month additional term; and drive whilst disqualified, six months minimum term with a three month additional term. 67. All of those sentences are to date from 22 November 2009 and expire on 21 May 2010. The effect of that is that three months of it is concurrent, and three months is cumulative to your release date.MAY: Excuse me, your Honour, I apologise for interrupting. In relation to the enter inclosed lands that maximum penalty is a $550 fine, and your Honour has imposed imprisonment.HIS HONOUR: I thought that was fourteen years the maximum penalty.68. All right. Enter inclosed lands conviction pursuant to section 10A - I am not going to fine him, he has got no wherewithal to pay a fine.MAY: No, your Honour, just in relation to the conviction. My understanding of 10A was that your Honour found the offence proved but did not proceed to a conviction.HIS HONOUR: No, well it is a conviction, but only a conviction. All right, all I am recording is a conviction.69. In respect of the escape lawful custody I convict you that you on 2 November 2008 at Brewarrina being an inmate of Yetta Dhinnakkal did escape from lawful custody there. In respect of that offence I would have set an overall sentence of sixteen months, that has become one of twelve months because I have discounted it. I set a minimum term of three months, and a balance of term of nine months, and it must date from 22 May 2010 and expiring on 21 August 2010, and the balance of term expiring on 21 May 2011. I order your release on 21 August 2010. Effectively what I have done is set six months further on your non parole period.70. Leigh Smith for the 166 matters, which is being carried in the utility, entering the closed lands at Birdwood, and being carried in that conveyance, in respect of each of those offences you are convicted. In respect of each of the first and last you are sentenced to six months imprisonment fixed term.71. In respect of the enter inclosed lands I am doing no more than convicting you because again you are in no position to pay a fine and it seems to me cruel to ask it of you.72. Those sentences are to date from 12 April 2009 and expire on 11 October 2009. Again the effect of that should be to add three months onto your existing release date.73. In respect of the escape lawful custody, again I would have dealt with you exactly the same as Mr Dates, that is to say I would have given you a sixteen month overall sentence which I have reduced to twelve. I sentence you to a minimum term of three months and a nine month balance of term. Your three months is to date from 12 October 2009 and will expire on 11 January 2010. Your balance of term will expire on 11 October 2010, that is nine months on parole.74. I order your release on 11 January next year. So again I have added six months to your sentence, your non parole period.75. Darren Hookey, your being carried in a conveyance without consent is the 166 matter, in respect of that I convict you, and I would have sentenced you to eight months, it is six months because I have taken the discount in. That fixed term will date from 11 June 2009 and expire on 10 December 2009.76. I think that what I have done there is what I have intended to do is accumulate by two months, right, to reflect the lesser criminality involved in your case. That is certainly my intention, if I got the dates wrong that is what I intended to do.77. In respect of the escape from lawful custody I also convict you of that. I am not going to read it out, you know what I mean. And in respect of that again I have come to a - I cannot quite remember how I got it, I think it was fifteen months I must have started with, and I have come to a total term of eleven months and one week because I have discounted it by twenty-five percent, I think I started with fifteen months as distinct from the other. I put a three month minimum term to date from 11 December 2009 and expire on 10 March 2010, and a balance of term of eight months one week to expire on 16 November 2010.78. I order your release, at least in respect of these sentences, on 10 March 2010. Your current release date is 10 October 09, and your present release date is 10/03/09, so I have added five months onto your non parole period.HIS HONOUR: They may be returned to custody. Can I just have the papers endorsed please? Mr Dates’ paper: 
     
      
      “The judge recommends that consideration be given by Corrective Services to placing him at Windsor Detention Centre. 
       
       
      In respect to of the other two they seek placement at Silverwater. The judge recommends that they be placed in Sydney closer to their family.” 
       
       
      
    LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENTHIS HONOUR: 80. Mr Dates, it would appear that I have made some mistake. One, I did not disqualify you, and I have to do that. Now have I made some error with his dates?MAY: Your Honour, there should be an extension of the sentences for Mr Dates and Mr Cooper in relation to the time that they were at large, that is two further days, when they should have been serving a non parole period but were not because they were at large in relation to the offence.HIS HONOUR: So I have to add two days. I will have to do it pursuant to - is it 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the slip rule?HIS HONOUR: I will add two days on to each non parole period.MAY: Not for my Mr Hookey, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: But not for Mr Hookey.MAY: No.HIS HONOUR: How come - I got it right with him, did I?MAY: He was out for less than twelve hours, your Honour. He was actually recaptured within the day.

   JUDGMENT1 In the early afternoon of 16 August 2008 the accused entered a music store in Pitt St. He began playing the drums and then a guitar. An employee, Matthew Dorahy asked him to leave. The accused did so. Later on that day Mr Dorahy left work. He hadn’t gone far when he was stabbed allegedly by the accused. CCTV footage from Sydney City Council shows a person, who the Crown says was the accused, hurriedly walking away from where Mr Dorahy was stabbed holding a walking stick in his right hand and a large stainless steel knife in his left hand. The accused was arrested a few days later. Incriminating items were found at his home. A photographic line up resulted in 4 witnesses identifying the accused but whether they identified him as the man in the music store earlier, or the man who stabbed Mr Dorahy is not made clear in the material placed before me. In any case it appears that the Crown case is quite a strong one.2 The accused has now been charged. A question regarding his fitness to be tried has arisen and accordingly a hearing was held before me to determine whether he is fit to be tried. As required, the proceedings were conducted in a non-adversarial way. It is the position of the Crown that the accused is fit to be tried, but the proposition advanced by Mr Fliece who appears on behalf of the accused is to the contrary. There is no significance arising from the fact that it is the Crown who says the accused is fit and the accused’s lawyers say he is unfit. The positions could easily have been reversed. I am to decide whether the accused is fit to be tried on the balance of probabilities with neither party bearing the onus of proof.3 The Crown relies on the opinion of Dr Allnutt who has examined the accused on two occasions; the most recent being on the morning of the day that he gave evidence before me. Mr Fliece relies on the opinion of Dr Nielssen who examined the accused some six months before the hearing before me. There is much that the two psychiatrists agree upon and the area where they differ involves not so much a psychiatric dispute as a legal one.4 Dr Allnutt is of the opinion that the accused meets all the Presser tests (R v Presser [1958] VR 45). 5 In conversations with Dr Allnutt the accused correctly identified the charge which he faces, and the nature of the allegation being that he had assaulted a person with a knife. The accused told Dr Allnutt that he had not committed the offence because at the time of the alleged offence he was at home at Redfern. Accordingly the accused told Dr Allnutt that he wanted to plead not guilty because he “did not do it”. 6 The accused correctly understood the consequences of both guilty and not guilty verdicts and that a plea of not guilty would result in a hearing to determine whether he was “innocent or guilty”. If found innocent he would “get released” but if found guilty he would be placed in gaol. 7 The accused understood the role of lawyers, and of the judge, and of the jury and, after explanation, the right of challenge. 8 Importantly Dr Allnutt also asked him what he understood of the concept of not guilty by reason of mental illness. The accused told Dr Allnutt that this meant: “that you are not liable for the crime because of mental illness” and the consequences of such a finding might be that “they place you in to medical custody, a psychiatric hospital and you remain there until you are well enough to go to society”. 9 The evidence established that the accused understood the concept of not guilty by mental illness, and in fact Dr Allnutt described the accused’s understanding as “astute”. 10 Dr Allnutt explored the accused’s attitude to a defence of mental illness. I will quote the relevant passage from Dr Allnutt’s report:  
     
      
       
      “I put the question to him “if it was you who committed the offence and you were mentally ill at the time, would you consider a mental illness defence”, he stated “yeah because I was mentally ill, the doctors write reports testifying you are mentally ill and the Court then puts you in a mental hospital”; I said to him - “If the Court said you did it, the crime, would you plead not guilty by reason of mental illness”, he said “if I was mentally ill at the time I’d plead not guilty by reason of mental illness”; he added, however, that if was not mentally ill at the time he would plead guilty.” 
      
    11 Dr Allnutt’s conclusion therefore was that the accused was fit to stand trial. He acknowledged that the accused was mentally ill at the time Mr Dorahy was stabbed and that the accused was now denying that he had been experiencing mental illness symptoms at the time of the alleged offence. Dr Allnutt therefore acknowledged that it is possible that he may lack insight into the question as to whether he had the defence of mental illness available to him and therefore might have difficulty in instructing his lawyers concerning that defence but, said Dr Allnutt, that does not mean that he is unfit to be tried. Dr Allnutt says: 
     
      
      “… he does understand at least in an objective sense, what the term not guilty by reason of mental illness is and its consequences are, and chooses not to apply this to his own case; given his understanding of the legal process that he demonstrates, along with his denial of committing the offence it seems reasonable that he would choose to plead not guilty … he has capacity to decide what defence he will rely on – he was able to articulate his defence, put simply, he was not there at the time the alleged offence occurred, that it was not “him” on the CCTV and that the charges have been brought in error.” 
      
    12 Dr Nielssen agreed with much of what Dr Allnutt said. The essential point of difference however is that it is Dr Nielssen’s view that the accused is unfit to be tried because he is unable to instruct his lawyers about the availability of a defence of mental illness because his mental illness itself prevents him from understanding that he was mentally ill at the time of the alleged offence.13 Dr Nielssen expressed himself in this manner in his evidence when asked for the reason that he thought the accused was unfit to be tried: 
     
      
       
      Well the sole basis was that his mental illness prevented him from raising the obvious defence to the charge which is that he was mentally ill at the time of the offence. 
      
    14 Dr Nielssen agrees that the accused meets all the Presser tests bar one, that is the ability to properly instruct his lawyers. It is Dr Nielssen’s opinion that because the accused does not have a complete understanding of the fact that he was mentally ill at the time of committing the offence he is not able to properly instruct his lawyers as to whether he should enter a plea of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness to the charge he faces. Dr Nielssen believes that, because of the strength of the Crown case, the mental illness defence is the obvious one, and the failure of the accused to accept that he was mentally ill prevents his response to the charge that he faces from being a rational one.15 It should now be clear why the point of difference between the two psychiatrists is not really a psychiatric one but a legal one. Both psychiatrists agree as to the underlying circumstances that relate to the accused’s case. What they disagree with is whether those circumstances result in the accused being fit to stand trial. 16 Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, there is little guidance in the authorities as to whether an accused who is unable, because of mental illness, to appreciate that he or she was mentally ill at the time of an alleged offence is by that reason unfit to stand trial. 17 In R v Reis [2005] NSWSC 707 the accused was found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness after having earlier been found unfit to be tried. The determination of unfitness was made by a jury after a short hearing in which there was no dispute as to the appropriate finding. The trial judge’s summing up was made available to me. In it, Barr J told the jury: 
     
      
      ""That brings me round to where we started. One of the essential things before a person can get a fair trial in New South Wales is that that person must be able to, by herself or through her solicitor or barrister, to set up every available defence. Here a very important one is that the very illness itself has created but which the very illness prevents her from getting. That is the substance of Dr Westmore's evidence and Dr Nielssen's evidence also"". 
       
       
      First, the defence of mental illness is available and, second, for the same reason, Mrs Reis would be unable to present her defence based on mental illness and, therefore, for the same reason she is unfit. Both psychiatrists agree that she is unfit to be tried; there is no evidence to the contrary. The question for you, therefore, you might think is very easily answered, but it is not for me to tell you what your answer must be. You must consider it and you must give your answer having considered the evidence. 
      
    18 Mr Fliece relies on what Barr J said to the jury and says that the situation which faces me is similar. It is proper to note that because there was no contradictor, the trial Judge was not asked to consider the appropriateness and accuracy of the opinions expressed by the two psychiatrists in that case (one of whom is relied on by the accused in the present hearing) as to the relationship between the accused’s mental illness and the Presser tests. Nor was his Honour asked to determine any matter in dispute or deliver a judgment in which consideration was given to the appropriateness and accuracy of his Honour’s directions. 19 In R v Robertson [1968] 1 WLR 1767 the Court of Appeal examined the case of an accused where, the evidence suggested, he had a complete understanding of the legal proceedings in which he was involved but, though mental illness, suffered from delusions which may have effected his ability to “properly” conduct his defence. In other words, his delusions may have led him to act otherwise than in his best interests. The Court of Appeal held that the fitness trial of the accused was unsatisfactory because the jury may well have thought that the mere fact that the accused was not capable of doing things which were in his best interests was sufficient to enable them to find unfitness.20 Robertson was referred to in R v Mailes [2001] NSWCCA 155 where, as he traced the history of the law of unfitness to plead in the United Kingdom, Wood CJ at CL noted that fitness was concerned with comprehension of proceedings and the ability to communicate with legal advisors rather than the ability to conduct a defence wisely or even rationally. The present case is similar to Robertson in that the accused correctly understands the legal process but dissimilar in that it is not merely the inability to conduct a wise defence which is said to make him unfit to be tried.21 Neither Reis nor Roberston were of much assistance to me.22 It is as well to remember that the concept underlying the various tests regarding fitness to be tried is one of fairness. Howard and Westmore, the authors of Crime and Mental Health Law in NSW (Butterworths 2005) say that: “The notion of fairness to the accused is the touchstone of the law in this area” and that “common humanity” requires that “no man should be called upon to make his defence at a time when his mind is in that situation as not to appear capable of so doing”, see R v John Frith (1790) 22 St Tr 307 (a case involving a man who threw a stone at a coach containing King George III - coincidentally another attack on George III by a man suffering from delusions was part of the development of the verdict of not guilty on the grounds of insanity see R v Hatfield (1800) 27 St Tr 1281)23 The Presser tests are therefore tests which determine whether it is fair to put an accused on his or her trial. Where there is a dispute as to how the Presser tests should be applied in a particular case it can therefore be helpful to recognise that the tests don’t exist for their own sake, but do have the idea of fairness to the accused lying behind them.24 This brings me to one of the most important considerations regarding the present matter. Dr Nielssen, as I said earlier, is of the opinion that the accused is not fit to be tried because he cannot instruct his lawyers as to whether he should raise the plea of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. Assuming for the moment that that is the case, and assuming even further that it is to the benefit of the accused to plead not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, would it be fair to put the accused to his trial in those circumstances? In this respect it must be remembered that the availability of a verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness does not depend on that outcome being raised by the accused. Even if the accused does not wish to be found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, a trial judge is obliged to leave that verdict to a jury in an appropriate case.25 In Falconer v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 30 (at 63) Dean and Dawson JJ said: 
     
      
      “we can see no reason why, if there is evidence which would support a verdict on the grounds of insanity, the prosecution should not be able to rely upon it in asking for a qualified acquittal as an alternative to conviction”  
      
    26 Also, in R v Ayoub (1984) 10 A Crim R 313, Street CJ, with whom Slattery J agreed said that: 
     
      
      “it is of course clear that if the state of the evidence justifies it a trial judge will put to the jury the defence of mental illness of his own motion… moreover irrespective of whether or not the accused raises or disclaims such a defence, a trial judge if he sees it as fairly open may well have a positive duty to put the defence himself.  
      
    27 See also Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 177 CLR 500 at 517. 28 So, in those circumstances it is difficult to see how the accused’s inability to instruct his lawyers on the issue of whether he was not guilty on the grounds of mental illness would result in a trial which was unfair to the accused because, whether or not the accused provided appropriate instructions, if the evidence justified it, that verdict would be available at trial.29 Mr Fliece responded to this matter by suggesting that if the accused’s lawyers raised the mental illness defence over his objection, then they may have their instructions withdrawn. There are a number of things to say about that submission. Firstly neither psychiatrist was prepared to attempt to predict whether the accused would withdraw his instructions if his lawyers themselves raised the possibility of a verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. Secondly the accused has been present in court during evidence and argument concerning his fitness to be tried and there has been no suggestion that he has objected to his lawyers advancing a proposition that he was mentally ill at the time of the alleged offence. And thirdly, even if he did terminate his lawyers’ instructions, the prosecution would be bound to at least raise the issue of the not guilty by reason of mental illness verdict which the trial judge would, depending on the evidence, be obliged to leave to the jury.30 So, in assessing the consequences of the accused’s inability to accept that he was mentally ill at the time of the offence, it is important to note that this inability does not preclude a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness.31 Another matter of importance to note is this: Dr Nielssen describes the mental illness defence as being “obvious” and the assumption seems to have been made that the accused is acting irrationally in denying that he stabbed Mr Dorahy in the face of strong evidence against him. 32 Yet that assumption may not be accurate. Dr Nielssen has not, for example, seen the closed circuit television footage on which the Crown proposes to rely. But even if the Crown case is strong, does the fact that the accused denies committing the offence, and claims to have been elsewhere at the time it was committed, suggest that he is unable to properly instruct his lawyers? He would not be the first person to enter a plea of not guilty in the face of a strong Crown case. Nor would he be the first person to refuse to plead that he was not guilty on the grounds of mental illness because he would prefer a verdict of “not guilty”. The accused may well have the view that he would like to take his chances hoping perhaps that for whatever reason the case against him collapses. 33 Perhaps more importantly it should not be assumed that it is appropriate to take the strength of the Crown case into account when determining whether a person is fit to be tried on the basis that they wish to maintain their innocence. I share the reservations expressed by Dr Allnutt that it is appropriate for a psychiatrist, or even me as a judge conducting a fitness hearing, to say that a strong Crown case is a matter to be taken into account in determining whether an accused who wishes to raise an alibi, for example, can properly instruct his lawyers. Yet it seems that Dr Nielssen did take the strength of the Crown case into account in forming his opinion.34 People plead not guilty in the face of strong Crown cases for various reasons, not only because they have limited insight into whether they were mentally ill or not at the time an offence was committed. Accused people may refuse to plead guilty out of belligerence, an unwillingness to face up to what he or she has done, or a hope that the Crown case against them will collapse. Why should I assume that the reason the accused denies his guilt in the face of a strong Crown case is because of his limited insight into whether he was mentally ill at the time the offence was committed? In any case, if it were a relevant matter then I would have expected more evidence to have been presented to me, perhaps the statements of the alleged victim, the CCTV footage, the statements of those who identify the accused as well as those who failed to identify the accused from photographs. The question of this accused’s fitness cannot really be determined according to how strong the case against him is, especially when evidence relevant to this issue was not put before me. 35 Even if the strength of the Crown case is a relevant factor, from conversations with Dr Allnutt, it is clear that the accused understands that a plea of guilty on the grounds of mental illness guarantees his incarceration, perhaps for “a few years”, whereas a plea of not guilty gives him a chance of being set free. Why should it be assumed that what the accused told the psychiatrists, that is that he did not stab Mr Dorahy, is necessarily the result of his mental illness? On the limited evidence presented to me it cannot be said that the accused is necessarily wrong – whether he is or not will need to be determined at either a special hearing or a criminal trial, but I do not consider it appropriate for me to make that determination at this stage. 36 The accused is able to tell his lawyers, and psychiatrists, about his version of events. Indeed as I have said earlier, the accused has claimed that at the time that the victim was stabbed he, the accused, was at home. Even if that version of events is rejected, and even if in truth the accused did in fact stab the victim, it does not follow from the fact that the accused was mentally ill at the time that he has available to him a defence of mental illness. A mentally ill person who commits an offence, is not, in every case, not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. As Dr Allnutt explained a person may commit an offence quite unrelated to their mental illness. 37 Despite the severity of the accused’s symptoms and his bizarre behaviour (assuming for the moment that the accused did in fact do what the Crown alleges) it does not follow that he would automatically be found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. No psychiatrist that I am aware of, has examined the accused in order to determine whether, in that psychiatrist’s opinion, the accused has a defence of mental illness. It is not therefore a case where there is but one true verdict which the accused’s mental illness rules out.38 Mr Fliece says that all that needs be shown is that the accused could perhaps be found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, that is that it is an issue which the accused could validly raise, and that his mental illness prevents him raising it. 39 I do not agree. In my view the undisputed fact that the accused comprehends all relevant aspects of the legal processes involved in a criminal trial means that he is fit to be tried. In particular, the accused understands the availability of a defence of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, and understands the consequences of such a verdict, and it has not been shown that his present unwillingness to embrace that defence results from his mental illness.40 It is well accepted that a person who has no memory of relevant events is still fit to be tried for a crime arising from those events, see R v Drummond NSWCCA 27 May 1994, and it could not be the case that a person who refused to accept that he or she did the relevant acts because he or she had no memory of them would for that reason be unfit to be tried. In many respects this case is similar, something suggested by Dr Allnutt in his evidence.41 As I have noted earlier, it is of assistance in applying the Presser tests in this case to remember that it is the idea of fairness to the accused which lies behind them. As well as being satisfied of the various matters not in dispute, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he is able to make his defence and answer the charge. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he is able to instruct his lawyers and to give them his version of the facts. It is not unfair to put the accused to trial.42 I reach these conclusions for the reasons given above, which I summarise as follows: 
     
     The accused has an astute understanding of the availability of the plea of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness and the consequences of such a finding. 
     
     
     The defence of mental illness is available whether or not the accused raises it. 
     
     
     I am unable to find (and it is certainly not “obvious”) that it is the accused’s mental illness which is causing the accused to offer the version of events which he puts forward. 
     
     
     Even I was able to find that it is the accused’s mental illness which is causing the accused to offer the version of events which he puts forward, the case is not relevantly different from that where a person refuses to accept that he or she did the relevant acts because he or she had no memory of them. 
    43 For those reasons I find that the accused is fit to be tried.

   JUDGMENT1. Mandy Jayne Lewis has appealed to me from the sentence imposed by a Magistrate. She had pleaded guilty to some offences under the Criminal Code of the Commonwealth on 24 February 2009. The Magistrate sentenced her on 7 April 2009. The Magistrate convicted Ms Lewis of the three charges and sentenced her, in effect, to a good behaviour bond under the terms of s 20 of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth. In addition the Magistrate made a reparation order and ordered costs and made an order for fingerprinting of Ms Lewis. 2. The offences which she was convicted of and sentenced for are called engaging in conduct resulting an obtaining a financial advantage for herself from a Commonwealth entity. The statement of facts which was included in exhibit A indicates that Ms Lewis was receiving support from the Commonwealth in the form of a payment called Parenting Payment Single. She had been receiving it intermittently since 1996. Between 14 June 2005 and 6 November 2007 she was receiving that income from the Commonwealth at relevant times but at the same time for some of that period she was receiving income from employment or other government agencies. She was required as a recipient of Parenting Payment Single to disclose to Centrelink the relevant Commonwealth agency circumstances relevant to calculating her payment. Centrelink in turn uses that to calculate the correct benefit. 3. The facts are that there were, in that period that I mentioned, twenty-four relevant fortnights of payment from Centrelink. For three periods within that overall period she either failed to report her employment or her income or under-declared her income. For each of those three periods she was charged with an offence under s 135.2(1) of the Criminal Code of the Commonwealth. The three periods representing the offences were 14 June 2005 until 21 July 2005, 18 August 2005 until about 27 March 2006 and 9 October 2007 until about 6 November 2007. For eighteen of those twenty-four fortnights she omitted to report her employment or her income at all. For six fortnights she substantially under declared her income. The total benefit which was paid to her which ought not to have been paid was $7,522.08. Centrelink periodically send notices to people such as Ms Lewis reminding them of the obligation to keep Centrelink informed of their personal circumstances.4. Ms Lewis in her case tendered one document which was a medical certificate issued by WorkCover New South Wales confirming that she was unfit for work as a result of a work related injury from 1 May 2005 until the end of June 2009. Attached was the report of an MRI of her lumbar spine confirming her injury.5. Ms Lewis’s main point is that she does not want a penalty which involves a conviction. She has - as she points out and is confirmed by Mr Hazelton who appears for the respondent prosecutor - no previous convictions. Ms Lewis indicates that she is happy to be subjected to a bond but wishes to avoid a conviction on her record. Having qualified as an enrolled nurse in the UK, she is retraining undertaking courses in professional counselling at TAFE as well as a Certificate in Drug and Alcohol and a Bachelor of Science for Counselling as well as a Certificate in Workplace Training and Assessment. She is interested in securing employment in the future as a security officer and dog handler. A criminal record would diminish her capacity to undertake work in the health or welfare area as well as significantly in any work in the security related industry.6. She has committed herself to her desire to work as a dog handler and has owned and is arranging to have trained her own dog at the moment. Her employment opportunities are somewhat restricted as a result of the injury which is the subject of the medical certificate and the MRI report. That was an injury which occurred when she was assisting a patient at one of the places where she was working from which she failed to declare or under-declared her income. She is seeing a neurosurgeon in the near future to discuss the possibility of an operation. She has, as well, a history of severe depression and is presently seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication for that condition as well. She accepts full responsibility and regrets her actions. 7. In effect, she is asking me for an order, under s 19B of the Crimes Act 1914, discharging her without proceeding to a conviction upon her giving security by recognisance that she will comply with certain conditions.8. Mr Hazelton points out that offences such as these are regarded seriously by the higher courts. The Court of Criminal Appeal has made it very clear that such offences against the Commonwealth should normally attract a gaol sentence regardless of whether the offences are committed because of the needy circumstances of the offender or because of the greed of the offender. Seven thousand dollars should be regarded as a significant amount of money. As Mr Hazelton points out, the sentencing options usually commence with custody and then a judicial officer needs to be satisfied that anything less than custody is appropriate. It is in that context that he makes the submission that follows that an order under s 19B discharging Ms Lewis would be very lenient sentence. 9. Part of exhibit A, which were the documents before the Magistrate, is a very comprehensive psychological assessment of Ms Lewis by a social worker, named Jennifer Brown, at the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. It is dated 3 April 2009. It sets out a large amount of detail regarding Ms Lewis’s personal history. Ms Lewis confirmed that history from the bar table. 10. She had a difficult childhood with her mother entering into another relationship with a man who sexually assaulted her and her brother. Ms Lewis has two children both of them girls, the younger is aged fifteen and still at home. The elder daughter herself has a child, a boy named Josh who was born in 2006. This daughter of Ms Lewis’s has had an unstable history of relationships and for a time Ms Lewis was herself looking after Josh. In addition, Ms Lewis herself has been in the past in an abusive relationship. The relationship between her and her elder daughter, the mother of Josh, has also been very difficult over the years.11. The report lists a number of significant problems with Ms Lewis’s health which, as the report said, impacted upon her psychological health. A wedding was called off at the end of 2005 when she discovered that her fiancé was being unfaithful; her house caught fire; her mother died in early January 2006 and she was unable to return to the UK; she was involved in a car accident in February 2006 and lost her car and had difficulty with the insurance claim. That series of events as described by the social worker impacted greatly on Ms Lewis resulting in a breakdown and a suicide attempt. She was admitted to Port Macquarie Hospital and monitored and placed on medication. The mental health team were very supportive and she has successfully rehabilitated from the state that she was in at that time. She sustained the work injury that I have referred to in 2008. She experiences chronic pain which affects her sleep and it leads to flashbacks regarding her experiences as a young girl. 12. As I said she is actively undertaking courses in order to retrain herself for a better future. She is still on a Commonwealth benefit and is repaying $20 a fortnight but, as Mr Hazelton pointed out, as a matter-of-fact the debt is going to a previous debt to the Commonwealth and as yet she has not been in a position to repay any arrears from the debt which is the subject of this case. 13. The social worker reports - which Ms Lewis confirms - that she was working shifts which made it difficult for her to estimate her income. She had poor mental health during much of the time of the period of her offences. The social worker reports that Ms Lewis has in her life experienced great loss and suffered psychologically which has had a range of lasting emotional consequences resulting in a serious depression and anxiety condition. The social worker saw her as a resilient person wanting to support herself and her children. With professional support she has survived to adjust and manage for herself and her children and wishes to make a contribution to the community despite her own health challenges. 14. Mr Hazelton helpfully referred me to a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in the Commissioner of Taxation v Baffsky (2001) 122 A Crim R 568. In a judgment delivered by the Chief Justice, with whom Simpson J and Einfeld AJ agreed, the Court reviewed the circumstances in which s 19B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act - the section Ms Lewis is asking me to apply - should be interpreted. The Chief Justice referred to a decision of the High Court in Cobiac v Liddy (1969) 119 CLR 257. His Honour said that other than by reason of the applicability of s 16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, s 19B(1)(b) is relevantly in the same terms as the legislation considered by the High Court in that case which had upheld, by majority, the exercise of the Magistrate’s discretion. The Chief Justice said at [21]: 
     
      
      “The joint judgment in Cobiac v Liddy establishes that the list of relevant considerations for determining the issue of “expediency” is broader than the list of matters specifically listed as factors to which the Court must have regard.” 
       
      
    His Honour then referred to a judgment of Sir Victor Windeyer, who is not part of the joint judgment, and after quoting from that passage the Chief Justice went on to say at [23]: 
     
      
      “This last reference to the ‘whole of the circumstances of the offender and the offence’ opens up a wide range of factors as relevant to the exercise of the statutory discretion. It appears that his Honour, like the judges who signed the joint judgment, did not take a narrow view of the scope of the relevant considerations, notwithstanding his Honour’s reference to the need for one or other of the specified factors to themselves be of sufficient significance to justify the finding of the expediency.” 
       
      
    The Chief Justice concluded at [29] as follows: 
     
      
      “These authorities clearly indicate the breadth of the considerations relevant to the determination of inexpediency. For the purposes of Commonwealth offences that breadth is confirmed by s 16A(2). It is the matters identified in that subsection which a Court exercising the power in s 19B(1) must take into account.” 
       
      
    15. Turning to the application of s 19B to this case, I need to be satisfied that the charge is proved which I am in this case as the result of the admissions and the plea of guilty. If I am of the opinion - having regard to certain matters - that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment, then I may make the order which Ms Lewis seeks. I am to have regard, in exercising that discretion, to a number of alternative factors. The factors which I regard as relevant in this case are Ms Lewis’s health and mental condition and I regard the offences as having been committed in this case under extenuating circumstances. Although, as Mr Hazelton correctly pointed out, the first offence commenced in June 2005 whereas Ms Lewis’s health started to significantly deteriorate at the end of 2005, she was carrying the personal emotional burden of her own upbringing as well as dealing with her relationship with her elder daughter. For much of the period it seems to me that the offences were committed she was undergoing significant personal difficulties so far as her own life and mental health were concerned resulting, as I said, at one stage in a breakdown and suicide attempt. These are very significant factors. 16. Taking my lead from the Chief Justice’s judgment in Baffsky’s case I regard the factors relevant to the exercise of my discretion as to whether it is inexpedient to inflict punishment as being broader than the factors listed and to which I have already referred. In this case I regard it as relevant that Ms Lewis is making every effort to redress the difficult background and personal circumstances which she has undergone, in retraining herself to become more employable in the future. She is doing that on a number of fronts including a commitment to training a dog for the purposes of becoming a dog handler. As she points out it makes sense that a conviction which involves a question of dishonesty would clearly impact on her ability to secure employment in the security industry - indeed any conviction may have such an impact in that industry - but it would also impact on her ability to secure employment in other industries as well. Taking into account her health, mental condition and extenuating circumstances in which she committed the offences and her efforts to become more employable I regard it as inexpedient to inflict any punishment in this case.17. I, therefore, propose to allow the appeal and in due course I will discharge her or make an order providing for a conditional discharge. HIS HONOUR: Now, I just step away from the reasons, Mr Hazelton and Ms Lewis, I will just ask you whilst I make these formal orders to think of any particular conditions that you might think are helpful and I just proceed to formalise the order. Have a seat.18. Accordingly, under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence of the Magistrate. Instead of that sentence, under s 19B(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1914, I discharge Ms Lewis without proceeding to conviction in respect of all three charges upon her giving security without sureties by a recognisance that she will comply with the following conditions:(a) That she will of good behaviour for two years;(b) That she will make reparation in respect of the offences in the sum of $7,522.08 by instalments of $20 a fortnight.19. I will stop there. I should also add as part of my reasons that I have taken into account the provisions of s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 and I regard the order which I have made as of a severity, for the reasons which I have given, appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence and I have specifically taken into account under s 16A(2)(m) Ms Lewis’s means and under (n) her prospects of rehabilitation. HIS HONOUR: I will stop there. Mr Hazelton, I will ask you first. I said that it should be by recognisance is that how it’s normally done?HAZELTON: That’s correct, your Honour, the only thing I would add to the order is that usually, well, I understand that it is necessary for you to make the order with respect to security in an amount. You’ve discharged the defendant upon giving security, the security should be an amount.HIS HONOUR: What sort of amount is it?HAZELTON: I believe it is in the Court’s discretion, your Honour, but I don’t accurately know.HIS HONOUR: That’s all right, is the security a promise to pay it’s not like a deposit?HAZELTON: It is a promise to pay. If the defendant forfeits on the order, say she breaches the bond, then the amount is automatically in default.HIS HONOUR: All right, I have in mind $500. Security in the sum of $500. I’ll hear you in a moment, Ms Lewis, and I have ordered reparation. What about Probation and Parole, do you have a view about that or not sure one way or the other.HAZELTON: That is unusual, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I don’t think it’s necessary in this case, I think she seems to be looking after herself.HAZELTON: But in any regard the order under 19B doesn’t require that you make conditions with respect to parole and probation. Perhaps it might have been.HIS HONOUR: No, it’s an option, it’s just an option, yes. All right, thanks, Mr Hazelton. 20. Now, Ms Lewis, what I’ve done is allow your appeal. I’ve given you a discharge. I’m putting you on a bond for two years. There is no conviction. This is a bond to be of good behaviour. You’ve got to stay out of trouble for two years. I’ve made an order that you have to repay the $7,000-plus by $20 a fortnight.APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour. Would that be $20 on top of $20 I pay now?HIS HONOUR: How much have you got left to pay now?APPELLANT: I don’t know, your Honour, to be honest.HIS HONOUR: No, I think what I’ll do is order that once you have repaid your present debt then after your present debt is repaid then you commence to repay this debt $20 a fortnight. I’m thinking that I don’t need to send you to Probation and Parole unless you think that’s a good idea.APPELLANT: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I don’t think so because you’ve got your own health professionals that you’re seeing and getting advice from.APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Is there anything you want to say about those orders which I suggested?APPELLANT: The security deposit of $500 what does that mean? Does that mean I have to pay that?HIS HONOUR: It’s not a deposit, you don’t have to pay it unless you default.APPELLANT: Okay.HIS HONOUR: Then you’re up for $500.APPELLANT: Okay.HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that?APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour, yes, thank you.HIS HONOUR: Do you want to say anything about that?APPELLANT: No, your Honour.HAZELTON: Could I suggest, your Honour, in the State jurisdiction it usually expresses an agreement to forfeit rather than a security.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I’m just reading the legislation here. That’s a good way of putting it, it’s an agreement to forfeit, isn’t it, yes.HAZELTON: Yes, sometimes I’ve found in offices there can be a problem with the use of the word “security.” HIS HONOUR: Thank you.HAZELTON: In some respects in the Commonwealth, your Honour, the security of giving of the security is the security itself, we do insist upon a monetary value being attached to that security.HIS HONOUR: All right. 21. I put, upon her giving security (that is agreeing to forfeit) the amount of $500. HIS HONOUR: I think that clarifies it, thanks Mr Hazelton.Do you understand all of that?APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: What do you want to ask?  APPELLANT: What actually happens to my fingerprints that were taken?HIS HONOUR: That’s a good question. Do you have an answer to that?APPELLANT: And does that mean as from today I don’t have a criminal record so if there was a criminal record check done.HIS HONOUR: It means that, yes, because you don’t have a conviction. I’ve set aside the order which includes the conviction and I have made an order without proceeding to conviction so you have no convictions. The fingerprint order is made under s 3ZL of some Act.HAZELTON: It’s the Crimes Act once again, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I don’t have all of that, there may well be some provision of what happens on appeal, if someone is successful on appeal. APPELLANT: I mean, because like those fingerprints would only be used like if I burgled somewhere or did something wrong which I’m not going to do.HIS HONOUR: I understand that but you’ve raised a fair question.APPELLANT: Yes, I just wondered.HAZELTON: Your Honour, I can look into this. I can get some instructions from the office, I don’t know the answer, myself, but I can--HIS HONOUR: There’s nothing in the statute about it?HAZELTON: There is a provision for destruction of identification material. It says: 
     
      
      “ 
      If identification material has been taken from a person under s 3J 
      ” 
       
      
    section 3ZL is what we’re considering here.HIS HONOUR: Do you mind if I have a quick look at that Act?HAZELTON: Yes, certainly, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I would be grateful if you could look into that. I’m not sure how, yes, it’s not obvious.HAZELTON: Would I be able to inform your Honour in Chambers subsequently and perhaps we could then - because I would need to return to the office another matter will come on, is it possible for me to contact you after this afternoon to inform you and we can inform--HIS HONOUR: Yes, but we would have to keep Ms Lewis in on it as well.HAZELTON: Right, well, could I inform Ms Lewis of the outcome?HIS HONOUR: Yes, do you have an email or a phone number?APPELLANT: Yes, I do, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Email?APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That’s handy. My associate will give you her card or give it to both of you, one each, which has her email address. Would you send me an email as a result of your research? Send it to her, my associate, and copy it to Ms Lewis so she knows what’s going on and if she wants to can make any submission if she wants to and then I’ll indicate through my associate how I’ll deal with it. It might be that we can’t do anything, there’s no power for me to do anything I don’t know. But Mr Hazelton is going to check it to see whether there is any power for me to do anything.APPELLANT: Okay, thank you very much.HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else you want to ask?APPELLANT: Yes, now the good behaviour bond I’ve already got for 12 months for the previous case.HIS HONOUR: Yes, that’s gone, I’ve set that aside.APPELLANT: Do I need to go to the Registry to go back on another good behaviour bond for two years?HIS HONOUR: Yes.APPELLANT: What happens with the court costs, I have to pay from the last court case, I can go and sort that out now because--HIS HONOUR: I haven’t ordered any court costs.APPELLANT: Okay, but what about from the last court case?HIS HONOUR: No, I set that aside. Have you paid any of that?APPELLANT: No, not yet because when I appealed--HIS HONOUR: No, look, I think you’ve got enough to pay, they were $128 weren’t they?APPELLANT: Yes.22. No, I’m not going to order you to pay those. I should but I’m not going to, no. I’ve got to explain it to you and I think you do understand. You’ve got a good behaviour bond if you mess up, misbehave yourself, get into trouble, you’ll be back before me and I can sentence you to something more serious and you’ll have a conviction. You have no conviction. You’ve got to be of good behaviour for two years and you have been ordered to pay the $7,000-plus, $20 a fortnight commencing after your present debt has been paid off and you’ve got to enter into a security for $500 which is a promise to forfeit that amount, that is, pay that amount if you breach the bond. Do you understand all of that?APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour, thank you very much.HIS HONOUR: Anything else, Mr Hazelton?HAZELTON: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That’s it, Ms Lewis, now you’ll need to go to the Registry, is that right?APPELLANT: Level 4, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Level 4 of the Downing Centre and my associate probably has to prepare the order, is that right, which I sign and how does that get down to the Registry? Then you take it down, do you? I wonder if Ms Lewis might be able to take it down once I sign it. No, you should, okay. If you go down you’ll have to wait.APPELLANT: Okay.HIS HONOUR: I have to sign this order and then it will be taken down and then they’ll do it down there, all right?APPELLANT: Just one more thing, your Honour, my workers medical certificate and my MRI results could I possibly take that back?HIS HONOUR: You want that back? Yes, you can. APPELLANT: Yeah, because that’s the only copy that I have.HIS HONOUR: I return exhibit 1 to Ms Lewis.APPELLANT: Thank you very much, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Good luck.APPELLANT: Thank you very much.HIS HONOUR: Thanks, Mr Hazelton, for your assistance.HAZELTON: Thank you, your Honour.

     Judgment 
    Stay of proceedings in defamation[1] The defendants bring an application pursuant to s 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) for a stay of these proceedings, asserting that New South Wales is not a convenient forum.[2] The plaintiff filed a Statement of Claim on 29 September 2008 claiming damages for three publications in New South Wales pleaded as arising pursuant to the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). The first of these was a letter dated 9 July 2002 which was sent to the Eastern Suburbs Rugby Union Football Club on 15 June 2005. The second was a letter dated 26 August 2002 which was sent to the Eastern Suburbs Rugby Union Football Club on the same date. The third was the covering letter which enclosed the first two letters. These are not media publications; they are letters also sent to a series of individuals in Queensland, and the extent of publication is very limited.[3] There were substantial deficiencies with this Statement of Claim. Any action for defamation in New South Wales for a publication on 15 June 2005 was statute barred by 29 September 2008 by reason of s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW), as the court is not empowered to extend the limitation period pursuant to s 56A Limitation Act 1969 beyond the maximum three year period, which had already expired prior to the commencement of these proceedings. In addition, the three letters were all one publication.[4] An Amended Statement of Claim was filed on 24 April 2009. Only one publication is now pleaded, namely the letter of 15 June 2005 with its annexures. However, the defendants challenge the imputations pleaded and I note the particulars of publication still include a claim of publication in New South Wales although in reality all the publications which are not time barred occurred in Queensland.[5] The plaintiff now concedes that there is no cause of action in New South Wales and that the only action the plaintiff has for defamation must arise from publication in Queensland, as the limitation under the repealed Defamation Act 1898 (Qld) is six years; the Defamation Act 2005 (Qld) does not apply by reason of s 49(1) as the publication falls outside the commencement date of that Act, namely 1 January 2006. The plaintiff does, however, point to the time barred publications to the Eastern Suburbs Rugby Union Football Club for “grapevine effect” damages both in New South Wales and Queensland (paragraph 9 of the Amended Statement of Claim) and one of the issues of law in any trial in New South Wales would be if a plaintiff is entitled to rely upon “grapevine effect” from a time-barred publication as a matter going to damages.[6] The matter complained of is set out as a schedule (see SCHEDULE “A”) to this judgment. It will be readily apparent that the entirety of its subject matter relates to events in Queensland, as Mr Rasmussen for the plaintiff conceded. The subject matter is factually complex; the letters refer to at least eleven incidents of some antiquity, including the circumstances in which the plaintiff allegedly took nude photographs of the under-19 football team on occasions in 2001 and 2002, as well as to a number of financial transactions during that period.[7] A defendant who objects to the hearing of proceedings in New South Wales and seeks a transfer to another state has several courses available, the most commonly used being an application under cross-vesting legislation: BHP Billiton Ltd v Schultz (2004) 211 ALR 523; Le Busque v ACP Publishing Pty Ltd [2006] ACTSC 46 (“Le Busque”); Lamont v Dwyer [2007] ACTSC 47; Simeone v Walker [2006] SASC 387 (“Simeone”). This is an expensive and time-consuming process for both parties. The application usually made to the District Court is for a stay pending an application in the Supreme Court for a transfer, as matters are transferred first to the Supreme Court and then to the interstate Supreme Court: see for example Geelong Advertiser Pty Ltd v Bertolacci [2008] NSWSC 1363. Another alternative is to file a Notice of Discontinuance in the District Court and start again, as the plaintiff attempted to do in very similar factual circumstances in KBRV Resort Operations Pty Ltd v Chilcott [2001] NSWCA 116.[8] Mr Rasmussen, who appeared for the plaintiff, did not raise the appropriateness of the defendants invoking the cross-vesting procedure as opposed to a general stay, and did not submit that the purpose of the stay should be limited to requiring the defendants (as opposed to the plaintiff) to go to the Supreme Court for a transfer and a cross-vesting application. He in fact pointed out that the parties would not be much better off in the Supreme Court in Brisbane and that the best venue would be the District Court in Toowoomba, which tends to underline the common sense of a stay to enable the plaintiff to start again.[9] Complaints of inconvenient forum are brought where the other jurisdiction is foreign, not where the other jurisdiction is another State or Territory of Australia, although the principles for dealing with such an application are similar: Le Busque at [6] – [7]. [10] The entitlement of a defendant to seek a stay under s 67 Civil Procedure Act, and whether it can be used to impose the burden of applying for a transfer, as opposed to seeking a cross-vesting order, is something of a novel issue. However, it must be remembered that the nature and extent of s 67 needs to be read in light of ss 56-62 Civil Procedure Act (the “overriding purpose” and “elimination of delay” provisions). Section 67 gives the court explicit power to stay proceedings and is complemented by rr 13.4 and 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).[11] In the present case, the plaintiff commenced proceedings in New South Wales which were time barred and which related to events which occurred in Queensland in 2001 and 2002. The complexities of any trial, which would need to be conducted under a repealed New South Wales Act as to procedure and a repealed Queensland Act to substantive law issues, would be considerable. Miss Gleeson, for the defendants, also draws to my attention the fact that there could be problems under the Queensland criminal law in relation to documents sought from the police concerning a number of police investigations referred to. This is not just a case where the defendants complain about costs and prejudice; it is one where case management and trial issues for this court would be of a very high order. The factual situation underlying this application truly is exceptional.[12] The defendants point to the following matters in support of the application: 
     
     (a) The applicable law is the law of Queensland, which is a significant factor in relation to convenient forum, for the reasons explained by Brereton J in  
     McGregor v Potts 
      [2005] NSWSC 1098 at [48] ( 
     “McGregor 
     ”), where his Honour said: 
      
      
      
      “ 
      [48] 
       In some situations, the continuation of an action in a selected (local) forum, though not amounting to vexation or oppression or an abuse of process in the strict sense, will amount to an injustice to the defendant when the bringing of the action in some other available and competent forum would not occasion an injustice to the plaintiff [ 
      Voth 
      , 556]. The local forum would be a “clearly inappropriate” one where “the subject matter of the action and the parties had little connection with that forum and the defendant may be put to great expense and inconvenience in contesting the action in that forum” [ 
      Voth 
      , 557]. There is no hint in their Honours’ reasoning that, in addition, proof of actual vexation or oppression was required: in effect, continuation of proceedings is presumed to be vexatious or oppressive where the forum is shown to be “clearly inappropriate”.” 
      
      
     I note that in  
     Le Busque 
      the matter complained of was statute barred in the Australian Capital Territory but that Crispin J still refused the application under s 5(2)  
     Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 
     , 1993 (ACT). However, that was a case where the matter complained of had been published nationally and where the ACT was the plaintiff’s “home town”, which outweighed this issue. That is not the case here as the publications (apart from the statute-barred 2005 publication) were all in Queensland and the plaintiff’s association with New South Wales is of recent and brief duration.  
      
      
     (b) The subject matter, the defendants and all of their witnesses are located in Queensland. A substantial number of subpoenae would need to be issued to banks and other institutions in Queensland. In an affidavit in support sworn by Mr Darren King, a long list of witnesses is given, all of whom reside in Queensland. Some of these witnesses will give evidence as to publication, some as to whether they received the matters complained of, and others as to issues going to defences. In this regard the factual basis is very similar to that in  
     Simeone v Walker 
     , where an application to transfer proceedings from South Australia to Queensland was granted for these “compelling” reasons (Debelle J at [11]). 
      
      
     (c) While the plaintiff has the personal juridical advantage of residing in New South Wales and having some “grapevine” witnesses in this state, there is no other juridical advantage. The plaintiff would have the advantage of avoiding a jury trial on all issues which is likely to occur in Queensland but the disadvantage of the requirement for a s 7A jury trial with all its attendant technicalities, a matter Mr Rasmussen considered, on balance, to be a disadvantage. 
    [13] An appropriate issue to take into account in cases such as this is to contrast the legal costs with the amount likely to be awarded. The imputations (see SCHEDULE “B”) are of a serious nature. However, there has been substantial delay in the commencement and prosecution of this litigation. While I should be careful not to penalise the plaintiff for this (as I have been informed that he is commencing proceedings for professional negligence against his former solicitor for failing to commence proceedings in time), the fact remains that the length of time since the publication and limited publication mean that the damages awarded, even if the plaintiff is entirely successful, could be Pyrrhic in nature. The plaintiff will also need to issue subpoenae for evidence and call witnesses from Queensland if there is to be a defence of justification, and the solicitor/client component of the costs could conceivably outweigh any verdict awarded.[14] The plaintiff points to evidence of the “grapevine effect” in New South Wales, and has identified three persons who are members of the Eastern Suburbs Rugby Union Football Club who may be called in this regard. The plaintiff can of course give evidence of “grapevine effect” without calling any witnesses. The plaintiff also points to correspondence he had with the Chief Executive Officer of the New South Wales Rugby Union, but such correspondence could be tendered without the need to call this gentleman. Similarly, evidence of shunning and avoiding can be given by the plaintiff without the need to call the persons who shunned and avoided the plaintiff.[15] If I were to apply the “clearly inappropriate forum” test, the issue would be to determine whether the conduct of the case would be seriously and unfairly burdensome or unjustifiably troubling: Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 243 and 247-248. This task involves the judge hearing the application in what has been called an impressionistic determination and is capable of taking into account a wide range of consideration: Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd (1990) 171 CLR 538 (“Voth”). Ms Gleeson drew my attention to the following statement from Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571 at 586-587: 
     
     “In  
     Voth 
     , this Court adopted for Australia the test propounded by Deane J in  
     Oceanic Sun 
     , namely, that a stay should be granted if the local court is a clearly inappropriate forum, which will be the case if continuation of the proceedings in that court would be oppressive, in the sense of “seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging”, or, vexatious, in the sense of “productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment”. It was also held in  
     Voth 
      that, in determining whether the local court is a clearly inappropriate forum, “the discussion by Lord Goff in  
     Spiliada 
      of relevant ‘connecting factors’ and ‘a legitimate personal or juridical advantage’ provides valuable assistance”.” 
    [16] This was explained by Brereton J in McGregor at [46] - [47]: 
     
     [46]  
     The effect of the High Court's endorsement, in  
     Voth 
     , of the value of Lord Goff's analysis of connecting factors, is that, in deciding whether the continuation of proceedings in the local forum is vexatious or oppressive, if an analysis of the connecting factors shows that the question of connection is not finely balanced but very clearly one way, then it can be presumed that compelling the foreign party to litigate in the local forum will occasion vexation and oppression in the relevant sense — much as it can be presumed that there is prejudice from delay (as to which see  
     Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor 
      (1996) 186 CLR 541 at 551, 555, per McHugh J). If proof of actual vexation or oppression were essential, examination of the various connecting factors would be a sterile exercise. 
      
      
     [47]  
     Consistently with this approach, the High Court pointed out that the “clearly inappropriate forum” test was similar to, and for that reason likely to yield the same result as, the “more appropriate forum” test in the majority of cases, the difference between the two being of critical significance only in those probably rare cases in which it is held that an available foreign tribunal is the natural or more appropriate forum, but in which it cannot be said that the local tribunal is a “clearly inappropriate” one. Allowing that the question that the “clearly inappropriate forum” test presents is slightly different — in that it focuses on the advantages and disadvantages arising from a continuation of the proceed­ings in the selected forum, rather than on the need to make a comparative judgment between the two forums — their Honours said that considerations relating to the suitability of the alternative forum were still relevant to examination of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the selected forum: “The important point is that, in those cases in which the ascertainment of the natural forum is a complex and finely balanced question, the court may more readily conclude that it is not a clearly inappropriate forum” ( 
     Voth 
      (at 558)). This indicates that the fundamental issue is the degree of connexion which the proceedings have with the local forum: while a conclusion that they have a greater connection with a foreign forum will not justify a conclusion that their continuation in the local forum is vexatious or oppressive, one that they have so clearly a stronger connection with a foreign forum that the local court can be said to be “clearly inappropriate” will do so.” 
    [17] The reference to Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor (1996) 186 CLR 541, the landmark case on the dangers of delay in litigation, is of particular relevance in these proceedings. This is a case where the relevant facts occurred more than seven years ago. Whatever the plaintiff’s reasons for delay in commencing this action (and I note in the matter complained of there are references to correspondence with him about these matters in June 2002) it is essential that these proceedings should be prosecuted with vigour to avoid further delays in the future. It is clear to me that this is most likely to happen if the case is heard in Queensland, preferably in a court in or near to Toowoomba.[18] The Court of Appeal in Garsec Pty Ltd v His Majesty Sultan of Brunei [2008] NSWCA 211 (“Garsec”) has set out the particular factors to be taken into account including the availability of witnesses, the law governing the transactions and the place where the parties reside or carry on business. In Garsec an important issue was whether the stay would have the consequence of no proceedings could be successfully pursued in the jurisdiction of Brunei (Garsec at [7]). The principal objection raised by Mr Rasmussen is that the plaintiff, who is a person of limited financial means, may not be able to obtain assistance from a legal aid or referral centre or legal representation on a ‘no win no fee’ basis in Queensland.[19] While I have given this question anxious consideration, and taken into account the matters raised by Spigleman J in Garsec at [7]-[20], this is not a case where the alternative forum is unavailable. There is no evidence before me that the plaintiff has endeavoured to find ‘no win no fee’ lawyers in Queensland but failed. In any event, the solicitors who have conduct of this matter can continue to conduct these proceedings with the aid of a Queensland agent and can continue to work in accordance with his retainer, as can Mr Rasmussen. Given that the whole of the factual background arises in Queensland it would be necessary for them to do this in any event.[20] Accordingly, if I were to apply the test generally applicable in cross-vesting applications to this application, I would have regard to the factors which Debelle J found so compelling in Simeone and make the same orders, for the same reasons. By granting a stay so that the plaintiff can start again in the District Court in Queensland (where this claim is still in time), I am cutting the Gordian knot.[21] The entitlement of a plaintiff to commence proceedings in the jurisdiction to which he resides, and in which there is some evidence as to damage, is not lightly to be disregarded. However, all of the evidence on all other issues, including aggravated compensatory damages (there being a claim on the basis of the falsity of the imputations) will require witnesses and documents from Queensland and the connection with Queensland is overwhelming. [22] I have not only taken into account the degree of disadvantage to the defendants (and for that matter the plaintiff) but also the degree of complexity for the judges in this court who case manage the proceedings and hear the trial. It would be necessary for the trial judge to conduct the trial under repealed Queensland legislation on substantive law issues and in accordance with repealed New South Wales legislation on procedural issues. There are differences between these New South Wales and Queensland repealed statutes, such as the unavailability of the defence of contextual truth In Queensland which, looking at the imputations the plaintiff has pleaded (and has attempted to avoid) is likely to be a significant complicating factor for the trial judge. In particular the issuing of subpoenae is likely to be a very substantial costs to both sides, as all subpoenae would need to be served interstate. On any test, this is a clear case where all of the factors favour the proceedings being heard in Queensland.[23] Accordingly, rather than require the parties to go through the procedure of transferring the matter under cross-vesting legislation, I propose to take the simpler course proposed by the defendants and to stay these proceedings pursuant to s 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 until further order. I shall place this matter in the Inactive List with a review date of 11 December 2009. The plaintiff can start proceedings again in Queensland.Ancillary matters[24] The defendants also brought an application to strike out a number of the imputations on the basis of form and capacity. The statement of claim clearly requires some surgery. The parties have agreed that if these proceedings are to be heard in Queensland it is appropriate that the matter should be determined by the judge who is case managing these proceedings.[25] The defendants seek costs of the application for a stay. There is much to be said for an order that costs follow the event. However, the plaintiff, who is a person of limited means, will have the expense of starting the litigation again. He should not have the additional burden of a substantial costs order operating as a brake on this step. In my view, an appropriate order is to make an order that costs be costs in the cause, but to grant the defendants liberty to apply to the judge case managing these proceedings in any other court for any different costs order sought.Orders(1) Pursuant to s 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), these proceedings are stayed until further order. (2) This matter is placed in the Inactive List with a notional review date of Friday 11 December 2009.(3) Costs of this application be costs in the cause. (4) Grant the defendants liberty to apply to the judge case managing these proceedings in Queensland in relation to order (3).

    5. Earlier this week we were horrified to see our local newspaper, the Toowoomba Chronicle, print articles regarding the abovementioned person. As previously reported to the QRU, Mr Quinn, was involved in a series of distasteful incidents during the 2002 – U/19 representative season.6. These incidents includes a series of events where, Mr Quinn, inappropriately dealt with youth and finances. We are therefore amazed that Mr Quinn has returned to our region for a schoolboy match where minors are involved and would be extremely surprised if, Mr Quinn, possessed a suitability card.7. Not wishing to elaborate in this format, briefly, the distasteful incidents involved allegations by players of inappropriate / offensive photographs being taken without consent, the execution of a police search warrant and the withholding of approximately $4,500.00 of revenue raised directly from the DDRU/19 players.8. Further investigations by our union unveiled that Mr Quinn had in fact been under the investigation of taskforce ARGUS (QLD Police Service), for many years. That he had been involved with a series of distasteful incidents whilst involved with the UQ Gatton and local Armidale rugby clubs and therefore the DDRU management committee terminated the appointment of Mr Quinn as U/19 representative coach in June 2002. We last heard, Mr Quinn, had fled Australia to America and made contact with the American national rugby union association to alert them of his pre-disposition to young males.9. Our 2002 letters to the QRU empowered you to revoke his coaching re-accreditation, however this has clearly not occurred. The D.D.R.U. has contacted the East Suburbs rugby club, Downlands College and the Toowoomba Grammar School. It is our belief that if Mr Quinn’s accreditation had have been revoked at the time all this extra work could have been avoided.10. We have taken these actions as a ‘duty of care!’ and request you advise us quickly of what action the QRU has taken in this matter.11. Yours Faithfully

    16. Dear Gentlement,17. MR GEOFFREY QUINN – MOST CONFIDENTIAL18. I know that you are aware of some of the actions taken by Mr Quinn as a rugby coach and acting without authority, as an agent of the Darling Downs Rugby Union (DDRU) this year. I am now in a position to enunciate the actions of Mr Quinn, the concerns and actions of the DDRU and the actions that I request from the Queensland Police Service and the assistance that I seek from both the QRU and the QRU legal advisers.19. Background. Mr Quinn was appointed by the DDRU to be coach of the DDRU Under 19 2002 side after he submitted a written application for the position. Mr Quinn held a coaching position at the Gatton College Club (UQ-Gatton) in 2001. Mr Quinn now holds neither management nor coaching positions with that Club.20. Mr Quinn was not provided with a letter of appointment by the DDRU (that will occur from Season 2003); however, he was informed by the DDRU President and Development Officer in the Development Office that he had no authority to commit any expenditure as Under 19 Coach. This occurred on the 16th January 2002.21. Misrepresentation. Under the guise of the position of DDRU Under 19 Coach, Mr Quinn has effectively committed the DDRU to $8,189.27 worth of debts, (the DDRU Senior side cost the DDRU approximately $3,000 for 2002 by comparison), done without the concurrence of the DDRU Management Committee or its individual members.22. It needs to be stated that all Mr Quinn’s actions, and the expenditure that he has incurred relate to rugby training, competition and excursions to Ballymore. He also is in the habit of ‘mentioning’; his plans to Individual Committee Members and the DDRU Development Officer; which he then interprets and argues as official concurrence for his expenditures.23. One example: Mr Quinn gained a number of complimentary Super 12 tickets from the DDRU, he then booked a bus, took the Under 19 team to the game – charging them for their participation and presented the DDRU with the bus travel and other expenses. The money extracted from the players (without the concurrence or approval of the DDRU) is still to be accounted for.24. Mr Quinn has acquired various rugby related material for rallie [sic] purposes which have all been billed to the DDRU. The DDRU cannot locate the exact whereabouts of these articles.25. Mr Quinn booked a bus for his team to travel to Goondiwindi for an Queensland Country fixture, an internal DDRU trip, without DDRU authority and committed the DDRU to in excess of $800 for meals on the day.26. Some of the bills presented to the DDRU have been processed by the Accounts Department of the UQ, Gatton Campus. Mr Quinn is a 55-year-old PhD Agricultural Science student who resides on the Gatton College campus, adjacent to the rugby playing fields. The DDRU intends to investigate the authenticity and accuracy of each account and, if necessary, advise the UQ Gatton Campus Manager that Gatton College has been a party to misrepresentation or fraud.27. Stolen Property. Mr Quinn still has distinctive DDRU property, i.e. the 2002 DDRU Under 19 rugby jerseys, which he refuses to return. He was asked for these to be returned by a DDRU Committee member on the 8th June and again on the 22nd of June – on both occasions he admitted to having the jerseys in his possession and his intention not to return them. This is despite being directed to do so by a resolution of the DDRU Management Committee meeting held on the 3rd June, at which Mr Quinn was present. Mr Quinn was also asked to return the jerseys by the DDRU Open XV Captain on a number of occasions.28. Mr Quinn attempted to conduct his own ‘official’ DDRU Under 19 Presentation Night at the University of Southern Queensland on 22nd of June. It was his intention to present the DDRU jerseys to the players. This event was interrupted by the DDRU President and a Committee Member where Mr Quinn, and his colleague, were informed of his legal position and of their intention to report the possession of DDRU property to the Queensland Police Service. This was done, the following Monday the 24th and a copy of that official complaint is attached.29. Video Incident. Mr Quinn has forwarded video bills (for the filming of representative games) to the DDRU for the sum of $1,100 – this was after the DDRU Management Meeting of 3rd June where the Committee, expressed its surprise at the expenditure incurred, but nevertheless agreed that the bills had to be paid. At Mr Quinn’s ‘Presentation Night’ individual videotapes were in Mr Quinn’s possession to be presented to individual players. The person who provided these tapes claimed he had provided them to Mr Quinn at no charge.30. Raffle. Mr Quinn distributed a number of raffle tickets to members of the DDRU Under 19 side under the guise of a DDRU approved raffle. This was done without the knowledge or approval of the DDRU. Mr Quinn charged the prizes and tickets for the raffle to the DDRU, again without authority. The response of the DDRU Management Committee is contained in Mr Hickey’s letter to Mr Quinn of 6th June. Accordingly, Mr Sean Hale, the DDRU Treasurer attended the 15th June DDRU fixture at Gatton; Mr Quinn was not in attendance and could not be located. The Gaming Commission has been advised by the DDRU of the failure of Mr Quinn to act in accordance with Queensland Treasury requirements, a copy is attached.31. Mr Quinn’s Coaching Behaviour. Mr Quinn’s behaviour following the defeat of the DDRU Under 19 XV could be described as obsessive and immature. Mr Quinn refused to accept the full-time score and provided video evidence of the ‘referee’s bias’, represented himself to the QRU and to the individual referee – all on his own volition. Mr Luke Wyatt of the QRU has more detail on his episode, which might represent a violation of the QRU Coach’s code of Conduct.32. Inappropriate Behaviour. Mr Quinn has been accused by a number of the DDRU Under 19 XV of photographing their genital regions while they were urinating and despite their protestations. The DDRU received an anonymous undated letter in May; our resultant actions including emailing the QRU to inform you of this accusation and the interviewing of the Under 19 side to ascertain the truth of these accusations. As a result of this action two team members have been prepared to submit a written complaint. This complaint, dated 4th of July, is attached. As a result of these interviews, is was obvious that a number of players left the DDRU Representative Under 19 side because of Mr Quinn’s ‘approach’ and his costly ‘social activities’. The DDRU will be taking this complaint to the Queensland Police Service at Toowoomba.33. There is another matter concerning Mr Quinn’s actions in relation to an individual player, which is currently under review – the prime concern of the DDRU is for the well being of the player. It concerns the ‘harassment’ of, and the discomfort felt by that player, a DDRU Under 19 player (who is eligible to play Under 19 next year) who is on the UQ Gatton Campus – the same Campus that Mr Quinn resides. Mr Dominic Doyle, the DDRU Development Officer is the point of contact on this issue.Conclusion34. It is my firm belief that Mr Quinn uses his position as Coach and his ‘perceived’ power of that position to ingratiate himself to the members of the 2002 DDRU Under 19 XV. It needs to be stated that of the 40 players who represented the DDRU 2002 Under 19 XV, eight were present at Mr Quinn’s ‘Presentation Night.’ The DDRU is acutely aware that the web of Mr Quinn’s actions can be interpreted as ‘misunderstandings’ and ‘boys’ pranks’; nevertheless the actions of a 55 year old with 18 and some 17 year olds is very different to ‘boys pranks’ among peers.35. Mr Quinn’s modus operandi is a cleverly weaved plan of action intended to emphasis his power, his authority and his wherewithal in the eyes of his young charges. He has taken advantage of a part-time Sporting Committee to establish himself on his target market. The DDRU is aware that Mr Quinn previously coached a composite University side in Armidale in 1994. The DDRU has taken the following actions:· advised you of the ‘camera’ incident on 30 of May;· reported the illegal possession of DDRU property to the Police on 24th June;· advised the Gaming Commission of Mr Quinn’s action;36. The DDRU intends to report the ‘camera incident’ to the Police and to validate Mr Quinn’s bills with the relevant merchants and, if necessary to advise the Gatton College Campus Manager of the consequences. It also intends to distribute to all DDRU Clubs the following Notice: “Mr Geoff Quinn was the DDRU 2002 Under 19 Coach. That position was declared vacant on 3rd June and subsequently; Mr Quinn has no coaching responsibilities for any DDRU XV. Further, Mr Quinn is not, and has never been a member of the DDRU Management Committee or its Executive.”37. The DDRU formally request that it be provided with legal access to clear this matter entirely. The DDRU believes that as a result of further investigations at least one player or players might require counselling and that Mr Quinn’s rugby coaching accreditation should be withdrawn until his actions receive favourable review. The DDRU is aware of a number of players’ parents very dissatisfied with Mr Quinn’s treatment of their sons – we believe that a player’s parent wrote the anonymous letter.38. I find this entire matter tedious and distasteful. However, people who employ Mr Quinn’s modus operandi bank on Committees such as the DDRU not ‘grasping the nettle.’ Mr Quinn, at the present time, is mounting a campaign against the DDRU quoting our current actions as motivated by vindictiveness and jealousy of his coaching success. I very much appreciate your assistance with this matter.39. Yours truly

Inspector Bill KnowlesInspector Toowoomba DistrictToowoomba Police Station4/173 Hume StreetTOOWOOMBA Qld 435042. Dear Gentlemen,43. MR GEOFFREY FRANCIS MICHAEL QUINN – UPDATE – MOST CONFIDENTIAL44. I must express my disappointment for not having received any acknowledgement, or any other communication on this matter from the QRU or its management, since our registered communication was sent on 11th July. The only communication on this matter on behalf of the QRU has been a verbal assurance of legal support from Mr Wyatt in June.45. This has been a very difficult matter to manage, and has taken up an extraordinary amount of time by the voluntary DDRU Management Committee. I can assure you all, that Mr Quinn’s ‘habits’ are very common knowledge among the DDRU Under 19 XV members (and a significant number of parents) the UQ Gatton College Management Committee, the UQ Gatton 2002 Under 19 XV members, as well as the DDRU Management Committee.46. I wish to now provide further assistance of Mr Quinn’s modus operandi which conclusively reveals that his operating pattern in relation to the 2002 DDRU Under 19 XV was not an isolated incident.47. UQ Gatton College Rugby Club – 2001 Incident. Mr Quinn was the UQ Gatton Rugby Club 2001 Under 19 Coach. An incident occurred during the Gatton Vs Goondiwindi fixture played at Goondiwindi. During the return bus trip from Goondiwindi UQ Gatton Rugby College have a quaint practice of ‘travelling nude.’ During this trip Mr Quinn took a series of photographs of the players, both Senior and Under 19. Mr Quinn refused to return the film when this was demanded by one of the UQ Gatton Club Committee, and the matter was resolved by the UQ Gatton Club.48. Mr Quinn also incurred debts on behalf of the UQ Gatton Club, some of which are still to be resolved. Mr Quinn has no position in the UQ Gatton Rugby Club. However, the UQ Gatton Rugby Club has a very high attrition rate amongst its players and officials because of its ‘isolated’ University population. The ‘corporate knowledge’ concerning Mr Quinn can be easily lost within the UQ Gatton Club, allowing him the opportunity to continue operating in his own fashion. Attached is a statement by the 2002 UQ Gatton President, Mr Peter Wyman who, with Mr Kevin Anderson the Club Vice-President, are both prepared to make statements concerning this matter.49. 2002 DDRU Under 19 Incident. The second player involved has confirmed the incident of Mr Quinn photographing the two players urinating despite their protestations. He is in the process of forwarding a letter of complaint to the DDRU.50. Update on Misrepresentation and Theft. Since the DDRU complaint to the Queensland Police and the Qld Gaming Commission, most of the articles related to the raffle have been forwarded to the DDRU – some monies are still outstanding. However, the DDRU Under 19 jerseys have not been returned to the DDRU are presumably are still in the possession of Mr Quinn. It can only be assumed that Mr Quinn intends to use these as a bargaining tool with the DDRU or the 2002 DDRU Under 19 players.51. DDRU Management Committee Actions. The DDRU Management Committee, as advised in our July letter, on the 31st July sent a letter to all DDRU Clubs concerning Mr Quinn’s position. A copy is attached.52. Further the DDRU Management Committee has advertised for its 2003 Coaching positions. This was going to occur at the time; however, it is appreciated that this action does underplay Mr Quinn’s declared position of occupying a DDRU Coaching position next year. A copy of the advertisement dated 17th August is attached.53. The DDRU Management Committee has, through its Development Officer, kept in close contact with the UQ Gatton Under 19 player who has been harassed by Mr Quinn, and who was invited to his premises at night to discuss the 2003 DDRU Under 19 Team program. That player’s mother has been also been advised of the situation and the actions of the DDRU.54. Mr Quinn’s Actions. Mr Quinn wrote to the DDRU President in July citing possible legal action against the DDRU or Individual officials55. The DDRU Management Committee urgently seeks the following advice and assistance from the QRU:· Acknowledgement of this letter and the DDRU letter dated 9th July entitled ‘Mr Geoffrey Quinn – Most Confidential’· Confirm the offer in writing of legal assistance if required – this was requested originally requested in July;· Confirm what action has been taken by the QRU on this matter;· Confirm the current status of Mr Geoffrey Francis Michael Quinn’s current rugby coaching accreditation;· Advise whether the financial misrepresentation against the DDRU, UQ Gatton Rugby Club and the State Gaming Commission; the illegal possession of DDRU property resulting in Queensland Police action and the habit of taking images of rugby players in a naked condition in 2001 and 2002 by Mr Quinn does constitute ‘conduct unbecoming’ of an accredited coach and conduct likely to bring the game into disrepute?· Advise the DDRU what actions, and responsibilities, the DDRU and QRU have and need to be taken should Mr Quinn reappear as a Junior Coach in the Brisbane Sub-Districts competition – or any other sporting competition;· Advise the DDRU on its ability to communicate to all DDRU Clubs that Mr Quinn is a ‘persona no grata’ and is not to occupy any formal coaching or administrative positions in any DDRU Club;· What legal obligation does the DDRU and QRU have to the UQ Gatton? – considering that Mr Quinn has submitted false invoices through its Faculties which have been forwarded onto the DDRU, has harassed a student and occupies a house on campus adjacent to the UQ Gatton playing fields.56.

    JUDGMENT1. William and Jenny Barker had been married for thirty-seven years. In western culture they were approaching their ruby anniversary. He is fifty-nine and she fifty-five. Only twelve per cent of our indigenous population live beyond their fiftieth birthday. Both William and Jenny Barker have health problems. They have four children, three girls and a boy. The boy works at a Nulty Station where William Barker is the senior station hand. At about the time of his offending conduct he had heard that the owner was selling out. Barker became worried as to his future employment prospects. 2. In the week prior to the offence there was another matter that troubled Barker. The shearers were at Nulty. After shearing Barker would join them for a yarn and a beer. One of the shearers claimed he had been running around with Jenny Barker, the offender’s wife. That man claimed to have had an affair with her. Further claims were repeated over about five nights. 3. The offender thought a lot about it. On 22 July 2008 the shearers had finished. There was what is called a “cut out” party. Barker usually consumes three large bottles of beer nightly. On this occasion he had drunk “a fair bit after the three bottles that night”. An arrangement had been made for his wife to ring at about 7pm. There was no call. Barker thought the shearer was in Bourke “at the house with her”. 4. William Barker had never been in trouble with the law until 10.50pm that night, Tuesday 22 July 2008, when a taxi dropped him off at his daughter’s home where his wife was staying. He did not come empty-handed. He arrived with an esky and a black bag. In either the esky or black bag was a twelve gauge Winchester shotgun, a boning knife, a short piece of polythene pipe and seven or eight beers. In his pockets were seven live shotgun cartridges and about three and a half metres of quarter inch rope.  5. He brought the pipe and the shotgun to frighten his wife. His evidence is he did not know he had the rope until he arrived but once there he was prepared to use it. He agreed that when he left Nulty he was angry and was going to frighten her. Nulty is 45 kilometres west of Bourke. He must have maintained his anger throughout the trip from there to Bourke. As a consequence of his acts that night he has been charged with recklessly wounding his wife, Jenny Barker. He is also charged with possessing a loaded firearm, the twelve gauge Winchester shotgun, so as to endanger the life of another person. Today William Barker is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. 6. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine appropriate sentence for these offences before the court committed by this offender harming this victim in his community; R v Gladue [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to him called subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the court relating to the offence and to the offender. 7. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. There will be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts and whether special circumstances are to be found, and I think backup charges from the Local Court.WILSON: Five, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus - the protection of the community - will also need to be determined. Facts8. After he arrived, William Barker entered the main bedroom, pulled the blanket off his wife and commenced to strike her with a piece of stiff orange plastic pipe, which was approximately 2 feet long, to the left leg and left arm about five to six times. He was yelling and was angry. He asked her who was the man in bed with her. There was no man present, only his daughter, Janetta. The offender poked his wife to the left side of her chest with the pipe causing bruising. His daughter got out of bed and told him to stop. He told her to stand back and continued to hit his wife with the pipe. Janetta ran from the room upset. His wife told him to leave her alone and said “Don’t hurt me”, she was very frightened. He stopped hitting her and moved to the lounge room and retrieved the shotgun he had brought, returned to her bedroom with the shotgun, aiming at her chest from about a foot away. He said “You’re not going to see your grandkids grow up ‘cause I’m going to shoot you”. He told her he was going to kill her and then himself. 9. She saw his hand on the trigger of the weapon. He had it in his right hand and she saw him put three red shotgun pellets in his left shirt hand pocket. He put the gun down, leaning it against the bedroom wall near the window. He produced the rope, tied one end to the northern bedpost, put a portion of the rope around her throat and I am satisfied secured, in some way or other, the other end of the rope so that his wife was immobile. 10. He took the shotgun up, this time by the barrel, striking her twice to the head with the stock of the gun. She felt immediate pain and blood coming from her. At this point she yelled for her daughters to get the police. He told the daughters to stay out of the room. He was pacing in and out of the bedroom, accusing her of having men, having parties up there. He pointed the shotgun to the bed. 11. Police say that they arrived within minutes of the call of 11.30. The first officers at the scene, Jeffcoat and Nicolson, announced their presence from the living room. He came from the hallway with blood on his face and hands; how that blood got there will be explained shortly. He was asked if there were any firearms to which he replied “No”. He was telling a deliberate untruth at that time. One of the police quickly checked the premises and found Jennifer Barker in the second room at the end of the hall. She must have moved from the first bedroom, the main bedroom. That room was in darkness. She had blood covering her clothing, face and head. An ambulance was called.  12. William Barker was arrested and searched. My understanding is that is the first time in his nearly sixty years he had been arrested. In the side pockets of his jacket police found six shotgun rounds. The shotgun was located by police on the double bed. It had what appeared to be blood staining on its barrel and apparent blood staining was seen on the mattress and doona cover. Blood splatter was noted on the wall behind the bed. Asked if the weapon was loaded he replied “No”. Again it was untrue. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it was deliberately untrue. The officer checked the weapon, breached the barrel, an unused shotgun cartridge was ejected from the barrel. I find it amazing that anybody would have handled a weapon for the first time, particularly a country man, without checking whether the weapon was loaded; but as I say I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he well knew that. His reply when challenged by police was to accused them of planting the round in the weapon. That allegation I find unfounded. He was taken to Bourke station to be interviewed and charged.13. Jenny Barker was treated by ambulance officers, taken to Bourke Hospital, later transferred to Dubbo Base Hospital. She had sustained two- what are described in the agreed facts as deep lacerations on the vertex of her scalp; deep seems a misnomer because there is not much scope for depth in that area. One measured 6 centimetres, the other 7. They required suturing. She developed symptoms consistent with a stroke and it is my inference that it was those symptoms that saw her transferred to the Dubbo Base Hospital. I cannot imagine Bourke Hospital being incapable, given the kind of traffic it has, of dealing with lacerations of 6 and 7 centimetres. Mrs Barker has a history of problems and a lot of risk factors relating to strokes. The doctors are unable to say whether there is an causal link between William Barker’s actions and the stroke. 14. The offender gave some answers in an interview, some of which were helpful and some of which were not. He conceded that he had put the rope around her but he described it as halfway or partly around her neck, just trying to get some information out of her about another boyfriend. I am satisfied he was trying to get information from her about another boyfriend but I am not satisfied that his description of where he put the rope is in any way accurate, other than it was probably around her neck. He said he brought the firearm out from Booker, which was 50 to 60 kilometres out of town. I have rejected that, it seems to me that if he caught the taxi and went 50 to 60 kilometres out of town, assuming it is in the same direction as Nulty, that would have shown a determination to have got the firearm. My view is the firearm was somewhere on Nulty. 15. He said he brought the firearm only with the intention to try and frighten her “because she wouldn’t let me know what was happening about the affair and another fellow”. As to that, he had brought the firearm before he knew that he wife would not cooperate; so that answer as it stands does not make a lot of sense to me. He said he felt sorry about what he had done and I accept that is so. He said he was thinking revengeful thoughts when hitting her with the pipe for what she has done, I have not read the interview but it is unlikely he would have used the word “revengeful”. It is more likely that that word was offered to him and he has picked it up and accepted it. He had nothing to eat during the day and he says he has not used firearms before because he has no licence, indeed that answer was demonstrated to be incorrect in the course of giving evidence in court. 16. I am satisfied William Barker was affected by alcohol. It is likely he consumed more alcohol than he usually consumed because of the impact the malicious gossip about his wife had upon him. I am satisfied he genuinely believed, probably for the first time, that what he had been told about his wife was true and he attached a significance to the absent 7pm phone call that his wife was being unfaithful to him. I am satisfied he was deeply troubled, distressed, dismayed by his beliefs which when coupled with alcohol morphed into an anger and a determination to frighten his wife and find, out if he could, more about what was happening. 17. I am satisfied he resolved to visit her that night and collected the pipe, shotgun and esky into which he put the beer. Whether he placed the knife into the esky then or it was already in the esky I cannot say. But I am satisfied he was aware of its presence. At the very least he would have seen it when he placed the beer in the esky. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the boning knife was there for any purpose related to his anger. Photograph 50 shows the blade concealed by a six-pack of beer, photographs 52 and 53 show what appear to be bird feathers stuck against the upper aspect of the handle of the knife and the lower aspect where the blade is absorbed into the knife [handle], consistent with their being there for some time and inconsistent with recent handling of the knife, at least by the handle. There are no other bird feathers in the esky that I can observe, further it does not appear the knife was presented to the victim at any time during her terrifying ordeal by him. 18. I am satisfied he was more open to worry and ruminating as a consequence of the impending sale and the consequential uncertainty to him of his employment prospects. No doubt he may have believed that his age and given his race, his employment prospects on the open market in the Bourke Shire were uncertain at best. I am satisfied that upon entering the bedroom and finding two occupants in his wife’s bed, his worse fears were realised (wrongly as it turned out) and that discovery contributed to his subsequent behaviour. 19. The evidence is silent as to how Jennifer Barker was released. Photograph 34 shows a length of rope hanging from the northern bedpost. The knot attaching that rope to the end of the bed looks professional to me. The loose end and some ten or so inches appear saturated in blood. The end appears cleanly cut. Photograph 64 shows another length of rope found in the bathroom. It appears as best one can tell to be a couple of metres or more in length. One end is clean cut, the other is frayed. The clean cut end appears soaked in blood; the adjacent 90 centimetres or so appears soaked in blood, see photograph 68 and 69. They make the obvious point that both bloodstained portions of the rope were once joined. The two knots appearing in the rope retrieved from the bathroom floor appeared to be made by a professional and are consistent, in my experience, with knots used by truckers when shortening a rope to secure a load. 20. The evidence suggests to me the knife found in the bathroom sink was used by someone, probably a daughter, to cut the rope in the bedroom while Mrs Barker was securely tied around the neck to the bed. Thereafter, Mrs Barker and the daughter attended the bathroom and were able to unwind the remaining rope from, as best I can tell, around the victim’s neck. It would appear that from there they made their way to the second bedroom. Mrs Barker was in the middle of the bed as she was bleeding, that can be determined from the bloodstains. She was bleeding as she was tied. The blood on the bed is some distance from the northern bedpost. I am of the view that she was tied so that she was unable to move towards the northern post to release herself, otherwise I fail to understand the need to cut the rope where it had been cut or the two trucker’s knots to shorten the rope. Nor does the transport of the piece of rope to the bathroom makes sense unless the full rope had to be cut to release Mrs Barker so she could travel there. 21. Defence counsel, in a leading question, assumed the offender had cut the rope. I find it more likely a daughter cut the rope. It follows from this that I cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the offender ever handled the knife found in the bathroom. Objective Criminality22. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess what is called the objective criminality of these offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with criminality of offences of a similar kind that come from other cases. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences before the court can be evaluated and particularly in this case the objective criminality which has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. Sometimes a judge cannot escape the objective criminality. 23. It goes without saying that the fundamental right of all citizens is the right to the integrity of their body. Put simply, no-one, not even officials of the government such as police or corrective service officers have the right to harm anyone without some lawful authority. While that authority may take various forms, absent lawful authority, any harm coming to another is viewed as a breach of the criminal law. Any authority a male once had to chastise his partner has long, long been abolished. 24. Some Aboriginal men may argue that traditional Aboriginal culture tolerated violence of a man towards his woman. Whatever may be the true position, so far as past Aboriginal culture is concerned on that matter, the continual and widespread reporting of domestic violence by Aboriginal women makes clear that women in Aboriginal communities will longer tolerate a domestic relationship that permits violence towards them. 25. In this country, whatever past or foreign culture may have permitted, violence within a domestic situation is regarded as a crime subject to the same maximum sentences that that very same crime would carry if committed against other citizens outside the domestic situation. There is no law saying that if one wounds a stranger in a pub with say a broken beer bottle the maximum penalty is seven years but if the same person wounds hisr partner in the backyard in the same way the maximum penalty should only be a rap over the knuckles. 26. One of the prime purposes of sentencing is the protection of the community. One of the largest groups in the community who are in peril are female partners from abusing male partners. A considerable percentage of that group are indigenous women. The law seeks to protect the whole community, it does not distinguish on the basis of gender, colour or race. All women are entitled to protection. The law is required to do all it can to progress that protection. 27. Adams J in speaking about the criminality of domestic violence identified two characteristics. As to the first, his Honour said “The offender usually believes that, in a real sense, what he does is justified, even that he is the true victim.” Then when speaking of both elements he said this:  
     
      
      “These elements also usually mean that the victim never feels truly safe. Unlike a casual robbery, where the victim is often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, the victim of domestic violence is personally targeted. To my mind these considerations emphasise not only the need for general and personal deterrence but also for denunciations in cases of this kind.”  
      R v Dunn 
       [2004] NSWCCA 41 at [47]. 
       
      
    Of course violence at the level that we are talking about here against a partner is a breach of trust and responsibility that the male instinctively and socially owes to the female partner in his relationship. 28. In his seminal judgment in Stanley Edward Fernando, Wood J at principle (F) observed:  
     
      
      “That in sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent the court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt yet must nevertheless assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender.”  
      Stanley Edward Fernand 
       (!992) 76 A Crim R. 58 
       
      
    I seek to do that in this case. 29. The Crown in his submissions referred me to a judgment of Wood J, when he was by this time the Chief Judge at Common Law, dealing with domestic violence, R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436. Of relevance to this case are his Honour’s observations: 
     
      
      “Regrettably this form of conduct involves aggression by men who are physically stronger than their victims and are often in a position economically or otherwise to enforce their silence and their acceptance of such conduct. In truth such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the court has a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished and that sentences are handed out that have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.” 
       
      
    Barker’s conduct when analysed is best described by words used in that judgment “brutal, cowardly and inexcusable”. A belief that one’s partner has been unfaithful, no matter how painfully held, or how reasonably held, cannot excuse any physical assault, let alone having the violence of this assault. 30. The two offences I am dealing with must be assessed against the level and means of violence administered. The wounding was caused by two strikes with the butt of a shotgun, the larger wound 7 centimetres; both bled profusely. There was considerable loss of blood, although one must recognise that uncontained fluid spreads quickly over a wide area. Police noted her clothing and head were covered in blood. The mattress also contains substantial patches of blood. 31. At the time the two blows her head were struck; Jennifer Barker’s capacity to move her head was very restricted, she had been tied to restrict her movements. Her being so tied must have been contributed to the wound in the sense she could do little or nothing to avoid the blow. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the stock of the shotgun was aimed at her head, the level of recklessness involved was high. Given the implement, the area of body struck and the lack of any depth of flesh to disperse or cushion the force of the blow a wound or two in this case were inevitable. 32. The defence submitted two weapons were used, the polythene pipe and the shotgun. That overlooks the length of the rope with which I have dealt. The weapons were all blunt. Use of a shotgun cannot be used, in my view, as an aggravating matter of the wounding because its possession and conduct while possessed are covered by a separate charge. The use of the rope has been described, clearly its use aggravates the wounding charge. Tied as she was, given the health problems she has, Mrs Barker was the epitome of a vulnerable victim. To make matters worse she was surprised in her bed and effectively in her home. 33. The endangerment of life arising from Barker’s possession of the shotgun arises by his using it to threaten her, it is to be remembered she had a history of strokes and numerous risks factors with the strokes. The presentation of a shotgun a foot or so from her must have been simply terrifying. 34. There is no evidence suggesting Mrs Barker lost consciousness, she was able to have photographs of herself and injuries taken at the house by investigating police. That appears to have been done while waiting for an ambulance. Whatever other factors may precipitate a stroke, emotional trauma, extreme stress, fear and anxiety would rank high among them. The pointing of the loaded shotgun at her accompanied by the words “You’re not going to see your grandkids grow up ‘cause I’m going to shoot you”, his announcement that he was going to kill himself, her husband of thirty-seven years, his striking her head, particularly the second strike, were all matters that must have caused extreme levels of fear and stress. 35. The other means by which life was endangered by the offender’s possession of the shotgun was his use of it as a club to strike her head. 36. It is difficult to know the exact length of time the assault took. He appears to have arrived at 10.50pm, the police appeared to have arrived at 11.30pm. Assuming he entered the bedroom immediately, and I stress that is but an assumption, by the time the police arrived it would seem Jennifer Barker had been released and may have returned to the second bedroom and to her bed. It is hard to tell from the photographs but the only blood on the bathroom floor appears to be transfers from the bloodied rope. That would suggest by the time she had gone to the bathroom she had stopped bleeding. There is material suggesting some interrogation of her about another boyfriend. All that can be said is the period during which Mrs Barker was under attack was not momentary, it was a sustained period although its full duration is unclear. 37. The facts do suggest police were called shortly before 11.30. No doubt they were called in response to Mrs Barker’s cry of alarm when being struck by the shotgun. But it seems it took some minutes to arrive and I am not entirely satisfied it was less than five, say. 38. Barker came equipped to frighten his wife, the wounding offence was not planned but no doubt the result of rising anger at the scene. The shotgun was not taken into the room initially but the presentation of it was accompanied by threats. The presentation and the threats were more deliberate. I am satisfied he took the weapon from Nulty with a view to frighten her. 39. The objective criminality of the firearm offence is to be assessed in this way. The firearm being shorten aggravates his criminality of it. It is loaded, that is an element of the offence and does not aggravate the offence. The offender did not believe it was loaded. His evidence on this was unchallenged. The endangerment of life as I have said came from aiming the weapon coupled with the threat and his hand close to or on the trigger to scare his wife. The second endangerment was its use to strike her forehead. 40. I have elsewhere said [that] he believed his wife had been unfaithful was no excuse for his behaviour, but his belief was genuinely held and on the evidence before me it was not unreasonable that he came to such a belief. That belief no doubt had a strong emotional impact upon him. As I say, there is everything to suggest this was the first time he had ever heard anything adverse about his wife’s faithfulness. He may have well have been more vulnerable to responding emotionally because of the uncertainty for him in another very important sector in his life, employment. 41. The wickedness of his act becomes less heinous when it is understood he was motivated by hurt, rejection and frustration anchored in a disillusionment, whether factually justified or not, relating to his partner’s fidelity towards him. His extra consumption of alcohol was also related to what he believed was his matrimonial problem. He did not undertake his drinking with a view to undertaking action against his wife. He undertook his drinking initially as part of the “cut out” party and as he did so consumed more than normal because of his emotional distress. In that sense then his alcohol consumption is a mitigating factor of his objective criminality. His state of disinhibition made the transition from being there to frighten his partner, to being there administering disinhibited violence easier than it otherwise would have been had he been sober. Likewise alcohol contributed to judgment impairment, both these matters sound in mitigation. 42. I note a standard non-parole period of three years applies to a reckless wounding charge that falls within the mid range of seriousness for such an offence. While there are matters that will bring this offence outside of the application of a standard non-parole period, my understanding is that I should at this time assess upon the objective facts alone where this offence falls judged objectively. That requires I take into account the actus reus (or acts) of the offender when causing the wounding, the consequences of conduct and factors impinging upon the mens rea, that is, his recklessness.43. I have reviewed the acts of the offender when causing the wounding, which I will quickly dot point: 
     
      
      Use of butt of loaded shotgun two times to the head. 
      Tying Ms Barker so that she was unable to avoid the blows. 
      Simultaneous use of the gun butt and rope. 
      Failure to release her immediately when bleeding but allowing daughter to subsequently release her.  
      
    The consequences appear to be these: two significant lacerations, extreme fear and distress, substantial blood loss. The wounds were not deep, they appear to have healed without difficulty. While not trivialising the wounds, they are not deep or horrific, they did not permanently damage the victim, no vital veins or arteries or other organs were severed.44. Factors impinging upon mens rea:  
     
      
      Recklessness. 
      Initial intent one of frightening. 
      In the circumstances the risk of injury is best described as inevitable, that is, a high degree of recklessness. 
      A reasonably held belief that his wife had very recently been unfaithful. 
      Alcohol contributes to lack of judgment and mood change to violent anger.  
      
    45. I am satisfied on its objective factors, this offence is one having a seriousness falling below the lower rungs of the midrange of seriousness. Contrary to the Crown’s submission, there was no plan to wound. The Crown relied on planning to aggravate the seriousness. There was a plan to frighten.46. What takes it into the lower area of the midrange is the consequence of the accused’s acts. The wounds themselves by comparison with others are more modest than frequently experienced in this court. In assessing the criminality of this offence, it is important to distil from it the criminality associated with the firearm offence and conduct that occurs through the offender’s possession of that weapon.47. The infliction of the wound was accomplished by wielding the shotgun. The use of the weapon is common to both offences. In the wounding offence the result of the use of the weapon are the two wounds. In the firearm offence the result of its possession was the endangerment of life. The endangerment of life is not an aggravating feature of the wounding.Subjective Matters48. I now turn to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender for some reason why a more or less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Family Background and Relationships49. As earlier stated, William Barker is fifty-nine years old. Although separated currently, he hopes to return to his wife of thirty-seven years. I have referred to his four children. From what he said to his wife during his attack upon her I have learnt there are grandchildren. Barker’s extended family live in and around the Bourke area. His son Willy Barker works on Nulty Station. Barker watches out for him and directs him at work. 50. Barker grew up at a place called Billygoat Bend where his father and uncle bought six acres on the river. There they built a corrugated iron shed. The offender had five brothers, one died young, another drowned in his early twenties. Barker’s father died when he was twelve. He still maintains contact with his brothers. He also has six siblings born to his mother from a second partner. They all identify as Barkers as well.Education, employment and skills51. The offender left school aged fourteen. While he is able to read, it is not a skill he has great fluency in. He commenced his working life on stations. He learnt shearing in the shearing sheds. He married at twenty-two, built a corrugated tin shed, looked after his young brother-in-law. He then moved to Alice Edward Village, more commonly known as The Reserve, in Bourke. After eighteen months he purchased his own house. He worked at CDEP, he has been employed for some forty-five years.52. Nulty Station is a fifty thousand hectare sheep and cattle property, forty kilometres south west of Bourke. He has been employed there doing seasonal shearing, crutching and lambing for the past ten to twelve years, and is there semi-permanent, live-on-property basis for the past three years. 53. Recently the property passed to new owners, Phillip Bell and his wife. On the recommendation of the previous owner Mr Bell continued Barker as one of the senior station hands. Barker drives machines, fixes cracking pipes and manages the station in the absence of its owner.54. Peter Pratten, the prior owner, wrote “Barker had complete access and control of the property on his own” in their absence also. The new owner wrote that there are times when he and his wife “are away for days/weeks and happy to leave” Barker there in their absence. Pratten recommended Barker to his successor, saying he “wouldn’t get a more honest and reliable person”. Phillip Bell has found him “honest, reliable, with an eye for detail, self-motivated with initiative to repair items without being asked”.55. From the new owner’s point of view, Barker knows the geography of the property, where the pipes run, mustering practices, where wells are located, and in a sense is the custodian of the institutional history necessary for the owner to tap as he needs.General health56. Barker suffers high blood pressure and has done so for the past twelve years. That is controlled by his morning medication, a point the custodial authorities will need to note. He suffers asthma attacks, which are controlled by his use of a puffer each morning. He appears older than his fifty-nine years. Apart from the nominated conditions he otherwise appears in good health.Drugs and alcohol57. His usual practice was to consume three 750ml bottles of beer daily. He would exceed that quote on occasions when drinking with cousins or family members. He accepts that alcohol played a part in his offending conduct.58. As a condition of his bail, he has not consumed alcohol. He says he did not find it difficult to remain alcohol free. He does not smoke, he gave it up some time ago when he noticed he had a smoker’s cough. He denies that he uses any illicit substances, quite a remarkable thing in the Aboriginal communities in Bourke.Character and criminal history59. William Barker is sixty in December this year. Prior to these offences he was a hard working family man with no convictions. In his chosen field of rural industries he has achieved much, to the point where he was left managing a large station when its owners were absent. He has commenced from humble beginnings. The rural craft and knowledge he has obtained from experience. 60. His sworn evidence is that he has seen others violent towards their wives, but until this fateful night he did not do anything of that sort. His attitude to the offence, to the pre-sentence report also, the offender appeared to believe his actions had been justified because he believed his wife had been unfaithful to him.61. Mr Barker gave evidence, I had the opportunity of observing him. While most of the questions he was asked were leading questions, thus sheltering him from volunteering much, it was clear to me that he regretted his behaviour and he loved his wife. He is not a sophisticated man. It may be he was simply trying to explain his actions to the author of the report rather than excuse them. There is no doubt he genuinely believed his wife had been unfaithful. That may explain his anger and subsequent violent behaviour. It may have been that he was trying to do no more than that in talking to Probation and Parole. He did not strike me as seeking to minimise his culpability or qualify his regret. His immediate action before leaving the house was to grab his wife, kiss her, and told her he was sorry. It is in that way that his hands and face received the blood transfer noted. I am satisfied he was genuinely contrite.Plea of guilty62. The Crown acknowledges the plea was entered early. It also acknowledges a twenty-five per cent discount would be available.Rehabilitation prospects63. I am satisfied from his past history, his contrition and his non-drinking that he is unlikely to re-offend.Assessment of midrange of seriousness for the malicious wounding charge64. I have indicated when taking account of the objective seriousness that the offence fell below the midrange of seriousness. Mr Barker’s subjective features work strongly in mitigation for him. They take the offence, again, below the midrange to a point that I would estimate as about halfway between a trivial offence and a midrange offence. 65. I note that the standard non-parole period is a reminder that Parliament was looking to judges to deal more firmly with these offences. The standard non-parole period, although it does not apply, still has work to do when sentencing for this offence, that is, for the malicious wounding offence.Deterrence66. Domestic violence offences call for deterrence, both general and personal. General deterrence is for those people like-minded to the offender who would be inclined to physically abuse their wives. Personal deterrence relates solely to the offender to persuade him not to re-offend by using violence towards his partner.67. While dealing with deterrence I note principle (D) in Fernando:  
     
      
       
      “Notwithstanding the absence of any real body of evidence demonstrating that the imposition of significant terms of imprisonment provide any effective deterrence in either discouraging the abuse of alcohol by members of the Aboriginal society or their resort to violence when heavily affected by it, the courts must be very careful in pursuit of their sentencing policies to not thereby deprive Aboriginals of the protection which it assumed punishment provides. In short a belief cannot be allowed to go about that serious violence by drunken persons within their society are treated by the law as occurrences of little moment.” 
       
      
     I also note principle (E): 
     
      
      “While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by person standing to sentence reflects socioeconomic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor.  
       
      
    Mr Barker certainly grew up in circumstances that were demonstrated evidence of dispossession and I have no doubt in an era of alcohol abuse and violence. But in his sixty years he had moved beyond that, and in my view principle (E) has very little application to him.Setting the sentence68. There a number of competing tensions I must resolve as I finalise the sentencing disposition. The principles themselves pull in different ways. In Fernando principle (H) is in these terms: That in every sentencing exercise, while it is important to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and not to lose sight of the objective seriousness of the offence in the midst of what might otherwise be attractive objective circumstances full weight must be given to the competing public interest and rehabilitation of the offender and avoidance of recidivism on his part.69. Supporting the same principle in R v Lattouf NSWCCA 12/12/96, Mahoney ACJ said: 
     
      
      “There is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles which would deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it ... But there are other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard; there are other objectives which the sentencing process must seek to achieve. Paramount amongst these is the achievement of justice in the individual case. To see the sentencing process as involving no more than stern punishment for each offender is not merely simplistic; it damages the public interest. A sentencing process which is seen by the public merely as draconian and not just will lose the support of those whom it is designed to protect. If a sentencing process does not achieve justice, it should be put aside. As I have elsewhere said ‘If justice is not individual, it is nothing’.” 
      
      
    Powerful as the quote is, one of the key lines of it is that “justice must be achieved in the individual case”. That does not always mean a soft landing. It does not mean that in this case.70. The competing tension is the drive to consistency in sentencing. Most recently put by the majority of the High Court in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [24]; (2005) 215 ALR 213 at [24]: 
     
      
      “Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as a cause with the statutory regime that applies.” 
       
       
      
    71. I have read the cases about domestic violence and what they urge, and I have made note of the statutory non-parole period and its impact on the sentencing. I have reviewed a number of cases referred to me by Mr Wilson where in the circumstances of each of those cases a lenient result was called for by the defence and achieved; see R v Hall unreported CCA 11/6/99, R v Lattouf NSWCCA 12/12/96, R v Gordon S.C. unreported 29/4/1994 per Hunt CJ at CL, R v Peter James Muir S.C unreported David Hunt J 3/4/1991. That last case was one of malicious wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm in which the prisoner had discharged a rifle at the victim wounding him in the chest, but not seriously. His Honour was dealing with an offender about half the age of Barker. In a passage that should be more recognised than it is, his Honour said: 
     
      
      “The prisoner had no relevant prior convictions. He is in effect at the turning point of his life and in my view the community, if fairly apprised of all the facts, would accept that the prisoner should be given the chance to work his way through to a better future, rather than that he should be flung onto the human scrapheap of society by an uncaring criminal justice system simply as a warning and an example to others.  
       
       
      I acknowledge finally there is an element of chance in the course I propose to take. Justice would have been better served by computers if judges were not prepared to give a chance to some even if the result may turn out to be unsuccessful.”  
       
      
    His Honour continued, “I do not believe that the result in this case will be unsuccessful.”72. In that case his Honour imposed a three-year s 558 recognisance. Regrettably I cannot avoid full time imprisonment but I have set the minimum period that in my view the law requires. The sentence I have set is fashioned upon the sentence Wood J imposed in Stanley Fernando’s case. In today’s language that requires a finding of special circumstances. I will return to that shortly.73. Notwithstanding defence counsel’s submissions that even though a sentence of imprisonment may be called for, I would not be falling into appealable error if I suspended it. I must reject this submission. The objective seriousness of the offence must take account of the deliberate bringing of the firearm. It must take account of the rope being used so that the victim was immobilised. It must take account that more than one blow was struck and each resulted in wounding. It must take account that Mrs Barker was not released immediately the wounds were occasioned. 74. Notwithstanding the powerful subjective case - no prior convictions, no prior domestic violent conduct, long and impressive employment history, immediate attempt at reconciliation with the wife, strong rehabilitation prospects and genuine contrition - a short, sharp period of full time custody is called for. 75. I have reviewed the JIRS statistics. I am satisfied the sentence that I am setting sits within the existing sentencing range and accommodates the extraordinary circumstances of this case. 76. My reasons for finding special circumstances include not only the facts - this is the offender’s first time in custody serving sentence - but also his age, his strong rehabilitation prospects, and that he is best left in the community to accomplish his rehabilitation. The only reason I send him to prison is the command of punishment. My own view of prison is that in every other way it is really counter indicated.77. But for the plea of guilty on each of the charges I would have set an overall sentence of two years six months. I discount that by twenty-five per cent, and on my calculations that becomes a sentence of one year ten months and fifteen days. 78. Mr Barker in respect of the offence that you recklessly wounded Jenny Barker at Bourke on 22 July 2008, you are convicted. I set a non-parole period of six months. I take into account the time you have already served, which is thirty-seven days bail refused. If my calculations are correct your sentence will commence on 17 May 2009, that should be thirty-seven days ago, and expire on 16 November 2009. Your balance of term will expire, if my calculations are correct, on 31 March 2011. I order your release on 16 November 2009.79. Likewise I convict you of possessing a loaded firearm, namely a Winchester brand twelve gauge shotgun so as to endanger the life of another person, namely Jennifer Barker, at Bourke on 22 July 2008 and I set precisely the same sentence with precisely the same dates, both sentences to run concurrently.80. There a number of 166 matters. All of these sentences should be regarded as having been reduced by twenty-five per cent. The first is that you are convicted of possessing ammunition without a licence or permit on 22 July 2008. Pursuant to S.166 I convict you of that offence and sentence you to three months imprisonment. In respect of the unregistered firearm you are convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment. The ammunition without licence offence, you are convicted and sentenced to three months imprisonment. The unregistered firearm, which is the .22 rifle at home, or at Nulty, you are convicted and sentenced to four months fifteen days imprisonment. And the not keep firearm safely, you are convicted and sentenced to four months imprisonment. All of those sentences are likewise backdated to 17 May 2009 and all are fixed terms.Is there any other matter?MAY: Your Honour just in relation to the possess ammunition without a licence or permit, I understood your Honour to impose a sentence of three months imprisonment. The maximum penalty is actually a fine of $5,500.HIS HONOUR: I abandon the non-jurisdictional order. I convict him pursuant to 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

   JUDGMENT1. This is a refreshing case for a judge to deal with because it involves an offender who is making genuine efforts to overcome significant personal problems which have led him into trouble with the law over many years.2. The case that I am hearing is an appeal. It is an appeal from a sentence imposed by a Magistrate. The Magistrate imposed a gaol term and Mr Wiseman, who is the appellant, asks me to set aside the gaol term and to impose a sentence which does not involve full-time custody. 3. Mr Wiseman was charged with an offence called break and enter with intent. That is a crime under s 113(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Mr Wiseman committed the crime on 21 January, 2007 at Dubbo. 4. Briefly this is what happened. Mr Kevin James lived in a house in Crick Street, Dubbo. He was over the road talking to a neighbour when the neighbour said that they saw someone go into his house. Mr James went across the road and saw a woman standing in front of the house. She ran away when she saw Mr James. Mr James went onto the veranda of his house and saw that a door was open leading from the veranda into the house. At that time he saw a man walking from inside through the door onto the veranda. The man tried to push past Mr James saying that he was looking for his girlfriend. Mr James hit the man on the back of his head causing the man to lose balance. He then left Mr James house.5. The person I have described as the man who was intruding into the house was Mr Wiseman. He took nothing from the house. At the time that he broke in, Mr James’s wife and nine year old son were inside. In fact Mrs James was helping her nine year old son get dressed when she heard the commotion on the veranda and she got there to see Mr Wiseman getting up from the floor. She described him as looking drunk.6. Mr Wiseman was later arrested and charged with this offence. He pleaded not guilty in the Local Court at Dubbo but was convicted after a hearing on 5 September 2008 before Magistrate Hamilton. On 22 October, 2008 the Magistrate sentenced Mr Wiseman to two years imprisonment to be served full-time and specified a non parole period of eighteen months. Mr Wiseman has accepted the finding of guilt and the conviction and appeals to me from the sentence which was imposed. 7. It is important to record some information about Mr Wiseman’s own background. There is a helpful pre-sentence report from a Probation and Parole officer dated 17 October, 2008. It notes that Mr Wiseman has been known to the Probation and Parole Service for about twenty years. 8. He had a disruptive childhood with an alcoholic father and outbursts of violence. He started using drugs before he became a teenager. From exhibit C, which is a report from a rehabilitation centre, it is apparent that he started using alcohol when he was aged fourteen; marijuana when he was aged ten; amphetamines when he was aged sixteen and heroin when he was aged twenty-one.9. His younger brother passed away aged twenty-two from a drug overdose and Mr Wiseman felt that loss intensely. The probation officer noted that Mr Wiseman had grown tired of the drug scene and was wanting to rehabilitate himself from his drug addiction. It noted that he had entered into the methadone treatment program. 10. He has never had full time employment and was at the time of the report in receipt of a Commonwealth benefit but had completed the Pathways to Employment education and training program. The report noted that he was addicted to heroin and cannabis and under their influence at the time that he committed this offence. Drug abuse was the primary motivation for the crimes which he had committed. His partner was also addicted to drugs.11. Evidently he had been involved in the methadone program since August, 2007 in an effort to break his addiction. Between August, 2007 and when the report was prepared, the probation officer noted that a report from the clinic said that despite some early behavioural issues his contractual compliance was much improved and random urine results showed decreasing substance abuse although he was not accessing case management. It recommended - that is the probation report - a medium level of intervention by that service with a focus on continuing participation in the methadone program and grief counselling. It noted that he was unsuitable for a community service order and ineligible for a periodic detention order. 12. I have made reference to his familiarity with the Probation and Parole Service. Mr Wiseman has a reasonably lengthy criminal record. He is now aged thirty-eight and has been committing offences since before he was an adult. The offences included breaking and entering and trespassing. He has received gaol terms before, including for a previous break and enter and steal, but that was in 1990. In 2004 he was sentenced to six months imprisonment for entering a dwelling with intent, which is the same or a similar offence as the one which I am dealing with now. He has had the benefit over the years of a number of bonds under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and there is no evidence of any breaches of those bonds. 13. The document I referred to briefly before is a report from a rehabilitation centre. It was a report from the Benelong’s Haven Family Rehabilitation Centre. There are in fact three reports from that centre dated 30 January 2009, 29 April 2009 and 18 June 2009. Each of them shows that the drug tests administered to Mr Wiseman were all negative apart from methadone which he is being treated with. He entered Benelong’s Haven on about 27 November 2008. After he was sentenced by the Magistrate he commenced serving his full time gaol sentence. He was successful in obtaining bail from the District Court on 24 November 2008 so he served just over a month in full time imprisonment. Since entering Benelong’s Haven on about 27 November 2008 he has stayed there until a few days ago. That is a residential rehabilitation centre where it is, I infer, a condition of residence that he remain at the centre except when given permission to leave.14. That is important to note because he has spent over six months in that centre in circumstances which, although not the same as full time custody, does involve a period of custody in a sense and is important to take into account.15. Returning to the reports from Benelong’s Haven, the most recent notes that “his adherence to rules is good and he accepts responsibility. His general demeanour is good, that he was willing to help in any way possible. At AA meetings he was very well spoken and expressive. His interaction with others was friendly and helpful and his attitude was positive.” It noted that “although he had been at the Haven on previous occasions, he had become more committed to his rehabilitation. He understood” - the report noted – “that it was a do or die effort given his age.” It noted that “his discussions exhibited extreme honesty and he was regarded as trustworthy when sober. He assumed responsibility easily and acknowledged that his process of recovery must come from his efforts which he puts into the residential program.” All in all, the latest report noted that he “spent some 126 days in the rehabilitation centre.”16. Mr Wiseman’s appeal came on before me on 5 February 2009 at Dubbo. After hearing submissions I determined to adjourn the appeal under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in order to assess his capacity and prospects for rehabilitation and also to demonstrate that rehabilitation had taken place.17. Ms Skinner, who appears for him today, called him to give evidence. I was very impressed by him as a witness and of his account of his efforts at rehabilitation. He has undertaken the benefits of the rehabilitation centre admirably. He has been honest in acknowledging his drug addiction and has participated fully in the residential program, including being entrusted with administering drugs appropriately to other clients of the centre. That is consistent with the reports from the centre. His plans are to resume living with his partner who has also undergone rehabilitation successfully. They have a two bedroom housing department flat at Dubbo. He is going to mix with more positive people and look for work around Dubbo and perhaps undertake a TAFE course. He is willing to accept assistance from appropriate agencies for his rehabilitation and to look for AA meetings at Dubbo.18. In my opinion his evidence and the evidence from Benelong’s Haven show that he has demonstrated that rehabilitation has taken place to a significant extent. Mr Wiseman wisely acknowledges that he will always remain an addict and will continue to require support in order to live a relatively normal life in the community despite his addiction.19. Ms Skinner asks for a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act describing the offence as at the lower end of the scale. I am more inclined to accept Ms Graham’s submission that the offence is mid-range. It is an offence of breaking and entering with intent without the component of an indictable offence having been committed. It did involve a confrontation with one of the occupants of the home and the knowledge on behalf of all occupants that somebody was on their property. Ms Graham acknowledges that the choice is between a s 9 bond or a s 12 suspended sentence and has outlined the advantages of each course. I agree with Ms Skinner that a bond under s 9 is the appropriate course in this case for the reasons given by her and by Ms Graham. 20. I propose to allow the appeal and to impose a bond under s 9 for a period of three years.21. I was in two minds as to whether I should impose a bond under s 9 or s 12. A suspended sentence under s 12 would more appropriately reflect the objective seriousness of this offence. However this is a case where the efforts at rehabilitation by the offender have been significant. A bond under s 12 is far less flexible if there is a breach. A relatively minor breach could result in Mr Wiseman going back into full time custody unless the breach was truly trivial. That could have a very serious impact on his efforts at rehabilitation. I therefore propose to impose the lengthy bond under s 9 rather than the suspended sentence.22. The formal orders which I make under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 are that I set aside the sentence of the learned Magistrate. Under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, I make an order directing Mr Wiseman to enter into a good behaviour bond for three years.  The conditions of the bond are these:1. That he be of good behaviour.2. That he notify the Registrar of the District Court at Dubbo of any change in his residential address.3. That he come before the Court if called upon to do so.4. That he subject himself to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and accept their reasonable recommendations and directions so far as any grief counselling is concerned, drug and alcohol counselling, employment advice, or urinalysis in so far as those services are available.HIS HONOUR: I think that deals with it Ms Skinner, Ms Graham.GRAHAM: Might I ask that the appellant report to the Dubbo Probation and Parole Service within seven days.HIS HONOUR: Is seven days enough time?GRAHAM: Yes he will be there tomorrow.22. Finally this condition: that he reports to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Dubbo within seven days of today. HIS HONOUR: Anything else? HIS HONOUR: Mr Wiseman as I said you have won your appeal, you’ve got a bond for three years. You know what a bond is, you’ve had them before. You have got to behave yourself, you’ve got to stay out of trouble. If you get into trouble you are going to come back before me and obviously I have to work out what I’m going to do with you and you could come out worse. But I have also made the conditions that I’ve listed. You have got to tell the Court if you change your address, you have got to behave yourself and most importantly report to the Probation and Parole Office and let them help you. You’ve had plenty of contact with them before, you know the benefits of getting help from agencies like that because you really have benefited from Benelong’s over the last six months. Probation and Parole are good at what they do.You’ve heard the specific items of grief counselling, drug and alcohol, employment and urinalysis, they are all things which were mentioned in your evidence and you’ve heard both lawyers refer to them. They’re designed to assist you if they’re available. Do you understand all that?APPELLANT: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay, good luck.APPELLANT: Thank you.SKINNER: I will take him over to the Downing Centre to enter the bond. I’m not sure what time the papers will be available.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 YOUNG JA: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Adam Samuel Jones Jnr, seeks leave to appeal under s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to sentences imposed on 23 November 2007 by Buddin J for the crimes of manslaughter, malicious wounding and common assault. 
     
      
    3 The offences were committed in the early hours of 9 October 2005 in the course of a violent confrontation between members of the Applicant’s family and the family of the deceased, William Smith. The Applicant’s offences were committed against three members of the Smith family. The partly cumulative sentences imposed upon the Applicant were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) malicious wounding of Noah Henry Smith - sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment to commence on 26 October 2005; 
       
       
      (b) common assault upon Mary Rose Smith - sentenced to four months’ imprisonment to commence on 26 July 2006; 
       
       
      (c) manslaughter of William Smith - sentenced to a non-parole period of five years and three months, to commence on 26 July 2006, with a balance of term of three years. 
       
      
    4 Accordingly, the total effective sentence imposed upon the Applicant for the three offences was one of nine years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years, with both periods to date from 26 October 2005. The earliest date on which the Applicant could be released on parole was 25 October 2011. 
     
      
    5 The sole ground of appeal is that the sentences imposed by Buddin J were manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    6 In remarks on sentence delivered on 23 November 2007, Buddin J passed sentence upon six members of the Jones family for a range of offences arising out of the violent confrontation between the Jones and Smith families on 9 October 2005: R v Jones and Ors [2007] NSWSC 1333. His Honour described the background to the offences, and the offences themselves, in a manner which is not challenged in this Court. Given the submissions made in this Court, it is appropriate to set out paragraphs [10]-[31] of Buddin J’s remarks (in which the Applicant is referred to as Adam Jones): 
     
      
       
        
        “10 The offenders and their family, as well as the deceased and his family, are Romany gypsies. Although both families were originally from the United Kingdom, they have lived in this country for many years. They reside in caravan parks and lead itinerant lifestyles which see them move around fairly frequently. Although members of the two families were acquainted with each other, they did not know each other particularly well. However the families became closer when the offender Adam Jones married Ellen Smith. Arrangements for the wedding, which took place in November 2004, gave rise to tension between the families. Those tensions led the young couple, who were then aged 18, to elope. Nonetheless it would appear that those tensions had abated by the time the events which give rise to these proceedings occurred. 
         
         
        11 The fatal incident took place at Tuggerah Village caravan park at Kangy Angy on the Central Coast at which members of the Jones family and the Smith family were then residing. Adam Samuel Jones and his wife Lydia Jones were occupying site 55. Adam Jones and Ellen Smith occupied site 41 which was a short distance away. The deceased and Noah Henry Smith, also known as Noah Smith Snr, are Ellen Smith’s uncles. They also resided at the caravan park, albeit on sites at the other end of the park, close to the amenities block. A number of other members of the Smith family also resided at the caravan park. 
         
         
        12 During the evening of 8 October 2005 Adam Samuel Jones, Adam Jones and Lydia Jones were socialising at the caravan park with members of the Smith family. At around about 11 pm an argument developed. On the face of it, the argument was trivial. It seems to have been precipitated by remarks made by Adam Samuel Jones to Ellen Smith’s mother, Mary Isabella Smith. I am satisfied that it amounted to no more than friendly banter. Mary Smith certainly did not take offence at the remarks. 
         
         
        13 The deceased’s reaction however was quite different. He, unlike Mary Smith, did not laugh it off. He became upset with Adam Samuel Jones and told him that he did not appreciate the fact that he was taking ‘the piss out of  
        [Mary Smith] 
        ’. It is not without significance that the deceased had been drinking heavily that day. Indeed he had spent much of the day at a nearby club with his brothers, John and Noah. The evidence indicated that the deceased was an experienced drinker and that he could, and did, consume significant quantities of alcohol on a very regular basis. A toxicology report, conducted at post-mortem, reveals that the deceased had a blood alcohol reading of 0.227. The evidence leads me to the conclusion that the deceased, fuelled by alcohol, was behaving in an aggressive manner during the course of this initial incident. 
         
         
        14 Nonetheless it was the actions of Adam Jones which escalated the tension. He produced a knife which he pointed at the deceased. He said to his father words to the effect of, ‘We can stab him Dad’. The argument then became quite heated. The deceased tried on several occasions to physically attack Adam Jones. He also taunted him by saying that he was not enough of a man to be worth fighting. When the deceased was restrained from attacking Adam Jones, he then grabbed hold of Adam Samuel Jones’ collar and said to him, words to the effect of, ‘Come on, I’ll fight you. You think you’re the big man, let’s see what you can do.’ Louisa Smith, the deceased’s mother, gave evidence that from her observation Adam Samuel Jones was clearly reluctant to engage in a fight. 
         
         
        15 Adam Jones was asked several times to put the knife away and eventually did so. The evidence suggests that the matter was resolved, at least temporarily, when the deceased and Adam Samuel Jones agreed that they would ‘sort things out in the morning’.  
         
         
        16 Various members of the Smith family gave evidence that they anticipated that this meant that the two protagonists would meet, in accordance with Romany gypsy tradition, for the purpose of having a fist fight the following morning. Be that as it may, I am quite satisfied however that various members of both families had other intentions. In any event, the parties dispersed and returned to their respective caravans. The evidence as to what happened at the caravan park from that point until the onset of the fatal incident is, at best, sketchy.  
         
         
        17 Evidence elicited from mobile phone records reveal that a call was made at about 11.30 pm from the phone owned by Adam Samuel Jones to the phone owned by his parents Samuel Jones and Elizabeth Jones who were then residing at the Parklea caravan park. The only direct evidence as to what was said emerges from Michael Bennett, a friend of Samuel Jones, who said that Samuel Jones told him that he had been informed that there were ‘dramas’ up at the caravan park. Whatever was said prompted the couple to travel immediately to Kangy Angy. Samuel Mark Jones was also residing at Parklea at the time and it can readily be inferred that contact was also made with him, probably through his wife. At 11.38 pm the phone owned by Samuel Jones and his wife was used to contact the phone owned by Lydia Jones. At 11.48 pm, the swipe card owned by Samuel Jones and Elizabeth Jones, was used to activate the boom gate at the Parklea caravan park. It is apparent from the phone records that they then left the Parklea area and made their way up the F3 freeway towards the Tuggerah Village Caravan park, where they arrived at approximately 12.30 am. 
         
         
        18 Although he travelled separately from his parents, Samuel Mark Jones also made his way up to Tuggerah arriving there at about the same time as his parents. The mobile phone records reveal that a number of other persons were contacted by Samuel Mark Jones as he travelled to the caravan park. The overwhelming inference from all the evidence, which was led in the case against him, is that he was responsible for recruiting those persons to attend the park for what was anticipated to be some kind of a fight. That inference is made even more irresistible when regard is had to the contents of two of those calls which Samuel Mark Jones made to a Michael Walker. Those calls had been lawfully intercepted by police in respect of an entirely separate investigation. During the course of the trial, I ruled that that evidence was not admissible in the case against the other offenders. Those calls were tendered, without objection, in the proceedings against Samuel Mark Jones. 
         
         
        19 Ellen Smith gave evidence that, prior to the arrival of those persons, she observed her husband, Adam Jones, collect a sword from their van and take it to his father’s caravan. She said that she also observed Adam Samuel Jones collect various items, including a baseball bat, and place them on the ground outside his caravan. 
         
         
        20 At some later stage, Ellen Smith saw Samuel Jones and Samuel Mark Jones in the vicinity of Adam Samuel Jones’ caravan. They were in the company of another male whom she did not know. According to Ellen Smith, Lydia Jones told her that ‘It will be a fair fight’. She also said that when she asked Samuel Jones to ensure that ‘nothing bad happened’, he had replied ‘I can’t baby, it’s out of my hands’.  
         
         
        21 At approximately 1.20 am, the five offenders, other than Lydia Jones, together with at least three other persons who were not known to members of the Smith family, approached the male members of the Smith family from the vicinity of the amenities block. Those persons were armed with a variety of weapons which included hand axes, machetes, swords, knives and iron bars. The Crown case was that those persons participated in a joint criminal enterprise, the purpose of which was to attack the deceased intending thereby to kill him or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. The Crown case was that each of the offenders was a principal in the first degree in that each participated in the attack upon the deceased by striking him with a weapon or weapons. There was no challenge on behalf of any of the offenders to the evidence given at trial that Samuel Mark Jones and several other persons were also engaged in the fatal incident. Nor was there any challenge to that aspect of the case during the sentence proceedings. 
         
         
        22 The evidence given by the 11 members of the Smith family who claimed to have witnessed the fatal incident is that no member of their family was armed with a weapon. They gave evidence that the attack had been totally unexpected and unprovoked and that members of their family had been defenceless in the face of what was essentially an onslaught. That part of the evidence was subjected to sustained attack by counsel who appeared on behalf of the various offenders. It is readily apparent from the jury’s verdicts that they rejected that aspect of the evidence given by members of the Smith family. I, too, have little hesitation in rejecting it. In doing so, I have had regard, inter alia, to a significant body of evidence from which it was clearly open to infer that in the period between the initial incident and the fatal incident, various male members of the Smith family, including the deceased, had gathered together a number of weapons in anticipation of a fight between the two families. The weapons which they had collected included a tomahawk, a machete, a meat cleaver, wooden sticks and socks which contained lead objects within them. Those items were located lying together at site 81, which is close to where the fatal incident occurred. It is reasonable to infer that they were secreted there by at least one member of the Smith family. Of particular significance is the fact that DNA consistent with that of each of the deceased, Noah Henry Smith and their father John Smith, respectively, was discovered upon some of those items. Even more importantly, Noah Smith’s blood was located upon one of the weapons. Noah Smith was quite unable, despite persistent questioning, to explain how it may have found its way there. Because Noah Smith was injured during the course of the fight, the only reasonable available inference is that his blood fell onto the weapon either then or whilst the weapons were being carried to site 81. To that material, may be added the evidence of Noah Henry Nathan Smith (Noah Smith Jnr). He told police that his grandfather had been in possession of a pickaxe handle. Somewhat improbably, he sought to retract that observation whilst giving evidence.  
         
         
        23 As I have said, the evidence given by members of the Smith family, that the attack upon them was unexpected and unprovoked and that they were unarmed, simply cannot be reconciled with the evidence to which I have just referred. Moreover, the evidence that the eleven members of the Smith family, amongst whom were several women and children, were all standing around sometime after 1am in the morning for the purpose of socialising, defies belief. The evidence indicates that the women were inside one of the vans whilst the men were outside the van. I am satisfied that the men, at least, had all gathered together in anticipation that a fight was in prospect. John William Smith told police that ‘we were concerned that members of the Jones group would return and start trouble’. He said that if they did so ‘then we would have to fight them as a group’. Caroline Smith said that she had a ‘feeling’ that something would happen. She also gave evidence that as the group of offenders approached, she heard someone yell out words to the effect of ‘they’re here’. There was, of course, no time in the period between the approach of the offenders and the beginning of the fight for the members of the Smith family to arm themselves. It is apparent, in those circumstances, that they had already armed themselves for the very reason that they anticipated that there would be some sort of fight involving the use of weapons. 
         
         
        24 Both Adam Samuel Jones and Adam Jones told police, in recorded interviews, that prior to the fatal incident they observed members of the Smith family gathering weapons together at their end of the park. They asserted that that group of persons, which included the deceased, had also taunted and threatened them. 
         
         
        25 The evidence disclosed that the deceased observed the offenders as they approached from the area of the amenities block. It seems that he was armed at the time with what appeared to be a pick axe handle. As I have already said, other male members of his family were also either armed or had ready access to weapons. The deceased immediately moved towards Adam Samuel Jones and grabbed him around the throat area. The deceased was then struck a number of blows which forced him to the ground. Whilst he lay on the ground on his stomach he was subjected to a further attack. The Crown case is that each of the offenders struck the deceased a number of blows during the course of the fatal incident. Whilst all this was happening, Samuel Mark Jones produced a pistol which he pointed at members of the Smith family. Even if it was only an imitation pistol, the production of it clearly changed the dynamics of what was presumably intended to have been a pitched battle involving the use of weapons. The introduction of the pistol effectively prevented the Smith family members from using their weapons during the course of the fight. This also partly explains why the offenders received only relatively minor injuries from their participation in the fight. 
         
         
        26 The female members of the Smith family, together with several of their children (whom as I have said were inside one of the caravans), heard the commotion and came out to see what was occurring. They each gave evidence as to what they had been able to observe. 
         
         
        27 The Crown case was that the offenders attacked Noah Smith when he attempted to render assistance to the deceased. It contended that there was a joint criminal enterprise, the purpose of which was to attack and wound Noah Smith with the intention of killing him. However the jury’s verdicts are to be understood as indicating that it was only satisfied to the requisite standard that each of the offenders was a party to, and participated in, an attack upon Noah Smith in which the intention of each of them was merely to wound him. 
         
         
        28 A number of witnesses gave evidence that Adam Samuel Jones and Adam Jones each struck him with an axe or a blade. Adam Jones admitted, during a conversation on 20 October 2005 with Ellen Smith, which was covertly recorded by police, that he had stabbed Noah Smith. A knife that he owned, which had the blood of Noah Smith upon it, was subsequently located at the scene by police. Noah Smith gave evidence that Samuel Jones had struck him in the head with an iron bar. Samuel Jones declined to be interviewed by police. His version of events, which was elicited through the evidence of his friend Michael Bennett, with whom he spoke prior to his arrest, was that he in fact had been attacked by Noah Smith. Mr Bennett gave evidence that Samuel Jones told him that he had sustained an injury to his forearm during the course of that attack. There was a photograph in evidence which depicted that injury. So far as that aspect of the matter is concerned, Samuel Jones relied upon self-defence, an explanation which the jury plainly rejected. Nonetheless, I accept that Samuel Jones was struck forcefully with an implement during the course of the fatal incident. 
         
         
        29 Towards the end of the incident, Adam Jones struck Ellen Smith’s 16 year old sister, Mary Rose on the shoulder with an object causing her a minor injury. His case was that she had first struck him in the hand. Although he did sustain an injury to his hand, the jury rejected the offender’s claim that he had been acting in self-defence at the time of that incident. 
         
         
        30 The offenders and their accomplices then fled the scene. At approximately 1.25 am Louisa Smith, the deceased’s mother, called the police emergency service line and requested the immediate attendance of police and ambulance officers at the scene. Police and ambulance officers arrived there at approximately 1.40 am. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of ambulance officers, nothing could be done to revive William Smith who had already died. Noah Smith, who was in a distressed state and was bleeding heavily, was treated at the scene. He was then taken to Gosford Hospital where he received further treatment from Dr Arora. He had sustained a deep 20 cm laceration, which ran from his neck and down his back, as well as lacerations to his scalp, face, hands and groin. He had also suffered a blunt force trauma to his forehead. In Dr Arora’s opinion, the wound to his back would have been occasioned by a weapon with a blade measuring at least 20 cm. 
         
         
        31 Dr Lee, a forensic pathologist, conducted the post-mortem upon the deceased. His examination revealed that the deceased had sustained 18 sharp force injuries to his head, face, torso, arms, hands and legs. Dr Lee described those injuries as being stabbing, chopping and slash type wounds. The fatal injury was caused by a single blow which penetrated the deceased’s left lung. The Crown was unable however to attribute the infliction of the fatal wound to any particular offender. It was Dr Lee’s opinion that that injury was most likely to have been caused by a carving type knife. The deceased’s injuries were caused, in his opinion, by a variety of weapons. Some of the injuries were consistent with the use of weapons such as a machete or an axe or something of a similar kind, whilst others were consistent with having been inflicted with a smaller knife.” 
        
       
      
    7 It will be observed that the Applicant’s offences are described by Buddin J at paragraphs [25] (manslaughter), [27]-[28] (malicious wounding) and [29] (common assault) of the remarks on sentence extracted above.  
     
      
    8 Following the offences, the Applicant fled to Queensland where he was arrested on 26 October 2005. He remained in custody thereafter. 
     
      
       
      Some Further Findings of the Sentencing Judge 
       
      
    9 Having regard to the issues raised on this application, reference should be made to other findings of the learned sentencing Judge. 
     
      
       
      Basis for Sentence for Manslaughter 
       
      
    10 Buddin J observed, at [70], that he proposed to sentence the five offenders convicted of manslaughter, including the Applicant, upon the basis that each was a principal in the first degree to the manslaughter of the deceased and that the basis upon which their liability was to be assessed was that each was acting, at the relevant time, in excessive self-defence or defence of another or others and also under provocation. 
     
      
    11 Buddin J made further findings at [116]-[117] concerning the circumstances of the manslaughter offence: 
     
      
       
        
        “116 The offenders are to be sentenced upon the basis that they acted pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise to strike the deceased with an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. As I have said, it is neither possible nor even necessary to identify who inflicted the fatal blow. It is common ground that it is an aggravating feature that the offences involved the use of weapons: s 21A(2)(c) of the Act. It is also appropriate to have regard to the fact that each of the offences were committed in company: s 21A(2)(e);  
        R v Imnetu 
         [2006] NSWCCA 203. Both the deceased and Noah Smith would inevitably have felt both fearful and powerless in the face of an attack of the present kind.  
         
         
        117 I have not overlooked the fact that the offenders are to be sentenced upon the basis that they were, to some extent, provoked. That is a mitigating matter which is specifically referred to in s 21A(3)(c) of the Act but it is nonetheless important to ensure that the matter is not given undue weight in a case in which it was also a factor in reducing the various offenders’ culpability for the death of William Smith from murder to manslaughter. In assessing this aspect of the matter I have had regard to the principles enunciated in  
        R v Alexander 
         (1994) 78 A Crim R 141 at 144.” 
        
       
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Features 
       
      
    12 The learned sentencing Judge adverted to the Applicant’s subjective features at [80]-[88]: 
     
      
       
        
        “80 Adam Jones was born on 2 August 1986 and is now aged 21. Although he was born in Australia he went to live in the United Kingdom at the age of 3. Whilst in the United Kingdom he received some schooling. His family returned to Australia when he was 10 years old and he attended primary school for a short period of time thereafter. Although he received no formal education after the age of 12, he is said to have acquired good numeracy and literacy skills through tuition from his family. 
         
         
        81 The offender worked with his father doing menial labouring jobs until he married at the age of 18. He thereafter became self-employed. His wife has now returned with her family to the United Kingdom to live and she and the offender are in the process of getting a divorce. 
         
         
        82 The offender informed the author of the pre-sentence report that he disputes some aspects of the Crown case, but the areas of disagreement are not of any great moment. Although he professed not to know what started the conflict between the families that night, he has nonetheless accepted responsibility for his actions on the night. The author of the pre-sentence report observed that he ‘has expressed his sorrow at the death of the victim … that was caused  
        [by the actions of his father and himself] 
        …and the rift this has caused between both families’. 
         
         
        83 At the time of the offence, the offender was accustomed to consuming alcohol once every two months or so and conceded to Mr Watson-Munro that he was engaged in a ‘pattern of heavy binge drinking’. He said that although he had consumed some alcohol on the night in question, he accepted that it ‘was not at such a level that he was entirely unaware of his actions or their consequences’. 
         
         
        84 Mr Watson-Munro arrived at the following conclusions about the offender: 
         
         
          
           
            
            It is apparent that  
            [the offender] 
             has suffered from a range of psychological issues from early childhood. This arises from the isolation imposed upon him by virture  
            [sic]  
            of a strong family bond dynamic and tradition, according to his Romany heritage. Hence whilst he appears to have been fairly secure in terms of his immediate family, paradoxically the isolation arising from this and his itinerant lifestyle has precluded any real opportunity for this man to establish meaningful peer group relationships beyond this constellation. This no doubt coupled to his limited education has coloured his view of the world, which is of some relevance in terms of his judgment and capacity to critically evaluate problem situations free from emotional bias. Given the strong dependence that  
            [the offender] 
             has had upon his family, it is apparent that he would willingly follow their direction without readily questioning the broader implications arising from this lifestyle. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          … 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            Arising from a fairly disjointed and itinerant life involving minimal formal education and extensive travel within Australia and the United Kingdom,  
            [the offender] 
             has developed a fairly myopic view of the world, which no doubt has reinforced the strong dependency that he has upon his family unit arising from the fairly intense bonding that has occurred by virtue of their isolation from the broader community. This dynamic has been further aggravated by his relatively young age and attendant immaturity. These issues are of considerable relevance to his mood state, judgment and behaviour at the material time. 
            
           
          
         
         
        85 The offender is described in a testimonial as a ‘caring and sensitive young man… 
        [who] 
         is devastated by the result that his actions have caused to both families, a burden that he will carry with him for the rest of his life’. The clergyman who officiated at the offender’s wedding to Ellen Smith indicated his ‘complete surprise to learn of the events that bring  
        [the offender] 
         to court’. He expressed the view that the offender ‘is genuinely sorry and repentant for his actions’. 
         
         
        86 The offender is reported to have been spending his time in custody in a productive fashion. He was originally employed as a sweeper but now works as a spray painter. His supervisor describes him as a good worker who relates well to both staff and inmates. Furthermore, he has completed a number of educational programs, including a TAFE course in carpentry. He has the continuing support of his mother and his younger siblings who visit him and his father on a regular basis. 
         
         
        87 Mr Watson-Munro also observed that: 
         
         
          
           
            
            [h] 
            is exposure to the harsh reality of maximum security prison life has had a salutary impact upon him and reinforced a developing resolve to deal with some of his underlying psychological issues. At examination  
            [the offender] 
             expressed remorse for his behaviour which appears to be genuine. 
            
           
          
         
         
        88 His only previous convictions were recorded in the Local Court in March 2006 and in the Children’s Court in May 2006 and involved offences of dishonesty rather than violence. In the Local Court matter, he received a one month sentence of imprisonment for obtaining money by deception. In respect of the matters in the Children’s Court, he was placed on probation for 18 months for offences of making a false instrument and receiving stolen property.” 
        
       
       
      Applicant’s Pleas of Guilty 
       
      
    13 Just prior to the commencement of the trial at which the Applicant (and other members of the Jones family) were charged with the murder of William Smith and wounding Noah Smith with intent to murder, the Applicant offered to plead guilty to manslaughter and malicious wounding. When that offer was refused by the Crown, the Applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter and malicious wounding upon his arraignment before the jury. The Crown declined to accept those pleas of guilty in discharge of the indictment and the trial of the Applicant (and others) proceeded before the jury between 21 February and 2 July 2007. The jury acquitted the Applicant of murder and wounding with intent to murder and an alternative count of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, but convicted him of manslaughter, malicious wounding and common assault. 
     
      
    14 With respect to the Applicant’s pleas of guilty to manslaughter and malicious wounding, which were not accepted by the Crown, Buddin J adverted to the relevant authorities and concluded at [123]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submits that a discount in the range of 10% - 15% should be extended to each of the offenders. Counsel for the relevant offenders suggested that a discount of up to 20% was called for. I am inclined to the view that a discount in the order of 15% is appropriate in the circumstances of the present case. In doing so I have had regard to the timeliness of the pleas, and to the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v FD & JD  
        (supra) in which it was suggested that pleas of guilty offered in circumstances such as the present ought properly to have attracted a discount somewhere around the mid-point of the range in  
        Thomson & Houlton 
         (at 422).” 
        
       
       
      Contrition and Remorse 
       
      
    15 Buddin J referred to submissions concerning the Applicant’s contrition and found, at [124], that the Applicant accepted responsibility for his actions and that he was “somewhat remorseful for having so conducted himself”.  
     
      
       
      The Role of the Applicant 
       
      
    16 His Honour said with respect to the Applicant at [126]-[127]: 
     
      
       
        
        “126 Adam Jones was a young man of 19 at the time of these offences. Although he played a pivotal role in the events which led to the fatal incident and is properly to be regarded as an adult so far as his actions are concerned, he is, and was, far from wise in the affairs of the world. Moreover, he was still very much under the influence of his family, particularly his father. His life within that family was a very insular one. I regard his age as having some relevance to the sentencing exercise: s 21A(3)(j). His age cannot however be regarded as having the significance which may have been attributed to it had he been younger and had he not conducted himself in the manner in which he did on the night in question. 
         
         
        127 Given all the features of the case to which I have referred, I am of the view that each of the offenders has ‘good prospects of rehabilitation’: s 21A(3)(g).” 
        
       
      
    17 Having referred to issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality, Buddin J turned to the question of parity and made findings, including further findings concerning the role of the Applicant, at [130]-[131]: 
     
      
       
        
        “130 That leaves the question of parity as between the five main offenders. This aspect of the sentencing task is not without its difficulties. Prima facie, persons who are involved in a joint criminal enterprise to commit a particular offence can expect to have the objective gravity of their offending assessed at the same level. I have already indicated however that the roles played by Samuel Jones and in particular Elizabeth Jones were such as to entitle them to a penalty which is a little less severe than the other three offenders. 
         
         
        131 Notwithstanding the fact that there are differences in the circumstances of each of the other three principal offenders, I am unable to see a basis upon which it would be appropriate to differentiate between the sentences imposed upon them. I should add that counsel who appeared on behalf of each of those offenders, as well as the Crown, indicated that they agreed with that approach. It is nevertheless necessary to briefly explain why I have reached that conclusion. Adam Jones is younger than the other two and I have concluded that his immaturity and dependency on his family played some part in the reason for his having committed these offences. Unlike his father he has no Form 1 offences to be taken into account, although he does have the conviction for common assault which is to be brought into play. However, his role throughout the entirety of the evening which culminated in the fatal incident, was a critical one. Furthermore, he must bear responsibility for having turned the initial argument from a verbal argument into something considerably more serious by having produced the knife and threatening to use it.” 
        
       
       
      Special Circumstances 
       
      
    18 A finding of special circumstances was made with respect to the Applicant (and others) at [137], principally to reflect the fact that each offender was to serve their first term of imprisonment and would need an extended period upon release from custody to re-integrate into society and also because the sentences were to be partly accumulated. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing for Manslaughter 
       
      
    19 With respect to sentencing for the crime of manslaughter, his Honour said at [135]-[136]: 
     
      
       
        
        “135 The various authorities to which I earlier referred make plain that there is no established tariff for the offence of manslaughter. Nevertheless, I have derived some assistance from a number of cases which, the Crown submitted, were somewhat comparable to the present case and as such give some indication as to the appropriate range. The cases to which I was referred by the Crown are  
        R v Ladd 
         [2001] NSWSC 1055;  
        R v Bullock 
         [2005] NSWSC 1071;  
        R v Berrier 
         [2006] NSWSC 1421;  
        R v Cavanough 
         [2007] NSWSC 561 and  
        R v Cakovski 
         [2005] NSWSC 1001. For completeness I should indicate that I have had regard to the review of relevant authorities undertaken in  
        R v Forbes 
         (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at 37-43 and in  
        Cakovski 
         (supra) at pars 35-6. 
         
         
        136 It appears to be common ground that, with the exception of the decision in  
        Ladd 
         (supra) (in which the offender had a significant prior history including a conviction for murder), those cases suggest that a head sentence in the order of 7½ years to 9 years with a non-parole period of 5-6 years may be appropriate in a case such as the present. Notwithstanding the well recognised limitations of that kind of material and although the exercise of the sentencing discretion is for the Court alone, I am disposed, in what the Crown aptly described, as the unique circumstances of the present case, to have some regard to what those authorities indicate.” 
        
       
      
    20 Before moving to pass sentence upon the offenders, Buddin J concluded at [142]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the final analysis, it is necessary to impose sentences which properly reflect the objective gravity of the offences in question. Furthermore, the sentences must give effect not only to the various matters referred to in s 3A of the Act but also to the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature. The considerations to which I have just referred apply equally to the non-parole period and to the overall sentence: see  
        R v Simpson 
         (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. This case involves the death of a man following an unrestrained attack upon him by a number of persons during the course of which a number of dangerous weapons were used. Another man was badly injured when he attempted to assist the deceased. The attack took place in the presence of, and was witnessed by, a number of members of the deceased’s family, including relatively young children. A message must be sent out that the community will not tolerate disputes, even those of an apparently private nature, being resolved in the fashion in which the present one was. Notwithstanding the circumstances in which the offenders committed these offences, a human being has needlessly lost his life. Nothing less than custodial sentences of some length can thus be countenanced.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions of the Parties 
       
      
    21 Mr Trevallion, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that having regard to the strong subjective case of the Applicant and the circumstances of the offences: 
     
      
       
      (a) the overall sentences were manifestly excessive; and 
       
       
      (b) his Honour erred in finding that a discount of 15% for the pleas of guilty was appropriate in the circumstances of the Applicant’s case. 
       
      
    22 Mr Trevallion submitted that the learned sentencing Judge had not given appropriate weight to the subjective circumstances of the Applicant, nor the provocative conduct of the deceased and other members of the Smith family. In particular, relying upon R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, it was submitted that his Honour did not give appropriate weight to the way in which the Applicant’s membership of the Romany gypsy community helped to explain, or throw light upon, his involvement in the offences and his particular circumstances.  
     
      
    23 With respect to the Applicant’s level of culpability, Mr Trevallion pointed to the fact that the initial dispute between the two families arose because of the Applicant’s desire to marry Ms Smith and their subsequent elopement and marriage in secrecy, together with the dynamics within the Jones family which influenced the Applicant. Particular reference was made to the report dated 12 September 2007 of Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, in the passages extracted by Buddin J at [84] of the remarks on sentence (set out at [12] above).  
     
      
    24 Mr Trevallion emphasised the extent of the provocative behaviour of the deceased, and the deceased’s family, which served to mitigate the Applicant’s culpability. 
     
      
    25 Reliance was placed upon sentencing statistics from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales for manslaughter offences, in support of the contention that the sentence for manslaughter in this case was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    26 With respect to the discount allowed for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty, Mr Trevallion submitted that insufficient weight had been given to what was said to be the very substantial saving of court time and resources and that a greater discount should have been allowed in this case. 
     
      
    27 The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge gave careful consideration, and appropriate weight, to the Applicant’s subjective features. Likewise, the Crown submitted that his Honour had carefully considered the issue of provocation on sentence, recognising the need not to allow the Applicant a double credit in this respect, given that an element of provocation had operated in the Applicant’s favour with his acquittal of murder. 
     
      
    28 The Crown pointed to decisions of this Court which have emphasised the need for particular care with respect to the use of sentencing statistics generally (Robertson v R (2007) 177 A Crim R 121 at 127 [36]) and other sentencing decisions for manslaughter: Ward v R (2006) 166 A Crim R 273 at 284-289 [59]-[74]; Salah v R [2009] NSWCCA 2 at [37]-[41]. 
     
      
    29 With respect to the discount allowed for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty, the Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated in this respect, and that a 15% discount lay within the discretion of the sentencing Judge.  
     
      
    30 The Crown submitted that this was a serious case of manslaughter, associated with offences of malicious wounding and assault committed against two other victims. The Applicant had played a significant role in the violent confrontation between the two families, and had escalated the tension directly when he produced a knife and, at a later point, was armed with a sword.  
     
      
    31 The Crown submitted that the appeal ought be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    32 In view of submissions made in support of the application, it is appropriate to recite some basic principles. 
     
      
    33 The Court of Criminal Appeal functions within well-established jurisdictional boundaries and is concerned, on an application for leave to appeal against sentence, primarily to ascertain whether the decision of the first-instance Judge was in error: R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 at 353. An appeal to this Court is not by way of rehearing, and error must be established before the Court may intervene: R v O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401. This Court is bound by findings of fact of the sentencing Judge unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504: Kardoulias v The Queen (2005) 159 A Crim R 252 at 265 [56].  
     
      
    34 To the extent that some of the Applicant’s submissions assert that “insufficient weight” was given to a factor or that “appropriate weight” had not been given to another factor, it is timely to refer to the observation of Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] that “questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge” and that “the circumstances in which matters of ‘weight’ will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined”. 
     
      
    35 The Applicant does not contend that there is patent error in this case, but submits that there is latent error in that, having regard to the findings of fact made, the sentences imposed upon the Applicant were manifestly excessive. The real question is whether the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25].  
     
      
    36 As is apparent from the extracts from the remarks on sentence set out earlier in this judgment, the learned sentencing Judge made careful and detailed findings with respect to the objective seriousness of the offences and the Applicant’s subjective circumstances. No error, either patent or latent, has been demonstrated with respect to his Honour’s assessment of the level of the Applicant’s culpability for his crimes and his subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    37 In my view, the decision in R v Fernando does not assist the present Applicant. Mr Trevallion confirmed that the decision had not been relied upon before Buddin J. In R v Fernando, Wood J made clear, at 62, that the same sentencing principles are to be applied in every case irrespective of the identity of the particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group, although the Court should not ignore those facts which exist only by reason of the offender’s membership of such a group. The principles in R v Fernando have particular application where deprivation and disadvantage suffered by an offender of Aboriginal race or ancestry exist, which bear upon the commission of the crime, although the application of the principles will depend upon the circumstances of the case: see R v Kelly (2005) 155 A Crim R 499 at 503-504 [17]-[19] (and the cases cited therein). 
     
      
    38 It is apparent that his Honour had regard to the Applicant’s family and social dynamics insofar as they played a part in his involvement in these serious crimes. No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s approach in this respect.  
     
      
    39 It is apparent from his Honour’s findings of fact that the Applicant had played “a pivotal role” (at [126]) and that his part throughout the entirety of the evening, culminating in the fatal incident, was “a critical one” and that “he must bear responsibility for having turned the initial argument from a verbal argument into something considerably more serious by having produced the knife and threatening to use it” (at [131]). Whilst acknowledging that the Applicant’s life within the family was “a very insular one” and that he was “still very much under the influence of his family, particularly his father” (at [126]), Buddin J found that the Applicant had played a significant role in the violent confrontation, in which the Applicant was criminally responsible for the death of one man, the wounding of another and the assault of a teenage girl. 
     
      
    40 No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s allowance of a 15% discount for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty. Bearing in mind that these pleas were offered, for the first time, just prior to the commencement of the trial, the discount allowed fell within the available discretionary range in accordance with the principles summarised recently in Borkowski v R [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32].  
     
      
    41 References to sentencing statistics for manslaughter offences provide little assistance: Salah v R at [40]; Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 at [16]-[18]. In manslaughter cases, the circumstances of the offence and criminality involved can vary enormously, and the assessment of these circumstances, and of the criminality, is very much a matter for the judgment of a sentencing judge: Stewart v R at [17].  
     
      
    42 This case is a further example of the disastrous consequences which can flow from a public affray: Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 at [47]. The Applicant was armed with a weapon and was part of a joint criminal enterprise which saw the killing of a man in circumstances of clearly excessive self-defence. He committed offences of violence against three separate victims. 
     
      
    43 In the present case, the learned sentencing Judge undertook a careful appraisal of the objective circumstances of the offence, and the subjective circumstances of the Applicant, and reached a decision with respect to sentence which was clearly open in all the circumstances of the case. It has not been demonstrated that the sentences passed were unreasonable or plainly unjust so as to make good a ground of appeal based upon a claim of manifest excess. To the contrary, the sentences passed were plainly open and were well within the discretionary range available in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    44 I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.45 LATHAM J: I agree with Johnson J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: Subject to the following additional remarks, I agree with the reasons of Harrison J. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    2 In considering ground 2, concerning whether the bail conditions of the respondents distinguished the case from the R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 guidelines, it is important to bear in mind the sort of judgment that Henry was. It was given by this Court, which is a court created by statute and thus has only those powers that statute conferred on it (including any incidental or implied powers arising from the statute: cf DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 240-1 [25]-[26]). It was given in 1999, at a time when the power of this Court to give guideline judgments could only have been based on implication derived from the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the statute that created the Court) and other statutes that confer powers and functions on this Court. Though the case arose, as Spigelman CJ said at 351 [1], when the court listed and heard together six Crown appeals and one severity appeal concerning similar offences, the circumstances of those individual cases are nowhere reported on or considered in the judgment of any of the judges. Indeed, the judgment is unusual in that it does not end with the making of any orders or the giving of any directions. That is not a function of the editor of published reports having deleted inessential matters from the report – the full text of the judgments, accessible on the Court's website, likewise does not end with the making of any orders or the giving of any directions.  
     
      
    3 The concern of the Court in Henry was to create a judgment that would provide a guideline for fixing appropriate sentences in a category of cases that had the seven characteristics identified by Spigelman CJ at 380 [162], namely: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
         
         
        (ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
         
         
        (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
         
         
        (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
         
         
        (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
         
         
        (vi) Small amount taken; 
         
         
        (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case."" 
        
       
      
    4 The guideline given in Henry was a range of sentences, namely (at 380 [165]) ""between four and five years for the full term."" The judgment specifically recognised, 382 [174], that the seven characteristics that defined the class to which the guideline judgment applied did not represent the full range of factors relevant to the sentencing exercise in any individual case.  
     
      
    5 The Crown is right in submitting that the silence of Henry about bail conditions meant that ordinary sentencing principles would apply in respect of matters not specifically mentioned. Any doubts that there may have been about the ability of this Court to give guideline judgments (other than in matters involving the exercise of federal jurisdiction: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584) have now been laid to rest by the enactment in 2001 of sections 37 and 37A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Those sections expressly empower the Court to give a guideline judgment. Such a judgment is defined in section 36 of that Act as meaning: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… a judgment that is expressed to contain guidelines to be taken into account by courts sentencing offenders, being:  
         
         
        (a) guidelines that apply generally, or 
         
         
        (b) guidelines that apply to particular courts or classes of courts, to particular offences or classes of offences, to particular penalties or classes of penalties or to particular classes of offenders (but not to particular offenders)."" 
        
       
      
    6 Those provisions operate retrospectively, and thus (in the absence of any High Court decision, or argument before this Court, to the contrary) remove any doubts there may have been about the ability of the Court to deliver the guideline judgment in Henry: see R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at 259 [32]. 
     
      
    7 Section 42A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 sets out the role that a guideline laid down by a guideline judgment is to play in sentencing: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A guideline that is expressed to be contained in a guideline judgment:  
         
         
        (a) is in addition to any other matter that is required to be taken into account under Division 1 of Part 3, and 
         
         
        (b) does not limit or derogate from any such requirement."" 
        
       
      
    8 It is Division 1 of Part 3 of that Act (which runs from section 21 to section 25, and thus includes the long list of specific factors to be taken into account in sentencing contained in section 21A) that enumerates the matters that a court is either empowered or required to take into account in sentencing for offences generally. Thus, the fact that a guideline judgment has been delivered which is applicable to the type of offence for which a court is sentencing does not prevent the court from giving effect to any of the matters listed in Division 1 of Part 3. However, the requirement of section 42A that the guideline is to be taken into account in addition to those matters means that the guideline significantly bears upon the sentencing process. As Spigelman CJ said in Whyte at [232] the guideline is: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… a 'guide' or a 'check'. The sentence imposed in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all of the factors required to be taken into account by s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        ."" 
        
       
      
    9 For the reasons given by Harrison J, the conditions on which the respondents were on bail were not sufficiently arduous, and the time to which they were on bail was not sufficiently long, to in itself be a reason for making the range of sentence referred to in Henry inapplicable. 
     
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    10 Ground 3 related to the judge having regard as a significant matter in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, that none of the respondents had committed the offence for a reason connected with their addiction to drugs. In Henry all the judges reached the conclusion that, on a charge of armed robbery, it was not in itself a mitigating factor that the offender had committed the crime to support a drug habit: at 381-6 [171]-[208] per Spigelman CJ, 387-98 [215]-[277] per Wood CJ at CL, 409-10 [331] per Hulme J, 410-13 [336]-[353] per Simpson J. All judges in Henry agreed with the conclusion of Wood CJ at CL that drug addiction could, in some particular cases, be relevant to the sentencing process in one or other of the specific ways identified at 397-8 [273]. The tendency of all those ways in which drug addiction could be relevant to sentencing is, in the cases where any such factors apply, to reduce what would otherwise have been the sentence. 
     
      
    11 When drug addiction has (depending on the facts of the individual case) either no role to play in sentencing, or a role that tends to reduce a sentence, it is hard to see how the fact that an armed robbery was not committed by reason of addiction to drugs is a factor that mitigates the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    12 Of course, that a convicted person is not addicted to drugs is a matter that is relevant to his or her prospects of rehabilitation, but that is a subjective matter. The trial judge found, in any event, that each of the respondents had excellent prospects of rehabilitation, without any express reliance on their lack of addiction to drugs.  
     
      
    Ground 4 
     
      
    13 Some detail about the circumstances in which the respondents turned themselves in to the police is required to evaluate how significant their action in turning themselves in really was. The offence took place on a Sunday night. The respondents had been continually recorded by the CCTV camera in the shop, for the whole time during which they were committing the offences. The CCTV images were in colour, and their quality was quite good. In particular, the type and colour of clothing of each respondent could be readily ascertained from the CCTV footage. Virtually immediately after the robbery, the number plate of one of their two getaway cars was recorded and given to the police. On 10 April 2008, the Thursday morning after the robbery, detectives attended the address of Mr Jajou. They seized from his bedroom items of clothing that he wore during the robbery. It was at 10.00am on the Thursday morning that Mr Jajou attended the police station, with his father and solicitor, to give himself up. He gave an electronically recorded interview to the police that day. The other respondents gave themselves up the next day, accompanied by the same solicitor who had accompanied Mr Jajou. In these circumstances, the appropriate conclusion to draw is that they gave themselves up only when it was clear to them that their involvement was already either known to or highly suspected by the police.  
     
      
    14 Her Honour's finding that ""short of going straight from the convenience store to the police station to give themselves up there was no time earlier that they could have admitted their guilt in relation to these offences"" is thus erroneous. However that error is of very slight significance in the overall sentencing process. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    15 I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J.16 LATHAM J: I agree with Harrison J and with the remarks of Campbell JA. 
     
      
    17 HARRISON J: The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed upon the respondents Fadi Jajou (""Jajou""), Maher Jebara (""Jebara"") and Sam Lafta (""Lafta"") by her Honour Tupman DCJ in the District Court at Sydney on 6 March 2009. Each of the respondents was sentenced in respect of two offences of armed robbery committed in contravention of s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years. The respondents were each sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years for each offence to be served wholly concurrently. Her Honour suspended the sentences pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    18 In broad terms, her Honour arrived at the two sentences upon the view that, taking into account various objective factors of the offences and subjective factors of the respondents, a sentence of 3 years imprisonment was appropriate. That was reduced by a discount of 15 per cent for early pleas of guilty, and by a further 20 per cent for assistance to authorities. This reduced the overall sentences in round terms to 2 years. 
     
      
    19 The Crown contends that her Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried and relies upon the following six grounds of appeal. Three of them invoke the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
     
      
      1. The learned sentencing judge erred in determining that the ""nature of the offences itself [sic]"" reduce it below a  
      Henry 
       guideline case. 
       
       
      2. The learned sentencing judge erred in finding and taking into account as a matter that ""reduces it below a Henry guideline situation"" that each of the respondents was on ""onerous bail conditions for a relatively long time, almost a year, just short of eleven months"". 
       
       
      3. The learned sentencing judge erred in finding and taking into account as a matter that ""reduces it below a Henry guideline situation"" that there was a ""marked difference"" in each of the respondent's case from the guideline in  
      R v Henry 
       (supra) because ""none of these young offenders committed this offence as a result of a serious ongoing addiction to drugs and in order to satisfy that addiction"". 
       
       
      4. The learned sentencing judge erred by mistaking the facts in finding that ""short of going straight from the convenience store to the police to give themselves up there was no time earlier that they could have admitted their guilt in relation to these offences"". 
       
       
      5. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account matters relevant to a determination of whether the sentences should be ordered to be served concurrently or otherwise and erred in imposing wholly concurrent sentences. 
       
       
      6. The learned sentencing judge erred in point of principle by imposing sentences which were manifestly inadequate. 
       
      
    Background facts 
     
      
    20 The offences were committed at about 11.30pm on Sunday 6 April 2008 in the Choice Mart Convenience Store at Kogarah. On that evening the owner of the store was working alone when five men robbed him of $200 in cash and three cartons of cigarettes. One of the men was armed with a meat cleaver and others were armed with knives. A customer in the store at the time was also robbed of $100 in cash and two mobile phones. Her Honour was given an agreed statement of facts to which reference is made in her remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    21 The offences were captured on CCTV footage that depicts the events of the evening over a period of just over three minutes. It was the Crown's submission that the recording reveals a menacing combination of five offenders and the terrifying wielding of a meat cleaver by one of them. The respondent Jebara is shown to be wearing a multi-coloured wig and is armed with a knife. The respondent Jajou is wearing a white baseball cap and is carrying a knife. The respondent Lafta is without headwear and is armed with the meat cleaver. The co-offenders Khader and Salman are also depicted. 
     
      
    22 The details of what occurred on this occasion are set out in her Honour's remarks on sentence. There is no dispute that her Honour accurately recorded these events. Once the robberies were completed the offenders all left the premises quickly and ran along Queen Victoria Street and entered two vehicles and sped off without turning on their headlights. They were followed by a witness who contacted the police with registration details. On 10 April 2008 police attended Jajou's home and he later voluntarily attended St George Police Station and made admissions during an ERISP. Jebara and Lafta did so the following day. 
     
      
    23 Each respondent pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and all were committed for sentence from the Kogarah Local Court on 15 July 2008. The sentencing hearing took place on 13 February 2009. The respondents each gave short evidence that they were willing to assist the authorities with details of the other two co-offenders. Khader was committed for sentence on 18 December 2008. Salman pleaded guilty on 30 March 2009 on the first day of his trial. 
     
      
    Subjective features 
     
      
    Sam Lafta 
     
      
    24 Mr Lafta was born in Iraq on 12 July 1989 and was 18 at the time of the offences. He had no prior convictions. He spent 12 days in custody before being granted bail. He confessed to the offences and offered assistance in respect of the two other co-offenders. A pre-sentence report dated 9 December 2008 stated that he had experienced a ""reasonably smooth settlement in Australia after migrating from Iraq with no familial problems reported"". He resided with his fiancée and they were expecting a child although his fiancée subsequently miscarried. He had held reasonably consistent employment in unskilled positions. There were no apparent drug and alcohol or gambling issues. He was assessed as being suitable for community service and periodic detention. 
     
      
    25 He subsequently married and worked full time in his father's trolley collection business. He intended to take over that business from his father. He was assaulted in 2007 and required an operation on his eye. He had also been injured playing soccer. 
     
      
    26 Mr Lafta was assessed by Dr Jacmon on 28 May 2008. His report contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Lafta is deeply ashamed over having offended. He reflected on the incident when he went home and realised the seriousness of his offence. He became very distressed, contacted his solicitor and handed himself in. He expressed remorse for offending, the distress caused to the people in the incident, the shame brought to his family, the bad example set for his siblings and having risked his liberty. 
         
          
          
         ***** 
         
         
        Posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety at clinically significant levels are markedly impairing Mr Lafta's daily functioning. The impairment is likely to have existed since the incident in which he was assaulted and seriously injured."" 
        
       
      
    27 Dr Jacmon did not offer an opinion with respect to the connection, if any, between the conditions he diagnosed and Mr Lafta's participation in the offences. 
     
      
    Maher Jebara 
     
      
    28 Mr Jebara was born in Iraq on 17 July 1988 and was 19 at the time of the offences. He had also spent 12 days in custody before bail was granted. He confessed and offered to give assistance to the authorities concerning the other two co-offenders. A pre-sentence report dated 8 December 2008 stated that he appeared to lack self-confidence and appeared to be easily led. He resided at home with his family. He had prospects of obtaining employment in the automotive industry. There were no drug and alcohol or gambling issues. He expressed remorse for the victims of the offences. He was assessed as being suitable for community service and periodic detention. 
     
      
    29 Dr Jacmon assessed Mr Jebara on 31 May 2008 and his psychological report provided further detail about work that he had undertaken as a cement renderer before obtaining a security licence in Queensland. Dr Jacmon's report contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Maher [sic] is ashamed and remorseful over having offended. The remorse encompasses offending, the distress caused to the people in the shop, the shame brought to his family and the bad example set for his siblings. After the incident he broke off his relationship with [his girlfriend], notwithstanding her pleas to support him in his time of need, because of the shame he felt. He is sorry for having placed his freedom in jeopardy and for having risked his aspirations for a career in security. His depression has returned. He was advised during the assessment that he needed treatment for his distress. 
         
         
         
          
         ***** 
         
         
        Depression and anxiety at clinically significant levels are markedly impairing [his] daily functioning. The impairment is likely to have existed for the last four years, since difficulties began to arise as he could not find appropriate work to support his family."" 
        
       
      
    Fadi Jajou 
     
      
    30 Mr Jajou was born in Iraq on 10 August 1985 and was 22 at the time of the offences. He had one conviction for driving whilst suspended for which he received a fine of $500 and a 12-month disqualification on 18 July 2008. He spent 13 days in custody before being granted bail for the present offences. He gave a voluntary confession after consulting his solicitor. He offered assistance to the authorities with respect to the other two co-offenders. A pre-sentence report dated 8 December 2008 stated that Mr Jajou was then a second year apprentice in the automotive repair industry and in a personal relationship that appeared to be stable and supportive. There were no drug and alcohol or gambling issues. He expressed some remorse for his victims. He was assessed as being suitable for community service and periodic detention. 
     
      
    31 Mr Jajou was married on 15 November 2008. He had been assaulted in 2006 and spent three weeks in Liverpool Hospital. 
     
      
    32 Dr Jacmon assessed Mr Jajou on 28 May 2008. His report contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""After Mr Jajou returned home he began to realise the full import of his actions. He became horrified by what he had done. He contacted his solicitor and in company with his father handed himself in to the St George police station. In the assessment he expressed remorse encompassing offending, the distress caused to the people in the shop during the incident, the shame brought to his family and fiancée, the bad example set for his siblings and the jeopardy in which he has placed his freedom and career."" 
        
       
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    33 In her remarks on sentence her Honour said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""…I then look to see where these offences might lie as compared to those sorts of cases referred to in the  
        Henry 
         guideline. There are factors it seems to me which reduce it below a  
        Henry 
         guideline case. One of those is the nature of the offences itself [sic] to which I have already referred, the fact that there was little planning, a degree of spontaneity, no actual threats and no evidence of any ongoing difficulties suffered by the victims."" 
        
       
      
    34 Her Honour had earlier said, ""in terms of assessing the objective criminality I accept that the whole incident was committed very quickly"". 
     
      
    35 The Crown submitted that the fact that there was little planning and a degree of spontaneity were not matters that reduced the offences below the guideline principles. One of the seven characteristics identified in Henry is ""limited degree of planning"". There were no verbal threats and her Honour's reference to ""no actual threats"" must have been a reference to that fact. For example, her Honour observed that there was ""no evidence of anything at all having been said by any of the three offenders during the course of the offences and … the CCTV footage is silent"". 
     
      
    36 However, as the Crown submits the CCTV footage reveals, it would invite error to constrain the guideline to verbal threats or to rely upon the absence of verbal threats as a matter that reduced the offences below what Henry appears to contemplate. The five offenders acted in unison. The shop proprietor was suddenly grabbed by Mr Jebara who reached over the counter to do so whilst clutching a knife. Mr Lafta wielded a meat cleaver in a fearsome fashion that required no words to augment its effect. The absence of any proven verbal threats did not reduce the objective seriousness of the offences.37 Nor was the absence of evidence of any ongoing difficulties suffered by the victims a matter that reduced the offences to some level below the Henry guidelines. Her Honour said that the victims appeared ""to look to an extent more dumbfounded and surprised than terrified"" but ultimately accepted that they must have been frightened. She felt that it would not be a surprise if there were some degree of ongoing psychological problems. According to the Crown, that is an uncontroversial finding and is sufficient to establish that there was an effect upon the victims. There were no victims' impact statements or other evidence of ""ongoing difficulties"". The Crown contended that that did not have the effect of reducing the matter to an unremarkable level for Henry purposes. 
     
      
    38 Moreover it was erroneous to place emphasis upon the fact that the robberies were ""committed very quickly"". Even though that assessment was correct, it was wrong for her Honour to have relied upon it as a factor that reduced the objective seriousness of the offences in general or below the Henry guidelines in particular. Rather, the time taken to commit the offences reflected, in the Crown's submission, a level of criminal efficiency and teamwork that was not a mitigating factor. The five offenders were in the store and acted as a group. Two men went in the direction of each victim and the fifth remained near the doorway. The victims were ""very quickly"" overpowered by the combined efforts of the offenders but in a way that added to the seriousness of the events rather than reducing it. The speed with which a crime is committed has no necessary or obvious relationship to its seriousness. 
     
      
    39 The Crown contended that, far from being outside the Henry guidelines in a way that favoured the respondents, the offences in question fell more or less squarely within them. Furthermore, not only was the nature of the offences themselves a matter that did not reduce the offences below the guidelines, they were committed in company, which was a seriously aggravating factor. The Crown contended that in all of these circumstances there was no basis for distinguishing the present offences from the combination of factors contemplated by the guideline judgment.40 The respondents dealt with grounds 1 to 3 together. It is sufficient to observe that the respondents submitted that any alleged departure by her Honour from the Henry guidelines was permissible and warranted and certainly not such as to demonstrate error on her part.  
     
      
    41 I disagree. None of the matters emphasised by her Honour either alone or in combination has the effect of warranting the treatment of these offences as somehow falling beyond the Henry guidelines. This Court was invited to view the CCTV recording of the incident. First, I do not agree that there was little planning. The assembly of offenders within the shop was ordered and patently premeditated. The five men took up positions within the shop that were obviously related to the actions of Mr Jebara at the counter. As soon as he reached over the counter the remaining offenders can be seen instantly to move almost as one. The wielding of the meat cleaver by Mr Lafta occurs at this time. Others move out of shot and in the direction of the customer who they rob.  
     
      
    42 Secondly, it is also incorrect to describe anything that happened as spontaneous. Her Honour's observation in this respect is to my mind no more than the statement of an obvious fact that not every single element of what occurred had been rehearsed to the last detail. Nor could it have been. The offenders were young and inexperienced and reacted necessarily in a somewhat skittish fashion. That is quite a different thing to saying that the events that constituted the offence somehow unfolded in an unexpected or unanticipated way for which the respondents ought not by implication be held accountable.  
     
      
    43 Thirdly, the time taken to commit the offences is not something that invites leniency. The respondents committed the offences with an efficiency that was consonant with an understandable desire to remain on the premises for no longer than was necessary. The respondents encountered no resistance from the victims and the items and cash that were taken were delivered or discovered without difficulty or delay. While no doubt the offences would have been more serious than they actually were if the respondents took a longer time to commit them and in that longer time kept the victims frightened by their weapons, and by the manner in which those weapons were being wielded, that does not mean that the comparative shortness of time that it took to commit the offence distinguishes it from the Henry guidelines. The speed with which the crime is committed does not feature in the list of factors that define the circumstances in which the Henry guideline is applicable, so speed cannot be a ground of distinction from Henry. Extremely serious crimes can quite obviously be committed in a very short time. 
     
      
    44 Fourthly, I do not consider that there were no actual threats. It is difficult to conceive of anything less threatening in relative terms than the wielding by an assailant of a meat cleaver held high above his head. The simultaneous reaction of all of the offenders was highly threatening and objectively alarming. The absence of an audio recording of what occurred does not mean that the absence of verbal activity (which on the evidence we must take to be the fact) rendered the physical acts of the respondents any less threatening or not threatening at all. 
     
      
    45 In my opinion her Honour was in error to the extent that she relied upon these matters as an available basis to reduce the objective seriousness of these offences to a position beyond the Henry guideline judgment. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    46 Her Honour also treated the respondents' bail conditions over approximately 11 months, including daily reporting and non-association with one another, including at sporting activities, as reducing the matter below the Henry guidelines. Henry is in fact silent concerning the bail conditions that may have been imposed on the type of young offender that it was considering. The Crown submitted that that silence did not somehow provide a basis upon which to assume that there was for that reason a marked difference between the sufficiently common category of case to which the guideline applied and a case where onerous bail conditions have been imposed in a way that permitted a departure from the guideline. The Crown contended that the silence simply meant that ordinary sentencing principles would apply in respect of matters not specifically mentioned. 
     
      
    47 Ordinary sentencing principles would not justify reduction of an otherwise appropriate penalty because the offenders were on bail for 11 months and subject to the conditions mentioned. The Crown referred to the remarks of Latham J in Dieguez v R [2008] NSWCCA 147 at [21]–[22] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[21] A further feature of the applicant's subjective case that was not taken into account by the judge, in the sense that it did not feature in the course of his remarks on sentence, was the fact that the applicant had been on bail for a period of 11 months, during which time he was subject to a residential condition and daily reporting conditions. The applicant relies upon the decisions of this Court in  
        R v Keyte 
         CCA 26 March 1986 and  
        R v Rajapaski  
        [2001] NSWCCA 126 to support the proposition that a state of conditional liberty, involving constraints to the applicant's freedom of movement, should result in some mitigation of penalty.  
         
         
        [22] It is important to place the comments in  
        Keyte 
         and  
        Rajapaski  
        in context. In  
        Keyte 
         there was a two and a half year delay between the applicant's arrest and sentence. In  
        Rajapaski  
        there was almost a four year delay between the applicant's arrest and sentence. By way of contrast, the passage of 11 months between the date of arrest (but for five days) and the jury's verdict of guilty represents a relatively speedy resolution of the applicant's fate. In my view, the applicant was not entitled to any mitigation of an otherwise appropriate penalty because of his bail conditions."" 
        
       
      
    48 I do not consider that the respondents' bail conditions are relevant to an inquiry concerning the application of the Henry guidelines at all. They are certainly not referred to in the judgment. The conditions upon or under which offenders are released on bail are many and varied and the extent to which any standard or usual range of conditions could be assembled as normal or not onerous would be limited. In one sense, except in the case of the most extremely onerous conditions, such as those involving house arrest or de facto home detention, or the continuance of the onerous bail conditions for an unusually long time, there is little that attracts favourable consideration to the grant of bail as a factor warranting amelioration of an otherwise appropriate penalty. There is every reason to give credit for time served on remand but that is not in any way comparable with conditional liberty. 
     
      
    49 Her Honour was in error to take this matter into account in a way that permitted or warranted a departure from Henry in the present case. 
     
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    50 During the course of her remarks on sentence her Honour observed ""none of these young offenders committed this offence as a result of a serious ongoing addiction to drugs and in order to satisfy that addiction"". Her Honour also said, ""I also take into account the subjective circumstances surrounding each of these prisoners which it seems to me distinguishes them somewhat from the subjective circumstances of those referred to in the Henry guideline"". However, none of the guideline factors includes a reference to offenders who have a serious ongoing drug addiction. There was therefore no basis for a conclusion that there was a ""marked difference"" between each respondent's case and the guidelines. It was therefore not appropriate to distinguish Henry on such a ground. According to the Crown's submissions, the practical result of this error was that the lack of a drug addiction had been inappropriately taken into consideration in reducing the starting point for the sentences with the respondents being credited with an additional allowance for their excellent prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    51 Without in any way wishing to be dogmatic about it there is a respectable argument that serious addiction to illicit drugs, and the need through illegal means to acquire funds to purchase them, would be more likely to explain the commission of the present offences than would otherwise be the case. The sanguine commission of armed robbery does not to my mind appear any less serious because the perpetrators were unaffected and uninfluenced by the ravages of a drug dependency. The regular deliberations and procedures of the Drug Court recognise the need for special solutions for the treatment of drug dependant offenders. Her Honour was in error to adopt an approach that gave credit to the respondents in the circumstances of the present case for their absence of addiction. Henry expressly suggests no such approach and none should be implied. 
     
      
    Ground 4 
     
      
    52 The Crown accepted that the respondents co-operated with the police and did so at an early stage. However, they did not turn themselves in until police had visited the home of one of them three days after the date of the offences. The Crown contended that her Honour erroneously mistook the facts and treated the mistaken facts as matters to be taken into account in mitigation. 
     
      
    53 With respect to Ground 4 the respondents contended in effect that her Honour's remark was ""off the cuff"" and not intended to be taken literally. This approach seems to me to miss the point. Howsoever described, the fact is that if her Honour was intending to suggest that the respondents should be given the benefit of having surrendered to the police at the earliest opportunity and in particular in circumstances where the prospect, let alone the likelihood, of their apprehension had not materialised, she was mistaken in that regard.  
     
      
    54 It is not to my mind an exercise involving exquisite subtlety to appreciate that an unprovoked and guileless surrender says more about an offender's contrition and remorse, and is more relevant to considerations of mitigation, than a latter day confession made in the shadow of approaching detection. The delay of three days was certainly small. However, the competing inferences are fairly blunt and were clearly apparent on the facts of the present case. This is not the same thing as recognising that the respondents were entitled to, and were given, an unchallenged discount of 15 per cent for their early pleas of guilty. It will be recalled that one of the characteristics of the class considered in Henry was that there was a plea of guilty. Presumably her Honour gave a discount below the sentences that she would otherwise have imposed because of the timing of the pleas. 
     
      
    55 The issue is to some extent minor in the scheme of things. I would not have considered in the absence of other factors that her Honour's remarks amounted to an error warranting intervention by this Court in a Crown appeal.  
     
      
    Ground 5 
     
      
    56 Whilst a decision whether or not to accumulate sentences in relation to multiple offences is an exercise of discretion, it is a discretion to be exercised in accordance with established principle. It is not wholly unconstrained. The effective overall sentence must be a proper period of incarceration having regard to the total criminality involved: see R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [70]. In Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57, (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said, ""[a] judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well, of course, as questions of totality"". 
     
      
    57 Her Honour determined that there would be ""an overall term of imprisonment of two years in each case"". She found that each of the three cases was ""truly exceptional"" and determined that each of the sentences be suspended. Any accumulation of the sentences would have precluded the possibility of suspension: s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    58 Her Honour referred to this issue in her remarks on sentence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am conscious that there are two offences for which I must sentence each of the offenders. It is true that taken strictly, the second offence involving [the customer] is slightly less serious in terms of its objective seriousness because he cannot be properly classified as vulnerable. However, each of these offences was committed within the same sixty seconds to two minutes. Each of them represents the commission, in effect, of one offence and it seems to me there is little to be gained in trying to impose a different sentence for each to take into account the fact that one is slightly less serious than the other.  
        Because they are part of the one criminal enterprise nonetheless, the sentences should be served concurrently 
        ."" 
        
       
      
    59 The Crown contended that the italicised portion of the passage just quoted was erroneous and that her Honour's discretion miscarried because she failed to take into account the fact that whether as a matter relevant to the question of concurrence or otherwise there were two victims. In R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38], Simpson J said, with respect to a challenge to sentences that were partially cumulative: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[38] In my opinion, it was not only well open to his Honour to accumulate one sentence upon the other two; I doubt that would have been correct not to do so. There were, in fact, three separate offences committed, even though all were committed as part of the same event. In this context the Crown appropriately reminded the Court of the purposes of sentencing set out in s3A of the  
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
        . The first purpose so specified is ensuring adequate punishment for crime; others here relevant include crime prevention by deterrence, denunciation, making an offender accountable, and recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community. To fail to accumulate, at least partially, may well be seen as a failure to acknowledge the harm done to those individual victims. I would reject this ground of the application."" 
        
       
      
    60 To similar effect in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [52], Hall J helpfully summarised the relevant principles. The Crown submitted that the totality of the criminality in both offences could not be wholly encompassed in the sentence imposed for one only of the offences. This is what has occurred. Her Honour's failure in the circumstances to impose sentences that were at least partially accumulated is in the Crown's submission one additional factor that has led to the imposition of an overall sentence that is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    61 There were two discrete offences involving separate victims. One of the victims, the shopkeeper, was the sort of victim in a vulnerable position expressly contemplated in Henry. The other victim, the customer, was not in the class of vulnerable victims expressly contemplated in Henry. Even so, from what one can see of him on the CCTV footage, he was apparently unarmed, dressed in insubstantial clothing, and of slight build. The CCTV footage depicts the robbery of the shopkeeper but not that of the customer. The robberies occurred almost simultaneously and if not simultaneously they were only separated by a matter of seconds. Her Honour was clearly of the view that they were both part of the same course of criminal conduct so as to warrant little or no accumulation. As discussed above, this is contrary to the approach highlighted in cases such as R v Wilson (supra) and R v XX (supra). Moreover, in the particular circumstances of this case, the principle of totality effectively mandates that some accumulation of the sentences would be required in the event that this Court were otherwise minded to resentence the respondents.  
     
      
    62 This putative error is not to my mind determinative of this appeal. On one view her Honour's decision not to accumulate the sentences for the separate offences preserved for her the ability to impose sentences of two years for all offences that could still be wholly suspended. Any accumulation of those sentences, even to a minor degree, would have made that impossible. However, even assuming that the way in which her Honour's discretion was exercised in this regard could not be criticised, the failure to impose a custodial sentence amounted to a fundamental miscarriage of her sentencing discretion. This is because her Honour recognised, but failed to give meaningful effect to, the objective seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    Ground 6 
     
      
    63 The principles enunciated in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54;  (2000) 202 CLR 321 are well known. In appellate review of sentencing it will commonly be the case that the appellate court's authority to intervene will derive from a conclusion that the resulting order is so disproportionate to the matter to which it relates as to afford the foundation for concluding that in some way the exercise of the powers of the primary judge had miscarried. In the present case the Crown submitted that the disproportion arises from manifest inadequacy, both in terms of length and the fact of suspension. 
     
      
    64 Her Honour remarked as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""On the basis of those findings it seems to me that, leaving aside the question of discounts that are available, these offences committed by these offenders fall below the circumstances referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the  
        Henry 
         guideline case."" 
        
       
      
    65 It was in those circumstances that her Honour commenced with a starting point of three years discounted by 35 per cent to allow for the pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities, thereby arriving at a sentence of 2 years for each offence. Her Honour found that each offender's case was truly exceptional and determined to suspend the sentences. As already noted, her Honour ordered that they should be served concurrently. 
     
      
    66 The Crown submitted that the discretion miscarried at what was described as ""a fundamental level"" when her Honour undervalued the gravity of the offences viewed objectively. It was contended that there were no matters that diminished the seriousness of the offences so that they could in any way be considered as falling below the guideline principles. 
     
      
    67 Her Honour appears also to have found that the ""impaired judgment"" of each of the offenders to which Dr Jacmon adverted was evident to some extent in the commission of the offences. The Crown submitted that to the extent that she did so it should be given little weight. This was because the respondents acknowledged their respective willing involvement in the offences. 
     
      
    68 Her Honour's description of the offences as ""serious"" does not correspond to the imposition of sentences that reflect that description. The courts have for some considerable time enunciated clearly a policy that armed robbery is to be treated as a very serious criminal offence. In R v Stefanovski (Court of Criminal Appeal, 9 June 1994, unreported) the Court cited the remarks of Carruthers J in R v Broxham (Court of Criminal Appeal, 3 April 1986, unreported) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The prevalence of the offence in respect of which the applicant was sentenced is a matter of grave social concern…It is now well recognised that the victims of such armed robberies or attempted armed robberies may suffer devastating psychological damage consequent upon the trauma necessarily involved with the commission of such offences. In these circumstances sentencing judges would be recreant to the trust which the community places in them, if they were not to impose sentences consistent with the seriousness and prevalence of such offences."" 
        
       
      
    69 In R v Spiero (1979) 22 SASR 543, King CJ said at 548-9: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It must be made clear beyond misunderstanding that when a person engages in robbery while armed with a weapon he can expect when apprehended and convicted a long period in prison. Armed robbery is a crime which leaves little scope for leniency even when mitigating factors are present."" 
        
       
      
    70 The Chief Justice in Henry (supra) also said this at [99]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[99] … Armed robbery is not simply a crime against property. It is a crime against persons. Furthermore, the fear engendered by the perpetrator of this crime, together with the continued adverse effects on its victims, establish armed robbery to be serious crime which requires condign punishment."" 
        
       
      
    71 In R v Chamma [2009] NSWCCA 92, a Crown appeal involving the robbery of a convenience store by co-offenders late on a Saturday evening, the Court allowed the appeal, quashed the sentence of periodic detention and re-sentenced the respondent to full-time custody. Buddin J said at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[21] The Crown submitted that notwithstanding the respondent's reduced culpability as a principal in the second degree and as someone who did not know of the use, or intended use of the knife, a sentence of full-time custody was nevertheless called for. The Crown relied upon this Court's decision in  
        R v Goundar 
         (2001) 127 A Crim R 331, in which Wood CJ at CL with whom other members of the Court agreed, referred to  
        R v Govinden 
         (1999) 106 A Crim R 314 and went on to say:  
         
          
           
          [a]s the Court there recognised it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that persons who commit armed robberies, and I would add those who aid and abet those offences, should not receive sentences involving at least some period of full-time custody. (at par 40)"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    72 The present offences were aggravated by having been committed in company: s 21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; Henry at [170]; R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292, (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 at [28]; R v House [2005] NSWCCA 88 at [10]. In addition the courts have expressed strong views about the use of knives: see, for example, Street CJ in R v Underhill (Court of Criminal Appeal, 9 May 1986, unreported) indicating that '[t]he knife is held in universal abhorrence within the community, and this view is shared by the criminal courts"". 
     
      
    73 Nor is the respondents' relative youth of particular significance. As the Chief Justice said in R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142, (2002) 54 NSWLR 300 at [74]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[74] Armed robberies of the character involved in the present proceedings, committed by young persons, generally with an addiction problem, are so prevalent that the objective of general deterrence is entitled to significant weight in the process of sentencing for this offence, notwithstanding the youth of the typical offender. (See  
        R v Pham 
         (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135;  
        R v Tran 
         (1999) NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[11];  
        R v AEM Snr 
         [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[102].) 
        
       
      
    74 The question of the suspension of a sentence was considered in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [32], where Howie J said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[32] Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate."" 
        
       
      
    75 It has been repeatedly said that a sentence other than one of full-time custody should only be imposed in cases of armed robbery in exceptional circumstances: Henry (supra) at [113]. The Crown contended that no proper application of the subjective circumstances to the particular facts of the present case would produce a different result. The Crown emphasised the remarks of Mason P in R v Horne [1999] NSWCCA 391 at [15]. 
     
      
    76 The respondents emphasised that her Honour revealed her process of reasoning in relation to her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences in the following passage from her remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In terms of assessing the objective seriousness of this offence I find that it is clearly not the most serious example of armed robbery given this combination of factors but nor is it at the bottom of the scale. Whichever way it is characterised on the scale, they are nonetheless serious offences. The sentence should send a message of general deterrence into the community of the type referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v Henry 
        . In relation to that guideline decision I accept that for offences of armed robbery, where the offence fits into the general categories referred to in that decision, a sentencing court should be looking to a starting point of an overall term of imprisonment as somewhere between four and five years with the appropriate necessary non-parole period. Many of the factors present in the  
        Henry 
         decision are present here. Each of the offenders is young. Each of them, in this case, has no previous criminal history. They were armed with a knife. There was very little property taken, or little property of value taken."" 
        
       
      
    77 The respondents endorsed the factors to which the Crown refers as matters constituting the first five grounds of appeal as differentiating factors in this case. They drew upon the remarks of the Chief Justice in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[37] Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised."" 
        
       
      
    78 The point of difference between the respondents and the Crown is not the question of whether her Honour's characterisation of the seriousness of the offences was open to her. The Crown does not disagree with her Honour's assessment of the offences as serious offences, even described as not the most serious examples of armed robbery. Nor for that matter does the Crown disagree with her Honour's characterisation of the offences as not at the bottom of the scale of seriousness. The simple and fundamental point of difference between the Crown and the respondents is the manner in which her Honour purported to give effect to these otherwise uncontroversial descriptions. 
     
      
    79 In my opinion her Honour failed to give effect to the matters that she recognised and identified as the proper characteristics of the present offences. Her Honour's description of the seriousness of the offences on the one hand, and the ultimate sentencing result on the other hand, are discordant and the sentences imposed by her Honour cannot be shielded from intervention by this Court. 
     
      
    80 There is no doubt that her Honour's thoughtful and compassionate approach to sentencing was manifest in her remarks on sentence and also during the course of the sentencing hearing when her Honour's comments bear witness to the difficult task that confronted her. For example, her Honour said the following shortly before adjourning the sentencing hearing on 13 February 2009: 
     
      
       
        
        ""…the other thing that needs to be said is that the easiest thing for me to do in this sentence matter, which would make life very straightforward for me, easy, completely unappealable would be to sentence them each to four years with a two year non-parole period and put them inside today and say come out in two years time because that would be with about four pages of reasons which would be pretty straightforward and I could recite off the top of my head right now, the easiest thing I could do and nobody could possibly complain about that because that would be entirely within guidelines. 
         
         
        If a more considered approach is required and it's fair to say then on behalf of each of the offenders their counsel has urged that when everything is taken into account I would find it possible to sentence them overall to terms of imprisonment that don't exceed two years and then for a whole series of reasons I would find it appropriate to suspend that so that they don't have to go back to prison. Now what members of the public understand is that even if I think that's a good idea, I'm not necessarily (a) allowed to do it and (b) whatever I do has to be done, considered, with reasons and in accordance with the law. If I were to do it any other way, not only would I not be doing my job properly but the DDP next week would put on a notice of appeal, go straight up to the Court of Criminal Appeal and they'd say she didn't do the job properly, go to gaol for two years and come out some time in 2011. So the easiest thing for me to do would be that, but that's not how I work and I'm going to spend some time thinking about which is going to take longer than four o'clock this afternoon. I still may send them to gaol for somewhere between eighteen months and two years with a parole period at the end of it…And then I need to think about how I'm going to express myself so that everybody knows where they stand and why I came to the decision that I did."" 
        
       
      
    81 This material is naturally of only limited utility. In referring to what passed between her Honour and counsel I take note of the observations of Grove J in Daniels v R [2007] NSWCCA 372 and in particular the several passages extracted from the cases to which his Honour drew attention at pars [10] to [13] of that decision. 
     
      
    82 The Henry guidelines are no more and no less than that. They are indicative of the approach that courts should take in cases that are similar. The case itself recognises, and subsequent cases have emphasised, that there may be novel and unprecedented factors that will cause a sentencing tribunal to impose a sentence closer to one or other of the ends of the range considered in Henry to be the appropriate range, and that the type and character of such factors is not closed. As the Chief Justice said in that case at pars [126] and [169]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[126] The determination of an appropriate sentencing guideline for offences against s97(1) must commence with a recognition that the objective and subjective factors relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion, may vary over a wide range. See eg  
        Brown 
         (1989) 17 NSWLR 472 at 473-474. As I said in  
        Jurisic 
         with respect to s52A. 
         
          
           
          'The nature of the offence is not such that the Court can devise a simple table in which indicative penalties are linked to a quantitative measure of the offence … What can be done, however, in case of an offence concerning a wide range of conduct which varies qualitatively rather than quantitatively, is to indicate in a general way the kind of case which would usually require a particular kind or level of sentence, whilst acknowledging that there will always be exceptional cases'.

        [169] Aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range as this Court's prior decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point."" 
        
       
      
    83 Her Honour failed to impose sentences that reflected her own accurate description of the objective seriousness of the offences. They were not the most serious armed robbery offences. They were not the least serious armed robbery offences. They were toward the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness for such offences. In my opinion her Honour's sentencing discretion would not have miscarried if she had sentenced the respondents to non-parole terms of imprisonment of 2 years, as her own comments in the course of the sentencing hearing revealed. I do not consider that her Honour's sentencing discretion would have miscarried in a way that would warrant the intervention of this Court on a Crown appeal if the only complaint were that the sentences of imprisonment imposed by her Honour for each offence had not been at least partially accumulated. I do consider that the imposition of sentences that do not result in the respondents serving some period of incarceration amounts to the imposition of sentences that are manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    84 The respondents drew understandable attention to the well known principles that apply to Crown appeals enunciated by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70], (2002) 71 NSWLR 692 at [70]. 
     
      
    85 In R v Reynolds [2004] NSWCCA 51 at [26] Simpson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[26] I am satisfied, however, that counsel for the respondent is correct in his contention that the ultimate question is whether the sentence has been shown to be manifestly inadequate. That does not exclude the identification of specific error, where it can be shown, that may explain how manifest inadequacy came about. Identification of specific error alone is not sufficient to warrant upholding a Crown appeal; the Crown must go further and show that (possibly in the light of, or as a result of, the error) a manifestly inadequate sentence was imposed."" 
        
       
      
    86 The respondents also contended that, in the absence of a well-documented error by the sentencing judge, the original discretion would only be interfered with in a compelling case. Successful Crown appeals should be rare in that category of case where no particular error can be identified: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. However, as will be apparent, I consider that her Honour erred in the ways I have described so that these cases do not apply.  
     
      
    87 I am mindful that it is not sufficient that this Court would have imposed a more severe sentence: R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 78. Moreover, this Court retains a lively discretion to refuse to intervene: R v Holder; R v Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 255-256, (1983) 13 A Crim R 375 at 384-385. See also R v Tortell; R v Tsegay [2007] NSWCCA 313 at [59].  
     
      
    88 The respondents emphasised the sentiments so forcefully enunciated in Everett v R [1994] HCA 49; (1994) 181 CLR 295 at [13] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[13]… As has been said above, the deep-rooted notions of fairness which underlie the common law principle against double jeopardy require that a court of criminal appeal approach an application by the Crown for leave to appeal against sentence on the basis that such leave should only be granted in the rare and exceptional case. Indeed, that approach was particularly appropriate in the present cases where the effect of the sentencing judge's orders had been that each of the appellants had been released from custody and had been permitted and encouraged to resume his place in the community and to set out on the path of rehabilitation."" 
        
       
      
    89 The respondents also submitted that the Crown took a different approach on the proper sentence on appeal to the approach taken below so that the Court's discretion not to intervene was attracted by the principles discussed in R v Tait (1979) 24 ALR 473 at 477. The passage relied upon is not specified but is presumably the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown has been said not to be concerned with sentence (see, eg Lawrence J in  
        Paprika Ltd v Board of Trade [1944] 1 All ER 372 at 374; [1944] 1 KB 327 at 332) 
        , but when a statutory right of appeal is conferred upon the Crown, that proposition must be more precisely defined. It remains true that the Crown is required to make its submissions as to sentence fairly and in an even-handed manner, and that the Crown does not, as an adversary, press the sentencing court for a heavy sentence. The Crown has a duty to the court to assist it in the task of passing sentence by an adequate presentation of the facts, by an appropriate reference to any special principles of sentencing which might reasonably be thought to be relevant to the case in hand, and by a fair testing of the defendant's case so far as it appears to require it. If the proposition that the Crown is not concerned with sentence was ever construed as absolving the Crown from this duty, it cannot be so construed when a Crown right of appeal against sentence is conferred. The Crown is under a duty to assist the court to avoid appealable error. The performance of that duty to the court ensures that the defendant knows the nature and extent of the case against him, and thus has a fair opportunity of meeting it. A failure by the Crown to discharge that duty may not only contribute to appealable error affecting the sentence, but may tend to deprive the defendant of a fair opportunity of meeting a case which might ultimately be made on appeal. It would be unjust to a defendant, whose freedom is in jeopardy for the second time, to consider on appeal a case made against him on a new basis - a basis which he might have successfully challenged had the case against him been fully presented before the sentencing court. As McClemens CJ at CL said in  
        R v Jacombe 
        , delivering the judgment of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal (19 December 1974, unreported): ""… we would not seem to encourage any system which meant that cases were brought here under s 5 
        D 
         of the Criminal Appeal Act on bases which were not argued before the judge below.""  
         
         
        Although the existence of error is the common ground which entitles the appellate court to intervene in appeals by the Crown and by a defendant (cf  
        R v Butler 
          
        [1971] VR 892 
        ;  
        R v Liekefett; Ex parte Attorney-General 
         [1973] Qd R 355), there would be few cases where the appellate court would intervene on an appeal against sentence to correct an alleged error by increasing the sentence if the Crown had not done what was reasonably required to assist the sentencing judge to avoid the error, or if the defendant were unduly prejudiced in meeting for the first time on appeal the true case against him."" 
        
       
      
    90 Counsel for the respondents went as far as to suggest that the Crown had failed in that duty ""to the court to assist [the court] in the task of passing sentence by an adequate presentation of the facts, by an appropriate reference to any special principles of sentencing which might reasonably be thought to be relevant to the case in hand, and by a fair testing of the defendant's case so far as it appears to require it"". When this Court sought elaboration of that submission by reference to the appropriate transcript references from the sentencing proceedings that contained the Crown's alleged shortcomings, counsel for the respondents provided a series of transcript references. Some of these references were to passages from the Crown's submissions and were accompanied by the re-occurring editorial assertion that counsel for the respondents had not been interrupted by the Crown when the specified submissions had been made.  
     
      
    91 That submission is puzzling on its face, but is no doubt explained by the fact that on the argument of the appeal it became apparent that there were occasions when her Honour interrupted the Crown part way through a submission, and to that extent interfered with the Crown's ability to provide assistance, in a way that was no fault of the Crown. I should also make it clear that by putting the matter in that way I am not implying that her Honour was at fault. Subject to the requirement of allowing a party to put its case, which no one suggests was breached here, a judge is entitled to cut short submissions that the judge is not finding helpful. The answer of substance to the respondents' submission is that none of the nominated references to the transcript contains any material upon the basis of which it could be said that the Crown below had adopted a position that is in tension with the Crown's present appeal to this Court. A failure to interrupt an opponent's submission is not a basis for asserting that it has thereby been accepted.  
     
      
    92 A review of the transcript of the sentencing proceedings confirms that there was a discussion between the Crown and her Honour on a variety of topics. Her Honour's contribution to that debate to some extent exceeded that of the Crown. 
     
      
    93 The facts as presented by the Crown were not in dispute. Counsel for the respondents at the sentencing hearing expressly acknowledged this. Written submissions on the Henry guidelines were also provided to her Honour. 
     
      
    94 The Crown acknowledged that the respondents made what she described as ""full and frank admissions"" as soon as they were spoken to by the police. Her Honour referred to the fact that the Crown case was strong and commented upon the relevance of the early pleas of guilty in that context. The Crown responded with the statement, ""I think in this case nobody can take away from them that they've been willing to accept their responsibility for this offence since the very start"". Her Honour noted that this was of ""considerable utilitarian value"". 
     
      
    95 The Crown subsequently made the following submission: 
     
      
       
        
        ""…my submissions are really quite general, your Honour hears probably more than your Honour would care to hear, the Crown's representatives talking to you about Henry and I can only say – well you know I accept that it doesn't provide a fetter on your Honour's discretion, it was never meant to do so, it just provides a general starting point. There's no question in my mind and I will submit to your Honour that this is a case that factually and objectively falls within the general guideline judgment, you know it's all those things …"". 
        
       
      
    96 The Crown also drew to her Honour's attention that there were five offenders in the shop, which she described as ""frightening"". She described the offences by saying that ""objectively it's obviously a very serious matter"" and that ""it falls – as a starting point objectively within the Henry guideline judgment, the only question is where …"". 
     
      
    97 The Crown later said this to her Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… the difficulty I have is I don't think I've heard my friend submitting to your Honour that your first finding shouldn't be that a full time custodial penalty, I think she accepts that that's the case but she's been moved on to ask that your Honour consider suspending that. My difficulty is that that means that if your Honour has to find a two year sentence …"". 
        
       
      
    98 The respondents criticise the Crown for having made no submissions about mitigating factors. However, when counsel for the respondents had put all arguable mitigating factors, it was not the responsibility of the Crown to repeat them. 
     
      
    99 Following a discussion concerning the force and effect of certain subjective matters her Honour observed that the respondents were ""very different people socially now than they were when they were arrested"". The Crown responded by saying, ""[b]ut ultimately the question is whether those factors are sufficient to bring this into the exceptional case scenario"". 
     
      
    100 Finally, the Crown's concluding remarks at the sentencing hearing included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""My ultimate submission to your Honour is that my view is that the objective seriousness of the matter does require a full-time custodial penalty and where it goes from there really is going to have to be a matter for your Honour."" 
        
       
      
    101 The proposition that the Crown had failed in its duty was in my opinion an intemperate submission and should not have been made. Her Honour's comments recorded at par [80] demonstrate that she was in no doubt about the boundaries of her discretion. Nothing that her Honour decided was a function of the Crown's breach of duty. The Crown did not lead her Honour into error upon the basis of anything that was done or left undone.  
     
      
    Re-sentence 
     
      
    102 The respondents read a series of affidavits upon the basis that this Court would take the matters deposed to into consideration in the event that it determined to re-sentence the respondents. It is both instructive and important that that material is set out in full. 
     
      
    103 Mr Jebara swore an affidavit dated 3 June 2009 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""2. Since the date of the District Court sentencing by Judge Tupman on 6 March 2009, I present the following which summarises the day to day events that have taken place in my life: 
         
          
           
          (a) I continue to be employed as a subcontractor/cement renderer and handyman. I am currently earning the sum of $200 per day working 5-6 days per week. 
           
           
          (b) I have, since the last court hearing, been in a relationship with [my girlfriend]. I state and confirm that our relationship is very strong and I intend to move to the country and live with [her] and her family who own a large farm. I will be assisting her father at the farm with all aspects of farming work. I state that [my girlfriend's] family is in the business of growing figs and selling same as wholesalers to various outlets. 
           
           
          (c) I state and confirm that my family continues to support me and myself and my family hope to bring to an end this matter which has caused all of us a certain degree of anxiety and depression. I regret having committed this offence so strongly that this matter continues to disturb me and my sleep. 
           
           
          (d) I confirm that I dread the thought of going to jail as I have started now to pick my life up and I am currently looking after my siblings as my mother, elder sister and brother have gone overseas and will be there for approximately 3 months. 
           
           
          (e) I have great faith in the justice system and hope that this matter will be dealt with without having to disturb the earlier sentencing decision of Judge Tupman so that I can progress with my life without any further hiccups. 
           
           
          (f) I have recently received a letter from the NSW Department of Corrective Services that I no longer need to keep in contact with Mr Nowrot, my probation and parole officer… 
          
         
         
        3. Immediately after the sentencing I was pleased that the matter was over and considered that I have the chance now to put the past behind me and proceed picking up my life and to work for a better future. However ever since the DPP appeal was filed I have been under a lot of anxiety, depression and have had difficulties coping as I am so sorry that the initial incident took place and hope to put this matter behind me and move forward. 
         
         
        4. I state and confirm that my mother and the rest of my family were also pleased after the sentencing of 6 March 2009 that the matter was over… 
         
         
        5. I confirm that my whole family including my wife remain supportive of me notwithstanding the offence I committed and hope to see this matter finalised so that I may move to create a better future for myself and my family. 
         
         
        6. I state and confirm that I am currently employed… 
         
         
        7. I state and confirm that even though both Salman and Khader have pleaded guilty I reiterate my undertaking and commitment to give evidence against both of these men should I be required to do so."" 
        
       
      
    104 Mr Jajou swore an affidavit dated 4 June 2009 in the following relevant terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""2. Since the date of the District Court sentencing by Judge Tupman on 6 March 2009, I present the following which summarises the day to day events that have taken place in my life: 
         
          
           
          (a) I continue to be employed by Sunset Smash Repairs as a spray painter. I am currently earning the approximate amount of $450 gross per week as an apprentice labourer. 
           
           
          (b) I continue to live with my wife Zena and do not yet have any children. However we are presently planning on having children. 
           
           
          (c) My wife is currently employed with the Marconi Club and earns approximately $500 per week. 
           
           
          (d) My wife and I, as newlyweds, try to share the every day living requirements in the hope of establishing a sound family life. 
           
           
          (e) I confirm and state that since my initial arrest for the offences subject to these proceedings I have not committed any other offences whatsoever nor do I have any plans or intentions to do so. I once again confirm that the initial offence was a huge mistake for which I continue to suffer. Since the last sentencing date I have been very anxious and worried because of the appeal and the upcoming hearing at the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
          
         
         
        3. I was, until recently, under the supervision of Probation & Parole but however I have received a letter from the service advising me that I no longer have to continue to report to my probation & parole officer Mr Henry Nowrot… 
         
         
        4. The whole case has been very long, very hard and very expensive. I was starting to plan for my future when I heard that the case was appealed. My mother fell sick when she knew and had high blood pressure and was admitted to hospital. 
         
         
        5. I know that this case is not over but I think I have suffered enough and pray to God that this matter will finally come to an end without me going to jail. 
         
         
        I am standing by my promise to give evidence against both Salman and Khader the other two people involved in the incident. 
         
         
        6. I am sorry for having done the robbery and ask that I am not sent back to jail as I have no one to look after my wife. I send my apologies to the court and the victims."" 
        
       
      
    105 Mr Lafta swore an affidavit on 4 June 2009 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""2. Since the date of the District Court sentencing by Judge Tupman on 6 March 2009, I present the following which summarises the day to day events that have taken place in my life: 
         
          
           
          (a) I continue to be employed by my father in a trolley business known as Trolley Service. I am currently earning the sum of $700.00 gross per week. I work 7 days per week from 8.00am until 7.00pm. 
           
           
          (b) I am presently married and I live with my wife at my above mentioned address. 
           
           
          (c) My wife is not currently working as we are trying to have children. I confirm that on or about approximately 4 months ago my wife was pregnant but unfortunately had a miscarriage due to a fall down the stairs. 
           
           
          (d) I state and confirm that I have recently applied to Liverpool TAFE to start a Business Management Course. The course will start in July 2009. The course will go for approximately 2 years and I will be attending at the night sessions. I will be attending 3 nights per week and whilst doing so I will continue to work for my father in the trolley business in order to survive and sustain my family. 
           
           
          (e) I state and confirm that since the last offence committed by me on 6 April 2008, I have not committed any offences whatsoever nor do I intend to do so. 
           
           
          (f) I have also been complying with all directives of Probation & Parole and have been liaising with my parole officer Mr Henry Nowrot of the Liverpool District Office. I have recently received a letter from the NSW Department of Corrective Services… that I no longer need to keep in contact with Mr Nowrot… 
          
         
         
        3. I was relieved after the last court date but was very disappointed that the case was appealed. Since then I have been feeling bad and have been stressed out. I am really scared as I do not want to go to jail. I was in jail after the incident for about fourteen (14) days. It was really horrible being in jail. 
         
         
        4. I state that even though both Salman and Khader have pleaded guilty I reiterate my undertaking and commitment to give evidence against both of these men should I be required to do so. 
         
         
        5. Finally, I now enjoy work and am thankful for the help my family has given me and ask that this case be over without going to jail."" 
        
       
      
    106 There is no doubt that the imposition of a sentence that requires any of the respondents to serve time in custody will be distressing and unpleasant for them and for their families. The fact that they did not receive a sentence that had this result in the first place will have made the continuation of their original concerns about such a sentence an added burden for each of them. The respondents drew attention to some remarks I quoted in R v Tortell; R v Tsegay (supra at [59]). I have reviewed that decision and the matters that it emphasised. It included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[54] As I have said on other occasions, uncontroversially, the question of what is, and what is not, a proper sentence in any particular case is a matter upon which minds will invariably differ. For example, in  
        R v Burns 
         [2007] NSWCCA 228, I expressed the following opinion at par [36]: 
         
          
           
          ""[36] There is often a fine line between those cases in which a sentencing judge can be shown to have failed properly to exercise a discretion reposed in her or him, having regard to the relevant legislative constraints and current judicial guidance, on the one hand, and those cases in which the discretion has patently been exercised in a way that balances and accommodates all the manifold competing circumstances and influences, on the other hand. Views on sentencing outcomes will almost always vary, depending significantly, although not exclusively, upon the perspective of the commentator. "" 
          
         
        
       
      
    107 However, his Honour McClellan CJ at CL also said this in that case at [9]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""9 ... Even accepting that the corporal violence was not of a high order the legislature has made plain that the offence of robbery is very serious. It will be only be in an exceptional case that some form of custodial sentence will not be appropriate when robbery is committed in circumstances of aggravation."" 
        
       
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    108 I do not consider that these offences fall within the category of exceptional cases to which his Honour was referring. Nor do I consider that there is a particularly fine line between the sentences imposed by her Honour and sentences of the type that would not have led her Honour's discretion to miscarry. I consider in all of the circumstances that the sentences imposed by her Honour were manifestly inadequate and that the respondents should each serve a period of imprisonment. A comparison with the guideline judgment reveals at least the following.  
     
      
    109 First, each of the respondents was a young offender and none had a criminal history at all or of any relevance. Objectively the respondents were wholly within this element of the guidelines. 
     
      
    110 Secondly, each of the respondents was armed with a knife or a meat cleaver, which were clearly capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
     
      
    111 Thirdly, there was a limited degree of planning. However, planning was not wholly absent in the sense that the offences were spontaneous, reactive and opportunistic. The premises had been (unsuccessfully) checked for the presence of CCTV and the weapons had been taken to the premises as earlier described. The planning was wholly inadequate to avoid detection. The respondents had their escape from the vicinity of the shop arranged to take place in vehicles that were driven away immediately following commission of the offences. 
     
      
    112 Fourthly there was a real threat of violence. On one view the actual violence was limited to the actions of Mr Jebara as he reached across the counter to take hold of the shop attendant. The CCTV footage suggests that what occurred aligns with the guideline judgment in this respect rather than anything else. 
     
      
    113 Fifthly, the victim of the first offence was a shopkeeper. The victim of the second offence was a customer. 
     
      
    114 Sixthly, the amount taken was small. 
     
      
    115 Finally, the respondents all pleaded guilty. They had done so when interviewed in the face of compelling CCTV footage that was unusually clear and uninterrupted by extraneous factors such as obscured views or inadequate lighting. 
     
      
    116 In my opinion it is not correct to observe, as her Honour observed, that these offences fell at the lower end of the Henry range. What her Honour may have been intending to convey was that these offences fell at the lower end of armed robbery offences as a whole. That is undoubtedly correct. However, the Henry guideline incorporates as a given that the offences are not as serious as many others that fall to be considered under the same provision. It is an error to discount the seriousness of offences for sentencing purposes by what amounts to a double counting of the ameliorating effects that are inherent in the Henry analysis. In my view this is what her Honour did.  
     
      
    117 Taking into account the principles that guide this Court in re-sentencing an offender in the case of a successful Crown appeal and the time that each offender has already spent in custody, I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
      In the matter of R v Fadi Jajou 
      :  
       
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Quash the sentences imposed upon the respondent Fadi Jajou by her Honour Tupman DCJ on 6 March 2009. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced on the first charge to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 June 2009 and expiring on 25 June 2010 with balance of term of 12 months commencing on 26 June 2010 and expiring on 25 June 2011 and on the second charge to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 December 2009 and expiring on 25 December 2010 with balance of term of 12 months commencing on 26 December 2010 and expiring on 25 December 2011. The effective non-parole period is therefore 18 months commencing on 26 June 2009 and expiring on 25 December 2010. 
       
       
      The earliest date upon which the respondent  
      Fadi Jajou 
       will be entitled to be released will be 25 December 2010. 
       
       
      In the matter of R v Maher Jebara:  
       
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Quash the sentences imposed upon the respondent Maher Jebara by her Honour Tupman DCJ on 6 March 2009. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced on the first charge to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 June 2009 and expiring on 25 June 2010 with balance of term of 12 months commencing on 26 June 2010 and expiring on 25 June 2011 and on the second charge to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 December 2009 and expiring on 25 December 2010 with balance of term of 12 months commencing on 26 December 2010 and expiring on 25 December 2011. The effective non-parole period is therefore 18 months commencing on 26 June 2009 and expiring on 25 December 2010. 
       
       
      The earliest date upon which the respondent  
      Maher Jebara 
       will be entitled to be released will be 25 December 2010. 
       
       
      In the matter of R v Sam Lafta 
      :  
       
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Quash the sentences imposed upon the respondent Sam Lafta by her Honour Tupman DCJ on 6 March 2009. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced on the first charge to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 June 2009 and expiring on 25 June 2010 with balance of term of 12 months commencing on 26 June 2010 and expiring on 25 June 2011 and on the second charge to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 26 December 2009 and expiring on 25 December 2010 with balance of term of 12 months commencing on 26 December 2010 and expiring on 25 December 2011. The effective non-parole period is therefore 18 months commencing on 26 June 2009 and expiring on 25 December 2010. 
       
       
      The earliest date upon which the respondent  
      Sam Lafta 
       will be entitled to be released will be 25 December 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 YOUNG JA: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: Following pleas of guilty, the Appellant, Saheen Thalari, was sentenced to terms of imprisonment at the Penrith District Court on 15 August 2008 with respect to firearms and drug supply offences. 
     
      
    3 Before this Court, he appeals against his conviction and sentence for an offence of unauthorised possession of a pistol contrary to s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996.  
     
      
       
      The Sentences 
       
      
    4 On 15 August 2008, the Appellant was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Count 1 - unauthorised possession of a pistol contrary to s.7(1)  
      Firearms Act 1996  
      (maximum penalty 14 years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years) - sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 5 September 2007, with a balance of term of one year and six months; 
       
       
      (b) Count 2 - possession of a loaded firearm in a public place contrary to s.93G(1)(a)(i)  
      Crimes Act 1900  
      (maximum penalty 10 years’ imprisonment) - sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 5 September 2007; 
       
       
      (c) Count 3 - supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s.25(1)  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
      (maximum penalty 15 years’ imprisonment) - sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months’ imprisonment commencing 5 March 2008. 
       
      
    5 The following offences were taken into account on a Form 1, in passing sentence on Count 1: 
     
      
       
      (a) Offence 1 - possess unregistered firearm (a .22 calibre pistol) contrary to s.36(1)  
      Firearms Act 1996 
      ; 
       
       
      (b) Offence 2 - possess ammunition without holding a licence contrary to s.65(3)  
      Firearms Act 1996 
      ; 
       
       
      (c) Offence 3 - supply prohibited drug (16.1 grams of cannabis leaf) contrary to s.25(1)  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
      ; 
       
       
      (d) Offence 4 - possess prohibited drug (1.57 grams of methylamphetamine) contrary to s.10(1)  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
      ; 
       
       
      (e) Offence 5 - goods in custody (cash in the sum of $565.00) contrary to s.527C(1)(c)  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      ; 
       
       
      (f) Offence 6 - having custody of a knife in a public place contrary to s.11C(1)(a)  
      Summary Offences Act 1988 
      . 
       
      
    6 The total effective sentence involved imprisonment for three years and six months with a non-parole period of two years, to date from 5 September 2007. The earliest date upon which the Appellant will be eligible for release on parole is 4 September 2009. The sentences for Counts 2 and 3 were entirely subsumed within the non-parole period fixed for Count 1. 
     
      
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    7 A Statement of Facts, which was tendered by consent at the sentencing hearing, revealed the following. 
     
      
    8 At about 4.58 pm on 5 September 2007, police were conducting perimeter patrols at the Richmond RAAF Base as part of operations during the APEC Summit. Whilst police were travelling on Pitt Street, Richmond, they observed a green Ford Falcon utility stopped at an intersection with the driver apparently reaching for his seatbelt. Police immediately recognised the Appellant as the driver of the vehicle. Suspecting that the driver was not licensed, police followed the vehicle to a home unit at Bowman Street, Richmond. They knocked on the door of the home unit, a woman answered the door and police saw the Appellant inside. Police searched him and found keys and 15 rounds of .22 calibre ammunition (Form 1, Offence 2).  
     
      
    9 Police searched the vehicle and found a Jonathan Arthur Ciener .22 calibre self-loading pistol (Count 1; Form 1, Offence 1) under the front driver’s seat which contained a magazine fitted with 10 .22 calibre long-range bullets. This firearm was loaded and ready to be discharged (Count 2). One of the police officers observed that on the rear right side of the pistol grip, a small identity lug had been removed, that lug ordinarily containing the serial number of the pistol.  
     
      
    10 The police officers also found $565.00 in cash in a wallet in the Appellant’s vehicle (Form 1, Offence 5). A further search of the Appellant revealed a black-handled lock knife clipped to the inside of his pants’ pocket (Form 1, Offence 6). The Appellant was taken into custody. 
     
      
    11 A further search of the Appellant’s vehicle revealed a small plastic resealable bag containing green vegetable matter (later analysed as cannabis). Also located in the vehicle was a black coffee tin containing a medium-sized plastic resealable bag, inside which was another medium-sized resealable bag containing green vegetable matter (later analysed as cannabis), and a further 10 small resealable bags containing cannabis. The total quantity of cannabis was 16.1 grams (Form 1, Offence 3). 
     
      
    12 Police also located within the black coffee tin a further tin containing two small resealable bags in which were found 19 green tablets with the stamped imprint of a butterfly, analysed as 3, 4 methylemedioxymethylamphetamine (“MDMA”) weighing 4.82 grams, with 10 of the tablets tested with a purity of 28.5% (Count 3). Police also located within the tin one small resealable bag containing a white-paste substance, analysed as 1.57 grams of methylamphetamine (Form 1, Offence 4).  
     
      
    13 Examination of a mobile phone located within the Appellant’s vehicle revealed several messages in the inbox section stating: 
     
      
    ·  “hey bro its Jonezy, can I get some green stuff off you”; 
     
      
    · “when you’re ready Sarge, Nigel has some interesting info about ace and is going out tonight and wants some pills if possible”, and  
     
      
    · “Nigel is here, he wants some pills”.  
     
      
       
      The Appellant was known by the nickname of  
      “Sarge” 
      . 
       
      
    14 The Appellant participated in an electronically recorded interview during which he admitted to possessing the knife, stating that he carried it for protection. He also admitted being in possession of the small tin containing ammunition, but denied any knowledge of the ammunition itself. He denied being the driver of the motor vehicle or being in the vehicle at any time during the day. He further denied any knowledge of the firearm or of prohibited drugs located within the vehicle. He admitted ownership of the mobile phone located within the vehicle, but denied any knowledge of the messages on the phone or their content. The Appellant stated that he was unemployed and had no form of income. 
     
      
    15 Further checks by police revealed that the Appellant was on bail for other matters at the time of his arrest. 
     
      
    16 The registered owner of the vehicle was the Appellant’s father, who attended Windsor Police Station and informed police that the Appellant was the custodian of the vehicle and that only he and the Appellant had keys to the vehicle. 
     
      
    17 Given the issues raised before this Court, it is appropriate to refer to aspects of the evidence before the District Court concerning the pistol. Senior Constable Thompson observed a black semi-automatic pistol with a brown handgrip lying on the driver’s seat of the Appellant’s vehicle. The slide of the pistol was closed and in a locked position and a magazine was fitted to it. He removed the magazine and observed that it contained .22 calibre rounds. A certificate of Senior Constable Dusting, of the Forensic Ballistics Investigation Section, described the pistol and ammunition in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Jonathan Arthur Ciener manufactured self loading pistol was test fired and is in working order. Three cartridges marked … were discharged in this exhibit for test purposes. It is capable of propelling, by means an explosive, a projectile that could inflict a lethal wound upon a human being. It is reasonably capable of being raised and fired by one hand and does not exceed the prescribed dimension of 65 cm in length. The exhibit … consists of a .22 long rifle calibre model 1911A1 slide and barrel manufactured by Jonathan Arthur Ciener fitted to a Replica Models Inc manufactured frame. The detachable box magazine has the capacity to hold ten .22 long rifle calibre cartridges. In my opinion the exhibit pistol … is a pistol as defined in section 4(1) of the Firearms Act 1996. 
        
       
       
        
        The 25 cartridges … are of Federal, Philippines, Remington and Winchester manufacture. They are designed for use in weapons chambered for .22 long rifle calibre cartridges and are suitable for use in the exhibit pistol. In my opinion, the exhibit cartridges … are ammunition as defined in section 4(1) of the Firearms Act 1996.” 
        
       
      
    18 Also in evidence were certificates under s.87 Firearms Act 1996 evidencing that the subject pistol had never been registered and that the Appellant was not, on 5 September 2007, the holder of a firearm’s licence or permit in New South Wales which authorised the possession or use of firearms. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    19 The Appellant was born in 1981 and was 26 years old at the time of the offences. 20 A pre-sentence report concerning the Appellant was before the District Court together with a report dated 2 October 2007 of Dr Dong Tran, psychiatrist, and a report dated 17 April 2008 of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist. 
     
      
    21 The Appellant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing, as did his sister.  
     
      
    22 The learned sentencing Judge recounted evidence concerning the Appellant’s history of drug abuse, including use of ecstasy and amphetamines. Reference was made to the reports of Dr Tran and Dr Nielssen in which diagnoses of schizophrenia were made.  
     
      
    23 Her Honour recounted the Appellant’s evidence concerning an assault upon him which led to his acquisition of the pistol and ammunition. Her Honour observed (ROS8-9): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender in evidence said he paid $2,000 for the items. He told Dr Nielssen he paid $500 for the pistol and the bullets. Either way that is a significant sum of money for someone who is unemployed to have ready access to and in addition to those sums he was found to have on him a further $565 at the time of his arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        He denies that he was in the business of supplying, however it flies in the face of the evidence of the quantities of cash he was able to access, that he was selling drugs just to support his habit or just selling to friends. I find he was involved to a far greater degree than he is willing to admit.” 
        
       
      
    24 Her Honour found that the Appellant was contrite, despite his initial attempts to minimise his level of culpability and that he had good prospects for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    25 Reference was made to the Appellant’s limited criminal antecedents, with offences of driving with the mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol and driving with an expired licence, for which he was fined and disqualified at Windsor Local Court on 7 June 2006. 
     
      
    26 The learned sentencing Judge allowed a combined discount of 30% for the Appellant’s pleas of guilty, contrition and his assistance to authorities.  
     
      
       
      Appeal Against Conviction 
       
      
    27 Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2 are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      (1) a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the sentencing Judge’s acceptance of the Appellant’s plea of guilty to the offence against s.7  
      Firearms Act 1996 
      ; 
       
       
      (2) the plea of guilty to the offence against s.7  
      Firearms Act 1996  
      was entered in circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice. 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    28 Mr Hunt, counsel for the Appellant, submitted that a miscarriage of justice has occurred because the Appellant, despite his plea of guilty to the first count, was not capable of being guilty of that crime on the evidence before the Court. He submitted that it was an element of the offence under s.7 Firearms Act 1996 that the Appellant was in possession of a “prohibited pistol” as defined by the Act. He submitted that it was not sufficient that the weapon was a “pistol” within the meaning of the Act and that, accordingly, this Court should set aside the conviction on Count 1.  
     
      
    29 This point was not taken in the District Court and was raised, for the first time, in this Court. 
     
      
    30 In support of this argument, Mr Hunt read an affidavit of the Appellant affirmed 22 May 2009 concerning the circumstances in which he came to plead guilty to this count, which disclosed a lack of understanding on his part of what is said to be the technical requirement for this offence that the relevant firearm be a “prohibited pistol” as defined in the Act. 
     
      
    31 The Crown submitted that the relevant element of a s.7 offence was that the person possessed a “pistol” as defined in the Act, and that the term “prohibited pistol” was unrelated to an offence under s.7. Although acknowledging that the Court Attendance Notice charging the Appellant with an offence under s.7 asserted that he “did possess a prohibited pistol”, the Crown submitted that this was not an accurate statement of the relevant element of the offence. The Crown submitted that the word “prohibited” in the Court Attendance Notice ought be disregarded as mere surplusage.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    32 This Court may quash a conviction entered upon a plea of guilty in the sentencing court if it is demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the Appellant is not permitted to withdraw the plea: R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36; R v Van (2002) 129 A Crim R 229; Elmir v R [2009] NSWCCA 22 at [33]ff. 
     
      
    33 The onus lies upon the Appellant to demonstrate that leave should be granted: R v Marchando (2000) 110 A Crim R 337 at 338 [4]; R v Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A Crim R 533 at 536-537 [16]-[23]. The Appellant must establish a good and substantial reason for the Court taking the course of granting leave to withdraw the plea: R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 at [39]; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 at 46 [39]. An application to withdraw a plea of guilty is to be approached with caution bordering on circumspection: R v Liberti (1991) 66 A Crim R 120 at 122; R v Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377 at [48].  
     
      
    34 The plea of guilty itself is a cogent admission of the ingredients of the offence: R v SL [2004] NSWCCA 397 at [51]. Indeed, it has been described as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: Charlesworth v R [2009] NSWCCA 27 at [25].  
     
      
    35 A person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person’s belief in his guilt, and the entry of a plea of guilty upon such grounds nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and this will normally only arise where the accused person did not understand the nature of the charge, or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it: Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 45-46.  
     
      
    36 The question here is whether the Appellant’s submission concerning the proper construction of s.7 Firearms Act 1996 ought be accepted. The issue is one of statutory construction. 
     
      
    37 At the outset, I note that the Court Attendance Notice in this case alleged that the Appellant “did possess a prohibited pistol … not being authorised to do by licence or permit”. Although the Court Attendance Notice refers to “Law Part Code 53107”, it should be observed that that form does not support the text used in the Court Attendance Notice.  
     
      
    38 The term “Law Part Code” has official status, and is defined in Part 75 r 3D(4) Supreme Court Rules as meaning “the Law Part Code allocated to the offence in the Law Codes Database maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales”: cf Lodhi v The Queen (2006) 199 FLR 303 at 324 [92] (Spigelman CJ). 
     
      
    39 As published on the Law Codes Database maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, Law Part Code 53107 (valid from 14 February 2004) provides a short description of an offence under s.7 Firearms Act 1996 of “possess unauthorised prohibited firearm” and a long description “a person must not possess a prohibited firearm unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit”. 
     
      
    40 Law Part Code 53108 (also valid from 14 February 2004) contains a short description “possess unauthorised pistol” and a long description “a person must not possess a pistol unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit”. 
     
      
    41 It appears that the author of the Court Attendance Notice in this case has used a combination of Law Part Codes 53107 and 53108. Although the content of Law Part Codes 53107 and 53108 assists the Crown construction of s.7, it remains a matter for the Court to undertake the process of statutory construction for itself to resolve the present matter of controversy. 
     
      
    42 Mr Hunt drew the Court’s attention to a number of decisions of this Court in which the relevant offence under s.7 was described (in passing) as possession of a “prohibited pistol”: R v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA 165 at [49]; R v Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391 at [3]-[4], [6]; R v Najem [2008] NSWCCA 32 at [2]; Cramp v R [2008] NSWCCA 40 at [9]-[10], [15]; Luu v R [2008] NSWCCA 285 at [4]. In R v Najem, Hulme J at [35] adverted to the present issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “35 Section 7 of the Firearms Act makes it an offence to possess or use the weapons to which it refers but it does not seem to me to be possible to conclude, at least in the abstract, that one of these concepts is likely to be worse than another. It must be recognised that the range of weapons encompassed by s7 are those answering the description ‘a prohibited firearm or pistol’. Given that the Act refers to ‘pistol(s)’ and ‘prohibited pistol(s)’ it is not immediately clear whether non-prohibited pistols are within the section although that issue does not arise in this case. The terms ‘pistol’ and ‘prohibited pistol’ are defined in s4 and s4C, the difference between the two lying primarily in calibre and length.”  
        
       
      
    43 In none of the cases referred to in the preceding paragraph was this Court called upon to construe s.7 so as to determine the breadth of its application. The present question of construction was not raised for determination. However, it is necessary for this Court to resolve the question.  
     
      
    44 It is helpful to trace the relevant history of the Firearms Act 1996. That Act replaced the Firearms Act 1989 and was part of a national campaign to implement firearms control following the Port Arthur massacre: R v Cromarty (2004) 144 A Crim R 515 at 519 [15]. It has been described as “complex and detailed” legislation: R v Najem at [14]. 
     
      
    45 Section 7 Firearms Act 1996, as enacted, originally provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “7  
        Offence of unauthorised possession or use of firearms 
         (cf 1989 Act s 5, APMC 3) 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A person must not possess or use a firearm unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or a permit. 
           
            
            Maximum penalty on summary conviction; 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            Maximum penalty on conviction on indictment: imprisonment for 10 years (if it is established beyond reasonable doubt that the firearm concerned was a prohibited firearm or a pistol), or imprisonment for 5 years in any other case. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a person who is the holder of a licence is guilty of an offence under this section if the person: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) uses a firearm for any purpose otherwise than in connection with the purpose established by the person as being the genuine reason for possessing or using the firearm, or 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b) contravenes any condition of the licence.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    46 It will be observed that s.7(1) created the offence of possession or use of a “firearm”, with a higher maximum penalty on conviction on indictment if it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the “firearm” concerned was a “prohibited firearm” or a “pistol”. The terms “firearm”, “pistol” and “prohibited firearm” were defined in s.4(1) of the 1996 Act in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “… 
        
       
       
        
        firearm 
         means a gun, or other weapon, that is (or at any time was) capable of propelling a projectile by means of an explosive, and includes a blank fire firearm, or an air gun, but does not include anything declared by the regulations not to be a firearm. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        pistol 
         means a firearm that: 
         
         
        (a) is reasonably capable of being raised and fired by one hand, and 
         
         
        (b) does not exceed any dimension prescribed by the regulations. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        prohibited firearm 
         means a firearm described in Schedule 1. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    47 It is apparent that the statutory scheme in 1996 envisaged an aggravated s.7 offence of possession of a “firearm” where it was either a “prohibited firearm” or a “pistol” as defined by the Act.  
     
      
    48 Section 7 was amended by the Firearms Amendment (Trafficking) Act 2001 by increasing the maximum penalty for an aggravated offence under s.7(1) from 10 years to 14 years’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    49 Section 7 was amended further by the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2002, by omitting the matter relating to penalties at the end of s.7(1), and inserting in its place the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years if the firearm concerned is a prohibited firearm or pistol, or imprisonment for five years in any other case.” 
        
       
      
    50 This amendment to s.7 lay within Schedule 2 of the 2002 Act which was entitled “Miscellaneous amendments to Firearms Act 1996 to clarify operation of existing penalties”. 
     
      
    51 The definitions of “firearm”, “prohibited firearm” and “pistol” in s.4(1) of the Act were not altered by the 2001 or 2002 amending Acts.  
     
      
    52 The Firearms Amendment (Prohibited Pistols) Act 2003 commenced on 1 October 2003. The long title of that Act was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “An Act to amend the Firearms Act 1996 and the Firearms (General) Regulation 1997 to make further provision in relation to the regulation and control of pistols used for the purposes of sporting target shooting; to provide compensation for surrendering certain pistols; and for other purposes.” 
        
       
      
    53 The Act introduced a definition of “prohibited pistol” in s.4(1) and s.4C of the Act. Section 4C provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “4C  
        Meaning of “prohibited pistol 
        ” 
         
         
          
          (1) In this Act, prohibited pistol means any of the following kinds of pistol: 
           
            
             
            (a) a pistol with a calibre of more than .38 inch, 
             
             
            (b) a self-loading pistol with a barrel length of less than 120 mm, 
             
             
            (c) a revolver with a barrel length of less than 100 mm, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            but does not include any such kind of pistol that is a black powder pistol. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            Note. A prohibited pistol is not a prohibited firearm. Prohibited firearms are listed in Schedule 1 (see definition of prohibited firearm in section 4 (1)). 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) For the purposes of this Act, any pistol that would be a prohibited pistol: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) if it did not have something missing from it, or a defect or obstruction in it, or 
             
             
            (b) if it were not for the fact that something has been done to it (being something that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is not in accordance with the recognised specifications for that pistol), 
            
           
          
         
         
         is taken to be a prohibited pistol.” 
        
       
      
    54 The Act made amendments to a range of sections in the Act which referred to a “prohibited pistol”: ss.8(1), 16B(1), 20, 58, 63(1A), 78, 78A and clause 21 of Schedule 3 to the Act. It is apparent from these provisions that the term “prohibited pistol” was created as part of a statutory scheme to reduce the range of pistols which were available for the purposes of sporting target shooting. A compensation scheme was established under s.78 of the Act, involving a buy-back period for persons surrendering a “prohibited pistol”, and a temporary amnesty was provided for in clause 21 of Schedule 3 of the Act to facilitate the buy-back period. It is clear that the term “prohibited pistol” is a statutory term of art enacted specifically, and defined in s.4C of the Act, to aid this precise statutory purpose concerning sporting target shooting.  
     
      
    55 As s.4C(1) made clear, a “prohibited pistol” was a subclass of “pistol” for the purposes of the Act. Section 4C(1) stated that a “prohibited pistol” meant “any of the following kinds of pistol”. The terms “prohibited pistol” and “pistol” were not mutually exclusive. As Hulme J observed in R v Najem at [35] (see [42] above), the difference between the two definitions lay primarily in calibre and length.  
     
      
    56 The amendments effected by this Act did not touch s.7 of the Act or the terms “firearm”, “prohibited firearm” or ‘pistol” as used in that section and as defined in s.4(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    57 The confined nature of the amendments enacted by the Firearms Amendment (Prohibited Pistols) Act 2003 is confirmed by perusal of the Second Reading Speech of Mr Watkins, the Minister for Police, delivered in the Legislative Assembly on 17 June 2003, which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am pleased to introduce the Firearms Amendment (Prohibited Pistols) Bill, which will amend the Firearms Act 1996, the Firearms (General) Regulation 1997 and the prohibited weapons legislation to implement the Prime Minister's handgun controls. This agreement was reached at the Council of Australian Governments [COAG] on 2 December 2002. The Firearms Amendment (Prohibited Pistols) Bill 2003 fully implements the National Agreement, which places a range of restrictions on handgun target shooters. These include restricting handguns that can be used for target shooting to a maximum of .38 calibre, semi-automatic handguns with a barrel length of 120 millimetres or more, and revolvers and single shot handguns with a barrel length of 100 millimetres or more.  
         
         
        Proposed sections 4C and 8 of the Act will create this new class of prohibited pistol, with proposed section 58(2) making it an offence with a maximum penalty of five year's imprisonment to unlawfully possess a prohibited pistol barrel. However, in line with the COAG agreement, there will be two limited classes of person who may access a prohibited pistol. Proposed section 16B provides for persons participating in International Shooting Sport Federation events, which count as Olympic and Commonwealth Games qualifiers, to access highly specialised target pistols which fail to meet the new barrel restrictions. The COAG agreed to this restricted use on the grounds that these highly specialised target pistols are large, visually distinctive and not readily concealable due to their overall size. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        The National Agreement also includes provision for a prohibited pistol buyback. Proposed section 78 provides the framework for this buyback.  
         
         
        …” 
        
       
      
    58 Later in 2003, the Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Act 2003 was enacted. This Act amended s.7, and enacted a new s.7A, which thereafter provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “7  
        Offence of unauthorised possession or use of prohibited firearms or pistols 
         
         
        (cf 1989 Act s 5, APMC 3) 
         
         
          
          (1) A person must not possess or use a prohibited firearm or pistol unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit. 
          
         
         
        Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years. 
         
         
          
          (2) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a person who is the holder of a licence is guilty of an offence under this section if the person: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) uses a prohibited firearm or pistol for any purpose otherwise than in connection with the purpose established by the person as being the genuine reason for possessing or using the prohibited firearm or pistol, or 
             
             
            (b) contravenes my condition of the licence. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (3) If, on the trial for an offence under this section, the jury is not satisfied that the accused is guilty of the offence but is satisfied on the evidence that the person is guilty of an offence under section 7A, it may find the person not guilty of the offence but guilty of an offence under section 7A and the accused is liable to punishment accordingly.” 
          
         
          
         
        “7A  
        Offence of unauthorised possession or use of firearms generally 
         
         
          
          (1) A person must not possess or use a firearm unless the person is authorised to do so by a licence or permit. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 5 years. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a person who is the holder of a licence is guilty of an offence under this section if the person: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) uses a firearm for any purpose otherwise than in connection with the purpose established by the person as being the genuine reason for possessing or using the firearm, or 
             
             
            (b) contravenes any condition of the licence.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    59 It will be observed that the effect of these amendments was to divide into separate sections (ss.7 and 7A) that which previously had been covered by s.7(1) of the Act. Section 7(1) now provided for the offence of unauthorised possession or use of a prohibited firearm or pistol, with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Section 7A provided for the lesser offence of unauthorised possession or use of a firearm (not being a prohibited firearm or pistol), with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.  
     
      
    60 Section 7(1) used the phrase “prohibited firearm or pistol”. Despite the creation earlier in 2003 of the concept of a “prohibited pistol”, ss.7 and 7A did not use that term. The reason for this is clear enough. As explained above, the term “prohibited pistol” was a statutory term of art introduced for a confined purpose by the Firearms Amendment (Prohibited Pistols) Act 2003. Examination of the terms of the legislation, and the statutory purpose identified in the Second Reading Speech, reinforces the view that the term “prohibited pistol” had no role to play with respect to the offence contained in s.7 of the Act.  
     
      
    61 This view is confirmed by reference to the Second Reading Speech of Mr Watkins, the Minister for Police, in the Legislative Assembly on 2 December 2003 with respect to the Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Bill 2003, where he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… 
        
       
       
        
        Schedule 5 makes a minor change to section 7 of the Firearms Act 1996 to create two separate offences for possession or use of an unauthorised firearm. 
        
       
       
        
        Currently section 7 conflates what are effectively two different offences into one, despite the considerable difference in the degree of criminality associated with those two offences. Namely, a maximum penalty of 14 years in relation to a prohibited firearm or pistol, which remains as section 7 of the Act, and a maximum penalty of 5 years in relation to other firearms, which is now section 7A of the Act. 
         
         
        This amendment clarifies and better defines those two offences and will enable the Judicial Commission and the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research to better collect and publish sentencing statistics which more accurately reflect the circumstances of the particular case. 
         
         
        The amendments in schedule 5 are minor changes to be viewed in the context of the Government's commitment to significantly overhauling gun laws to improve safety In New South Wales. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    62 Mr Hunt submitted that the words “prohibited firearm or pistol” in s.7(1) of the Act should be construed to mean “prohibited firearm or prohibited pistol”. He submits that the proper construction would see the word “prohibited” qualify each of the words “firearm” and “pistol”. Mr Hunt submitted that the amendment to s.7 effected by the Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Act 2003 did not take the opportunity to alter the section to state, for example, “pistol or prohibited firearm”. He submits that a consequence of this is that the legislature has adopted language (wittingly or otherwise) which extends the term “prohibited” to both a “firearm” and a “pistol”. 
     
      
    63 The Crown submitted that such a construction is entirely inconsistent with the legislative history of s.7(1), and the term “prohibited pistol” created for a confined purpose in 2003.  
     
      
    64 In my view, the short answer to the Appellant’s submission is that s.7(1) means what it says. The terms “prohibited firearm” and “pistol” are defined in s.4(1) of the Act. They have different meanings. Since the enactment of the Firearms Act 1996, these definitions have remained constant, and possession or use of such items has constituted an aggravated offence, attracting a higher maximum penalty, under s.7 of the Act.  
     
      
    65 The Appellant’s argument requires a construction of the Act which is entirely inconsistent with the statutory purpose and history of s.7, and the term “prohibited pistol” as introduced elsewhere in the Act in 2003 for an entirely different purpose. There is no logical explanation as to why possession of a “prohibited pistol”, as defined in s.4C of the Act, would constitute the aggravated offence attracting the higher maximum penalty under s.7 as opposed to possession of a “pistol” as defined in s.4(1) of the Act (which includes the subclass of “prohibited pistol”). In truth, the Appellant’s submission injects an element of absurdity into the construction of s.7 of the Act.  
     
      
    66 To the extent that the construction advanced by the Appellant is an arguable one, I am satisfied that such a construction would not promote the purpose or object of the legislation, and that the construction advanced by the Crown is clearly preferable: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987. Use of extrinsic material, in the form of the Second Reading Speeches, to which reference has been made, assists this conclusion: s.34 Interpretation Act 1987.  
     
      
    67 To the extent that the Appellant’s argument involves reading in the word “prohibited” so that it qualifies the term “pistol” in s.7(1), no warrant exists for such a construction, which is both strained and entirely inconsistent with the statutory scheme: cf R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at 685-691; R v PLV (2001) 51 NSWLR 736 at 742-744 [80]-[91]. The task of the Court is construction of the words actually used by the Parliament and that process militates firmly against the construction advanced by the Appellant. The same conclusion is reached by application of the principle concerning interpretation of penal statutes which, in any event, is one of last resort: Beckwith v The Queen (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576.  
     
      
    68 I am satisfied that the offence under s.7(1) of the Act involves the unauthorised possession or use of a “prohibited firearm” or a “pistol” as defined in s.4(1) of the Act. The term “pistol” in s.7(1) is not confined to the narrower class of pistol falling within the definition of “prohibited pistol” in s.4C, although s.7 catches unauthorised possession of a “pistol” which is a “prohibited pistol” as well. As long as a pistol is less than 65 cm in overall length, it is a “pistol” for the purposes of s.4(1) of the Act: clause 120 Firearms Regulation 2006. 
     
      
    69 It follows that the content of Law Part Code 53108 (see [40] above) is correct in its description of the relevant offence under s.7(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    70 Likewise, it follows that the Court Attendance Notice in this case was incorrect in alleging that the Appellant possessed a “prohibited pistol”. It was accepted in this Court that, should the Appellant’s argument be rejected, the word “prohibited” in the Court Attendance Notice could be disregarded as mere surplusage. The Appellant pleaded guilty to an offence of unauthorised possession of a pistol under s.7(1) of the Act. Apart from the admission of the elements of the offence implicit in his plea (see [34] above), there was ample evidence before the District Court in the certificate of Senior Constable Dusting that the item in question constituted a “pistol” as defined in s.4(1) of the Act.  
     
      
    71 It is not necessary to resort to the proviso in s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to resolve the present appeal against conviction. This is not a case where the Court Attendance Notice omitted to allege an essential element of the offence, a circumstance which led to an appeal against conviction being dismissed by application of the proviso in Chanthaboury v R (2007) 176 A Crim R 438. The word “prohibited” in the Court Attendance Notice may be simply disregarded as surplusage, with the Notice otherwise alleging an offence known to law under s.7(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    72 Although the resolution of this issue is, in my view, a straightforward one, it was appropriate to refer to the relevant statutory history of the Firearms Act 1996 given the earlier decisions of this Court referred to at [42] above. The descriptions of s.7 offences in those decisions suggest that, from time to time, police and prosecutors have been misdescribing the offence under s.7(1) as possession of a prohibited pistol. The Court Attendance Notice in this case repeats the same error.  
     
      
    73 The present appeal indicates the wisdom of close compliance by police and prosecutors with the form contained in Law Part Code 53108 with respect to the offence of unauthorised possession of a pistol under s.7(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    74 In my view, Grounds 1 and 2 ought be rejected and the appeal against conviction ought be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentence 
       
      
    75 Ground 3 contends that the sentence imposed for the offence under s.7(1) Firearms Act 1996 was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    76 In support of this ground, Mr Hunt submitted that a non-parole period of two years with a balance of term of one year and six months was manifestly excessive, in circumstances where positive findings were made by the sentencing Judge with respect to the Appellant’s subjective circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation, and a combined 30% discount was allowed for his early pleas of guilty, contrition and assistance to the authorities. Mr Hunt submitted, in passing, that it was erroneous to factor the Appellant’s contrition into that discount. 
     
      
    77 Mr Hunt accepted that her Honour was entitled to have regard to the standard non-parole period as a guidepost, notwithstanding the Appellant’s plea of guilty to the s.7(1) offence. He submitted that the unusual circumstances of the s.7(1) offence, whereby the Appellant possessed the pistol as a consequence of an attack upon him at an earlier time, was a matter which reduced the objective seriousness of the offence. He submitted that an effective head sentence of three years and six months, with a non-parole period of two years, after application of a 30% discount, placed too great an emphasis on the circumstances of the offences and on specific and general deterrence, as opposed to rehabilitation of a relatively young offender with subjective mitigating factors in terms of his mental health and drug usage.  
     
      
    78 Whilst acknowledging that it was necessary for the sentencing Judge to have regard to the six matters on the Form 1, Mr Hunt contended that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    79 Although accepting that sentencing statistics are a blunt tool in the absence of factual particulars of other cases, Mr Hunt sought to rely upon statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in support of his submission of manifest excess in the imposition of sentence on the s.7(1) offence. 
     
      
    80 The Crown submitted that the s.7(1) offence in this case was a serious one, and that it was necessary for the sentencing Judge to have regard as well to the six offences to be taken into account on the Form 1. The offences were committed whilst the Appellant was on bail with respect to other matters.  
     
      
    81 The Crown submitted that, despite some unusual features, the s.7(1) offence was objectively serious and the sentencing Judge had found, correctly, that it fell towards the mid-range of objective seriousness. The Crown pointed to the fact that the pistol was loaded, that additional ammunition was found and that the firearm offences were committed in the broader context of the Appellant supplying drugs. The Crown submitted that the sentence was not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    82 The Appellant’s narrow focus on the sentence imposed on Count 1 introduces an element of artificiality to the case. The Appellant was sentenced for three offences, with the Form 1 offences to be taken into account, as well, on Count 1. Counts 2 and 3 were separate offences involving serious criminality. Count 3 was a deemed supply offence involving the Appellant’s possession of 4.82 grams of MDMA - more than six times the traffickable quantity (0.75 grams). Yet the Appellant’s sentences for Counts 2 and 3 fell entirely within the non-parole period for Count 1. 
     
      
    83 I turn to the argument directed to the sentence on Count 1. 
     
      
    84 In R v Najem, Hulme J at [38] pointed to what were described as “two irreconcilable standards” against which a s.7(1) offence was to be measured - a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment, but a standard non-parole period of three years.  
     
      
    85 In approaching the challenge to the sentence imposed in this case, it is necessary to keep in mind the available maximum penalty for the s.7(1) offence, as well as the relatively low standard non-parole period which is available, as a guidepost, following a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    86 Although the Appellant’s reason for acquiring the pistol was somewhat unusual, it remained the fact that at the time of detection by police, he possessed a loaded pistol in the vehicle, in conjunction with a range of drugs which he possessed for supply. He possessed the paraphernalia of a drug supplier including plastic bags which, it may readily be inferred, were to be used for the purpose of supplying drugs, together with a not insignificant sum of money. He had spent a substantial sum of money to purchase the pistol from a criminal source. 
     
      
    87 Despite the Appellant’s unwillingness in his evidence at the sentencing hearing to acknowledge the extent of his drug supply, the messages on his mobile phone (see [13] above), and his possession of funds, point clearly to the business of drug supply.  
     
      
    88 The fact that the pistol was loaded, and that the Appellant possessed other ammunition, bore upon the seriousness of his crimes: R v Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 270 at [14]; R v Amurao [2005] NSWCCA 32 at [69]; Yang v R [2007] NSWCCA 37 at [18]. The Appellant’s claim that he possessed the loaded pistol for his own protection was not a matter of significant, if any, mitigation, since the policy of the legislature evinced by the enactment of the offence under 7(1), with a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment, was to act as a deterrent, and to punish possession of a pistol per se: R v Krstic at [14]. The rule of law, and the authority of courts, depends upon the proposition that persons do not, by illegal means, take their protection into their own hands: R v AA [2006] NSWCCA 55 at [46].  
     
      
    89 The fact that the serial number of the pistol had been obliterated, although explicable by the criminal origin of the weapon, does not assist the Appellant, who possessed the firearm for criminal purposes: Yang v R at [18]. The fact that the Appellant possessed the pistol in a context where he was involved in the supply of drugs also bears on the objective seriousness of the pistol offence: Luu v R at [32]. 
     
      
    90 It was necessary for the sentencing Judge to have regard, as well, in imposing sentence on Count 1 to the six offences contained in the Form 1. These matters were to be taken into account in sentencing the Appellant, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the s.7(1) offence. The sentence imposed for this offence had to reflect the need for personal deterrence and retribution arising from the additional criminality involved in the Form 1 offences: Attorney General’s Application under s.37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42]-[43]; R v Mouloudi [2004] NSWCCA 96 at [66].  
     
      
    91 The sentencing Judge had regard to the objective seriousness of the offences and the Appellant’s subjective circumstances. In the circumstances of the case, a combined discount of 30% was allowed. A generous finding was made that the Appellant was contrite, although he denied that he was in the business of supplying drugs, a position rejected by the sentencing Judge (see [23] above), and he had been otherwise caught red-handed with respect to the other offences. I do not accept Mr Hunt’s submission that error is revealed in the use of a rolled-up discount in this case.  
     
      
    92 It was appropriate for the sentencing Judge to have regard to issues of general and specific deterrence in the imposition of sentence. Although there was some evidence concerning the Appellant’s mental state in psychiatric reports prepared for the purpose of sentencing proceedings, that evidence, in my view, did not render the Appellant an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Mr Hunt referred to this issue only in passing, noting that he did not “mount a full Hemsley style of argument” in this Court. No such argument had been advanced in the District Court.  
     
      
    93 Whether the principle emerging from cases such as R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 ought be applied, so as to render an offender a less appropriate vehicle for general deterrence, depends upon the circumstances of the case. See, generally, R v Hamid (2006) 164 A Crim R 179 at 198-200 [109]-[115] and the cases referred to therein. In this case, the Appellant was involved in the supply of drugs for gain, as well as being a personal user of drugs, and he possessed a loaded and lethal pistol in the context of these activities. I do not consider that the evidence before the District Court concerning the Appellant’s mental state rendered him a less appropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Indeed, the issue of public safety arising from his possession of a loaded pistol tends to heighten concern, in a manner which might fairly be reflected in a significant allowance for personal and general deterrence in this case.  
     
      
    94 I do not consider that sentencing statistics for s.7(1) offences provide any real assistance in this case, where there were significant offences to be taken into account on a Form 1 in passing sentence for the s.7(1) offence. 
     
      
    95 To make good Ground 3 asserting manifest excess, it is necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that the sentence imposed on Count 1 was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. The Appellant has not made good this ground.  
     
      
    96 Indeed, the total effective sentence imposed for the combination of firearms and drug supply offences committed by the Appellant lay towards the lenient end of the range of sentence for such criminality.97 I would reject Ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Proposed Orders 
       
      
    98 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
       
      (b) grant leave to appeal against sentence, but appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a number of child sexual assault offences committed against two of his daughters between 1966 and 1974. He was committed for sentence to the District Court on 1 December 2004 but refused to adhere to his pleas and the matter was remitted to the Local Court. On 5 October 2005 the applicant was committed to the District Court for trial on 25 charges. After negotiations between the Crown and those acting for the applicant, on 16 December 2005 he pleaded guilty to 17 counts on an indictment. However, before the applicant could be sentenced on those matters, he made an application that the Court allow him to withdraw his pleas of guilty. Judge Goldring refused that application on 25 August 2006. The applicant then came before Conlon DCJ (the Judge) for sentencing on 20 April 2007. 
     
      
    3 On 18 May 2007 the Judge sentenced the applicant to an overall sentence of 20 years with an overall minimum period to be served of 12 years. The sentences commenced on 18 August 2006 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 17 August 2018. On that date the applicant will be just shy of his 85th birthday. The total sentence expires on 17 August 2026. On that date the applicant will be just shy of his 93rd birthday. 
     
      
    4 The applicant faced sentencing for eight counts of indecent assault contrary to s 76 of the Crimes Act (now repealed); three counts of carnal knowledge with a child under 10 years contrary to s 67 of that Act (now repealed); and six counts of carnal knowledge by a father contrary to s 73 of that Act (now repealed). Each of the indecent assault offences carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years, each of the carnal knowledge offences carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and each of the offences of carnal knowledge by a father, a maximum penalty of 14 years. 
     
      
    5 For each of the counts of indecent assault the Judge sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of 3 years to date from 18 August 2006. For each of the offences of carnal knowledge the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 7 years to date from 18 August 2008. For each of the offences of carnal knowledge by a father the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 8 years to date from 18 August 2010 and an “additional term” of 8 years. This meant that for each of the offences of carnal knowledge by a father a total sentence of 16 years was imposed. As has been noted, the maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 14 years and thus the sentence imposed for each of those offences exceeds the maximum penalty. 
     
      
    6 Shortly before the hearing of the application, the Court received a report from the Judge dated 15 April 2009. The Judge acknowledged that an error had occurred in the sentences pronounced by him, and as set out on the indictment, for each of the offences of carnal knowledge by a father. Having perused his handwritten notes, the Judge was able to ascertain that, for each of those offences, he intended to impose a sentence made up of a non-parole period of 8 years and an “additional term” of 5 years. Apparently a typographical error occurred when the Judge’s associate typed a draft of his sentencing remarks from the Judge’s hand-written notes. The additional term was written as a “5” in the notes but was transposed into an “8” in the typed draft. The Judge did not discover this error prior to passing sentence on the applicant. 
     
      
    7 Instead of the overall term of imprisonment of 20 years that was imposed upon the applicant, the Judge intended that the overall term would be 17 years against which the applicant would be required to serve a minimum period of custody of 12 years. Therefore, if the sentences for the offences of carnal knowledge by a father were altered to reflect the Judge’s intention, the total sentence would expire just short of the applicant’s 90th birthday. 
     
      
    8 All the offences, except one indecent assault, were committed against his daughter CH who was aged between 8 and 15 years at the time of the offending. The remaining indecent assault was committed against his daughter VH in 1974 when she was aged 11 or 12. 
     
      
    9 It is unnecessary to detail the truly appalling acts of sexual depravity that the applicant committed against CH. The Judge described them as “objectively horrendous”. They were committed regardless of the physical pain he caused her at the time of the offending or the psychological damage he might have inflicted upon her for the rest of her life. The offender subjected his daughter to the whole gamut of indecent and sexual acts, including penetrating her with objects, in order to satiate his sexual desires. As a result the hapless child become pregnant to him at the age of 13. The pregnancy was terminated in December 1972 just before she turned 14. But not even that event spared the child. There were three further charges of carnal knowledge thereafter, but the applicant took the precaution of withdrawing before he ejaculated. Eventually the child escaped by leaving home. The last charge related to the applicant indecently touching another of his daughters. 
     
      
    10 It should be noted that many of the offences of indecent assault would now be classed as acts of intercourse. They were of the most serious kind and objectively in the worst category. In fact it is difficult to see how a court sentencing the applicant at a time shortly after the offences were committed could have avoided the maximum penalties for some offences. The applicant should have spent a very large part of his adult life in custody as punishment for this course of criminal conduct and to denounce and deter this type of behaviour towards a young child by her father. 
     
      
    11 But as so often is the case with this type of offending, the applicant avoided punishment for very many years because his victim was unable to complain about the conduct, so traumatised was she by it. It is an unfortunate fact in offences of this kind, that the more serious they are the less likely is it that the offender will be brought before the court at a time when an appropriate punishment can be imposed upon him. 
     
      
    12 The offender reported to a police station in February 2002 saying that his daughter had telephoned him telling him to “hand himself in”. While police were trying to ascertain what the matter was about, the applicant’s wife arrived with a daughter, who was neither of the complainants. The wife understood that VH had complained to police about the applicant’s conduct. Nothing further occurred at that time to bring the applicant to justice. In July 2004 the police spoke again to the applicant as by that time both complainants had made statements to police. The applicant declined to be interviewed on legal advice and was charged with a large number of child sexual assault offences. 
     
      
    13 As has been noted, the delay from 2004, when the applicant was charged, until the applicant was sentenced in 2007 was largely due to his apparent attempts to manipulate the system by pleading guilty and then not adhering to the pleas in the District Court, thereafter being committed for trial, then pleading guilty and finally attempting to withdraw those pleas. 
     
      
    14 Notwithstanding this conduct the applicant was given the benefit of a discount of 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of his pleas. This was erroneously based upon a matter, which the Judge saw as most important, being that the “the offender’s pleas have spared the victims the ordeal of having to testify”. That is not a matter to be taken into account in determining the utilitarian value of the plea: see R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. 
     
      
    15 As should be apparent, the sentencing proceedings occurred about 40 years after the offending commenced and about 33 years after it concluded. The applicant was born in 1933 and was aged 73 at the date of sentence. He had no criminal record. He was born in Malta and came to Australia at about the age of 20. He was married at the age of 23 and had nine children. The marriage ended in 1992 when this offending was disclosed within the family. He worked until 1983 as a labourer or crane driver. He ceased work because of health issues including a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease. That disease is now in remission. 
     
      
    16 In a report tendered before the sentencing judge, a psychologist stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I note a complex developmental history characterised by educational impoverishment, illiteracy, a poor capacity to cope with his environment, and attendant to these considerations, ongoing depression and anxiety for many years. As a complicating feature this man suffers from an intellectual disability. Arising from this I suspect that he has only managed to function at a basic level in the community as a consequence of the prior supportive structure that he enjoyed with his family. This is of considerable relevance in relation to how he [is] managed both within a custodial setting and indeed upon his eventual release from prison. 
        
       
       
      And further: 
       
        
         
        This man is having a very difficult time in prison. This is on the basis of his age, his illiteracy and his considerable isolation from younger prisoners and his estrangement from his family. His confinement no doubt is compounding his emotional problems at a level of significance. 
         
        . 
         
        I note that he has been seen by the Forensic Psychology Unit, but I am unclear as to whether or not ongoing treatment is currently happening. It is clear that this man requires considerable professional support. He remains very much a risk in a custodial environment by virtue of his age and indeed the nature of his convictions. In the setting of him requiring ongoing protection for the duration of the sentence I anticipate his mental state will continue to deteriorate. 
        
       
      
    17 A clinical psychologist subjected the applicant to a number of tests and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The applicant’s] performance reflected severe impairment of intellectual functioning. His overall level of intellectual functioning was extremely low (previously referred to as mentally retarded) functioning at the first percentile. 
        
       
      
    18 In light of this evidence the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is the responsibility of the court to moderate considerations of deterrence according to the circumstances of the particular case, and I have done so in this matter. 
        
       
      
    19 There was medical evidence before the sentencing judge. This indicated that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The applicant] suffers ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and peripheral arterial disease (but continues to smoke). He also has problems with osteoarthritis. 
        
       
       
      However, the treating doctor stated the following opinion: 
       
        
         
        I do not see that these conditions preclude him from incarceration if that is the court's decision. However, he has attended here at approximately three monthly intervals and I feel he should undergo regular medical assessments if he is indeed incarcerated. 
        
       
      
    20 The Judge concluded that the applicant's age and health would have the effect of ""making gaol more onerous for him"". He also accepted that the applicant would have to serve his sentence on protection owing to the nature of his offending and that he might even be at risk in protection because he would not have the physical capacity to protect himself. In relation to the applicant's age the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Also on the question of age, I am of course aware of the possibility of the offender dying during the course of his minimum term. However, there is no automatic reduction because of advanced age, and it is also a matter to be considered together with the other circumstances of the case. 
        
       
      
    21 The Judge found special circumstances in order to reduce the non-parole period from the statutory relationship on the basis of the applicant’s age and the fact that he would be serving his first time in custody. In that regard it should be noted that, in the sentence as imposed, the overall non-parole period was 60 per cent of the overall term of imprisonment. However, in the sentence that the Judge intended to impose, according to his report to this Court, the overall non-parole period is about 70 per cent of the overall term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    22 The grounds of appeal filed are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The sentence is manifestly excessive when regard is had to sentencing practice at the time of the offences: 
         
         
         (a) in respect of the non-parole period; 
         
         
         (b) in respect of the head sentence. 
         
         
        2. His honour erred in imposing sentences in excess of the maximum penalty. 
         
         
        3. His Honour erred in the application of the principles enunciated in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) CLR 610. 
         
        
       
      
    23 Ground 2 can be easily dealt with. Accepting that there was a typographical error that resulted in a sentence being imposed that not only exceeded the total maximum penalty but also was not the sentence that the Judge intended, this ground could be upheld and the sentence intended to be imposed could be substituted for each of the offences of carnal knowledge by a father. However, the applicant indicated during oral argument that such a substitution would not result in the other grounds being abandoned. The applicant asserts that under ground one the substituted sentence would still be manifestly excessive having regard to sentencing practice at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    24 Obviously one of the most significant matters in determining the appropriate sentence for the applicant was his advanced age at the time of sentencing. Old age does not necessarily result in substantial leniency being granted to an offender who has committed serious offences, particularly where the offences were committed relatively recent to the time of sentencing. More consideration can be given to the advanced age of an offender where there has been a delay in the sentencing, especially where that delay has resulted in a deterioration of the offender’s physical or mental health. The court takes into account the offender’s age in assessing whether imprisonment would bear more heavily upon the offender because his age may mean that he will have little prospect of ever walking from the gaol free or having any worthwhile life left after the sentence is served: R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 507. 
     
      
    25 As can be noted in the passages extracted from the Judge’s sentencing remarks above, his Honour was aware of the significance of the applicant’s age and the general approach to be taken in sentencing such a person as the applicant for offences of considerable seriousness after an extensive delay. He specifically noted that imprisonment would be more onerous for the applicant and that there was a prospect that the applicant might die in prison.  
     
      
    26 The difficulties for sentencing courts caused by extensive delay between the offending conduct and sentence, usually in child sexual assault cases, has been the subject of a number of decisions of this Court. The latest is CPW v R [2009] NSWCCA 105. That was a somewhat complicated case because there were a number of offences committed between 1982 and 1986 and another group of offences committed between 2002 and 2006. However in respect of the earlier offences, which the Court referred to as “the old offences”, the Court applied those authorities that were concerned with sentencing for offences that had occurred many years before the sentence was to be imposed. 
     
      
    27 It is unnecessary to refer to these authorities in any detail. The principle generally and simply stated is that the sentencing court attempts from information available to it to fashion the type of sentence that might have been imposed at a time proximate to the date of offending. Certainly the court ensures, so far as it is able to do so, that the offender is not disadvantaged by any change in the way specific types of offences have been considered by sentencing courts over the years that followed the offending or by changes to the legislation governing sentencing. 
     
      
    28 This manner in proceeding to sentence for “old offences” applies both to the head sentence and the non-parole period. In regard to this latter part of the sentence to be imposed, the Court in CPW quoted and applied the decision in AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32. 
     
      
    29 AJB involved a sentence imposed in 2006 for an offence committed in 1982. The Court concluded that in 1982 a non-parole period was fixed at somewhere between a third and a half of the term of the sentence. I wrote the principal judgment with which the other members of the Court agreed and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [37] It seems to me that this Court should endeavour to apply the practice that existed in 1982 in specifying a non-parole period because that practice would favour the applicant. It can do so on the basis that special circumstances under s 44 are to be found in the fact that there was a different sentencing practice in relation to fixing a non-parole period in 1982 which did not require a finding of special circumstances in order to avoid a statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term. In Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 it was held that special circumstances could be found in order to overcome unfair disparity between co-offenders that would arise from “a too literal application of conventional sentencing principles and the requirements of s 44”. It is consistent with that approach to find special circumstances in the present case in order to avoid unfairness that would arise by reason of the delay in the prosecution of the current charges as a result of a change in the law in relation to the determination of the appropriate non-parole period. 
        
       
      
    30 AJB was applied in MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261 in respect of offences committed between 1974 and 1982. It was also applied in Bradbury v R [2008] NSWCCA 93 in respect of offences committed between 1970 and 1975. There is no reason why it should not also apply to the offences in the present case. I note that in Bradbury the appeal was allowed where the non-parole period after a finding of special circumstances was 70 per cent of the total sentence. That is the situation here on the revised sentences based upon the Judge’s report. 
     
      
    31 The legislation that was operative in the period when the offences were committed was the Parole of Prisoner Act 1966. As was pointed out in AJB, there was no provision in that Act that required there to be any relationship between the non-parole period and the total term of the sentence. But even under the current scheme, a finding of special circumstances in relation to a man of the age of the applicant with some health issues and intellectual deficiencies would not normally result in a non-parole period in the order of 70 per cent of the total sentence. 
     
      
    32 In AJB I indicated that, at least in relation to that applicant, general deterrence was of less significance than it might otherwise be because of the period between the offending and the imposition of sentence and because of his reform over that period. I believe that this will generally be the case where, as in both AJB and the present case, a considerable period of time has passed between the offending and sentencing and where over that period there have been no further offences. This is not to imply that general deterrence is of no significance in such cases. Potential offenders should understand that the courts will treat these types of offences harshly notwithstanding that extensive delay occurs before the offender is punished. But, as was recognised in Holyoak, the need for general deterrence must be considered in light of the effect of the sentence of imprisonment upon the offender and the implication of that sentence upon his prospects for release. 
     
      
    33 In a case such as the present where the offender is aged 73, has health issues that will affect his ability to cope with imprisonment and suffers intellectual disabilities, whatever be their effect upon his appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct, general deterrence will have little role to play in the length of the sentence to be imposed. This is simply an application of the sentencing principle, found chiefly in sentencing mentally handicapped offenders, that a particular offender may not be a suitable person upon whom to visit the full extent of general deterrence by making an example of him to others. 
     
      
    34 In any event the fact that, after more than 30 years of non-offending since the commission of the crimes, and despite his age, health issues and intellectual disabilities, the offender is being sent to prison for the first time must have a very significant deterrent effect upon potential offenders. To moderate the need for general deterrence when deciding upon the length of the sentence to impose in such a case as that of the applicant could hardly be taken as encouragement to others to offend or to lead others to think that they will be treated with the same leniency if they offend in the same way. 
     
      
    35 The Judge indicated that he was moderating the need for general deterrence in this case. Just why he was taking that course or the extent of the moderation was not made clear. The statement was made in the context of a consideration of the applicant’s mental state at the time of the offending and the significance of his “intellectual deficiency” and its impact upon his appreciation of the wrongfulness of his conduct. 
     
      
    36 With respect I believe that the issue of the relevance of general deterrence went much further than that. On simply an evaluation of the mental state of the applicant at the time of the offences, I doubt that the moderation of the need for general deterrence would be very great. But an evaluation of the role and impact of general deterrence had to take into account the applicant as he stood for sentencing, including his age, his then mental capacities, and the impact of a deterrent sentence upon the applicant in terms of his prospects for release. 
     
      
    37 The ground of appeal in relation to the overall sentence was that the Judge failed to take into account a pattern of sentencing that existed at a time proximate to the offending or as determined by this Court in dealing with such cases. I do not believe that error is made out because I do not believe there is a pattern that can be gleaned from the cases or statistics. The cases determined by this Court do not seem to me to show that his Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried in this way. But I am satisfied that the sentence imposed was excessive because his Honour must have given too much weight to the need for general deterrence in the circumstances of this particular case. An overall head sentence of 17 years that his Honour intended to impose was, in my opinion, excessive in all the circumstances. 
     
      
    38 This is not to suggest that such a sentence would have been inappropriate to reflect the seriousness of the offending had the applicant been better able to serve such a sentence if he had been required to do so by parole being refused, as unlikely as that event might be. But as the applicant stood at the date of sentencing, such a sentence would have been unduly harsh having regard to not only his age but also to his mental and physical state and to the nature of his custody and its impact upon him. 
     
      
    39 A reduction in the overall sentence must result in a reduction in the overall minimum period the applicant is to serve, even having regard only to the approach taken by the Judge. But his Honour, in fixing the non-parole period, failed to have regard to what this Court said in AJB. This is probably because neither party referred his Honour to that case or the approach to sentencing for old offences that it adopts. The Judge found special circumstances based upon the applicant’s age and the fact it was his first time in custody. He fixed the minimum period as 60 per cent of the overall sentence he imposed. But, as has been noted, on the corrected head sentence, the overall minimum period of custody is about 70 per cent. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion the overall minimum period fixed by the Judge was excessive even without having regard to what was said in AJB. But applying AJB the minimum period of custody should be no more than 45 per cent of the overall total sentence. It should be set at this level because of the very great seriousness of the offences committed by him. There must be an element of denunciation and retribution reflected in the non-parole period. 
     
      
    41 The third complaint is that some of the individual sentence themselves were manifestly excessive, in particular the sentences imposed for the indecent assault offences. One of the difficulties is that the Judge does not discriminate between particular offences falling into a particular category. So all the indecent assault offences were punished by a penalty of a fixed term of three years. The maximum penalty for any one of those offences was five years and after reduction by 20 percent, four years. A fixed term of three years is the equivalent of a non-parole period being 75 per cent of the maximum penalty for the offence less the discount for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    42 This argument is somewhat technical because there were 8 indecent assault offences, and the sentences were made concurrent. However, the argument is made good and his Honour’s manner of dealing with the offences was in breach of the accepted approach following the decision in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    43 The Court was taken to a number of cases concerned with sentencing for sexual offences against young children. Although the submission was made that certain cases were worst factually than the present, minds might differ about that assertion. In my opinion the facts of this matter, even though they involved substantially a single complainant, were within the worst category of offending of its kind. There were a host of aggravating features including the fact that the complainant became pregnant at the age of 13 and the termination of that pregnancy. As I had noted, this event did not stop the applicant’s abuse of his daughter. The simple fact is that, because of his age and health, the applicant cannot now be required to serve a sentence anywhere approaching the severity necessary to reflect the objective gravity of his offending. 
     
      
    44 In my opinion the overall sentence should be 14 years 6 months, which is the equivalent of a sentence of 18 years less 20 per cent. The overall non-parole period should be 6 years 6 months. This means that the applicant would be eligible for release on 17 February 2013, about 6 months before his 80th birthday. Fixed terms have been imposed because of the sentences imposed for the offences of carnal knowledge by a father. Special circumstances exist for the reasons given in the judgment. There should be a partly cumulative sentence in respect of the offence against the complainant VH. 
     
      
    45 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Application for leave is granted and the appeal allowed. 
         
         
        2. The sentences of the District Court are quashed. 
         
         
        3. In lieu, the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
         
         
         (a) For counts 1,4,5,7 to 10 (inclusive) on each count a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months that commenced on 18 August 2006 and expired on 17 February 2008. 
         
         
         (b) On count 17 a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year that commenced on 18 August 2007 and expired on 17 August 2008. 
         
         
         (c) For counts 2,3 and 6, on each count a fixed term of 4 years that commenced on 18 August 2008 and that expires on 17 August 2012. 
         
         
         (d) On counts 11 to 16 (inclusive) a minimum term of 3 years 6 months to commence on 18 August 2009 and expires on 17 February 2013 the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. There is to be an additional term of 8 years from 18 February 2013 to expire on 17 February 2021. 
        
       
      
    46 R A HULME J:  I agree with Howie J.

   Judgment[1] The plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation by Statement of Claim filed on 29 April 2009 concerning three publications alleged to have been published on the website www.catcam.com.au. These matters are attached as PDF files in a schedule to this judgment.[2] The plaintiff pleads the following imputations arise from each of the matters complained of: 
     
     First matter complained of 
      
      
     4(a) The plaintiff as the owner of Beechwood Homes is responsible for building defective and substandard homes; 
      
     4(b) The plaintiff as a master builder is so incompetent that he should not be chosen by anyone to build their home; 
      
     4(c) The plaintiff knowingly tried to deceive homeowners by falsely claiming that major building defects were no [more] than inconsequential and minor defects; 
      
     4(d) The plaintiff as the owner of Beechwood Homes and Cavasinni Constructions is a crook builder responsible for shonky and sub-standard workmanship. 
      
      
     Second matter complained of 
      
      
     6(a) The plaintiff knowingly tried to deceive homeowners by falsely claiming that major building defects were no [more] than inconsequential and minor defects. 
      
      
     Third matter complained of 
      
      
     8(a) The plaintiff knowingly tried to deceive homeowners by falsely claiming that major building defects were no [more] than inconsequential and minor defects; 
      
     8(b) The plaintiff sought [to] cover up serious building faults created by Beechwood Homes; 
      
     8(c) The plaintiff unreasonably refused to rectify serious building defects by homeowners. 
    [3] This is an application by the defendants to strike out the Statement of Claim on the basis of lack of form and capacity of the imputations, failure to provide particulars of publication, and spelling errors.[4] I have been provided with helpful written submissions and heard oral argument this morning. The application is for the court to determine these issues as separate questions of law pursuant to r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) and to strike out the imputations pursuant to r 14.28(1) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005. The relevant Act is the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).[5] The principles applicable to arguments concerning the manner in which publications on the Internet are actionable and should be pleaded are explained by the High Court in Dow Jones & Company Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575. [6] The principles applicable to arguments concerning the form and capacity of imputations have been outlined by the High Court in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 186 at [6] and [20]-[22], by the Court of Appeal in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Hitchcock [2007] NSWCA 364 at [6]-[7], [29] and [106]-[109] and Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWCA 37 at [7]-[8] and by the Supreme Court in a number of helpful practice decisions by Nicholas J and Simpson J.Publication[7] The defendants complain that the publication on the Internet pleads publication not only in New South Wales but in other States and Territories identified only as “and elsewhere” in paragraphs 3, 5 and 7 of the Statement of Claim. It is submitted that it is necessary for there to be evidence that the publication was downloaded for it to be actionable as a defamation: Dow Jones at 605-607. [8] The plaintiff has now provided particulars that publication is only to be asserted in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland and accordingly it is not necessary for me to deal with this matter further.[9] However, I should note that the reason for the requirement of downloading in Dow Jones was because the publication in question was one obtainable only on subscription, and not freely available to everyone on the Internet. The requirement that the plaintiff must establish that the matter was downloaded in each State and Territory in order to establish a cause of action should, in my view, be read subject to this special fact, which is not applicable to the publication in these proceedings.[10] By analogy, it could just as easily be said that publication in the newspaper could not be proved without evidence of the names of persons who proffered the appropriate sum to a newsagent.[11] The warnings of Kirby J in Dow Jones at 630-633 that rules should be technology-neutral should be borne in mind on this issue as well as the other issues to which this principle was applied in those proceedings.[12] Mr Potter has indicated that as his client will be filing an amended statement of claim to correct typing errors, he will replace “and elsewhere” with references to Victoria and Queensland, so I have made an order to this effect, but this is not an order I would otherwise have made, as the defendants know from answers to particulars the case they have to meet.Imputations – form[13] The defendants’ objections to form fall into the following categories: 
     
     (a) Objection is taken to words such as “responsible” on the basis that they are “weasel words”:  
     Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden  
     (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 163. 
      
     (b) The defendants also complain that imputations repeat the words of the matter complained of (as opposed to distilling the defamatory act or condition), which is not permitted:  
     Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd 
      [2005] NSWCA 255 at [1], [118]-[132]. 
      
     (c) The defendants also complain that one of the imputations contains a rhetorical flourish, which does not add to the sting of the imputation and is thus impermissible:  
     Mayfield-Smith v Mirror Newspapers Ltd  
     [1982] 2 NSWLR 419 at 420;  
     Waterhouse v David Syme & Co Ltd  
     [2000] NSWSC 817 at [22]. 
      
     (d) There are typographical errors in several of the imputations and the defendants say this renders the meaning obscure. 
      
     (e) The imputations lack the requisite precision. 
      
     (f) Some of the words used are ambiguous (e.g. “cover up”, “crook”). 
      
     (g) Some imputations are rolled-up and contain more than one sting. 
    [14] One of the objects of the enactment of uniform defamation legislation was to do away with these sterile arguments by removing (in New South Wales) the imputation as the cause of action. However, this goal still appears to be out of reach.Imputation 4(a) and “weasel words” [15] The defendants submit that this imputation suffers a defect in form in that the defamatory act or condition is unclear because of the use of the word “responsible” which, it is submitted, is “an impermissible weasel word” (written submissions, paragraph 15, referring to Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden at 163).[16] What is a “weasel word”? This is a word often used in applications to strike out imputations, but never explained, so I have checked its meaning in Wikipedia. The phrase “weasel word”, referring to a word which sucks the meaning out of a sentence the way a weasel sucks an egg but leaves the empty shell, is an adaptation of Shakespeare’s metaphor in As You Like It: “I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs” (Act II, scene v). [17] The term was popularised by Theodore Roosevelt in speeches during the First World War, where he used it to deride political doublespeak, but its first modern use is attributed to the American political commentator Stewart Chaplin, who in his short story “Stained Glass Political Platform” (published in 1900) used the line “Why, weasel words are words that suck the life out of the words next to them, just as a weasel sucks the egg and leaves the shell.” [18] Don Watson’s book “The Dictionary of Weasel Words” (Knopf, Sydney, 2005) gives examples from “journalese” and political slogans such as “closure” and “border protection”. Watson defines weasel words as words which have been sucked dry of meaning and are “shells of words: words from which life has gone, facsimiles, frauds, corpses”. [19] The defendants submit that “responsible” is a weasel word. They complain they do not know the sense in which the word “responsible” is used and that if the imputation is allowed to be pleaded as is, they would be unsure how to defend it.[20] Mr Potter points out, in his submissions in reply, that in Marsden Hunt A-JA described the word “caused” as a weasel word, but held that this defect could be cured by an amendment to add the words “bore a responsibility for”. In other words, words connoting responsibility for something may in fact cure a weasel word problem, rather than cause it.[21] In Piggins v Denton [2006] NSWSC 954 Simpson J deplored the practice of defendants asserting that they did not know what evidence to lead to plead a defence of justification to an imputation that the plaintiff was responsible for a particular event. The word, once again, was “responsible”:  
     
     “[21] One of the objections taken to the form of this imputation concerned the use of the expression “is responsible for”. The complaint is that the imputation fails to specify in what respect the plaintiff is said to bear responsibility for the failure of the club; it fails to identify any act or condition which made him so responsible.  
      
      
     [22] This is a familiar refrain in the submissions of defendants concerning the formulation of imputations. It is frequently, as in this case, attached to a further argument about the difficulty a defendant would experience in attempting to justify the imputations. Underlying this is a notion that, in my opinion, ought to be exploded. It is that plaintiffs ought to be required to frame imputations in such a way as to facilitate the defence of the plaintiff’s claim. This is not so.” 
    [22] Similarly, in Dobson v Macquarie Radio Network Ltd [2007] NSWSC 718 Nicholas J noted at [13]-[18] in relation to another attack on “responsible”: 
     
     “[13] On the issue of form, the defendant submitted that “responsible” is a weasel word which has a variety of meanings, so that the use of the phrase “... bore a responsibility for ...” is ambiguous or equivocal. It was put that the imputation itself does not make clear the sense in which the phrase is to be understood in that it fails to specify in what respect the plaintiff is said to bear responsibility for the incidents. It was put that in failing to identify any act or condition on the part of the plaintiff which he claims was attributed to him, the imputation is likely to lead to confusion either at the pleading stage or at the trial in relation to the question for which the plaintiff contends, contrary to the principles considered in  
     Whelan v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd 
      (1988) 12 NSWLR 148, p 155;  
     Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd 
      [2005] NSWCA 255, para 119ff). 
      
      
     [14] Ordinarily, the sense in which an imputation is to be understood will be clear from its terms considered with regard to the context provided by the publication. Relevantly, in  
     John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Gacic 
      [2007] HCA 28, Callinan, Heydon, JJ said: 
      
      
      
      “194. ... To say that because the words of an imputation may reasonably convey more than one defamatory meaning or impression, or that because implications, inferences and imputations suggest more than one meaning or successive meanings, they must be rejected, would be to introduce unnatural and excessive refinement to the basic factual question whether the words (or the imputation) have defamed the plaintiff. Published matter may well convey a duality of meanings and impressions, not necessarily exclusive of one another, and sometimes with one leading to another, successive, inevitable or almost inevitable one.” 
       
       
      
     [15] In  
     Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation 
      (1990) 21 NSWLR 135, Gleeson, CJ (p 137) held that the degree of specificity required in the formulation of a defamatory imputation must be related to the nature and content of the defamatory matter. He said (p 137): 
      
      
      
      “Almost any attribution of an act or condition to a person is capable of both further refinement and further generalisation. In any given case a judgment needs to be made as to the degree of particularity or generality which is appropriate to the occasion, and as to what constitutes the necessary specificity. If a problem arises, the solution will usually be found in considerations of practical justice rather than philology ... 
       
       
      Furthermore, whilst the principles relevant to the plaintiff’s obligation remain constant their practical application may depend upon the facts and circumstances of the given case, and the relevant circumstances may include the manner in which the defendant, or the author of the defamatory matter, has expressed the defamatory matter. Defamation may come in the form of snide insinuation or robust denunciation, or something in between those two extremes. The attribution to a person of an act or condition may be done with a high degree of particularity or it may take the form of the most generalised and non-specific abuse ... The requirement upon a plaintiff cannot go beyond doing the best that can reasonably be done in the circumstances.” 
      
      
     [16] In  
     Jackson & Ors v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd  
     [Unreported, NSWSC, 17 October 1996] Levine, J accepted that where the tenor and thrust of the disparagement in the publication is in general terms, and nothing is said of a specific activity, it is not required that the imputation specify some precise act or condition. (See also  
     Vella v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd 
      [2000] NSWSC 615, para 10;  
     Piggins v Denton 
      [2006] NSWSC 954, paras 18, 25, 26.) 
      
      
     [17] Consistently with the emphasis given in the cases to the relationship between the terms of the pleaded imputation and the matter complained of, Ipp, JA in  
     Gacic v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd  
     [2006] NSWCA 175 in a passage approved of by the High Court of Australia in  
     John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd  
     [2007] HCA 28 (para 174) said: 
      
      
      
      “119. ... The question as to the meaning that the words convey to the ordinary person should be a simple and straightforward one, as befits a law that governs the everyday life and actions of all levels of persons in the community. The question should not be obscured by overly complex and subtle metaphysical distinctions that stand as a formidably esoteric barrier to what should be an easily comprehensible reasoning process akin to common sense.” 
      
      
     [18] I am unpersuaded that, having regard to the general tenor and language of the matter complained of referable to the plaintiff, the imputation lacks precision. The attack upon the plaintiff is directed, in general terms, to his conduct whilst in charge of the Goulburn Police Academy between 2002 and 2005. Its general tenor and language is to demand that he be held to account for the incidents which took place on his watch. I accept the plaintiff’s submissions that the smear is couched in general terms, without specification of his conduct other than that he was the person in charge for the relevant period.” 
    [23] While each use of the word must depend on the context, as long as the sense of the word is clear, use of words such as “responsible” should cause no difficulty in imputations, particularly under the new Act, where the imputation is no longer the cause of action.[24] The matter complained of sets out the plaintiff is the “director or owner” of Beechwood Homes and seeks to blame him in that capacity. There is no confusion or imprecision about this imputation and I decline to strike it out.Imputation 4(b) and use of words from the matter complained of[25] The defendants objections to imputation 4(b) are to the use of the word “incompetent” as a repetition of the words of the matter complained of (Harvey at [118]-[132]) and to the words “so incompetent that he should not be chosen by anyone to build their home” as a rhetorical flourish. These objections to form require careful analysis.Use of the words of the matter complained of[26] Objections to imputations which adopt the words of the matter complained of were commonly made when the imputation was the cause of action, but are of increasingly less weight under the new legislation, particularly in light of a series of Court of Appeal decisions permitting such imputations where the use of the word clearly captures the sting of the meaning.[27] Ever since Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682, when Hutley JA commented that it was “strange to hear the suggestion that this defendant does not understand an imputation which is precisely in the words it has used” the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the entitlement of a party to plead an imputation using the language of the matter complained of provided that this accurately encapsulated the sting of the imputation rather than merely repeating the words. Gleeson CJ reiterated the correctness of Hepburn in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 148 as did Hodgson JA in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake; David Syme & Co v Blake (2001) 53 NSWLR 541 at [52]-[54]. More recently, McColl JA in Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213 noted the use of the words of the matter complained of is permissible.[28] There is no defect in the adoption of words used by the defendants in the matter complained of where the meaning of the imputation is clear from the context of the publication.Rhetorical flourish[29] The defendants also complains that the second half of the imputation is a “rhetorical flourish” which does not add to the sting of the imputation: Mayfield-Smith v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 419 at 420; Waterhouse v David Syme & Co Ltd [2000] NSWSC 817 at [22].[30] In Viney v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1273 Simpson J at [24] deplored this practice:  
     
     “If that is what is meant by “a rhetorical imputation”, a complaint to that effect merely duplicates a complaint that the imputations in question fall foul of the rule. In my opinion, the time has come for defendants’ counsel to bury the practice of attacking imputations pleaded by plaintiffs on the basis that they are “rhetorical”; alternatively to specify precisely what they mean by the epithet. Otherwise, the complaint is, itself, mere rhetoric.” 
    [31] In Buckley v Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] NSWDC 102 I took into account, on the issue of costs, the fact that a defendant brought such an application in the face of Simpson J’s warnings. [32] Even if there were a prohibition on rhetorical imputations, it would be ridiculous to impose it where the matter complained of itself asks rhetorical questions such as the question posed in the matter complained of from which this imputation arises: “Would you want this Master Builder to build your home, I sure would not.” [33] The second half of the imputation is not rhetorical. It is a clause of degree, in that the degree of incompetence is spelled out. It is descriptive rather than rhetorical.[34] The defendants’ complaints about this imputation are dismissed.Imputations 4(c), 6(a) and 8(a) and lack of precision[35] The defendants submit that these three imputations lack precision because the plaintiff does not identify the persons to whom the false claims are made. Ms Chrysanthou relied upon two decisions concerning imputations of suspicion. In Greig v WIN Television NSW Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1118 Nicholas J refused to strike out an imputation that the plaintiff conducted herself in such a way “so as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion” of misconduct, but without identifying who suspected her. In David v Abdishou [2007] NSWSC 1195 an imputation that the plaintiff “was the subject of legal proceedings against him for insider trading” was struck out because it contained no statement of reasonable grounds for the proceedings, or that the plaintiff’s conduct was such as to warrant the proceedings against him, in circumstances where the proceedings could just as easily have been commenced by an irresponsible person as a responsible person (Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 at 680F). [36] Imputations about a person whose conduct gives rise to a reasonable suspicion often, although not always, have to have the person who suspects them identified, because that is part of the sting. These imputations are different kinds of imputations. The sting is that the plaintiff knowingly tried to deceive homeowners by false claims that major problems were in fact minor ones. The imputation clearly identifies the persons who are deceived, namely the homeowners. [37] I accept the plaintiff’s submission that this is an excessive refinement. The persons the plaintiff was trying to deceive were homeowners, so it is unnecessary to add the words “to them”.[38] The word “more” was omitted from these imputations. This is the first of several typographical errors which the defendants complain about. These are matters that should be raised in correspondence between the parties and not in submissions before the court. Typographical errors are easily made, and just as easily corrected, by correspondence between the parties, and are not appropriate matters for complaint to the court. Imputation 4(d) and rolled-up imputations[39] The defendants submit that this imputation rolls up imputations of dishonesty and incompetency into one.[40] Somewhat inconsistently, there is no objection to the use of the actual words “shonky” and “crook”, probably because they have been permitted in other proceedings (Bass v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 34; Dix Gardner Pty Ltd v Strathfield Municipal Council [2003] NSWSC 597 at [4]-[6] (endorsing Dunford J’s decision in Bass v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 270 at [6]).[41] “Crook” is a word with a number of meanings, as the dictionary shows. It can function as a noun, adjective or verb. As a noun, its meanings can include dishonesty (eg “corporate crook”: Gillespie v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 553) or illness. As part of a verb (“to go crook”) it can mean to express anger. As an adjective, “crook” or “crooked” can mean dishonesty or bad workmanship.[42] However, the sting of an imputation needs more than a list of meanings from a dictionary. Language is not a vertical list of dictionary words, not is it a horizontal grammatical sentence structure; to obtain meaning we look behind the words and grammar, as Chomsky demonstrated with his sample sentence “colourless green ideas sleep furiously” (“Syntactic Structures”, Paris, 1957, p. 15). [43] The matter complained of is a litany of complaints about the buildings erected by Beechwood Homes. The use of “crook” to describe the builder is a reference to the kind of builder he is, namely a bad builder. “Bad” or “inferior” are in the list of definitions given for “crook” in the Macquarie Dictionary, and when the allegation underlying the words is looked at, this is the sting of the imputation. The semantic (as opposed to the dictionary) meaning of the word “crook” can be obtained from the context of the publication. [44] Further, the fact that a word or phrase used by the defendant in the matter complained of is capable of more than one meaning is something that can no longer be the subject of complaint by a defendant. In John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Gacic (2007) 230 CLR 291 at [194] the High Court explained: 
     
     “It is too categorical to say that imputations must be scrutinized for a duality of inferences, and, if a duality is found, rejected. We certainly do not think that their Lordships went nearly so far in  
     Lewis 
     . We take Lord Hodson, in referring to the drawing of an inference from an inference, to be saying no more than that in the circumstances of the case, to allege that suspicion implied or meant actual guilt was unreasonable. Lord Devlin stated that ""two fences have to be taken instead of one,"" and that to impute guilt would be to ""take the second in the same stride"". In this case both the trial judge initially and Ipp JA in the Court of Appeal were sceptical about such a far-reaching proposition, and, in our opinion, rightly so. The real question is as to the impression that the words are likely to make upon the reasonable reader. The way in which the trial judge put that issue to the jury in this case initially, was substantially correct. To say that because the words of an imputation may reasonably convey more than one defamatory meaning or impression, or that because implications, inferences and imputations suggest more than one meaning or successive meanings, they must be rejected, would be to introduce unnatural and excessive refinement to the basic factual question whether the words (or the imputation) have defamed the plaintiff. Published matter may well convey a duality of meanings and impressions, not necessarily exclusive of one another, and sometimes with one leading to another, successive, inevitable or almost inevitable one.” 
    [45] In the context of this publication, the meaning of the word “crook” does not contain the meaning asserted by the defendants, and the imputation is consequently not a rolled up imputation. I reject the defendants’ objections to the form of this imputation.[46] An objection was also taken to the word “responsible” and I reject this submission for the same reasons as for imputation 4(a). Imputation 8(b)[47] This is another imputation where there is a typographical error; the imputation should read “the plaintiff sought to cover up”.[48] The defendants submit that the words “cover up” lack specificity and are ambiguous, and that the imputation should plead how it is alleged that the plaintiff covered up serious building defects.[49] Imputations of a cover up have been permitted in many defamation actions, of which Coates v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 292 (covering up an Olympic controversy), SMEC Holdings v Boniface [2007] NSWSC 1402 (covering up criminal activities), Dobson v Macquarie Radio Network Ltd [2007] NSWSC 718 (covering up a sex scandal), Fakhoury v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 561 (covering up corrupt payments), Hanneybel v Uniflex (Australia) Pty Ltd [2002] WASCA 349 (cover up failure to comply with fire standards) are some of the most recent. In none of these cases where the “cover up” imputation was challenged was the challenge accepted. [50] A further objection is that this imputation does not differ in substance from imputation 8(a); this was developed in oral submissions as a claim that this is a “fallback” imputation.[51] These two imputations clearly differ in substance. Pretending serious defects are inconsequential is quite different to denying they exist. Nor is it the case that one is an alternative to, or more serious than, the other, and thus a fallback.[52] The objections to form of this imputation are rejected.Imputation 8(c)[53] This is another imputation where there is a typographical error. The word “reported” is missing. The defendants have now withdrawn their objection to it. Conclusions concerning the submissions on the form of the imputations[54] The defendants’ objections to the form of the imputations are all rejected. This brings me to the issue of the capacity of certain imputations that are the subject of challenge by the defendants.Imputations - capacity[55] The principles governing the issue of capacity are set out in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2007) Aust Torts Reports 81-915; [2007] NSWCA 254 at [14]. Mr Potter draws my attention to the following factors as relevant to these publications: 
     
     (a) if reasonable persons may differ as to whether the matter complained of was capable of carrying the imputation pleaded, then the issue must be left to the jury; 
      
     (b) the ordinary reasonable meaning of the matter complained of may be either its literal meaning or what is inferred from it. In deciding whether any particular imputation is capable of being conveyed, the question is whether it is reasonably so capable; 
      
     (c) the ordinary reasonable reader is prone to a certain amount of loose thinking; and, 
      
     (d) a wide degree of latitude is given where (as is the case here) the words published are imprecise, ambiguous, loose, fanciful or unusual. 
      
    [56] The context of the matter complained of, and its manner of presentation, with bold headings, capital letters and exclamation marks (e.g. “HELP remove crook builders!”), strong terms such as “shonky” and the general tone of high drama are relevant to (c) and (d).[57] The matters complained of are not publications that shrink from striking at the plaintiff. Only three of the imputations are challenged on the basis of capacity; I will consider each one in turn.Imputation 4(c)[58] The defendants submit there is nothing to suggest knowledge by the plaintiff, but I consider that lines 39 and following make it clear that this “minor ‘defective’ work” was referred to the plaintiff clearly infers that the plaintiff knew about the problems and also, because of the use of quotations, made representations about them (about which the defendants are being sarcastic). The whole of the matter complained of, with its constant pejorative refrain, is to the effect that the plaintiff knows his obligations but chooses to lie or deny instead of agreeing with the defendants concerning their many complaints.[59] This imputation is capable of being conveyed.Imputation 4(d)[60] The defendants’ submission that an imputation of being a “crook builder” is incapable of arising is hard to reconcile with the fact that the most eye-catching part of the matter complained of states in bold type : “HELP remove crook builders!” This clearly is a reference to the plaintiff, who is described elsewhere as the owner of the business and as a Master Builder.[61] This imputation is capable of being conveyed.Imputation 8(c)[62] The defendants submit that “unreasonably refused” is not capable of arising. However, there are many references to the plaintiff’s unreasonable conduct, notably the assertion that he refused even to attend a meeting to discuss the defects (lines 74 – 9).[63] This imputation is capable of being conveyed.Costs[64] The defendants seek an order for costs on the basis that even if they are wholly unsuccessful, the plaintiff must file an Amended Statement of Claim because of typing errors in some of the imputations.[65] Counsel for the plaintiff has indicated he is happy to file an Amended Statement of Claim to correct these errors. It will also give the plaintiff an opportunity to add the references to publication in Victoria and Queensland in lieu of “and elsewhere”. [66] However, I do not consider the defendants should be entitled to any costs. They have been entirely unsuccessful on every issue. Complaints about typing errors are not matters that should be brought before the court at any time. They should be resolved in correspondence between the solicitors.Orders(1) Defendants’ objections to form and capacity of the plaintiff’s imputations dismissed.(2) Plaintiff file an Amended Statement of Claim correcting typing errors and identifying places of publication by 4pm 2 July 2009.(3) These proceedings stood over to the Defamation List for further directions at 9:00am on Friday 3 July.(4) The defendants pay the plaintiff’s costs of this application.(5) No order as to the costs thrown away by reason of the amendments to the Statement of Claim.

      Introduction 
       
      The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon her in the District Court following her pleas of guilty to various offences. Count 1 alleged that between 1 and 30 September 2005 the applicant attempted to use a child under 14 years (namely a girl then aged 13) for pornographic purposes. The victim, whom I shall refer to as L, is the applicant’s niece. The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 14 years. The remaining seven counts all related to events which occurred on a date between 10 and 14 June 2006. Counts 2-4 alleged that the applicant aided and abetted sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years. Count 2 related to a child, whom I shall refer to as J., who was aged 6, whilst counts 3 and 4 related to a child, whom I shall refer to as R., who was aged 9. J. and R. are the applicant’s daughters. The maximum penalty for those offences is imprisonment for 25 years. Counts 5 and 6 alleged that the applicant used a child under 14 for pornographic purposes. Count 5 related to R. and count 6 to J. The maximum penalty for those offences is imprisonment for 14 years. Count 7 alleged that the applicant produced child pornography whilst count 8 alleged that she disseminated child pornography. Each of those offences attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Three further offences on a Form 1, being two offences of possessing child pornography and one offence of producing it, were taken into account when the applicant was sentenced in respect of count 2. 
       
      
    4 The following sentences were imposed upon the applicant. In respect of count 1, a fixed term of 2 years 4 months to date from 11 December 2006 (the date upon which the applicant went into custody) was imposed. In respect of each of counts 7 and 8, a fixed term of 3 years to date from 11 December 2007 was imposed. In respect of each of counts 5 and 6, a fixed term of 4 years 2 months 12 days to date from 11 December 2007 was imposed. In respect of each of counts 3 and 4, a non-parole period of 8 years with a total term of 12 years imprisonment to date from 11 December 2007 was imposed. In respect of count 2, and taking into account the Form 1 matters, a non-parole of 8 years with a total term of 12 years 9 months to date from 11 December 2007 was imposed. The total effective sentence comprises a non-parole period of 9 years which expires on 10 December 2015 with a total term of 13 years 9 months which expires on 10 September 2020. The sentences imposed in respect of counts 2-7 were partially accumulated upon the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 which, as will be apparent, related to an offence committed upon a separate victim on a separate occasion. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    5 The matter proceeded by way of an agreed statement of facts, the most salient features of which I shall now endeavour to encapsulate. In about April 2005 the applicant began corresponding by email with a man whom I shall refer to as DC. He is an American citizen who was then living in the United States. At about the same time L. began living with the applicant. The applicant’s two daughters, to whom I have already referred, also lived with her. 
     
      
    6 By July 2005 the applicant and DC were corresponding by email on a daily basis. The conversations between the applicant and DC mainly involved DC wanting the applicant to invent games for “sex parties”. The parties and games involved adult sex. Around this time DC told the applicant that he had a foot fetish so the applicant began including feet in her suggested games and stories. In about August 2005 DC asked the applicant if she would masturbate and use her web camera so that he could see her doing so. The applicant agreed to DC’s request and every second day or so she would masturbate herself with sex toys. DC would masturbate at the same time but, unlike the applicant, he did not use a web camera to capture his activities.7 In about September 2005 DC began asking the applicant to provide him with pictures of L. with her breasts exposed. These requests continued for a period of about a month and culminated in DC asking the applicant for pictures of L. whilst she was naked. One afternoon towards the end of September, L. was watching television in the lounge room of the family home whilst the applicant was “chatting” to DC by email on a computer in the same room. The applicant said to L., “[DC] would like a photo of you naked, if you do this, I’ll buy you a phone and some playstation games.” L. said, “No” and went to her bedroom. The applicant followed L. into her bedroom. She produced a pair of scissors and told L. that if she did not allow her to take a photo, she would “cut [her] clothes off [her]”. L. said, “I don’t care, you’re not getting one”. The applicant threw the scissors on to the floor and left the room. She went back to the computer and told DC that she and L. had had a fight. She told DC that “it wasn’t going to happen”. 
     
      
    8 About an hour later the applicant signed back on to the computer. DC was online and typed out words to the effect of “[j]ust kick her out, I don’t care where she lives. I don’t care if she lives in the street.” The applicant typed, “Okay. It’ll be done.” It is clear that DC believed that L. had been told to leave the house and that she was no longer living with the applicant because he never referred to L. again. (Those facts constituted the offence which gave rise to count 1). 
     
      
    9 Towards the end of September DC began showing an interest in the applicant’s daughter, R. At about that time, as well as communicating online, the applicant and DC began talking to each other on the telephone. They spoke on the telephone about three times a week. During this period the applicant’s daughters also began talking to DC on the telephone as well as corresponding with him by email. 
     
      
    10 On an occasion in October the applicant, whilst corresponding online with DC, told him that her daughters and two young boys were playing outside in the pool. DC said, “I want some pics”. The applicant said, “Of what?” DC said, “Of the boys in the pool”. The applicant told DC that the web camera did not reach that far. Over the next couple of days, DC asked the applicant to locate boys aged between 11 and 13 whom he wanted her to invite back to her house. He requested that she take photos of them whilst they were naked and asked her to send the photos to him. These requests continued for a period of about two weeks. To avoid an argument, the applicant told DC that she had been out looking but had been unable to find any suitable boys.  
     
      
    11 For the next few months the applicant continued to communicate regularly with DC both online and by telephone. During this period, whenever the applicant mentioned that her daughters were playing with boys at her home, DC would ask her to take photos of the boys whilst they were naked. The applicant declined to do so. 
     
      
    12 The applicant and DC had an argument on Christmas Eve. As a consequence, they spoke with each other on only one occasion during the month which followed. 
     
      
    13 In February 2006 DC contacted the applicant on line and asked her if they could begin talking again. The applicant agreed, and although nothing of a sexual nature was discussed between them, they began communicating again online about two or three times a week.  
     
      
    14 The frequency of their contact increased towards the end of May and into the early part of June. During these conversations the applicant’s daughter R. again became the focus of attention. R. would often wave to DC over the web camera before she went to school,.15 On 10 June DC asked the applicant online for explicit photos of R. DC said, “I want some pix of her and J. today”. The applicant asked, “doing what?” DC asked the applicant, “any suggestions?” The applicant replied, “no idea”. DC then said, “oiled feet”, “naked”, “touching each others pussies”, ”rubbing feet on each other”, “them rubbing”, “licking each other”. The applicant replied, “and who said u didn’t know what u wanted”. DC said, “you naked, them one on each leg all masturbating”. The applicant said, “that one could be tough, but see what we can do”. Later DC asked the applicant, “any thing on this vast list that you can’t do?” The applicant replied, “u know me I will do all that I can” and “I told u which one would be difficult”. 
     
      
    16 The following day the applicant picked her daughters up from school at around lunch time and took them home. When they arrived home, the applicant told her daughters that “[w]e are going to play, have some fun and send some pics to Daddy D”. The applicant asked her daughters to take their clothes off in the lounge room. She then told them to play together whilst she took photos of them. The applicant asked them to put their feet together, to ride a bike, and to wrestle. After a while the applicant asked her daughters (who were still undressed) to get into various positions and to do the things which DC had requested, including performing cunnilingus on each other. Some months later a number of photographs were seized from DC’s computer. It was the conduct that that material revealed which gave rise to counts 2 to 7. Amongst the photographs were three images which depicted J. and R. (whose faces could be seen) performing acts of cunnilingus upon each other. One of the images depicted R. performing cunnilingus on J. (Count 2). The other two images depicted J. performing cunnilingus on R. (Counts 3 and 4). The photographs depicted the genitalia of each child (Counts 5 and 6). The photographing of the children, who were either fully or partially naked, took about an hour. The applicant, who remained fully clothed, took the photos on the web camera which was connected to the computer. The applicant saved the images on her computer in a file entitled “DC”. (This conduct gave rise to count 7). 
     
      
    17 The following day (14 June) the applicant sent 17 images to DC’s email address. When she spoke to DC online later that day the applicant said, “and that is your girls fingering each other”. Some of the photos which were seized depict digital penetration but the faces of the participants cannot be discerned. DC told the applicant that he had not received the images and so the applicant sent them to him again. The applicant asked DC if the images were okay and told him “there are your girls eating each other” (The act of sending the images to DC constituted Count 8). 
     
      
    18 Although the applicant and DC continued to communicate, there was no further discussion about sexual matters. Sometime in August, DC asked the applicant if she would pay for him to come to Australia. The applicant agreed to do so and DC arrived in Australia on 28 September. The applicant picked him up from the airport and took him to her home where he stayed until his arrest in December. 
     
      
    19 In July 2006 police in the United States began an investigation into a number of burglaries. As a result of the investigation, police executed a search warrant on a motel room in Booneville, Mississippi. During the search a Toshiba laptop computer was seized. An examination of the laptop hard drive by the FBI revealed a record of the email communication between DC and the applicant in June of that year. In particular, FBI analysts located a record of the conversation in which DC asked the applicant to photograph her daughters. FBI analysts also found 17 images of J. and R. in a variety of sexual poses and activities. Further analysis identified the applicant’s email account as being the source of the images. On 8 December 2006 authorities in the United States informed the Australian Federal Police about what they had discovered. 
     
      
    20 On 11 December 2006 police executed a search warrant upon the applicant’s home address. DC and the applicant were at home at the time and were arrested. During a search of the applicant’s house, police found and seized the applicant’s computer. An examination of the computer’s hard drive revealed a folder entitled “DC”. Inside the folder an email containing 5 pornographic images of R. was found. In the same “DC” folder a second email containing 4 pornographic images of R. was found. (These discoveries gave rise to the three Form 1 offences). 
     
      
    21 Following her arrest, the applicant was taken to Mount Druitt Police Station where she agreed to be interviewed by investigating police. During the interview the police showed the applicant a transcript of the online conversation which had taken place on 10 June between her and DC. She said that the “person R” mentioned was not her daughter but an adult friend of hers. Police also showed the applicant the transcript of the online conversation that had taken place on 12 June. The applicant admitted that one of the persons referred to in it was her daughter R. but denied that she had been talking about her daughters during the conversation on 10 June. 
     
      
    22 The applicant was asked about the pornographic images which were sent to DC on 14 June. She admitted sending DC photos of her “own anatomy” but denied taking photos of her daughters whilst they were involved in any sexual activity with one another. She continued to deny that the pornographic images were of her daughters and said, “that’s not a picture of them, but I would have given the impression that it was them”. The applicant did admit to taking photos of her daughters whilst they were naked and with their feet near their genitals. She said that she had sent them to DC because “he likes feet”. The applicant also said that “it was something that I just did because I know he likes feet and the girls know he likes feet”. She said that it was not done at the request of DC, and that “it was something that I did on my own”. 
     
      
    23 The sentencing judge described the offences in the following fashion: 
     
      
       
        
        The actions of the offender were outrageous and disgusting. They involved gross breaches of trust of her daughters – two very young girls who were entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from the risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulty in later life because of the vile conduct of their natural mother. These offences were committed in the sanctity of their own home. It does not need words of mine to indicate how the community would view this type of behaviour. Various epithets can be used such as “outrageous” and “disgusting”. It suffices to say that the community would regard these offences as carrying considerable criminality indeed, as I have said, and, consistent with the principles to which I will refer shortly, that these offences would carry substantial periods of full-time custody. 
        
       
       
        
        The photographs which had to be viewed by the legal representatives and this Court can only be described as stomach-churning. It is almost incomprehensible that a mother of two young girls could behave in such a way. Sadly, she is not the only mother in custody for behaving in such a fashion. In recent times there have been a number of matters before this Court and other courts of a similar vein – mothers who are prepared to engage their children in sexual activity in an endeavour to comply with the demands made upon them by others. 
        
       
       
        
        These young victims were vulnerable in every sense of that word. They are very young and, of course, incapable of standing up for themselves against the wishes of their mother, irrespective of whether they thought they were playing a game. Perhaps at the time they were too young to realize what they were being encouraged to do was wrong. Sadly, as they mature and become aware of what was done to them they will come to the realisation that they are victims of sexual abuse. Not only did this offender encourage them to engage in sexual acts, but she then photographed them and she published those photos. She had the opportunity to think overnight about what she had done but she chose to send the photographs the following day – not once, but twice when she realised the photos had not been received.  
        
       
       
      The applicant’s subjective case 
       
      
    24 The sentencing judge was furnished with information about the applicant by way of a pre-sentence report and a psychological report prepared by Ms Anne McGregor, as well as from evidence which the applicant herself gave. The applicant was born in May 1967 and was accordingly 38 when the offence giving rise to count 1 was committed, and 39 when she committed the remaining offences. The applicant was raised in a stable family environment and is one of four siblings. However, she only maintains a relationship with one of them. She was a high achiever at high school both academically and otherwise. After completing her Higher School Certificate she commenced, but did not finish a university degree. After leaving university, she entered the workforce where she remained in regular employment for a period of about 10 years. She worked in a number of positions in the hospitality industry, including in a managerial capacity. She left the workforce when R. was about 2 and, at the time of the offences, was a full-time single parent. 
     
      
    25 The applicant’s mother died in 1991, an event which had a profound impact upon her. The evidence reveals that as a result the applicant developed significant “abandonment issues”. In the months leading up to June 2006, the applicant’s father became very ill. It would appear that it fell to the applicant to assume much of the burden for providing him with support. His illness is said to have also caused her a high degree of emotional distress. 
     
      
    26 The evidence revealed that the applicant has experienced great difficulties in forming intimate relationships and that she has had very few such relationships of any significance. She had a two year relationship when she was a teenager which she terminated because she found her partner to be too controlling. Shortly after her mother died, she met her ex-husband who is the father of her two children. Her ex-husband was a heavy drinker and was reported to have mentally abused her. That relationship lasted for about 12 years but the applicant eventually terminated it because she said that she was “sick to death of being miserable”. Since her incarceration, the applicant has had no contact of any kind with her children who now reside with their father. 
     
      
    27 The applicant described herself as being a “lonely, overweight woman who had a propensity to try to make others happy, even at her own expense”. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was lonely and that she had few friends. It was against that background that the applicant began to use the internet to seek out friendships. In due course she came into contact with DC. The applicant admitted that she had hoped that the relationship with him might develop into an intimate one. That apparently did not occur even after he came out to Australia to stay with her in the latter part of 2006. In any event, it would appear that the applicant succumbed to pressure from DC to involve herself in these very serious crimes because of her desire to win his affection. 
     
      
    28 The applicant has, for all and intents purposes, a clear criminal history. The only previous matter recorded against her was an offence of mid-range PCA committed in 1990 and, as the sentence judge correctly observed, it was of “no consequence” so far as the present proceedings were concerned. 
     
      
    29 The sentencing judge nevertheless observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        [t]he fact that she is a person of otherwise good character is of little assistance to her. All too often those who have no prior criminal antecedents commit these types of offences. It is their otherwise good behaviour which often prevents detection. They hide behind the façade of respectability, confident that if the children were to come forth and complain they would not be believed because their mother is a person who is otherwise held in high regard by others. 
        
       
      
    30 On 24 August 2007 the applicant pleaded guilty to counts 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the Local Court and was committed for sentence to the District Court. At that stage they were the only matters with which she had been charged. On 28 August 2007 the applicant provided a statement to police in which she set out the details of the evidence which she was prepared to give against DC. In due course she signed an undertaking to that effect. In her statement, she described most, if not all, of the matters which were set out in the agreed statement of facts which, as I have said, was tendered at the sentence hearing. She also admitted matters which she had previously denied, including the conversations with DC in June 2006 in which he had asked her to involve her daughters in the sexual acts which gave rise to counts 2-4. On 13 December 2007 the applicant appeared in the District Court for sentence. Just prior to that appearance, the Crown informed her legal representative that it was going to present an ex-officio indictment against her which contained, in addition to the five matters to which she had already pleaded, the three further counts which eventually became counts 2 - 4. After briefly conferring with her legal representative, the applicant pleaded not guilty to those three additional counts whilst adhering to her pleas to the original five matters. The applicant’s legal representative then went on leave. Upon his return from leave, he arranged a conference at the gaol with the applicant and the informant. Immediately upon being shown that part of the Crown brief which contained images of the events which gave rise to counts 2-4, the applicant instructed her solicitor to enter pleas of guilty to those counts as well. The Crown was then advised that the applicant had changed her pleas. These events occurred some two to three weeks before the scheduled trial date. The sentencing judge extended to the applicant a discount of 25% for her pleas of guilty to counts 1 and 5-8 and a discount of 20% for her pleas of guilty to counts 2-4 upon the basis that they were not entered at the earliest opportunity. Having considered all the material, and having heard the applicant give evidence at the sentence hearing, Her Honour concluded that “she is truly remorseful and contrite”.  
     
      
    31 Although the applicant was initially less than forthright about what she had done, the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant “has developed insight into the potential harm that she has caused. ….and [that] she will need assistance in minimising her risk of relapse and re-offending post release”. It was in that context that her Honour made a finding “that with supervision and counselling the risk of re-offending is minimal”. 
     
      
    32 The sentencing judge allowed the applicant a further discount of 20% for her assistance to the authorities. The assistance related to evidence which she indicated she was prepared to give against DC. The sentencing judge described the assistance as being “significant” and acknowledged that the applicant’s motivation for providing it was entirely genuine. Her Honour also accepted the applicant’s evidence that she “needs to stop [DC] from doing this to anyone else [and that she] needs to live with herself knowing that she has done everything within her power to stop him”.  
     
      
    33 In the upshot, DC ended up pleading guilty to his involvement in these offences. The applicant nonetheless indicated her preparedness to honour her undertaking should a dispute arise about the facts upon which DC was to be sentenced. The significance of her assistance, as the applicant acknowledged, was to remove from circulation a person who was described as “an on-line predator”. Her Honour accepted that the applicant was on protection as a consequence of her decision to assist the authorities. The fact that she was known to a Correctional Services officer as well as the nature of the offences which she had committed provided additional reasons for her being in that form of custody. 
     
      
    34 The evidence before the sentencing judge revealed that the applicant had been progressing well since her incarceration. She had not incurred any institutional charges and had been working in trusted positions as a sweeper in the reception area and in the mental health support unit. She was described by custodial staff as being “a model inmate who relates well to staff and other inmates”. 
     
      
    35 The sentencing judge made a finding of “special circumstances” because, as her Honour explained, “[t]here is clearly a need for lengthy and supervised parole to ensure attendance at appropriate counselling and to minimise the risk of relapse” and because this was her first time in gaol. 
     
      
    36 The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      1 The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      2 (i) The sentencing judge erred in treating the applicant’s previous good character as irrelevant. 
       
       
       (ii) The sentencing judge erred in making a generalisation that evidence of previous good character should not be a mitigating factor in child sexual assault cases. 
       
       
      3 The sentencing judge, having found the offender’s risk of re-offending to be minimal, erred in law by emphasising the need for specific deterrence. 
       
       
      4 A different, less severe, sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed. 
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    37 The nub of the applicant’s submission in respect of Ground 1 can be briefly stated. It was contended that since an overall effective discount of 40% was extended to the applicant for her pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities, it followed that the sentencing judge must have had in mind a starting point of approximately 23 years imprisonment in order to arrive at the effective total term of imprisonment of 13 years 9 months. Even allowing for the fact that the applicant had committed offences of the utmost gravity, it was argued that such a starting point was manifestly excessive. I accept that submission and I am fortified in doing so by the Crown Prosecutor’s concession to that effect made during oral argument.  
     
      
    38 The court was provided with summaries of a number of cases which were said to bear comparability to the present case. However, given that the facts of the present case are highly unusual, and particularly since only one of the cases to which the court was referred concerned a female offender, I am of the view that those authorities are of only limited assistance. That said, the impression which I have gained from them serves to confirm my view that the sentences in the present case are indeed manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    39 Having arrived at that conclusion, it follows that the court should proceed to re-sentence the applicant. In those circumstances it is unnecessary to consider the remaining grounds of appeal. For the purposes of re-sentencing, I have had regard to the contents of an affidavit sworn by the applicant. In it she candidly acknowledges that being on protection has had only a “limited impact” upon her. Indeed she has been able to maintain her employment as a sweeper. She has also managed to complete the Tertiary Preparation Program through the University of Southern Queensland and achieved good marks in doing so. She has now enrolled to undertake a Bachelor of Arts degree (majoring in English literature) by correspondence with the same university. She says that she was distressed when she was unable to attend the funeral of her father who died after she went into custody. She also describes the pain associated with being ostracised from her family. She expresses the hope that she may, in time, be able to re-establish a relationship with her children and the rest of her family. However, she recognises that she requires on-going professional assistance to enable her to address her underlying problems. 
     
      
    40 In re-sentencing the applicant it is of course necessary to have regard to the various principles which inform the sentencing process including the maximum penalties which have been prescribed for the various offences in question. Consideration must be given to all the circumstances in which the offences on the indictment, as well as the three Form 1 offences, occurred. As the mother of two of the victims and as an adult who was in a position of authority in relation to the third, the offences which the applicant committed involved a very significant breach of trust on her part. See R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1 [at par 20]. The victims were subjected to abuse in the sanctity of their own home, a place where they were entitled to feel safe and secure. It is also necessary to have regard to the number of victims, and to their ages, although it is important to recognise that the age of the various victims is, in most instances, an element of the offence: see generally R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at 585; and MLP v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 93 [at paras 18-22]. 
     
      
    41 Clearly enough the offences giving rise to counts 2-4 are the most serious. Although it makes little difference in the overall assessment of the applicant’s criminality, it may be accepted that despite the fact that she instructed the victims as to what they were to do, she did not personally interfere with them. The offences were not accompanied by any violence and nor was there any penetration of the sexual organs of the victims. Furthermore, it appears that the applicant participated in these activities only after a degree of persistence over a considerable period of time on the part of DC. Those requests came from a person upon whose friendship the applicant placed a high premium. By the same token the offences could hardly have been said to have occurred spontaneously.  
     
      
    42 Whilst it is true, so far as the offence giving rise to count 1 is concerned, that the applicant ultimately desisted in making overtures towards the victim, she did so only after first having offered the victim inducements to participate and after then having threatened her. So far as count 8 is concerned, the applicant deleted the images after she had sent them to DC. However, once she had sent them to him she had no control over what he might do with them, even if she may have believed or perhaps hoped, that he too would delete them once he had viewed them. 
     
      
    43 On the other hand, there are a number of factors upon which the applicant is entitled to rely which serve to significantly ameliorate the otherwise appropriate sentence. The applicant is entitled to a substantial discount for her pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities. In my view the applicant should receive the same overall effective discount of 40% which was provided to her by the sentencing judge. I would also extend an additional measure of leniency to the applicant for her expressions of remorse. The applicant is also entitled to call in aid, in accordance with well-settled principles, her prior good character. For a discussion of the relevant authorities see R v Gent (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 [at paras 45-69] per Johnson J. See also Kite v R [2009] NSWCCA 12 [ at para 19); R v Woods [2009] NSWCCA 55 [at para 65]. 
     
      
    44 I accept the sentencing judge’s conclusion that so long as she responds satisfactorily to supervision, the applicant is at “minimal risk” of re-offending. I would also confirm the finding of “special circumstances” for the reasons given by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    45 There is one other matter that needs to be considered. In respect of counts 2-4 the sentencing judge made the following observations: 
     
      
       
        
        These are offences contrary to the provisions of s 66A of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , offences which attract maximum penalties of twenty-five years imprisonment. Offences contrary to s 66A of the  
        Crimes Act 
         attract standard non-parole periods of fifteen years imprisonment following upon a guilty verdict after trial for offences failing within the mid range of objective seriousness. 
        
       
      
    46 Her Honour characterised the offences as falling within the mid-range of objective seriousness. Her Honour then observed that the pleas of guilty “and the fact that the offences are ones of aiding and abetting are matters which may amount to reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period”. It may be inferred that her Honour had those considerations in mind when she imposed sentence. 
     
      
    47 Neither in written submissions nor in oral argument did the applicant challenge the sentencing judge’s conclusion that the standard non-parole period provisions applied to the present offences. On the other hand the Crown did raise the issue and sought to rely upon this court’s decision in Hosseini v R [2009] NSWCCA 52 as providing support for the conclusion that the standard non-parole provisions do apply to offences of aiding and abetting. The court there decided that the standard non-parole period provisions applied to an offence of “knowingly take part” in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs.  
     
      
    48 It was in that context that the Court requested that the parties provide supplementary written submissions upon the issue. In Hosseini (supra) Price J, (with whom Hodgson JA and James J agreed), placed particular reliance upon the fact that the section referred to in the table of standard non-parole period was a section which dealt with both ‘supply/manufacture’ and ‘knowingly take part in supply’. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        In my opinion, the words within the brackets in the Table items do not identify or limit in any way the offence to which the standard non-parole period applies. The offence to which the standard non-parole provisions applies is identified by the section of the statute which is found opposite the standard non-parole period in the particular Table item. [at par 48] 
        
       
      
    49 In those circumstances I am not persuaded that Hosseini provides any particular assistance in resolving the present issue. 
     
      
    50 As counsel for the applicant pointed out there is no reference in the table of standard non-parole periods to ss 345-51 of the Crimes Act which are the provisions which attach liability to ‘aiders and abettors’ and other offenders whose liability is ancillary in nature. By reason of those provisions such offenders are nevertheless exposed to the same maximum penalty as the principal offender. The same considerations also however apply to persons who attempt or conspire to commit substantive offences. An accessory before the fact can be charged, pursuant to s 346 of the Act, as a principal. See generally King v the Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423. 
     
      
    51 It is to be observed that this court has held that the standard non-parole period provisions do not apply to offences of attempting to commit substantive offences other than offences of attempted murder: DAC v R [2006] NSWCCA 265. In arriving at that decision the court took into account a number of considerations including the fact that the Attorney-General, when introducing the standard non-parole period legislation, specifically referred to the fact that offences of attempt were excluded from its reach. This court has also held that the provisions do not apply to offenders charged with conspiracy: Diesing & Ors v R [2007] NSWCCA 326. In that case the parties conceded that it was an error for the sentencing judge to have applied the provisions to offences of that type and the court, without any further analysis, intervened and proceeded to resentence those offenders. That said it may well be that different considerations apply to offences of attempt and conspiracy, which of their very essence are preliminary in nature. 
     
      
    52 There are however two decisions of this court in which the issue has arisen. In DJB v R, R v DJB [2007] NSWCCA 209, the Court had to deal with a Crown appeal against sentence. That offender was charged, inter alia, with two offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent pursuant to s 61J of the Crimes Act. With respect to one of those charges, DJB was charged as having aided and abetted his 14 year old son, NB to have intercourse with a 14 year old female TE, who had been drugged with Diazepam. With respect to the other, he was charged with having himself had intercourse with TE. The court proceeded upon the basis that the standard non-parole period applied to each of the s 61J offences and indeed one of the grounds upon which the Crown relied was “the failure to impose sentences for two offences under s 61J in accordance with the standard non-parole period provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999”. In upholding that ground of appeal Price J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        A separate and careful consideration of counts 2 and 3 [the s61J counts] could not have reasonably led to the characterisation of these offences as falling below the mid-range of objective seriousness. The respondent initiated the sexual assault by his son, which constitutes the second offence. His active encouragement included removing the then helpless TE’s pants and those of NB who was heavily intoxicated. Without the respondent, this offence would not have happened. Although he was to be sentenced as an aider and abettor, the respondent was dominant in the commission of the offence and his culpability was substantially more than that of his 14-year-old son. He then removed his son and commenced having sexual intercourse with the victim himself….(at para 100). 
        
       
      
     
    53 No doubt his Honour had in mind the following passage in GAS & SJK v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198, in which the High Court observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        … However, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in the present case, it is not a universal principle that the culpability of an aider and abettor is less than that of a principal offender, … A manipulative or dominant aider and abettor may be more culpable than a principal (at [23]). 
         
        
       
      
    54 In R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255 a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentence was upheld. Some of the counts involved allegations that that offender had aided and abetted offences of aggravated break and enter and steal. The court again proceeded upon the basis that the standard non-parole provisions applied to the offences of aiding and abetting.  
     
      
    55 It is pertinent to observe that in neither DJB nor Merrin was any issue raised as to whether the standard non-parole period provisions did in fact apply and presumably in those circumstances there was no occasion for the court to consider the question of principle which presently arises. 
     
      
    56 The principles which are to be applied in cases of ancillary or accessorial liability are not without their difficulties. The High Court provided a comprehensive analysis of them in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 especially per McHugh J at 341-351. That analysis includes a discussion of the concept of joint criminal enterprise and common purpose. The factual scenario which arose in GAS & SJK (supra) provides one such illustration of the difficulties which can arise. There two offenders broke into the victim’s premises. During the course of the incident the victim was killed. As the Crown was unable to prove to the requisite standard which of the offenders was responsible for the death, each offender was treated as an aider and abettor and not as the principal in the first degree. See also Mohan v The Queen [1967] AC 187. None of those complexities were addressed in the supplementary written submissions.  Accordingly, in my view, the issue which has been raised remains to be authoritatively determined. That said, I see no reason for present purposes at least, to depart from the approach taken in DGB (supra) and Merrin (supra). In any event, I have no hesitation in accepting the submission advanced by counsel for the applicant that there were a number of reasons, mainly related to the subjective features of the applicant’s case, why the standard non-parole period had a substantially reduced significance in the process of determining the appropriate sentences in the present case. That is so even allowing for the fact that the offences may properly be characterised as falling within the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    57 In structuring the sentences now to be imposed, it is convenient to take the same approach which the sentencing judge adopted. That is to say, I would order that each of the sentences in respect of counts 2-8 should be concurrent with one another but be partially cumulative upon the sentence in respect of count 1. I would do so because although the sexual assault offences and the child pornography offences involved separate criminal activities, they were all interrelated and had the same ultimate purpose which was the facilitation by the applicant of the exploitation of her own children for the sexual gratification of another person.  
     
      
    58 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2 Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and in substitution therefore impose the following sentences: 
       
       
      (a) in respect of count 1, sentence the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to commence on 11 December 2006 and to expire on 10 December 2008. 
       
       
      (b) in respect of count 5, sentence the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years to commence on 11 December 2007 and to expire on 10 December 2010. 
       
       
      (c) in respect of count 6, sentence the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years to commence on 11 December 2007 and to expire on 10 December 2010. 
       
       
      (d) in respect of count 7, sentence the applicant to a fixed term of 2 years 6 months to commence on 11 December 2007 and to expire on 10 June 2010. 
       
       
      (e) in respect of count 8, sentence the applicant to a fixed term of 2 years 6 months to commence on 11 December 2007 and to expire on 10 June 2010. 
       
       
      (f) in respect of count 3, sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 6 years to commence on 11 December 2007 and to expire on 10 December 2013 with a total term of 9 years imprisonment to expire on 10 December 2016. 
       
       
      (g) in respect of count 4, sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 6 years to commence on 11 December 2007 and to expire on 10 December 2013 with a total term of 9 years imprisonment to expire on 10 December 2016. 
       
       
      (h) in respect of count 2, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 document, sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 6 years to commence on 11 December 2007 and to expire on 10 December 2013 with a total term of imprisonment of 9 years 6 months to expire on 10 June 2017. 
       
       
      (i) The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 10 December 2013. The total effective sentence consists of a non-parole period of 7 years with a total term of imprisonment of 10 years 6 months.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This application was heard on 1 May 2009 when the court made orders granting leave to appeal and upholding the appeal. The relevant orders are set forward at the conclusion of these reasons. These are my reasons for joining in the orders which the court made on that day. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was sentenced in relation to the following offence: 
     
      
       
        
        “That he, on or about 4 January 2007 at Burra in the State of New South Wales, did assault Graham Barrett with intent to rob Graham Barrett and at the time of that assault used corporal violence.” 
        
       
      
    3 The offence is contrary to s 95 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The day after the offence the applicant went to the police and told them of his involvement in it. He was committed for trial and only on the date fixed for hearing entered a plea of guilty. He was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months. 
     
      
    5 The facts before the sentencing judge were agreed. The applicant has provided a summary of those facts which I have utilised in the following summary. 
     
      
    6 On the evening of 3 January 2007 the applicant was at his home with three other young persons. He had a discussion with the others and the four of them agreed to order a taxi, travel in it to an isolated area, rob the driver and then go joy riding in the stolen car. 
     
      
    7 Several calls were made to the local taxi company in Queanbeyan before the applicant made the final call at about 12.37 am on the morning of 4 January 2008. The applicant used the name “Charlie” and ordered a taxi to an address that was two doors from the applicant’s residence. 
     
      
    8 The victim answered the call and attended the nominated address. The applicant and his co-offenders entered the taxi and directed the victim to a property in an isolated location. On arrival at that destination the victim stopped the taxi and the applicant and two of the co-offenders got out and moved a short distance away. JJS, a co-offender, remained in the taxi. 
     
      
    9 At this stage the victim felt a blow to his head, which was delivered by JJS. JJS had entered the taxi carrying a mallet which he used to strike the victim. 
     
      
    10 The victim saw two of the people who had left the taxi moving back towards it. He managed to start the taxi and drive away. The applicant denies that he was one of the two persons who moved back towards the taxi. He claims to have panicked at this stage and had not wanted anything more to do with the enterprise. 
     
      
    11 The applicant attended Queanbeyan police station of his own accord at about 3 pm on 4 January 2008. He supplied information to the police about the offence and made admissions concerning his involvement in the robbery. He denied knowledge of the mallet being taken to the scene. 
     
      
    12 The victim suffered soreness to his head but although he was very scared at the time of the offence and feared for his safety, he did not receive any permanent injuries. 
     
      
    13 The police were of the opinion that the information given to them by the applicant was significant and led to the arrest of the three co-offenders. The applicant also assisted authorities by giving evidence in the Children’s Court against the co-offender JJS. 
     
      
    14 As I have previously stated it is surprising that the applicant did not enter an early plea. It may be that there were negotiations about the particular offence to which he would plead guilty but this Court has not been provided with any relevant information. In any event the sentencing judge allowed the applicant a “slight discount for the utilitarian value for the plea”. His Honour was mindful of the applicant’s expression of remorse to a psychologist. His Honour also attributed particular significance to assistance to the authorities given by the applicant when he attended the police station and informed the officers of his role in the events. At the time he approached the police it would appear that they did not have him in mind as a suspect for the offence. 
     
      
    15 The applicant was 4 days short of his 19th birthday at the time of the offence and was aged 20 at the time of sentence. There was only one matter on his criminal record being an offence of possessing a prohibited drug for which he received a bond. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge did not quantify the percentage discount in respect of any of the matters for which the applicant was entitled to a discount on his sentence. Nor did he indicate the overall combined discount. The applicant did not contend that this was an error but submitted that having regard to the decisions of this Court in R v El Hani (2004) NSWCCA 162 and SZ v R (2007) NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 the appropriate discount for his Honour to have provided would have been in the order of 40-50%. If this was the case it was submitted the notional starting point for the applicant’s sentence was between five and six years. 
     
      
    17 The applicant submitted that when analysed in this manner it was apparent that the sentence imposed on him was excessive when compared with the sentence of his co-offenders giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. In particular it was argued that he could legitimately submit that his sentence was excessive having regard to the sentence imposed on the co-offender BW. BW was sentenced to a control order of 9 months which was suspended upon him entering into a bond pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the Children’s (Criminal Proceeding) Act 1987 NSW.  
     
      
    18 At the date of the offence BW was aged 2 weeks short of his 17th birthday. He had a criminal history consisting of offences related to goods in custody and an offence of unlicensed driving. He was also sentenced in relation to an offence of break, enter and steal at the same time as he was dealt with for the present matter. 
     
      
    19 The role of BW in the offence is not made entirely clear in the agreed facts. However, it was JJS and not the applicant, or BW who carried the mallet and inflicted the blow to the victim’s head. The sentencing judge concluded that it was obvious that the offenders contemplated violence if, as they intended, they were to subdue the cab driver. Although he did not make a finding adverse to the applicant with respect to the mallet he said “I find it difficult to accept the offender’s claim that he was ignorant of the presence of the mallet.”  
     
      
    20 The applicant did not enjoy a normal childhood. He was the youngest of six children. His father died from lung cancer when he was about 10 and he left school at age 15. He has not been able to sustain any long-term employment. His Honour considered it a matter of concern that the applicant consumed and continues to consume large amounts of alcohol on a regular basis and is a regular substance abuser. 
     
      
    21 The sentencing judge concluded that a prison term was appropriate but recognising the need to encourage the applicant’s rehabilitation varied the usual ratio between the parole and non-parole periods. 
     
      
    22 When sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge was mindful of the sentences imposed on all of the co-offenders. BM who was aged 14 at the time of the offence and had no prior criminal history was sentenced to a 12 month bond. JJS who was 15, and was on bail at the time of the offending was sentenced to an 18 month control order with a six month non-parole period. 
     
      
    23 There is no doubt as the respondent submitted that the offence which the applicant committed was serious. It occurred at night when the offenders lured a taxi driver to an isolated place intending to rob him and take possession of his taxi. Violence was inflicted on the victim. 
     
      
    24 These matters required a sentence which appropriately reflected considerations of general and specific deterrence. This Court has on many occasions expressed concern about offences committed on taxi drivers late at night. They provide an essential service for many people but are vulnerable and have little capacity to defend themselves if attacked, particularly by someone armed with a weapon. 
     
      
    25 It is important to appreciate, as this Court said in TJ V R [2009] NSWCCA 99, that the co-offenders were sentenced as juveniles whereas the applicant was 18 years of age at the time of the offending. Because the sentencing regime for juveniles is different to that for adults a direct comparison between BW’s sentence and that of the applicant was not appropriate. However, notwithstanding those differences it is necessary to ensure that the sentence imposed on the adult offender is in all the circumstances proportionate to that imposed on the juvenile: R v Colgan [1999] NSWCCA 292 per Spigelman CJ at [13].  
     
      
    26 The Crown submitted that the role of BW in the offence was less than that of the applicant. It was the applicant who made the phone calls to the taxi company and, so it would seem, it was the applicant who was the leader amongst the group. It was submitted that these differences were such, together with the fact that BW was a juvenile, as to justify the disparity in their sentences (Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295). Accordingly the respondent submitted that the applicant could have no legitimate sense of grievance. 
     
      
    27 Notwithstanding the serious nature of the applicant’s offending there were a number of matters which required careful consideration when his sentence was imposed. Although an adult and required to be sentenced as such he was 19 years of age and the offence could not be seen as an entirely isolated incident, his personal history suggests that he may have prospects of effective rehabilitation. Of particular significance is the fact that the applicant gave himself up to the authorities and both assisted in their inquiries and gave evidence in respect of at least one of his co-offenders. There can be no doubt that although he was required to be punished his sentence needed to be carefully structured to ensure an adequate opportunity for him to develop as a mature and responsible member of the community. 
     
      
    28 The effective sentence imposed on BW was significantly less than that which was imposed on the applicant. Although for reasons I have indicated a direct comparison was inappropriate, I am satisfied that the applicant is legitimately entitled to consider that his sentence was out of proportion to that imposed on BW. BW’s sentence of nine months was wholly suspended whereas the applicant received a minimum period of full time custody of 16 months. Although the applicant probably had a greater role in initiating the offence, he made the phone calls, his part in the crime was no greater than BW, once the victim had picked up his passengers. By giving himself up and assisting the police he has demonstrated genuine remorse and has given every indication that he will avoid offending in the future. Although a term of full time imprisonment was appropriate the length of the applicant’s sentence was required to be proportionate to that of the co-offenders. To my mind the sentence imposed on the applicant was excessive to the extent that this Court should intervene. 
     
      
    29 In my judgment the sentence imposed on the applicant should be quashed and he should be re-sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months with a total term of 2½ years.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA:  
     
      
       
      Nature of the Appeal 
       
      
    2 The Appellant has been convicted in the District Court of New South Wales on a charge of importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug, namely cocaine. There was no dispute at the trial that the Appellant had arrived at Sydney Airport on 19 October 2006 on a flight from Argentina, and that a quantity of cocaine, estimated to be 2.369 kgs, was found concealed in his luggage. The issue at the trial concerned whether he had knowledge of the presence of the cocaine or was reckless as to its presence.  
     
      
    3 The grounds of appeal relate to the adequacy of the trial judge’s directions to the jury.  
     
      
    4 One ground of appeal alleges that a miscarriage of justice arose from two omissions on the part of the trial judge, namely: (a) to give adequate directions on the right of silence, and (b) to give adequate directions on the inference that could be drawn from the Appellant’s exercise of his right of silence during official questioning (section 89 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)). 
     
      
    5 The second ground of appeal is that a miscarriage of justice arose from a positive error of the trial judge, namely directing the jury that they could draw an adverse inference from the Appellant’s failure to raise a defence during his questioning by Customs and Federal Police.  
     
      
    6 The Appellant was represented by experienced counsel at the trial. That counsel, Mr Hanley, made no complaint about any of the alleged errors on the part of the trial judge that are the subject of the grounds of appeal. Thus, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules requires the Appellant to obtain leave from this Court to raise these grounds of appeal. The convenient course is to consider the question of leave concurrently with the merits of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Circumstances of Arrival at Sydney Airport 
       
      
    7 Though at the time of his arrival in Sydney the Appellant’s home was in Colombia, he is a citizen of the United States of America and was travelling on a United States passport. There was evidence that when the Appellant arrived at Sydney Airport he was carrying as hand luggage a black laptop computer bag, a black backpack and a camera and related equipment. The laptop computer bag was sometimes referred to in evidence as a briefcase. 
     
      
    8 The Appellant’s passport and travel documents were tendered. His airline ticket had been issued in Panama on 16 October 2006. It related to a flight leaving Panama City on 17 October 2006 at 11:18 am, having a flight of 7 hours and 5 minutes to Buenos Aires, catching another flight that left Buenos Aires about 3½ hours later, then travelling another 19 hours (flying via Auckland) and arriving in Sydney at 8:00 am on 19 October 2006. He was booked to return to Buenos Aires on a flight that left Sydney at 9:30 am on 24 October 2006 for Buenos Aires, with a further flight on 25 October 2006 from Buenos Aires to Panama City. The arrival card that he filled out upon arrival in Sydney showed that he intended to stay in Australia for 10 days, for both business and a holiday.  
     
      
    9 On arrival the Appellant collected a suitcase that was wrapped in plastic from the luggage carousel. A Customs officer, Mr Tammareddi approached him, asked for his travel documents, and asked him some questions. Mr Tammareddi’s evidence included:  
     
      
       
        
        “And then I pointed to the, to his luggage and said, ‘Is this your luggage?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ And I said, ‘Did you pack the bags yourself?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ And I said, ‘Are you fully aware of the contents?’ He said, ‘Yes.’” 
        
       
      
    10 Mr Tammareddi removed the contents of the laptop computer bag, lifted the bag, and found it was unusually heavy. He called another customs officer, Ms Purcell, who took the empty laptop bag away. Mr Tammareddi’s evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did you do when she took the suitcase, took the laptop briefcase, what did you do? 
         
        A. I said to Mr Sanchez, ‘We are going to x-ray the bag. Can you explain why the empty bag is so heavy?’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he say? 
         
        A. He said, ‘It’s heavy because of the padding to protect the computer.’ And I asked him a few other questions.” 
        
       
      
    11 Part of Mr Tammareddi’s evidence about his conversation with the Appellant was: 
     
      
       
        
        “I said, ‘Why do you need so much baggage for a short stay of 10 days?’ He said, ‘One is my computer laptop briefcase, one is my camera equipment and one is my clothing.’” 
        
       
      
    12 After a short time Ms Purcell returned. Mr Tammareddi’s evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “… Officer Purcell said to Mr Sanchez, ‘Hello sir, I have taken an x-ray image of the computer bag. It is quite thick, thick and quite heavy and thick in the lining. Do you know why that would be?’ And Mr Sanchez said, ‘It’s because of the padding for to [sic] the computer. It is a computer bag.’ Then officer Purcell said, ‘It’s 9.10am at the moment. I would like to take a closer look at this bag and your other luggage. And what is going to happen is we will take you to an interview room and finish the baggage exam under videotape.’” 
        
       
      
    13 Mr Tammareddi then took the Appellant to an interview room. Another Customs officer, Mr Koustoubardis came into that room soon after. The rest of the Appellant’s conversation with Customs officers was videorecorded. That videorecording and a transcript of it were admitted into evidence without objection.  
     
      
    14 The transcript records the following concerning the computer bag: 
     
      
       
        
        “KOUSTOUBARDIS: 
        
       
       
        
        Q15. Do you have anything else in this bag? 
         
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        TAMMAREDDI: 
        
       
       
        
        Q16. Can you explain why it is so heavy? 
         
        A I think it’s the cushioning of the ah, of the computer. All right now, all this ah, new imported contain luggage for computers, laptop computers are made of ah, heavy cushioning. So that’s why it’s ---” 
        
       
      
    15 An initial test of the computer bag with an instrument that detects traces of narcotics was negative. Ms Purcell then used a knife to penetrate a part of the lining of the bag, and applied the detection instrument to the blade of the knife. The record of interview continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q21. Okay. Mr Sanchez, you saw me do a reading off your brief case after I pierced it with that knife. And the reading’s come back for cocaine. So what I’m going to do now is I’m going to caution you that you do not have to say or do anything, but anything you do say or do may be used in evidence. Do you understand that? 
         
        A Yes ma’am. 
        
       
       
        
        Q22. Okay. So you have a right to communicate with a friend or a relative to inform them of your whereabouts if you wish. You also have the right to communicate with a legal practitioner. You have a right to an interpreter if you feel you need an interpreter. 
         
        A M’hm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q23. You also have the right to communicate with a consular office of your – USA Consulate if you wish. You have the right to remain silent and you have the right to refuse to participate in any investigation. 
         
        A Well, you tell me that the – this positive for cocaine? 
        
       
       
        
        Q24. Yes. 
         
        A How do you know? 
        
       
       
        
        Q25. Because I’ve just pierced where this is really heavy. 
         
        A yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q26. Your brief case is exceptionally heavy for an empty brief case. 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q27. The x-ray shows an inconsistency with a [sic] empty brief case. I’ll show you the x-ray image. There is a strong odour coming from this bag, okay. And you saw me pierce the side of the bag with this knife. And I wiped the edge of that knife and it shows a reading for cocaine. Okay. So that’s why I have cautioned you because I believe there’s cocaine in that bag. 
         
        A So the suspicion is – is for sure it is cocaine in there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q28. Yeah. It is my suspicion that that is cocaine in there. 
         
        A And then what will happen? 
        
       
       
        
        Q29. Okay. What we’re going to do now is complete looking through your other baggage to make sure you don’t have any more of this sort of thing with you today. 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q30. And then we’ll be contacting the Australian Federal Police. Okay. Any other questions? 
         
        A Not [sic] ma’am.” 
        
       
      
    16 Later in the interview, the Customs officers took the plastic off the suitcase, and examined its contents. As well as various personal items, it contained a brown trolley bag. The customs interview proceeded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q90. I’ll get you to take this one out. But we’ve just emptied this one too because this is …(indistinct)… this bag here. Are these both your bags sir? 
         
        A Excuse me? 
        
       
       
        
        Q91. Are they both your bags? 
         
        A Excuse me? 
        
       
       
        
        Q92. Are these both your bags – is this bag yours? 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q93. And this bag yours? 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q94. Okay. Just leave it in this side …(indistinct)… I’m very suspicious about this bag ‘cause it’s so heavy empty. The officers are just going to x-ray it and have a look. 
         
        A Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    17 While the brown bag was being examined, the Appellant was told that the Australian Federal Police “will come down and they’ll have a chat with you.” The interview continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q108. Once the AFP come down and talk to you they’ll avail you of all your rights that I told you about. 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q109. Do you want me to go through those again or anything for you, what rights you have? 
         
        A (No audible reply) 
        
       
       
        
        Q110. Yeah? You have a right to communicate with a friend or relative. You have a right to communicate with a legal practitioner. You have a right to an interpreter. You have the right to communicate with a consular office. You have the right to remain silent. You don’t have to talk to us at all. And you have the right to refuse to participate in any investigation. Now when the AFP come, Australian Federal Police[,] they’ll actually give you those rights I expect again and it’ll be up to them whether you’re allowed and what time you can ring someone and things like that. 
         
        A Because if I’m going to be detained I – I need to talk to my wife. So I have ah, to stay or just answer some questions here and I stay for a while. Is that it? 
        
       
       
        
        Q111. When the Australian Federal Police come, they’ll talk to you about what time you can ring your wife. 
         
        A Okay.” 
        
       
      
    18 After Ms Purcell had returned to the room with the suitcase and the brown bag, she informed the Appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Okay. We have inconsistencies again with this bag here sir. It looks like there’s a concealment of some sort in there. And I presume it’s the same as your brief case. The officer will repack the bag and we’ll take some photographs.” 
        
       
      
    19 The computer bag, when emptied of the contents but with its lining in place, weighed 4,386.7 grams. The brown bag, empty but with its lining intact, weighed 8,171.5 grams.  
     
      
    20 Physical examination showed that the lining of the computer bag, and the lining of the brown trolley bag, each contained foam pocket packages in which there were sheets of gel. Analysis of the gel showed it contained cocaine. 
     
      
    21 The total weight of the foam pockets and gel sheets removed from the computer bag was 2,844.8 grams. The total weight of the foam packets and gel sheets removed from the brown bag was 4,033.6 grams. The weight of gel sheets alone removed from the computer bag was 2,535.2 grams. The weight of gel sheets alone removed from the brown bag was 3,676.9 grams.  
     
      
       
      Evidence at the Trial – Mr Santamaria 
       
      
    22 Mr Santamaria, a Federal Agent with the Australian Federal Police, gave evidence in chief that he arrived at the interview room, cautioned the Appellant, arrested him, and then took him to the AFP room at the airport. There, the Appellant was given access to a telephone, and spoke to both Legal Aid, and the Colombian Consulate. Soon after, the Appellant declined to participate in a record of interview. Mr Santamaria gave no other evidence in chief about conversations with the Appellant. 
     
      
    23 In the course of Mr Santamaria’s cross-examination the following additional facts were elicited, concerning a time before the Appellant spoke to a solicitor from the Legal Aid Commission: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Whilst you were in the interview room with him, did you ask him: ‘What was your purpose for coming to Australia’? 
         
        A. Yes, in a way, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t have any notes of any conversation? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It wasn’t recorded on the video? 
         
        A. No, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you hear him say words to the effect: ‘I was to come here for a work study for $5,000. I was to go to the Ibis Hotel and I was going to be contacted by someone.’ Did he tell you words like that? 
         
        A. Words to that effect, yes.” 
        
       
      
    24 Later in the course of Mr Santamaria’s cross-examination by counsel for the Appellant, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Subsequently he exercised his rights and didn’t make a statement? 
         
        A. That is correct. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : Ladies and gentlemen, any person who is spoken to by the police and asked whether he or she wishes to make a statement is quite within his or her rights to decline to make such a statement and no adverse inference should be brought against the accused because he exercised those rights. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : Thank you your Honour.” 
        
       
       
      The Appellant’s Evidence at the Trial 
       
      
    25 The Appellant gave evidence at the trial. He was born in Pereira in Colombia, and had obtained a degree that qualified him as an industrial engineer. The Appellant said that he had served as a university professor, and that he had managed and conducted businesses in different parts of the world, including Madrid. In 2006 he was living once again in Pereira, Colombia. 
     
      
    26 He travelled to Panama City in June-July 2006 to investigate and possibly purchase equipment for a business he was thinking of setting up with his son. While in Panama City on that occasion he met and became friendly with a man called Jorge Giban Osorio and a friend of Jorge’s called Sandra. He did not know Sandra’s surname. He met them at an internet café that he frequented, where they appeared to be friends of the proprietor or manager. The Appellant had previously been involved in acquiring and setting up internet cafés, and Jorge and Sandra spoke to him about that.  
     
      
    27 The Appellant returned to Panama City on 10 October 2006, again in connection with purchase of equipment for the business he and his son were contemplating setting up. He met Jorge and Sandra again. On the night he arrived in Panama City, 10 October, they visited him at his hotel and proposed that he do for them a feasibility study on the setting up of a very large internet café in Sydney. They offered him US$5,000, plus payment of expenses, to carry out the study. They said that there was a person called Mr Pereira in Sydney who was a good friend of Jorge and who “will be like a chaperone to me, so I wouldn’t be wasting time locating places where it would be a waste of time.” Jorge and Sandra gave him US$2,500 in cash for an airline ticket. On making enquiries of a travel agent he found that the ticket from Panama City to Sydney would cost US$3,500. Jorge and Sandra arranged for an additional US$1,000 to be sent to the Appellant’s wife (who was still in Pereira, Colombia), and she transmitted it to him in Panama City. He intended to stay in Sydney for “15 to 30 days” and the return trip on the airline ticket that he purchased was one that could be changed. (It will be recalled that his airline ticket related to a return trip, leaving Sydney five days after he arrived.) 
     
      
    28 He gives no evidence of being given Mr Pereira’s telephone number, or any description of him. He had made a booking at a Sydney hotel, the Ibis, but the booking was not pre-paid. He said he expected to pay for the hotel with his own credit card. It was a coincidence that the man who was to help him in Sydney had the same name as that of the city in which the Appellant lived. 
     
      
    29 On the morning of 17 October Jorge and Sandra picked him up from his Panama City hotel and drove him to the airport. On the way Sandra gave him a new computer bag, and packed the contents of his old computer bag into the new computer bag for him. The computer bag contained not only his laptop computer, but also various leads and other computer-related items. He did not notice that the new computer bag was any heavier than his old computer bag.  
     
      
    30 Sandra also gave him the brown bag in the course of the trip to the airport, and told him that Mr Pereira had left it on a previous trip to Panama City. The brown bag was empty. Sandra opened his suitcase, and packed it inside. To make room for it, she took out a coat, which the Appellant then carried to Australia as hand luggage. On arrival at the airport in Panama City the appellant noticed that there was a bump in his suitcase so he opened it and rearranged the contents to make them level, in the course of which he handled the leather bag “and I made a quick check of things inside the leather bag and I didn’t notice anything wrong with it”. He then wrapped his suitcase in the plastic wrapping.  
     
      
    31 One of the documents in his possession when he landed in Australia was a piece of paper on which were written the names of various Sydney tourist attractions, and the names and approximate locations of three Sydney universities. He said these were notes that he made arising from a conversation with a man he met on the plane. He said he had asked that man about tertiary education: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And is there any reason why you did that? 
         
        A. Well I was planning to come back, to come here some day in future with my family. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did you decide that? 
         
        A. Well, I have decided later on in my future, but I was thinking of if my residence in Spain wouldn’t work I might have look at other places to be with my family, and that could be Australia.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And is there any reason why, if you were planning to maybe come to Australia in the future, why you were looking at universities? 
         
        A. Yes, I had still have a dream to make an MBA in any university. I tried to do that while I was in Miami at Florida International University. And I always have in mind that I want to study a little bit more, even if I don’t practice, but to show it to my kids. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And so that was something you may have investigated whilst you were here? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    32 In cross-examination he agreed that he was an experienced traveller, and was aware of warnings about taking items for other people, and was aware that that was because of danger “of it being drugs”. He said “Yes there is a lot of signs at airports and all over the place about it, yes.” However he said it did not cross his mind that he was being asked to take a bag of drugs into Australia.  
     
      
    33 He was cross-examined about the occasion when he levelled out the bump in his suitcase, that involved rearranging the brown bag inside the suitcase: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. By seeing it that didn’t make you suspicious about someone sending the suitcase from Panama City all the way to Sydney, did it? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. There is nothing particularly special about that brown trolley bag is there? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Doesn’t look like a designer trolley bag? 
         
        A. No it doesn’t look like a big deal. Just maybe some kind of sentimental thing for somebody who left that suitcase in Panama City. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And a bag like that could have been sent by post from Panama City to Australia couldn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    34 He agreed he did not know any details about the business of Jorge and Sandra, did not make any enquiries to ascertain any details about their business, and did not know if they had any other businesses in Panama City, or anywhere else in the world. His arrangement with Jorge and Sandra was verbal, and he agreed he had no guarantee that on his return he would be paid the US$5,000. He did not do any research about Jorge and Sandra. He accepted that he had never been to Sydney before, he did not conduct any research prior to coming to Australia on the feasibility of setting up an internet café in Australia, and had done no research about Sydney before coming to Australia. His cross-examination included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Would you agree that if you are to do a feasibility study it would have been better to have information provided to you before you came to a country that you had never seen before? 
         
        A. It could be thought that way, but being here and with hands-on in the city is the best way to attack the problem. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The best way? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Without any prior research. That is the best way, is it? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    35 His cross-examination included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You’re aware that Customs commented on the weight of the bag are you not? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when they commented on the weight of the bag, you mentioned the padding? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You did not mention it that time that someone had given it to you only 48 hours beforehand, did you? 
         
        A. No I didn’t.” 
        
       
      
    36 The cross-examination included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Officer Purcell says to you ‘Are these both your bags? Is this bag yours?’ Pointing to the large black suitcase. You said ‘yes’. Then she said ‘And this bag yours?’ Namely the brown trolley bag and you said ‘yes’. Now at that stage you knew that the black laptop computer bag that you had been given by Sandra and Jorge had cocaine in it, didn’t you? 
         
        A. Well at that time it wasn’t, I was expecting inconclusive or negative results because they were shown before. She said before this negative result then they made another test. I was still waiting but I it was a terrible mistake. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So at that stage you knew that the black laptop computer bag that had been given to you by Sandra and Jorge was suspected by Customs as having cocaine in it? 
         
        A. Yes allegedly. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Allegedly? 
         
        A. Yes suspected but I just, I cannot be sure, if I am told it could be full of guns I have no idea. You have the means. I don’t have. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Then the Customs officer asked you about the other bag that had been given to you by Jorge and Sandra? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said it was yours? 
         
        A. Well I wasn’t, I was very upset at what was happening. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At that stage you didn’t say ‘that’s a bag that isn’t mine. I am to pass it on to somebody else’? 
         
        A. No I didn’t say that.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown Submissions 
       
      
    37 The Crown prosecutor submitted that the Appellant’s version of how he came to bring the two bags into Australia was unbelievable. In addressing the jury about the recorded interview with Customs officers, the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now at that stage he knows that the other bag that was given to him by Sandra and Jorge has tested positive to cocaine. He may have thought it was a suspicion but it’s at least a suspicion of cocaine. It has been pierced, tested, tested positive to cocaine. It is heavy and the x-ray image reveals an inconsistency with an empty bag. Enough warning bells for him to know that there is a suspicion that that bag contained cocaine, and yet when the other bag also given to him by Sandra is set aside and the Customs officer said that it was also heavy and the Customs officer also had a suspicion about that he did not say at that time that he didn’t own the brown trolley bag and it had been given to him by someone else. When asked did he own the brown trolley bag he said ‘Yes.’” 
        
       
      
    38 The Crown also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When alerted to the positive tests for cocaine in his laptop bag he did not advise that the brown bag was not his, even though he was given the opportunity.” 
        
       
       
      The Summing Up 
       
      
    39 In the course of summing up the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When it became apparent that the customs officer or officers had detected what they believed to be drugs, at no stage did he protest that he was carrying the brown bag for somebody else, or that his computer bag had been packed by another who had just given it to him. Nowhere in his discussions with the customs officers, nor with Agent Santamaria did he ever raise these matters. 
        
       
       
        
        In the crown case as a matter of sheer commonsense you would expect some protest, some explanation, some effort to distance himself by telling the customs agents or the federal agents what he claims to be the truth, that is[,] how he came to be in the possession of those two bags. As to why he would not have raised that matter then and there, on the crown case is simply incredible.” 
        
       
      
    40 It is this portion of the summing up that the Appellant submits is a misdirection. 
     
      
    41 Later in the summing up the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you look at the DVD, Mr Hanley says that will demonstrate the accused showing no concern with the investigation of his bags.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        As to what he said or did not say when being questioned by the customs agents, and his baggage examined, Mr Hanley put to you that you really would not expect chapter and verse from a man who had just spent many hours travelling from South America.” 
        
       
       
      That last remark relates to the Appellant having spent over 29 hours travelling from Panama City to Sydney. 
       
       
      Applicable Legal Principles 
       
      
    42 There was no dispute at the trial about the applicable legal principles. Insofar as they arise from the general law, they are stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Petty v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 95 at 99: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person who believes on reasonable grounds that he or she is suspected of having been a party to an offence is entitled to remain silent when questioned or asked to supply information by any person in authority about the occurrence of an offence, the identity of the participants and the roles which they played. That is a fundamental rule of the common law which, subject to some specific statutory modifications, is applied in the administration of the criminal law in this country. An incident of that right of silence is that no adverse inference can be drawn against an accused person by reason of his or her failure to answer such questions or to provide such information. To draw such an adverse inference would be to erode the right of silence or to render it valueless. …  
        
       
       
        
        That incident of the right of silence means that, in a criminal trial, it should not be suggested, either by evidence led by the Crown or by questions asked or comments made by the trial judge or the Crown Prosecutor, that an accused's exercise of the right of silence may provide a basis for inferring a consciousness of guilt. Thus, to take an example, the Crown should not lead evidence that, when charged, the accused made no reply.  
        Nor should it be suggested that previous silence about a defence raised at the trial provides a basis for inferring that the defence is a new invention or is rendered suspect or unacceptable.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    43 Their Honours went on to recognise that some cases had recognised a “distinction between reliance on silence as evidence against the accused, and reliance on it by way of answer to or comment upon a defence raised for the first time … at the trial.” Their Honours said, at 101: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the denial of the credibility of that late defence or explanation by reason of the accused's earlier silence is just another way of drawing an adverse inference (albeit less strong than an inference of guilt) against the accused by reason of his or her exercise of the right of silence. Such an erosion of the fundamental right should not be permitted. Indeed, in a case where the positive matter of explanation or defence constitutes the real issue of the trial, to direct the jury that it was open to them to draw an adverse inference about its genuineness from the fact that the accused had not previously raised it would be to convert the right to remain silent into a source of entrapment. Accordingly, the distinction is, in our view, unsound.” 
        
       
      
    44 Insofar as the principles were contained in statute at the time of the trial in June 2007, section 89 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “89 Evidence of silence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) In a criminal proceeding, an inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn from evidence that the party or another person failed or refused: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to answer one or more questions; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) to respond to a representation; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          put or made to the party or other person in the course of official questioning. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence of that kind is not admissible if it can only be used to draw such an inference. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Subsection (1) does not prevent use of the evidence to prove that the party or other person failed or refused to answer the question or to respond to the representation if the failure or refusal is a fact in issue in the proceeding. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In this section: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          inference 
           includes: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) an inference of consciousness of guilt; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) an inference relevant to a party’s credibility.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    45 The Dictionary to the Evidence Act defined “official questioning” as meaning “questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence.” “Investigating official” was defined as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior); or  
        
       
       
        
        (b) a person appointed by or under an Australian law (other than a person who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior) whose functions include functions in respect of the prevention or investigation of offences.” 
        
       
      
    46 The argument proceeded on the assumption that the Customs officers involved in the present case were “investigating officials” within the meaning of this provision. Members of the Australian Federal Police are included in the definition of “police officer” in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    47 In Jones v R [2005] NSWCCA 443 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Simpson and Hoeben JJ agreed) referred, (at [69]-[70]) to the statement by Gaudron A-CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at 630, [22] that the expression “right of silence”: 
     
      
       
        
        “… is a useful shorthand description for a number of different rules that apply in the criminal law. But referring, without more, to the ‘right to silence’ is not always a safe basis for reasoning to a conclusion in a particular case; the use of the expression ‘right to silence’ may obscure the particular rule or principle that is being applied.” 
        
       
      
    48 The authority that their Honours cite for the first sentence just quoted is the speech of Lord Mustill in R v Director of Serious Fraud Office; Ex parte Smith [1993] AC 1 at 30-1. There, Lord Mustill stated that the “right of silence” covered at least six different types of immunity:  
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A general immunity, possessed by all persons 
          
        and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions posed by other persons or bodies. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A general immunity, possessed by all persons 
          
        and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions the answers to which may incriminate them. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A specific immunity, possessed by all persons under suspicion of criminal responsibility whilst being interviewed by police officers or others in similar positions 
          
        of authority, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions of any kind. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A specific immunity, possessed by accused persons undergoing trial, 
          
        from being compelled to give evidence, and from being compelled to answer questions put to them in the dock. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) A specific immunity, possessed by persons who have been charged with a criminal offence, 
          
        from having questions material to the offence addressed to them by police officers or persons in a similar position of authority. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) A specific immunity (at least in certain circumstances, which it is unnecessary to explore), possessed by accused persons undergoing trial, from having adverse comment made on any failure (a) to answer questions before the trial, or (b) to give evidence at the trial.” 
        
       
      
    49 The third type of “right of silence” is a right that the person who is entitled to it actually exercises by choosing to not respond to questions. The sixth type of “right of silence” is not one that the person entitled to it needs to choose to exercise before it becomes operative. Rather, it is an entitlement that the accused person has concerning the manner in which his or her trial is conducted. The trial should be conducted in accordance with that sixth type of “right of silence” without the accused person taking any step or making any claim to require it to be so conducted.  
     
      
    50 In the present case, the third type of “right of silence” applied concerning questioning of the Appellant from at least the time that Ms Purcell warned him immediately after testing of the knife blade gave a positive result. The Appellant chose to exercise the third type of “right of silence” during his time with Mr Santamaria after his conversation with Legal Aid, but did not exercise it during his conversations with the Customs officers, or when he answered a question from Mr Santamaria before the Appellant spoke to Legal Aid.  
     
      
    51 The sixth type of “right of silence” was also a right the Appellant had in relation to the entire course of his trial. Even though the Appellant had, in this way, the sixth type of right of silence, his trial was conducted in accordance with it. At no time was adverse comment made at the trial about his having chosen not to answer questions from Mr Santamaria, and indeed the jury were told that he was entitled not to answer such questions. 
     
      
    52 The account of the “right of silence” given by the High Court majority in Petty extends even further than the sixth category identified by Lord Mustill in R v Director of Serious Fraud Office. The prohibition on suggesting “that previous silence about a defence raised at the trial provides a basis for inferring that the defence is a new invention or is rendered suspect or unacceptable” applies even if a person in authority has not asked an accused person a question in response to which one would expect, if the account the accused gave at his trial were true, that he would have given that account. Indeed, the prohibition applies even if a person in authority has not asked the accused person any questions at all. The prohibition applies to any suggestion that a defence might be rejected because the accused failed to say anything before the trial about the substance of the defence, whatever might have been the circumstances in which that failure to say anything might have occurred. Like Lord Mustill’s sixth type of right of silence, it does not need to be specifically claimed or exercised by an accused person, but is rather an entitlement about the manner in which his or her trial is conducted. Even a very talkative person can be considered “silent” within the meaning of this principle, if such conversation as he or she has before the trial does not include an account of the substance of the story that the accused tells in evidence at the trial, or has his or her counsel raise through cross-examination of other witnesses at the trial.  
     
      
    53 The operation of this type of “right of silence” is illustrated in Glennon v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 1, where the trial judge had given a direction (recorded at 5): 
     
      
       
        
        “In testing the veracity of that defence brought before you in this court you are entitled to have regard to the fact that it was not revealed to the police and you are entitled to ask yourselves, if this explanation is true, surely the sensible thing was to tell the police about it as soon as possible. Such a test of the veracity of the story does not depend on drawing any inferences from the exercise by the accused of his right to decline to answer questions but from producing here a story which if true he could have produced to the police but didn’t.” 
        
       
       
      That direction was held, at 8, to be  
      “clearly erroneous” 
      . 
       
      
    54 An important qualification of the extent to which the “right of silence” prohibits comment at a trial upon failure of an accused to give his account of the facts at an earlier time is stated by McClellan CJ at CL in Jones at [75]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, if the accused chooses to break his or her silence and give an explanation before trial which is inconsistent with an account given in evidence, the inconsistency may be used by the prosecution, both to attack the accused’s credit, and as consciousness of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    55 What is meant by “break his or her silence” here is that the accused, during official questioning, chooses not to exercise the third type of right of silence, and in the course of answering the question gives an account that is inconsistent with his or her evidence at the trial. To similar effect is R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 at 111 per Mahoney JA, 114-115 per Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Badgery-Parker J agreed). 
     
      
       
      Timing of Direction on Right of Silence 
       
      
    56 In R v Reeves, Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Mahoney JA and Badgery-Parker J agreed), said (at 115E) that where: 
     
      
       
        
        “… evidence is given which discloses that the accused has exercised his right of silence, a direction should invariably be given – as soon as the evidence is given and, if necessary, again in the summing up – to make it clear to the jury that the accused had a fundamental right to remain silent and that his exercise of that right must not lead to any conclusion by them that he was guilty:  
        R v Astill  
        (Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 July 1992, unreported) at 9.” 
        
       
      
    57 In R v Matthews (NSWCCA, 28 May 1996, unreported) Badgery-Parker J (with whom Cole JA and Sperling J agreed) at 3 gave a slightly different emphasis: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is preferable, as was pointed out in  
        Astill 
        , 
          
        that such a direction be given at the time when the evidence is first adduced, but in any event should ordinarily be given in the course of the summing up.” 
        
       
      
    58 On both formulations, at the time evidence is given that an accused has exercised a right of silence, a judge should give a direction to the jury that they are not to draw an adverse inference from the accused having done so. On both formulations, there is no rule to the effect that that warning must be repeated in the summing up. It may well often be desirable, and prudent to do so, but whether failure to do so involves appellable error will depend on the circumstances of the individual case. 
     
      
       
      Rule 4 
       
      
    59 Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal”. 
        
       
      
    60 In Regina v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340, Ipp JA (with whom Buddin and Shaw JJ agreed) collected, at [93]-[98], authorities concerning rule 4 and expressed views that I gratefully adopt: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        [93]  
        In  
        R v DH 
        , Stein JA observed [at 115]:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Again, rule 4 applies because no point was taken at trial. In  
          Jeffrey 
           (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 16 December 1993), Mahoney JA made some pertinent observations about the role of rule 4 where an appellant relies on misdirections or non-directions to which no objection was taken at trial. They bear repeating. His Honour said: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘[It] is proper to emphasise the importance of the principle embodied in r 4. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            In my opinion this principle plays an important part in the criminal trial process. It is important that any objection to the summing up or that any defect or omission at the trial which can be cured or mitigated by steps taken at the trial, be raised at the time of the trial. The judge should be asked to, and should have the opportunity to, correct any error or deficiency of this kind. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            Errors will occur and r 4 provides for them. But unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level. But infrequently, this Court is asked to act under r 4 when the reason why the defect was not dealt with at the trial has not been established and where it is at least possible that there were tactical reasons why it was not. It is not easy for the Court of Appeal to satisfy itself that the reason why the matter was not raised was error rather than choice. In such circumstances, the court should be slow to act under r 4 …’”.

            ‘The requirements of r 4 of the  
            Criminal Appeal Rules 
             do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or non-direction may, without leave, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury. If a summing-up contains some error which could easily have been cured once the judge’s attention had been drawn it, and if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error operates fails to comply with his or her duty to draw the judge’s attention to that error … any suggestion that such detriment automatically entitles the accused to a new trial does not strike a sympathetic cord in the hearts of those who see the right to a fair trial as operating in favour not only of the accused but also of the Crown, which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community. The  
            Criminal Appeal Act 
              
            1912 
             (NSW) does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted under one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial. There are, of course, cases in which the error made is of such a nature that, notwithstanding the failure of counsel for the accused to comply with a duty leave will be granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The caution given by Gleeson CJ in  
          Sanderson 
           was to the following effect:

            Criminal Appeal Rules 
             of r 4. If trial counsel had apprehended that there was any significant risk that the jury might have misunderstood the true nature of their function in relation to this matter of corroboration then the point was available to be taken by trial counsel. If the point had been taken, and if there really had been a problem, it was a problem that was capable of simple correction. It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.’’

        The approach which his Honour indicated should be taken to r 4 accords with that adopted by McHugh J in  
        Papakosmas v R  
        (1999) 196 CLR 297 where his Honour said at 319:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error or law or is satisfied that the appellant’s conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant.’

          ‘It is now more than ever imperative that trial counsel recognise and discharge the responsibility which they owe to the trial judge to provide whatever assistance he or she may require in order, so far as possible, to ensure that the directions to the jury are such that it can be said the accused has had a trial according to law. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          For years this Court has emphasised in the strongest possible terms the need for trial counsel to take objections to the summing up or the admissibility of the evidence at the trial itself so that, if they are of substance, the judge may correct them and thus avoid appeals to this Court and possible second and sometimes third trials.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        These views were reiterated in

        R v

        [97]  
        It is disturbing that so often no account is taken of the clear warnings that have been given by this Court. It is not unusual for appellants, without making any application for leave under r 4, to proceed blithely to argue grounds that should have been raised by counsel at trial but were not. There is usually, as in this case, no explanation whatever for the omission to raise the perceived difficulties with the trial judge.  
        
       
       
        
        [98] 
         The existence of r 4 and s 99 imposes a duty on counsel to inform the trial judge of all points that arise from the summing up that reasonably could give rise to an appeal. It will not lightly be assumed that this duty has been breached. Rather, unless there is good reason to hold the contrary, it will be inferred that decisions not to raise such matters with the trial judge are taken for sound forensic reasons. No more need be said than to repeat and emphasise the remarks of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v 
          
        Sanderson 
         (unreported, NSWCCA, 18 July 1994) that:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances, to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    61 In Picken v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 319 Mason P (with whom Hidden and Harrison JJ agreed) said (at [20]-[22]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Leave to rely on an error to which no objection had been taken at the trial will be granted only where the appellant can demonstrate that the error led to a miscarriage of justice. There have been varying formulations of the test for identifying a miscarriage of justice in this context (see  
        Tripodina 
          
        and Morabito v R  
        (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 195;

        It appears to be generally accepted that the appellant must at least establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted.  
        
       
       
        
        The question of leave in accordance with rule 4 needs to be addressed in relation to the particular error identified by the appellant and its impact, in isolation and in conjunction with other errors, upon the justice of the conviction under challenge.” 
        
       
      
    62 In Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 this Court (Giles JA, Hulme and Hislop JJ) said of rule 4 (at 472, [10]-[13]):

        11 In

            ‘it is the duty of counsel appearing at the trial to take objection to matters which, in their view, are irregular, or which might be unduly prejudicial to their client, and in particular to raise, in relation to the summing up, any matters which the trial judge may have overlooked or which, in their view, he has put erroneously.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        12 A failure by counsel to perform this duty may be explicable because:

      Section 6 
       
      
    63 If the Appellant can obtain leave under rule 4, the fate of the appeal is then decided in accordance with section 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912. So far as relevant to this appeal, section 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act says: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion … that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    64 In Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ accepted that in the case before them no error was shown in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal that the proviso should not have been applied, because the jury would inevitably have convicted the appellant. However, at 373 they went on to state: 
     
      
       
        
        “The proviso has no application where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. If that has occurred, then it can be said, without considering the effect of the irregularity upon the jury's verdict, that the accused has not had a proper trial and that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. Errors of that kind may be so radical or fundamental that by their very nature they exclude the application of the proviso: see  
        R v Hildebrandt 
         (1963) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 143 at 148;  
        R v Henderson  
        [1966] VR 41 at 43 
        ;  
        R v Couper 
         (1985) 18 A Crim R 1 at 7-8.” 
        
       
      
    65 In Glennon, the High Court considered the application of that principle to the particular circumstance of a misdirection on an accused person’s right of silence. The majority, Mason CJ, Brennan and Toohey JJ, said, (at 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the right to silence is a fundamental right of any accused person, it cannot be said that  
        any 
         misdirection on that subject is a fundamental irregularity of the kind discussed in  
        Wilde 
        . In this case, the trial judge directed the jury that they were not to use the applicant's exercise of his right to silence in a manner adverse to him. This direction was perfectly proper. However, the trial judge then qualified the direction by informing the jury that they might use the applicant's silence to test the veracity of the applicant's defence. This subsequent direction was clearly erroneous. However, in the context in which it appeared and at a trial in which there was other evidence on which the applicant could be convicted and in which there was no other misdirection by the trial judge, the trial judge's misdirection was not a fundamental irregularity. We would reject the applicant's submissions in so far as they are based on this approach to the proviso.” (original emphasis) 
        
       
      
    66 In Glennon, Deane and Gaudron JJ reached the same result as the majority, but by different reasoning. They applied the view of the proviso that Deane J had adopted in Wilde whereby the proviso does not apply “in a case where, overall, there has not been a fair trial according to law”. However in applying that standard, Deane and Gaudron JJ said (at 12): 
     
      
       
        
        “A misdirection as to the use or evaluation by a jury of properly admitted evidence does not ordinarily result in there not being, overall, a fair trial according to law in the sense discussed by Deane J in  
        Wilde 
        . Rather, a misdirection of that kind is ordinarily one that must be evaluated in the light of the issues in the trial and the way in which the trial was conducted before it can be ascertained whether it might have affected the jury's deliberations.” 
        
       
       
      Submission 
       
      
    67 Mr Johnston, counsel for the Appellant on the appeal, submits that there has been a “fundamental error” in the directions to the jury that has led to a miscarriage of justice. That miscarriage arises, in his submission, because there is a “real risk that as a result of incorrect directions and in the absence of correct directions the jury misused the evidence of the silence of the appellant.” 
     
      
    68 Mr Johnston submits that the errors in the summing up are “so fundamental as to exclude the operation of the proviso”. In support of that proposition he relies upon Wilde. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
       
      Common Law Right of Silence 
       
      
    69 The two paragraphs of the summing up concerning which the Appellant complains (para [39] above) performed different functions in the structure of the summing up. The first paragraph is an accurate statement of the undisputed evidence in the case. The second paragraph purports to summarise an aspect of the Crown case concerning that evidence. The factual accuracy of the first paragraph does not necessarily mean that the judge made no error in stating those facts to the jury. 
     
      
    70 When the two paragraphs are taken together the jury could very well take from them that the Crown was suggesting that the failure of the Appellant to tell the Customs officers or the Federal agents the story that he had told in evidence was a reason why his account of how he came to be in possession of the two bags should not be accepted. Even though the judge was purporting to summarise the Crown submission (albeit inaccurately, as the Crown had said nothing about the failure of the Appellant to tell the substance of his defence to “Agent Santamaria”, or “the federal agents”) the judge said nothing about that being an illegitimate way for the jury to reason. In my view that is a clear contravention of the Appellant’s right of silence, as expounded by the High Court majority in Petty, and as illustrated by the decision in Glennon. 
     
      
       
      Section 89 
       
      
    71 I am not persuaded that there has been any separate contravention of section 89 Evidence Act. Section 89 is narrower in its scope than the common law concerning the right of silence. There was neither failure nor refusal by the Appellant to answer one or more questions put or made by an investigating official. Nor did he fail or refuse to respond to a representation from an investigating official. The Appellant made clear to Mr Santamaria that, if Mr Santamaria were to ask any question he would not answer it, but the interview after that point never got to the stage of any question actually being “put or made”, or any representation being “put or made”, to him. Thus the occasion for operation of section 89 has not arisen.

    72 Even though cases have identified types of circumstances in which a court should be “slow to act” under rule 4, or when it is “extremely difficult” to satisfy a court concerning rule 4, or what would “usually” or “generally speaking” happen under rule 4 in certain types of situation, the decision whether to grant leave remains a judicial discretion to be exercised taking into account the particular circumstances of the case in question. It should also be exercised taking into account the purpose of the provision. The purpose includes, as one side of the coin, encouraging counsel at trial to provide proper assistance to the court and; as the other side of the coin, providing a means whereby counsel appearing for an accused at trial can have no confidence he will be able to obtain for his or her client an option on having a new trial by failing to object to an error that has occurred in the course of the proceedings. 
     
      
    73 No explanation has been given on behalf of the Appellant, or even speculated at in the submissions made on his behalf on the appeal, as to why counsel appearing at the trial did not take the point that the judge’s direction contravened the right of silence and request the judge to withdraw and correct the offending parts of the direction. The principles concerning the right of silence, and those concerning the operation of rule 4, are ones that are likely to be well known to experienced counsel.  
     
      
    74 The passage in the summing up that is the basis of the appeal occupies approximately half a page of text, in a summing up that occupies in total just over 19 pages of text. It is quite plausible that counsel at the trial did not regard it as, overall in the context of the trial, creating any injustice.  
     
      
    75 As well, in seeking to understand how it happened that counsel did not seek to correct the error, one can consider what may have happened if the judge was asked to correct the direction.  
     
      
    76 Consistently with Jones and Reeves it would have been open to the trial judge to tell the jury that, while they could not draw any inferences from the Appellant’s failure to tell the Customs officers and Federal agents the account he gave in the witness box, they could take into consideration any inconsistency between matters that the Appellant had told the Customs officers and his evidence at the trial. The judge could tell them that the way they could take any such inconsistency into account was in deciding whether to regard the Appellant’s evidence at the trial as a reason for not finding the Crown case proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    77 A very significant inconsistency between what he said to the Customs officers and his evidence at the trial was his affirmative response to a question about whether the brown bag was “yours”. The context in which he made that statement was significant; namely, after Ms Purcell had told him that she suspected his bag contained cocaine and that he had a right to remain silent. He was specifically told that his other baggage would be searched “to make sure you don’t have any more of this sort of thing with you today”, and that the Customs officers would be contacting the Australian Federal Police. It was in that context that, when specifically asked, the Appellant said that the brown bag was his, and did not say that it was the property of someone else.  
     
      
    78 As well, there are some other matters in his conversations with the Customs officers that a jury might regard as falling short of actual inconsistency with his evidence at the trial, but that a jury would need to take into account in evaluating his evidence at the trial. These include his statement to Mr Tammareddi that he had packed his bags himself and was fully aware of the contents of his luggage, and his explanation for why the lining of the computer bag was thick and heavy.  
     
      
    79 It is quite plausible that counsel may have taken the view that, overall, it would not be helpful to his client to have the misdirection corrected at the price of the jury having pointed out to them the use that they were entitled to make of the Appellant’s discussions with the customs agents. 
     
      
    80 A very important circumstance in deciding whether to grant leave under rule 4 is whether the accused lost a real chance of acquittal by reason of the error in the summing up. In the present case I am not persuaded that he did. In essence, his account had the following elements:  
     
      
       
      - He had been asked, by two strangers that he had met comparatively briefly, and by chance, to go to a country that he had never been to before to perform an important business task for them. 
       
       
      - The strangers offered to engage him on the strength of his own account of himself and his experience. 
       
       
      - The information that he had about the two strangers was extremely scanty. 
       
       
      - He was prepared to spend a significant amount of his time, and pay a significant amount of his own money for accommodation and incidental expenses, in the expectation that the strangers would pay him a fee, and reimburse his expenses, upon his completion of the task. 
       
       
      - He set off to perform that task within days of them first asking him, and without doing any research or preparation to enable him to perform the task. 
       
       
      - So far as his evidence goes, he had only the most general idea of the type of business for which he was to prepare a feasibility study, and there is no mention of any budget or other financial constraints within which the proposed business would operate. 
       
       
      - While it was he who purchased his airline ticket to Australia, he did so partly with cash that the strangers had provided, and partly with money that the strangers had arranged to be sent to his wife so she could forward it to him. 
       
       
      - The strangers gave him the two bags that contained the cocaine on the morning he departed, and he thought nothing unusual about that. 
       
       
      - He did not notice that the computer bag was any heavier than his old computer bag. 
       
      
    81 One needs to add to that the matters referred to in paras [76]-[78] above, and, the discrepancy between the time of the return journey on his ticket and his stated intention as to how long he would stay in Australia. 
     
      
    82 The account he gave of the circumstances in which he came to Australia was so bizarre that I do not accept that there is a real chance that a jury would regard it as a reason for not drawing the inferences that would otherwise arise from the presence of the cocaine in his luggage. 
     
      
    83 I do not regard the misdirection concerning the right of silence as being such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. The reasons given by the High Court in Glennon as to why a misdirection on the appellant’s right of silence was not a fundamental irregularity of the kind discussed in Wilde apply equally, in my view, to the misdirection involved in the present case. 
     
      
    84 In circumstances where the judge had told the jury, when Mr Santamaria was giving his evidence, that no inference unfavourable to the accused could be drawn from his exercising his right to decline to talk to the police, I would incline to the view that there was no error involved in failing to repeat that direction in the summing up. However, even if I were wrong in that view, a deficiency in the summing up arising from failure to repeat that direction would not be a departure from the essential requirements of the law going to the root of the proceedings, and in the circumstances that I have considered concerning the error in the summing up there would be no reason to grant leave under rule 4 concerning it.  
     
      
    85 In my view, the appropriate course is to refuse leave under rule 4. 
     
      
    86 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: In February 2008 the appellant was tried before Hulme DCJ (as his Honour then was) and a jury on a charge that, on 5 November 2006 and at a particular place, he: “… did have sexual intercourse with [ABC] without her consent, knowing she was not consenting and at the time of such sexual intercourse did maliciously inflict actual bodily harm upon her” contrary to section 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    2 There has been a non-publication order in respect of the identity of the complainant, in consequence of which I shall refer to her throughout this judgment as “ABC”. The particular form of sexual intercourse that ABC alleged she had been subjected to involved the appellant inserting a beer bottle into her anus.  
     
      
    3 After a four day trial the appellant was convicted of an attempt to commit this offence, but was not convicted of the offence charged. It appears that the jury were not satisfied that her anus had actually been penetrated by the beer bottle. 
     
      
    4 The appellant has been in custody from the date the jury returned their verdict, 26 February 2008. He was sentenced on 5 June 2008 for the offence of attempted aggravated sexual assault. The sentence was that there be a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months, the sentence to date from 26 February 2008, with the appellant to be eligible for release on parole on 25 August 2012. Some other orders were made pursuant to sections 12(2) and 39 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.  
     
      
    5 The appellant and ABC had been in a de facto relationship for several years before November 2006. They had purchased three adjacent houses in the Hunter Valley town in which they lived, and lived in one of those houses, that they were in the process of doing up. The appellant worked as an interstate truck driver, and was regularly away for days at a time. The events the subject of the charge occurred on a Sunday, after the appellant had returned on the previous Friday night from an interstate trip, and at a time when the appellant had consumed several bottles of beer, though the number of bottles and type of beer was a matter of contention at the trial. 
     
      
    6 The appellant appeals against his conviction, and, in the event that that appeal is unsuccessful, against the severity of the sentence. In the appeal against conviction the appellant has been granted leave to amend his grounds of appeal, so that they now read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1 
        
       
       
        
        There has been a miscarriage of justice in that defence counsel incompetently conducted the appellant’s trial in two respects: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) failed to properly articulate the basis upon which to cross-examine the complainant pursuant to section 293(4)(b) of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act  
        1986 
        ; and 
        
       
       
        
        (2) failed to cross-examine in respect to the DNA evidence so as to ascertain the reasonable possibility of 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) transference and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) that the DNA may be from a relative; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) that the bottle did not come in contact with the complainant’s anus.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 There is a single ground in support of the application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances in light of the following: 
        
       
       
        
         The applicant’s first time in prison (at age 52, without any relevant convictions and a person of good character). 
        
       
       
        
         The applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
         The offence was an isolated aberration in the context of a de facto relationship when the applicant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.” 
        
       
       
      Conviction Appeal 
       
      
    8 The witnesses called for the Crown were ABC, ABC’s daughter (to whom ABC had made a telephone call soon after the incident complained of), ABC’s aunt (who ABC telephoned after the incident, and who then drove to ABC’s house to collect her and take her to hospital), three police officers involved in investigation of the incident and collection of forensic evidence on the night of the incident and the next day, another police officer who was custody manager of the police station when the appellant was taken there, and a doctor who saw both ABC and the appellant on the night of the incident or the next day.  
     
      
    9 The witnesses in the appellant’s case were the appellant himself, and a next door neighbour who had seen and been involved in some of the events occurring around the time of the incident. 
     
      
    10 The Crown tendered various exhibits, including photographs of the injuries to the complainant, photographs of both the outside and the inside of the complainant’s house, and records of phone calls relating to the complainant’s house. There was also a certificate relating to a DNA analysis conducted on a beer bottle, and concerning swabs taken from the house which were positive for blood and matched the appellant. 
     
      
       
      The Section 293 Ground of Appeal 
       
      
    11 The first respect in which miscarriage of justice arising from incompetence of counsel is asserted arises from an application that counsel for the appellant at the trial (who was not the same counsel as appeared for the appellant on the appeal) made to the judge at the start of the second day of the trial. Counsel had begun his cross-examination of ABC the previous afternoon, but the cross-examination that afternoon had been only a few questions, of the most introductory kind.  
     
      
    12 At the start of the second day counsel sought a ruling “as to whether I can cross-examine without infringing the provisions of section 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act”.  
     
      
       
      The Statutory Provision  
       
      
    13 Section 293 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible.

          (b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) if:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the accused person is alleged to have had sexual intercourse (as defined in section 61H (1) of the  
            Crimes Act  
            1900 
            ) with the complainant, and the accused person does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the evidence is relevant to whether the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury is attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to have been had by the accused person, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) if the evidence is relevant to:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) whether at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence there was present in the complainant a disease that, at any relevant time, was absent in the accused person, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) whether at any relevant time there was absent in the complainant a disease that, at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, was present in the accused person, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) if the evidence is relevant to whether the allegation that the prescribed sexual offence was committed by the accused person was first made following a realisation or discovery of the presence of pregnancy or disease in the complainant (being a realisation or discovery that took place after the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence), 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) if the evidence has been given by the complainant in cross-examination by or on behalf of the accused person, being evidence given in answer to a question that may, pursuant to subsection (6), be asked, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) A witness must not be asked:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (6) If the court is satisfied:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (7) On the trial of a person, any question as to the admissibility of evidence under subsection (2) or (3) or the right to cross-examine under subsection (6) is to be decided by the court in the absence of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) If the court decides that evidence is admissible under subsection (4), the court must, before the evidence is given, record or cause to be recorded in writing the nature and scope of the evidence that is so admissible and the reasons for that decision.” 
        
       
      
    14 The proceedings in the present case were ones in respect of a prescribed sexual offence.  
     
      
       
      Counsel and the Judge Discuss Section 293 
       
      
    15 The exchange between counsel and the judge concerning the possibility of the judge making a ruling concerning section 293 began: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        [COUNSEL] 
        : My instructions the case of the accused is that shortly after 5 November 2006 the complainant and the accused re-commenced to have a relationship within the usual terms, an emotional relationship, including sexual relations, that continued right up until Monday afternoon of this week, Monday evening of this week, including Sunday the seventeenth, Monday the eighteenth of February and through January, through last year, 2007, at least three times a week, in circumstances where she was residing at the premises [where the incident had happened] and he was residing up at Gillieston Heights and/or travelling back from wherever he’d gone to in his destinations and journeys as an interstate truck driver; he’d come back and stop there and stay with her overnight and then go back to his own place, up at Gillieston Heights but I’m told that that carried on in that fashion for something like, I suppose – what are we talking about now – sixteen months, I suppose. 
        
       
       
        
        The issue is that the unlikelihood of – this is why I seek your Honour’s ruling – it’s the unlikelihood of such a relationship resuming and in the intimate way that it has, if there’d been the act carried out as alleged by the complainant, that is the insertion of the bottle and/or his fist into her anus as she alleges. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, whether that infringes the section itself is a moot point but the way I would want to put it is that there’s been a continuing – and I don’t want to go into the details, intimate details of it, your Honour, at all because that would be inadmissible but just merely to cover that relationship. It’s just not something – I mean an ADVO was taken out against him that he wasn’t to reside at the premises but that did not prevent him from going to the premises because he’s an owner of the house and two adjoining houses and continue to go there, working on those premises, during the last sixteen months. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : How do you say subsection 3 of section 293 does not apply? 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : Subsection 3 of 293? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : You’ve got 293. Subsection 3 renders the evidence inadmissible. Subsection 4 provides exceptions. Which exception are you relying upon? 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : Your Honour, I’m having difficulties in fitting myself into the section itself because we’re not going into any of those specific matters there. I’ve looked at it very quickly. I just can’t see that – I can’t deal with (a) for example, 4(a), that is the complainant’s lack of sexual experience; I can’t do that. Is of events that allegedly form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the offence was committed; well, no, I can’t bring it under (a)(2). (b) There was existing or [recent] at the time of the commission; I can talk about that matter but I don’t want to go into that in detail because it might contravene there.” 
        
       
      
    16 Counsel then sought to raise some other topics with the judge, but the judge directed his attention back to section 293: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        HIS HONOUR 
        : … You’re asking to be able to cross-examine her as to the continuation of a relationship from some time soon after 5 November until Monday of this week. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : So, which provision in subsection 4 would tend to permit that? 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : I just don’t see it there, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : Well, why do you say you should be allowed to raise it? 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : Well, the cases seem to say this, your Honour, that this section should not be construed narrowly to prevent otherwise relevant evidence to be admitted. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : What cases are you referring to? 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : I’m looking at  
        Morgan’s case 
        , your Honour, it’s in the reported service that I pulled off the net this morning. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : I think  
        Morgan 
         was one of the early cases in which something was said about if cross-examination of this nature was proposed that the parameters of it should be reduced to writing and provided. Has that been done? 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : No, it hasn’t, your Honour but I can do that very shortly but I thought that as I didn’t come strictly within it, within the section itself, I’d articulate the matter in the first instance and then I can, your Honour will see, in short terms, it will only be very short.” 
        
       
      
    17 After counsel had accepted that the prohibition in subsection 3 made the evidence he wished to adduce prima facie inadmissible, the exchange continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        HIS HONOUR 
        : So, subsection 4 is what you’ve looked to to find some exception to it. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : And you’re saying that you can’t find any exception to it. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : I can’t, your Honour, no. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : Well, the section is quite clear in its terms then. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : Yes. Quite frankly, your Honour, I just can’t see where it fits in on subsection 4. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : Well, that seems to be the end of the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : Yes but I suppose, your Honour, if the witness was asked the question, ‘You’ve continued to have a relationship with him’ and there being no suggestion of a sexual kind, that would not be prohibited. In other words, ‘You’ve seen him three times a week; you’ve made contact with him; you were with him on Monday and had coffee and drinks at a local hotel; he took you home; you were going to have dinner with him on Sunday evening; you were dressed and you made phone calls to him’. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : Well, the term ‘relationship’ has connotations, particularly when it’s in the context of two people who have had a relationship, which clearly included sexual activity. To say that she’s continued to have a relationship, to my mind, implies continued sexual activity which would be out of bounds, unless you can bring it within one of the exceptions. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : I suppose if you were to ask her whether she has seen him in certain situations which wouldn’t imply sexual activity, that wouldn’t be prohibited. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : No, of course but I’m trying to, as I say, I’m seeking the court’s guidance as well. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : I can’t advise you. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : No, I know that, your Honour but I’m seeking the court’s guidance in the sense that, as your Honour’s just said, “You’ve seen him”; yes, I acknowledge that. I don’t want to infringe the section itself. My learned friend and I have had some discussions about what my case is about and I don’t think that he’d argue to the contrary, about the facts. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : It seems to me that if you were to raise incidents in which they have seen each other but in terms that do not imply any sexual activity, that wouldn’t be prohibited. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        : No. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : Anything you want to say about that, Mr Crown? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR 
        : No, I agree with that. I support what your Honour says about the use of the term ‘relationship’ though because the section’s quite clear, it’s a blanket prohibition and extends to any implication, quite clearly. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : Yes, I think that term would imply sexual activity, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR 
        : But merely to go to instances where there’s been contact between the two-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        : Yes, he’s lobbed around, she’s had him in the house, they’ve had coffee together or whatever. That’s a different matter.” 
        
       
       
      Evidence before the Jury about Post-Incident Contact 
       
      
    18 Upon resumption of the cross-examination of ABC, the first topic that counsel turned to was contact between ABC and the appellant after the offence. The second day of the trial was Thursday 21 February 2008. ABC accepted that the previous Monday she had gone with the appellant to a Gloria Jean’s coffee shop for a cup of coffee, then drove with him in his car to the licensed club where they consumed alcohol, after which he drove her to her home, and left. They were together from about 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm on that occasion.  
     
      
    19 In the previous week, the appellant had wanted to take ABC out for Valentine’s Day, but she was otherwise occupied. On the Sunday morning he had turned up at her house at 2:00 or 3:00 am, she let him in, and he left about 6:00 in the morning.  
     
      
    20 Since the incident the subject of the charge “three times probably” ABC had, at the appellant’s request, picked up some truck parts and dropped them off to the appellant’s premises at Gillieston Heights. 
     
      
    21 ABC accepted that she had been away with the appellant in his truck since the incident, including on trips to Melbourne, Adelaide and Tamworth. The trip to Tamworth was a one-day trip. She accepted that she had travelled with the appellant for seven days from Sydney to Woomera in South Australia, but said that was with the appellant “and plenty of other drivers”. Counsel cross-examined her suggesting various specific dates and destinations of trips on which she had accompanied him since the incident, but she did not assent to some of those suggestions, and in relation to some of those suggestions gave evidence to the effect that she thought that any such trip had been in 2006. She accepted that on Boxing Day 2007 the appellant was at her home. Concerning that incident she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Yeah, the neighbours were coming. Yeah, the neighbours were there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And they came around for a drink? 
         
        A. He’s always there, he doesn’t leave. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No, no. I said “And the neighbours came around for a drink”, isn’t that correct? 
         
        A. Yeah, the neighbours did.” 
        
       
      
    22 The cross-examination then turned to other topics, until there was a short adjournment. After the adjournment counsel returned to the topic of contact between ABC and the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I just want to go over a couple of things with you that we were – I was asking you this morning. Last Sunday morning 17 February, it is true that you contacted the accused using your mobile phone, is that correct? 
         
        A. I can’t remember, yeah.” 
        
       
      
    23 After some imprecise answers, the cross-examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. But did you use that phone that belonged to your ex husband in the early hours of Sunday 17 February this year to ring the accused? 
         
        A. Yeah it’s in my bag but I don’t know the number. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, is that what you’re saying, yes? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I just want to be clear about this. You’re agreeing that you used that phone to contact the accused in the early hours of Sunday? 
         
        A. Yeah I think so, I’m not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL] 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And I’m suggesting to you that the tone of the conversation was when was he going to arrive at [the town where ABC lived]. Do you agree with that? 
         
        A. No I thought it was the 6 
        th 
        , the Saturday. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’m talking about Saturday night, Sunday morning, early hours of Sunday morning 17 February. Do you understand? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you understand? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well I suggest to you that you did ring him using this service that you say is subscribed in the name of your ex husband, [name] in the early hours of Sunday 17 February on at least four occasions before 3 am. What do you say to that, am I correct or not? 
         
        A. It could possibly be. I can’t – I think he rang a few times and it kept hanging up and I kept ringing back to see if he could be contacted. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’ve said that he left about 6 am that morning after you’ve had a conversation with him, is that right? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I suggest to you it was 8 am when he left? 
         
        A. Yeah about 7 I thought.” 
        
       
      
    24 Other evidence concerning contact between the complainant and the appellant was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You do agree that you rang the accused on the telephone, the mobile phone subscribed through your former husband, [name] at about 11.41 on 15 February, that’s last Friday? 
         
        A. Yeah that’s when he rang from somewhere for about four or five hours in the morning because it was the night after Valentines Day. He was accusing me of going out somewhere and I never went anywhere. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said – you left a message on his voice message which said “Just me, just wanted to find out if you got onto the bloke about the keys?” 
         
        A. Yeah the keys for the house. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You rang him again at 3.50 on 15 February and-- 
         
        A. --cause his phone kept cutting on. He’s got another prepaid number. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. All right, but you left a message saying “Just me, talk later”, is that right? 
         
        A. Oh probably yeah. I ring him on his normal number and it diverts to this other number. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You rang him on Thursday 14 at 11.23 am and left a message “Just me, talk later.” Do you agree? 
         
        A. On what day? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You left a message at 11.23 am on 14 February that said “Just me, talk later”? 
         
        A. Yeah because he sent flowers. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He phoned you at 8 o’clock of Sunday last, 17 February and you spoke for some time with him. Is that correct? 
         
        A. I can’t remember.” 
        
       
      
    25 In re-examination the complainant was asked the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You’ve been asked a lot of questions about the contact that you kept with the accused Mr Taylor from the day of this incident, 5 November 2006, right through until this week? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is there a reason why you kept contact with him during that period of time? 
         
        A. Because he owns half of the properties that we’re renovating and his attitude is he’s entitled to be there and I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were asked about a number of trips you made with him in the truck since that day, 5 November 2006, including a long trip down into South Australia? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And at least one trip to Tamworth? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is there a reason why you went with him on those occasions in the truck? 
         
        A. Because if you don’t go with him he thinks you’re at home with boyfriends or running around town somewhere, he doesn’t know where I am, so he’d prefer me to go in the truck with him.” 
        
       
       
      Addresses Concerning Post-Incident Contact 
       
      
    26 In the course of address the prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may well be suggested to you that [ABC’s] credibility nosedives because she’s maintained contact with the accused since these events on 5 November 2006 and you’ve heard that as recently as Monday of last week she had coffee with him at Gloria Jean’s and went to some licensed premises in Tomago and the argument might run that if these terrible things had been inflicted on her as she says, that she wouldn’t continue contact with him over the period of time that has elapsed since then. That I would submit to you, might be an argument of some weight if they were virtual strangers. That’s not the situation here. These are people that have been in a longstanding de facto relationship for at least two or three years. They met in, I think February 2002, they’ve been living together for quite some time and they’re tied together. Not because of mutual feelings that they have for one another and obviously there’s some feelings there, but they’re also tied together financially. They’re wrapped up in this development of the three properties that they had.” 
        
       
      
    27 In his address counsel for the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We would say to you that if you look at the relationship between these people in the sense that they’ve been seeing each other, they had legal arrangements between themselves in this land, there’s no doubt about that. But did you notice that when she was being cross-examined about having seen him, recent times, the trips down to Roxborough Downs, Woomera in a truck with him for a week, back to Melbourne, Dandenong, Sydney, Tamworth, Orange, Binnaway, Dunedoo. Unlikely that somebody, unlikely members of the jury, that someone who’d been assaulted in such a violent fashion, to insert a bottle into your anus, would want to go with a man in those circumstances, particularly when you’d made a statement to the police and on the Monday afternoon and there’s a little dispute about it. You might have thought this trial was listed to commence on Monday. She’s with him drinking coffee at Gloria Jean’s, somewhere in Hamilton she says, I think it might be in Darby Street, Cooks Hill or Newcastle, but anyway it doesn’t matter. Went to Tomago Bowling Club and had a couple of beers, or a drink or two. 
        
       
       
        
        Sunday morning, he says, arrived at her place at 3.30, left at eight. Arrangements, telephone calls with each other. The flowers for Valentine’s Day. If that was the case, he stuck a bottle in your anus, with the force that she described you’d hunt him. Commonsense, objective reality says that. Objective reality is the reality that all of us inherit from our parents, our society, that says that you don’t willingly you might have thought with commonsense keep company with a man that jams a bottle into your anus, in the fashion in which this woman says occurred. You’d think you’d keep right away from him. Irrespective of whether you had legal dealings with him in land or otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    28 In his summing up to the jury the judge said nothing about the evidence concerning contact between the complainant and the appellant after the incident. 
     
      
       
      Relevant Legal Principles 
       
       
      Section 293 Criminal Procedure Act 
       
      
    29 Section 293 Criminal Procedure Act is in terms that do not relevantly differ from those of the former section 409B Crimes Act 1900, which was enacted in 1981. Section 409B(3)(b) was in terms that differ only stylistically from section 293(4)(b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    30 In R v White (1989) 18 NSWLR 332 this Court (Gleeson CJ, Carruthers and Badgery-Parker JJ) considered the scope of the prohibition in section 409B(3) that is analogous to the present section 293(3) Criminal Procedure Act. Their Honours said, at 340C-D: 
     
      
       
        
        “The word ‘disclose’ means to make a statement which reveals or makes apparent some fact which was previously unknown to someone who hears or reads the statement:  
        Foster v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 
          
        (1951) 82 CLR 606. The evident purpose of the legislation is to limit the circumstances in which complainants in sexual assault cases will have to endure having what might otherwise be personal and sensitive matters made public knowledge by virtue of evidence given in court. The width of the expression ‘discloses or implies’ and the use of the phrase ‘has or may have had’ demonstrate that what attracts the prima facie exclusion is the information or imputation which the evidence conveys to someone who hears or reads it.” 
        
       
      
    31 Their Honours also considered the scope of the exception in section 409B(3)(b). They said, at 341D-F, that the “relationship” there spoken of “must be something more than what exists between two people who have met one another once or twice before and who strike up a conversation on a beach”. They held that the meaning that “relationship” had in that particular context was, of two possible dictionary meanings they considered, closer to the sense conveyed by a definition of “relationship” as being “an emotional connection between people, sometimes involving sexual relations”. It is to be noted that their Honours were not purporting to themselves give a definition of “relationship” as it appears in section 409B(3)(b). 
     
      
    32 The account of “relationship” given in R v White was extended by Gleeson CJ, Campbell and Mathews JJ in R v Henning (NSWCCA, 11 May 1990, unreported). Their Honours said, at 76-77: 
     
      
       
        
        “Putting aside for a moment the temporal requirements of paragraph (3)(b), it would seem to follow from  
        White 
         that an emotional and/or a sexual connection between the parties will ordinarily, although not necessarily always, be the basis for concluding that there is a ‘relationship’ between them. We say and/or a sexual connection, for we do not consider in the circumstances that the emotional aspect is as important as the sexual one. We are, after all, considering the matter in the context of an alleged sexual assault. So if the evidence were to disclose a reasonably regular sexual liaison between the parties, which was still current or recent at the time of the alleged offence, then we consider that this would constitute a relationship under paragraph (3)(b). It would be immaterial that there was little or no emotional involvement between the partners to the sexual activity.  
        
       
       
        
        We have entered into this discourse only because of its particular relevance to this case. For it would be unwise to attempt to define ‘relationship’ under paragraph (3)(b) too closely. In this volatile area of human activity, there must be a degree of latitude in order to enable judges to meet the particular exigencies of individual cases.” 
        
       
      
    33 Similarly, R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 517-8 recognised that “relationship” in section 409B can be wider than the meaning adopted in R v White, and can extend to the sort of relationship that exists between an adult and the child he sexually abuses, in which there might be no “emotional connection” beyond the abuser’s desire for the child.  
     
      
    34 The restriction on admissibility of evidence about sexual activity created by section 409B(3) applies to both consensual and non-consensual sexual activity: HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2; (1999) 197 CLR 414 at [28]-[31] per Gleeson CJ, [51] per Gaudron J, [92] per McHugh J, [124] per Gummow J, [147] per Hayne J. 
     
      
    35 It is possible for evidence of acts occurring after the incident the subject of the charge to be admitted under section 409D(3)(b) if they are relevant to the charge: R v Beserick (subsequent sexual contacts between accused and complainant admissible as showing guilty passion at the time of the alleged offence); R v Morgan (1993) 30 NSWLR 543 (evidence admissible under equivalent of section 293(4)(a) of complainant having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend [a man other than the accused] within an hour or two of the alleged offence and making no complaint to him). 
     
      
    36 There is ample authority in this Court that the categories of exception defined by section 409B(3) should be construed broadly when the material in question is otherwise relevant to the issues of the case: R v McGarvey (1987) 10 NSWLR 632 at 634C-D per Hunt J (with whom Wood and Allen JJ agreed); R v Henning at 70-1 per Gleeson CJ, Campbell and Mathews JJ; Dimian v R (1995) 83 A Crim R 358 at 365 per Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Smart and Simpson JJ agreed). In R v Morgan at 551D-E Mahoney JA (with whom Gleeson CJ and Sully J agreed) identified the reason for so doing as being that the court should “adopt a construction which favours the liberty of the accused”.  
     
      
    37 In R v Warner (NSWCCA, 7 May 1997, unreported) Gleeson CJ (with whom Grove and Sperling JJ agreed) upheld an appeal against a conviction for having sexual intercourse with a complainant without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting. The trial judge had rejected evidence described by Gleeson CJ as being that (at 5): 
     
      
       
        
        “… a few weeks after the alleged rape of the complainant by the appellant … the complainant sought out the company of the appellant, went to live with him for a few days, and during that time resumed her sexual relationship with him.” 
        
       
      
    38 Gleeson CJ said, at 6, that the relationship relevant to section 409B(3)(b) “was the relationship which was allegedly existing at the time of the commission of the alleged offence.” He held that a “relationship” within the meaning of section 409B(3)(b) was in existence between the complainant and the accused at the time of the offence.  
     
      
    39 His Honour explained the relevance of the evidence that had been rejected as being (at 5-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “… it was possible that the jury might have thought that the fact that in March 1992 these two people were engaged in consensual sexual relations had a bearing upon the probabilities as to whether or not, a few weeks earlier, the appellant had subjected the complainant to the violent and degrading act of rape which she described in her evidence. There are some people who might think that conduct of that kind on the part of the complainant in March 1992 might have made it less likely that she was telling the truth about what she alleged had occurred on 30 January 1992. I hasten to say that there are other people who would not think that. It is, however, very difficult to predict what kind of effect evidence of that kind might have on the minds of individual jurors.” 
        
       
      
    40 Concerning the admissibility of the evidence, Gleeson CJ said (at 6-7): 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me impossible to deny that the evidence that was excluded in the present case was evidence relating to the relationship which was existing at the time of the commission of the offence. The relationship in question had begun before [the date of commission of the offence], it existed on [the date of commission of the offence] and it continued for a time thereafter. This was evidence about the relationship. In my view the evidence should have been allowed under s 409B(3)(b).” 
        
       
      
    41 Quite apart from the decision in Warner, there is ample judicial authority concerning the approach to be taken to a construction of the words “relating to” in a statute. For example in Joye v Beach Petroleum NL (1996) 67 FCR 275 at 285 Beaumont and Lehane JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of the phrase  
        ‘relating to’ 
        , Taylor J said, in  
        Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) 
         (1961) 105 CLR 602 at 620: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘... the expression … is extremely wide but it is also vague and indefinite. Clearly enough it predicates the existence of some kind of relationship but it leaves unspecified the plane upon which the relationship is to be sought and identified. That being so, all that a court can do is to endeavour to seek some precision in the context in which the expression is used.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Taylor J went on to say (at 620) that  
        ‘relating to’ 
         in the context there considered was not the  
        ‘equivalent of ‘referring to’; the ‘relationship’ must be based upon some more substantial ground’ 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Other decisions of the High Court have acknowledged that, ordinarily,  
        ‘relates to’ 
         is a wide term, and that it will depend upon context whether it is necessary that the relationship be direct or substantial, or whether an indirect or less than substantial connection will suffice (see  
        Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner 
         (1995) 183 CLR 323 at 338 per Brennan J, at 347 per Dawson J, at 354 per Toohey J and at 370 per McHugh J;  
        PMT Partners Pty Ltd (In liq) v Australian National Parks & Wildlife Service 
         (1995) 69 ALJR 829 at 835-836 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ and at 845-846 per Toohey and Gummow JJ;  
        Re Jarman; Ex parte Cook 
         (1996) 70 ALJR 550 at 553 per Brennan CJ and Gaudron J and at 556 per Kirby J.  
        Tooheys’ case 
         has been followed in this Court (see, eg,  
        Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Boswell 
         (1992) 36 FCR 367 at 374 per Hill J and at 383 per Cooper J).” 
        
       
      
    42 Similarly, in Oceanic Life Ltd v Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) [1999] NSWCA 416; (1999) 168 ALR 211; 154 FLR 129 Fitzgerald JA said, at [56]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The width of the phrase ‘relating to’ is undoubted. Lord Macnaghten stated that ‘[t]here is no expression more general or far-reaching’:  
        Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Maple & Co (Paris) Ltd 
          
        [1908] AC 22 at 26. See also  
        Fountain v Alexander 
          
        (1982) 150 CLR 615 at 629;  
        Colakovski v Australian Telecommunications Corporation 
          
        (1991) 29 FCR 429;  
        Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Boswell 
          
        (1992) 36 FCR 367;  
        PMT Partners Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service  
        (1995) 184 CLR 301 at 329-330, although the addition of the words ‘or depending on’ was presumably intended to give the combined phrase ‘relating to or depending on’ a wider operation than ‘relating to’. The difficulties of construction presented by such language have also been noted. Taylor J observed that ‘... the expression ‘relating to’ ... is ... vague and indefinite ...’ and ‘... leaves unspecified the plane upon which the relationship is [to be] sought and identified’:  
        Tooheys Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties 
          
        (1961) 105 CLR 602 at 620. One area of debate has been whether, in particular legislation, a relationship need or need not be ‘direct’ or ‘direct and immediate’: see, for example,  
        Ausfield Pty Ltd v Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia Ltd (No 2) 
          
        (1977) 14 ALR 457 at 460, 462; 30 FLR 477 at 480, 483;  
        Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner 
          
        (1995) 183 CLR 323 at 364 and 370;

        Perlman v Perlman 
          
        (1984) 155 CLR 474. Overall, the position judicially adopted has been that the operation of the phrase ‘relating to’ is determined by the statutory context and purpose:

    43 The potential width of the expression, “relating to”, together with the established principle that the categories of exception in section 409B(3) should be construed broadly when the material in question is otherwise relevant to the issues of the case (a line of principle clearly applicable to section 293 Criminal Procedure Act) provided a basis of authority for arguing that the evidence concerning the continuation of the relationship after the incident was admissible. This meant that having a sound basis for presenting an argument for admissibility of the evidence was not dependent upon counsel already knowing about, or being able to find, the unreported judgment in Warner. (I note that a reference, and hyperlink connection, to Warner emerges promptly if one searches the expression “409B” in judgments of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Casebase, but put that fact to one side when there is no evidence about whether a search conducted at the time of the trial would have yielded the same result. These days, use of electronic aids to legal research is part of the standard that courts are entitled to expect of counsel.) 
     
      
       
      Procedure for an Application under Section 293 
       
      
    44 The procedure that counsel should adopt in making an application under section 409B were laid down by this Court in R v McGarvey. Hunt J (with whom Wood and Allen JJ agreed) said, at 634G-635B: 
     
      
       
        
        “Counsel should be vigilant to see that there is made a proper record of the material upon which a ruling is sought pursuant to s 409 
        B 
        . Preferably, a detailed written statement of the evidence proposed to be led or extracted in cross-examination should be handed to the trial judge and marked for identification. In that way, there should be no room for any later argument in the trial or upon appeal as to what had been permitted or rejected pursuant to s 409 
        B 
        .” 
        
       
      
    45 The desirability of counsel coming to an argument about admissibility under section 293 armed with a written statement of the evidence proposed to be given arises from the terms of the section itself. Unusually amongst rules of evidence, section 293(5) imposes limits upon the questions that counsel can ask of a witness – usually counsel is free (subject to limits of proper professional conduct) to ask any question he or she likes, and wait to see whether it is objected to.  
     
      
    46 By contrast, section 293(5) forbids counsel from asking a question that would elicit evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), and counsel can ask a question that would elicit evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) only if there is a prior ruling of the court that the evidence would, if given, be admissible. For a section like that to be workable, it is necessary for both counsel, and the judge, to know in advance the substance of the evidence that would be elicited by the question.  
     
      
    47 The structure of section 293, so far as presently relevant, is that subsection (3) creates a blanket rule making inadmissible the types of evidence described in it. Subsection (4) then creates six exceptions to that blanket rule. Before an exception applies, the evidence that is proposed to be adduced must both: 1) be one or other of the types of evidence described in paras (a)-(f) of subsection (4), and 2) meet the test that “the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission”. The proposed evidence would need to be known in some detail before counsel or the judge was in a position to tell whether it fell within one or other of paras (a)-(f) of subsection (4), and whether the probative value of the evidence outweighed any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission.  
     
      
    48 Further, there is a mandatory requirement under section 293(8) for the court, before the evidence is given, to record or cause to be recorded in writing the nature and scope of the evidence that is so admissible, and the reasons for the judge’s decision that it is admissible. Again, that task can only be performed if the “nature and scope of the evidence” is known in advance. The judge’s ruling about the nature and scope of the permissible evidence should be made “with some precision”: Dimian at 367. However, there is no need for the questions that are to be asked to be specifically identified: Dimian at 364 per Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Smart and Simpson JJ agreed). 
     
      
       
      Miscarriage of Justice Through Incompetence of Counsel 
       
      
    49 In R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 Gleeson CJ (with whom McInerney J agreed) said at 685: 
     
      
       
        
        “The relevant principles, may be summarised as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
        
       
       
        
        2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.” 
        
       
      
    50 It will be seen that the third principle focuses on whether there has been a miscarriage of justice as being the test for appellate intervention, and identifies “flagrant incompetence” of counsel as “perhaps” one possible cause through which a miscarriage of justice comes about. It is the miscarriage of justice that is the basis of an appellate court’s intervention. That is because this Court is created by statute, and has only the jurisdiction that is given to it by statute. Its only presently relevant jurisdiction is that conferred by section 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    51 In the present case it is not contended that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, nor is it contended that the judgment of the court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on any question of law. Thus the only way in which the complaints that form the substance of the appeal can find a footing in section 6(1) is if the court is satisfied that “… on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”.  
     
      
    52 But a criminal appeal in which one of the grounds alleges miscarriage of justice arising from incompetence of counsel is not a civil trial of an action for negligence. It is not a disciplinary enquiry into an allegation of professional misconduct. As Gaudron J (with whom Gummow J agreed) said in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124 at 134 [30]-[31]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The words  
        ‘on any other ground’ 
         do not postulate the demonstration of error. Rather, they simply require that  
        ‘something occurred or did not occur’ 
         in the trial (see  
        R v Scott 
         (1996) 131 FLR 137 at 152; 137 ALR 347 at 362-363, per Doyle CJ).  
        
       
       
        
        As in the case where there is a defect or irregularity in the trial, the reason why something occurred or did not occur is relevant to the question whether, in the circumstances, there was a miscarriage of justice. But the relevant question that must ultimately be answered, is whether the act or omission resulted in a miscarriage of justice, not whether, if it is referable to the course taken by defence counsel, it was the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’, ‘egregious error’ or the like.” 
        
       
      
    53 Similarly, in Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 80 ALJR 614; 225 ALR 161; 162 A Crim R 301 at [8]-[9] Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where the conduct of counsel, as a participant in the trial process, is said to give rise to, or to be involved in, a miscarriage of justice, ordinarily it was what was done or omitted that is of significance, rather than why that occurred. … The nature of the adversarial system, and the assumptions on which it operates, will lead to the conclusion, in most cases, that a complaint that counsel’s conduct has resulted in an unfair trial will be considered by reference to an objective standard, and without an investigation of the subjective reasons for that conduct.” 
        
       
      
    54 One way in which an objective standard is applied to the conduct of counsel is by enquiring whether that conduct is capable of rational explanation on forensic grounds: TKWJ at 131 [17] per Gleeson CJ, 133 [25]-[27] per Gaudron J, 158 [107] per Hayne J (Gummow J agreed with Gaudron and Hayne JJ); Nudd at [16] per Gleeson CJ, [31] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, [157] per Callinan and Heydon JJ.  
     
      
       
      Evidence Concerning Counsel’s Instructions 
       
      
    55 It was in the course of argument on this appeal that the appellant was granted leave to amend his grounds of appeal. Following that amendment, the hearing was adjourned, on application of the Crown, to give it the opportunity of obtaining evidence from the barrister who appeared at the trial. The appellant was also given the opportunity to put on any supplementary evidence.  
     
      
    56 Counsel who appeared at the trial has sworn an affidavit. It deposes to the following matters. 
     
      
    57 Counsel was first retained in September 2007. He was informed by the appellant on 25 October 2007 that the appellant’s relationship with ABC had ceased after he was charged and resumed spasmodically from some time in March 2007. 
     
      
    58 At a further conference between counsel and the appellant on 14 January 2008, instructions were received that the sexual relationship had resumed in about March 2007 and continued “until the evening of the 18th February 2008” [sic]. On 14 January 2008 the appellant was requested to provide instructions and supporting material verifying that resumption of a sexual relationship. 
     
      
    59 On 17 February 2008 the appellant was requested to locate business records that could support his instructions. On the morning of 20 February 2008 the appellant produced his day books for the years 2006 and 2007, on the basis of which he instructed that sexual relations had resumed on or about 23 March 2007 at Armidale. He provided instructions about particular trips on which ABC had accompanied him, during which sexual relations had occurred. 
     
      
    60 Counsel says he came to the view that the provisions of section 293(3) applied to his factual instructions. He gave consideration to section 293(4)(b), and formed the view that the gap of four months and almost three weeks between the date of the alleged offence and the resumption of sexual relations meant that “there was no recent relationship that could connect to the commission of the offence”. He accepts that, in regarding the matter that way, he asked himself the wrong question. He was not aware of the decision in Warner. 
     
      
    61 A supplementary affidavit from the present solicitor of the appellant gives evidence that she obtained the file of the solicitors who acted for the appellant at the trial. It contained a folder said to be counsel’s brief. That folder contained four copies of a four-page document purporting to be a statement of the appellant, but that was not signed or dated. The former solicitors’ file also contained a document containing identical text to the statements just mentioned from counsel’s brief, that had a fax header identifying it as having been sent from the fax of the appellant’s former solicitors on 19 February 2008. That document paints a picture that differs in some details from the picture presented by counsel’s affidavit. It says that “since 5 November 2006” ABC and the appellant “have maintained an intimate relationship”, and that “since the alleged incident on 5 November 2006” they “have been engaging in sexual intercourse approximately three times per week”.  
     
      
    62 The statement includes a statement that the meeting between ABC and the appellant on 18 February 2008 included sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    63 It also includes details of specific dates when ABC accompanied the appellant to specific destinations, over the period 2 March 2007 to 18 January 2008, but the statement says nothing about whether sexual intercourse did or did not take place on those trips. 
     
      
    64 The Crown also filed an affidavit annexing a statement taken from ABC. It confirms that “we started to resume normal physical relations about March or April 2007”, and gives her explanation for why she did so. It was, in broad terms, that she was not strong, and had very low self-esteem, and “did not want to cause too much trouble and as time passed with the adjournments I felt an obligation toward allowing him there due to his half ownership of the property”. She asserts that now, after counselling, she recognises “that it was his dominance and control that had me remain in a relationship.”  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    65 Counsel appearing at the trial was right to concede that the evidence that he wished to adduce from ABC in cross-examination fell within the prohibition created by section 293(3). However, he failed to identify for the judge that section 293(4)(b) would enable the cross-examination to take place. In the present case, if counsel’s instructions were correct, there was clearly a “relationship” within the meaning of section 293(4)(b) between the appellant and ABC, and that relationship was existing at the time of commission of the alleged offence. Further, the evidence that counsel wished to adduce “related to” that relationship, because, if counsel succeeded in adducing it, and it was accepted by the jury, it would show that that relationship continued uninterrupted after the date of the alleged offence. The evidence is similar in nature to the evidence that the trial judge in Warner wrongly rejected. It would have precisely the sort of relevance that was identified by Gleeson CJ for the evidence that had been rejected in Warner.  
     
      
    66 Counsel was not able to identify any of the relevant cases for the judge, apart from Morgan. In the end, he did not press the application, and admitted defeat in trying to bring the evidence within subsection (4). In my view, if the application had been properly made to the trial judge, it would have been erroneous for the judge to have rejected it. That is so regardless of whether the application was made on the basis that sexual relations did not recommence until 23 March 2007, or that they commenced in the manner that counsel outlined to the judge (set out at para [15] above).  
     
      
    67 The discussion concerning section 293 did not get to the point of the judge needing to make the recording, required by section 293(8), of the nature and scope of the evidence that is admissible and the reasons why the judge decided it was admissible. However, had that stage been reached, counsel’s task in assisting the judge to comply with section 293(8) would have been considerably eased if counsel had had in written form a statement of the evidence proposed to be adduced. 
     
      
    68 Counsel’s affidavit and the statement that was contained in his brief provides proof of what I would in any event have inferred from the fact that the questions were asked at all, namely that counsel had instructions concerning the various specific trips away in the truck that he suggested to ABC had occurred after the incident. Of course, his having those instructions, and the instructions being true, or the facts to which they related ultimately being accepted by the jury, are quite different things. Similarly, to the extent to which the recently obtained statement from ABC survived any evidentiary objection, it would be a matter for the jury whether it accepted it, or regarded it as a reason for taking any different view than they would otherwise take concerning whether the elements of the offence were made out. 
     
      
    69 It is to be observed that there were various parts of ABC’s evidence that she volunteered that are consistent with an ongoing relationship that had a sexual component. I refer to her evidence that “He’s always there, he doesn’t leave” (concerning her home), the evidence about him sending flowers on St Valentine’s Day (though a jury might discount that on the basis that it was so close to the date of the trial), and the evidence about the accused regarding himself as having a right to control who ABC went out with and to know where she was.  
     
      
    70 In the present case, if one were restricted to drawing inferences from the transcript, it would be inconceivable that counsel appearing at the trial made an informed and deliberate decision not to present the type of argument that the court upheld in Warner as to why evidence of an ongoing sexual relationship between the accused and the complainant after the events that form the subject of charge was admissible. It would also be inconceivable that counsel appearing at trial made an informed and deliberate decision not to refer the judge to relevant cases on section 293 or its predecessor, or to cases that showed how the proposed evidence “related to” the relationship within the meaning of section 293(3)(b). It would also be inconceivable that counsel appearing at trial made an informed and deliberate decision to conduct the discussion (it can hardly be called an application) he had with the judge concerning section 293 when he had only “looked at it very quickly”, and without having reduced to writing the nature and scope of the evidence he hoped to elicit in cross-examination of the complainant. No forensic advantage could have come from counsel deciding to act in any of these ways. It was these actions that were the substantial cause of there being no attempt made to elicit the evidence concerning the topics on which he had instructions. Counsel’s affidavit confirms that, although he appreciated the clear relevance of the sexual relations between ABC and the appellant, he was not seeking any forensic advantage in failing to put these matters to the judge. Rather, he did not present what should have been a successful argument for admissibility of the evidence because it did not occur to him. 
     
      
    71 The Crown makes no submission that the continuance of the sexual relationship after the alleged offence is irrelevant. It submits that there was evidence before the jury of continuing contact between the appellant and ABC after the alleged commission of the offence, including trips away. It submits that we should not find that there was a substantial chance or a significant possibility that the jury would have acquitted the appellant if, in addition to that evidence of continuing contact, there had also been evidence of a resumed sexual relationship.  
     
      
    72 I do not agree.  
     
      
    73 The picture that the jury was left with, that a substantial reason for their ongoing contact was that they were locked together by their joint ownership of properties that were part way through a process of renovation, is substantially different to the picture that there would have been if the jury had had evidence of an ongoing regular sexual relationship. Of course, as Gleeson CJ explained in Warner, it would be very much a matter for the jury what significance they put on that different picture. However, when an important element of the appellant’s case was not able to be put before the jury because of the way counsel handled the application under section 293, it seems to me that the appellant has lost a real chance of acquittal. It is important, in reaching that view, that this is a case where the jury’s view of ABC’s credibility in her account of how the assault took place is of great importance, even though the Crown case is supported by more than her evidence. 
     
      
    74 In all these circumstances there has been, in my view, a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    75 It is unnecessary for the purposes of this judgment to give consideration to the possibility, adverted to by Gleeson CJ in Nudd at [9], that sometimes it may be necessary to understand why a particular course of action was taken at a trial to decide whether it results in a miscarriage of justice. The reasoning so far is sufficient to lead to the conclusion that the conviction should be set aside, and there should be an order for a new trial. 
     
      
       
      The DNA Evidence Ground of Appeal 
       
      
    76 Senior Constable Belinda Carrington is an officer of the Forensic Services Group, Crime Scene Operations Branch. She gave evidence of attending the premises about 11:30 am on Monday, 6 November 2006. The complainant was there, and pointed out various items to Senior Constable Carrington. 
     
      
    77 Senor Constable Carrington observed an empty 375 ml Tooheys Extra Dry beer bottle on the ground outside the house. She took one wet swab from both the inside and outside of the spout of the bottle, and one dry swab from those same locations. She identified the location as being “around the mouthpiece where you would normally touch a bottle if you touch a drink … and, and also just inside the lip”. 
     
      
    78 A Certificate of Analysis from Ms Sharon Neville, an employee of the Division of Analytical Laboratories of the Sydney West Area Health Service, was tendered. She had available to her buccal samples taken from the appellant and the complainant respectively. She carried out DNA testing on two areas of the beer bottle (the body and the neck) and on the swabs that Senior Constable Carrington had taken from the beer bottle. Ms Neville reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “Colin TAYLOR has the same DNA profile (in the Profiler Plus System) as the DNA recovered from the swabs from the beer bottle (item 2). This DNA profile is expected to occur in approximately 1 in 24 million individuals in the general population. Traces of DNA from a second individual were also present. [ABC] could not be excluded as the source of this DNA. 
        
       
       
        
        [ABC] has the same profile (in the Profiler Plus System) as the DNA recovered from the body of the beer bottle (item 1, area ii)[.] This DNA profile is expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion* individuals in the general population. Traces of DNA from a second were also present. Colin TAYLOR could not be excluded as the source of this DNA. 
        
       
       
        
        The DNA recovered from the neck of the bottle (item 1, area i) is a mixture which appears to originate from two individuals, one male and one female. It is approximately 573 
          
        million times more likely to obtain this mixture if it originates from Colin TAYLOR and [ABC], than from Colin TAYLOR and an unknown, unrelated individual. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A billion is defined as 1000 million.” 
        
       
      
    79 Ms Neville was not called to give evidence in chief. The cross-examination of Senior Constable Carrington clarified exactly what steps she had gone through in taking the various forensic samples that she took that day, but did not touch on any of the topics listed in the second sub-ground of ground 1 of the appeal.  
     
      
    80 Senior Constable Carrington was in the process of undertaking a diploma course in forensic investigation through the Canberra Institute of Technology. She listed the courses and training that she had undergone: 
     
      
       
        
        “… chemical targeting of trace evidence at crime scenes; certificate IV in forensic investigation; Forensic Service Group physical evidence induction course; collection of DNA evidence under the  
        Crimes Forensic Procedures Act 
          
        2000 
        . I have completed other external and in-service courses that assist me with my duties.” 
        
       
      
    81 Her level of knowledge and experience concerning how DNA is transferred, and the extent of similarity of DNA of related persons, was not likely, on the basis of the qualifications and experience she listed, to be high. However her qualifications and experience were such that it was not a foregone conclusion that she would be unable to answer such questions. 
     
      
    82 In address the Crown Prosecutor referred to the DNA evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “[ABC] has the same profile as DNA from the body of the bottle. Again, there’s traces of a second individual and the accused could not be excluded as the source of DNA from the neck of the bottle, a mixture of two individuals and it’s proper male and female, more likely from the accused and [ABC] than the accused and some unknown person. So there’s DNA on the bottle outside that lends support to what [ABC] says has taken place with that bottle. You’d have some expectation that her DNA would be on it somewhere and the location of the DNA fits in, you might think, with the way she says the bottle was used in the attack, that part of that bottle penetrated her bottom, that he was holding it in his right hand and punching at it, her bottom with it. So you’d have the expectation that there would be DNA of her around the top of the bottle and other places on the bottle as well because the other parts of the bottle would be making contact with her as well and, of course, he’s got his hand around it so his DNA would be on it as well.” 
        
       
      
    83 In address, counsel for the appellant pointed out that the testing of the swabs taken from the neck of the bottle showed the appellant’s DNA was there, but did not positively establish that ABC’s DNA was there. It also pointed out that the DNA of a second individual was said to be “traces”. There is some allusion to the testing of the neck and body of the beer bottle itself, in a context of suggesting that the location of the DNA was not consistent with her account of how she was injured. 
     
      
    84 In his summing up the judge summarised the DNA evidence, and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now one thing in relation to that ‘traces’, ladies and gentlemen, you should be careful about that, because you do not have any evidence about how DNA bearing material can be left on an object. Then you also, I suppose, need to bear in mind that you are looking at a swab, so a fairly small area of the surface area of the bottle. The entire surface area of the bottle is not the subject of this testing, but just the area from which a swab was taken.” 
        
       
      
    85 Though counsel’s affidavit gives some account of why he did not cross-examine on the DNA evidence, no useful purpose would be served by considering that account. That is because, even if I were to come to the view that there was no rational forensic explanation for failure to cross-examine on the DNA evidence, it would not contribute to the ultimate outcome of this appeal. In light of the conclusion to which I have already come, that the way in which section 293 was dealt with in the course of the trial has caused a miscarriage of justice, there would be a real difficulty in deciding whether the failure to cross-examine concerning the DNA evidence has deprived the appellant of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him. It would, in my view, be quite artificial to consider that question on the hypothetical basis that no miscarriage of justice had resulted from counsel’s having run the application for a ruling under section 293 in the manner he did. Notwithstanding the usual desirability of this Court dealing with all grounds of appeal, I do not think that, in the particular circumstances of this case, it is possible to decide the ground of appeal relating to the DNA evidence. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    86 I propose that the conviction be quashed, and a new trial held. 
     
      
    87 LATHAM J: I agree with Campbell JA. 
     
      
    88 HARRISON J: I agree with the judgment of Campbell JA and with the order he proposes. I would only wish to add some brief remarks. 
     
      
    89 As Campbell JA has accurately recorded, this is a case where the jury's view of ABC's credibility in her account of how the assault took place is a matter of great importance. One of the matters that was clearly of significance in that respect was the true nature of the relationship between her and the appellant. As a general proposition, there is an unsettling air of unreality about requiring a jury to give some consideration to the importance of any set of facts, such as a relationship between an accused person and a complainant in a sexual assault trial, without proper and appropriate access to all of the admissible details of it. In simple terms, the jury should be given the full picture if there is any chance that being given only some of it might lead to a misunderstanding of precisely what that picture was. What the jury does thereafter with that information is of course strictly a matter for the jury concerned. A jury might reason that the appellant and ABC had some form of financial interdependence from the evidence that was admitted at the trial. That was certainly an important part of their relationship but it was not the full picture. In my view, knowledge of less than all of the admissible facts about the relationship between ABC and the appellant in the particular circumstances of this case was potentially, if not actually, misleading. The exception that is contained in s 293(4)(b) appears to anticipate or to recognise this without doing any disservice to the very important safeguards and protections that it enshrines. The acts or omissions that led the jury in this case to decide it without the full picture also led to a miscarriage of justice.

     JUDGMENT 1 ALLSOP P: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    2 PRICE J: David Kalemusic seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by Freeman DCJ (the Judge) in the District Court on 14 December 2007. He had pleaded guilty to an indictment containing one count of manufacturing not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (27.5 kilograms of 3,4-methylenedioxymethyl-amphetamine) contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (count 1), one count of supply of an amount not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (1,477.4 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (count 2), one count of supply of an amount not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (764.6 grams of methylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (count 3) and one count of possession of an unauthorised firearm (.22 calibre pistol) contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996.  
     
      
    3 An offence contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is punishable by imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment has been prescribed for this offence. An offence of supply of an amount not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is also punishable by imprisonment for life with a prescribed standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment. An offence of supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is punishable by 20 years imprisonment with a prescribed standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment. An offence of possession of an unauthorised firearm contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act is punishable by 14 years imprisonment with a prescribed standard non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had asked the Judge to take into account on sentence two matters which had been included on a Form 1. One was an offence of possession of a prohibited drug (0.39 grams of methylamphetamine) contrary to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and the other was the unauthorised possession of ammunition contrary to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act. An offence of goods in custody ($4,465) contrary to s 527(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 was included on a certificate pursuant to s 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    5 The following sentences were imposed: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
         
        (including Form 1 matters) Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 11 years 3 months to commence on 1 December 2005 and to expire on 28 February 2017 with a balance of term of 3 years 9 months to expire on 30 November 2020. 
         
         
        Count 2: 
         Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months to commence on 1 December 2005 and to expire on 31 May 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months to expire on 30 November 2015. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: 
         Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months to commence on 28 August 2009 and to expire on 28 February 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months to expire on 27 August 2019. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: 
         Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 15 months to commence on 1 March 2017 and to expire on 31 May 2018 with a balance of term of 3 years 9 months to expire on 28 February 2022. 
        
       
       
        
        S166 Certificate: Fixed term of 3 months imprisonment to commence on 1 December 2005 and to expire on 28 February 2006. 
        
       
      
    6 The total effective sentence imposed by the Judge was a non-parole period of 12 years 6 months commencing on 1 December 2005 and expiring on 31 May 2018 with a balance of term of 3 years 9 months expiring on 28 February 2022. 
     
      
    7 The Judge had reduced the sentence by one sixth (sixteen and two-thirds per cent) for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    8 The Notice of Appeal identifies two grounds, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour made findings of fact that were not open to him upon the evidence before him which resulted in a sentence that was manifestly excessive. 
         
         
        2. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the sentences imposed upon co-offenders. 
        
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    9 A statement of agreed facts consisting of ten pages was tendered which for present purposes may be conveniently summarised. 
     
      
       
      On 30 November 2005, police commenced surveillance of a property at Colo Vale. In the early hours of the morning of 1 December 2005, police stopped a van in which the applicant and his brother Tom Kalemusic were travelling. They had been driving away from the Colo Vale property. The applicant was searched and $4,465 in cash was located in his pocket ( 
      s166 certificate offence 
      ). He was also in possession of a bum-bag in which there was a resealable bag containing 0.39 grams of methylamphetamine ( 
      Form 1 offence 
      ). In the glove box of the van was a silver handgun which had a magazine in it but no round in the chamber ( 
      count 4 
      ). In the van the police also found a bag and two plastic containers which contained a total of 1,477.4 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxmethylamphetamine (“MDMA”, also known as ecstacy) ( 
      count 2 
      ) and a half-filled 2 litre Coca-Cola bottle containing 764.6 grams of methylamphetamine in liquid form ( 
      count 3 
      ). Items removed from the van by police included boxes containing a number of pieces of scientific glassware and a tub which contained various printed internet documents which related to the manufacture of prohibited drug precursors and prohibited drugs. 
       
       
      At about midday on the same day, police executed a search warrant at the Colo Vale property. Inside a shed, they found a drug laboratory within which a number of chemical reactions were taking place. In the laboratory were: 
       
       
        
        (a) 27.5 kilograms of MDMA (1.038 kilograms of pure MDMA) 
        
       
       
        
        (b) 9.3 kilograms of MDP2P (capable of making a further 825 grams of MDMA) 
        
       
       
        
        (c) 213.8 litres of liquid containing 184.8 litres of pure safrole (which could be used to produce about 101.6kg of MDMA as its hydrochloride salt). 
        
       
      
    10 The laboratory had been used to manufacture MDMA and for a few days prior to the execution of the search warrant approximately 1-2 litres of methylamphetamine oil was manufactured. 
     
      
    11 Tony Suteski, Benjamin Eady, Luke Jossey, Karl Plawtschak and Tibor Vestroczi were on that day arrested at the site. Some months later Zdenko Cvitan was arrested. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    12 The applicant did not give evidence before the Judge. A Probation and Parole pre-sentence report dated 15 June 2007, a report from Tim Watson-Munro, a psychologist, dated 8 August 2007 and an affidavit of Milan Tonic were tendered. 
     
      
    13 At the time of the commission of the offences, the applicant was 35 years old. He had been born in Bosnia of Croatian heritage on 15 March 1970. His parents immigrated to Australia when he was two years old. After obtaining the Higher School Certificate, he undertook a five year part-time Associate Diploma in engineering which he almost completed. He worked with Telstra as a technical officer for about eight years. The applicant left this employment to commence work doing commercial fit outs and some self-employment in the building industry. At the time of his arrest, he was in a commercial fit out partnership. 
     
      
    14 The applicant at the time of sentence had been involved in a de facto relationship for nine years. He and his partner had six children whose ages ranged between one and five years. 
     
      
    15 The applicant’s prior criminal history revealed that he had been sentenced in the District Court at Penrith on 15 November 2001 for knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine between 13 and 19 April 2000. Three matters of being in possession of goods reasonably suspected of having been stolen and two matters of possession of prohibited drugs were taken into account on sentence on a Form 1. O’Reilly DCJ imposed a sentence of 3 years imprisonment which was to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    16 When sentencing the applicant for the present offences, the Judge relevantly said (ROS at 18): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown rather charitably it seems to me, did not suggest this conviction for a distressingly similar crime was an aggravating factor. But the submission is made and I accept that the prisoner’s demonstrated failure to learn any lesson from that previous experience militates strongly against his prospects of rehabilitation and requires more weight to be given to retribution and deterrence.” 
        
       
       
        
        and (ROS at 20): 
        
       
       
        
        “Finally I should note that despite his previous conviction of drug possession and involvement in the manufacture thereof, the prisoner has a strong history of employment. He has been a hardworking, perhaps too hard working father and provider for his wife and their six young children. The effect on his family is sad and no doubt impacts upon the prisoner himself. It is not suggested, however, that this effect should amount to extraordinary circumstances such as to have, in turn, an effect on the duration of his sentence.” 
        
       
      
    17 The Judge noted that the applicant’s former business partner would be prepared to take him back into the business which they jointly ran and said (ROS at 21): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is important therefore that the sentences to be imposed be not crushing although weighty they must certainly be.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1:  
      His Honour made findings of fact that were not open to him upon the evidence before him which resulted in a sentence that was manifestly excessive 
      . 
       
      
    18 The applicant complains that the Judge made adverse findings of fact of which he could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. Specific complaint is made of the Judge’s findings that the applicant’s possession of the drugs at the time of his arrest showed that he had “a confidence in his own authority, his place in the hierarchy” (ROS at 14), that the applicant “seems to occupy a position of some authority or at least a place closer to the organisational centre of this group than the others” (ROS at 15) and it seemed “likely that [the applicant] did have some role in facilitating the gathering of the necessary personnel and the execution of the necessary construction” of the drug laboratory (ROS at 15).  
     
      
    19 Ms Davenport SC for the applicant submitted that there was no evidence in the agreed facts that could have satisfied the Judge beyond reasonable doubt of these matters. These findings of fact, it was submitted, were critical to the Judge’s assessment of the applicant’s role in the criminal enterprise, as well as his level of objective criminality and that the Judge fell into error in determining these matters in the manner that he did. Ms Davenport made specific reference to the description of the applicant in the agreed facts by BE (Benjamin Eady) at [36] as “the handyman”. During oral submissions in this Court, Ms Davenport contended that the Judge improperly elevated that role as a handyman into something not consistent with the role described by BE. Further reference by Ms Davenport to parts of the agreed facts included at [38] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “According to BE, [the applicant] came and left…sometimes he wasn’t there for three or four days and then he came back.” 
        
       
       
      and to BE’s assertion that it was he and Tony Suteski who were involved in the manufacturing of the drug and that the applicant was sent on errands by “Steve” (Zdenko Cvitan). 
       
      
    20 As to the applicant’s possession of the drugs at the time of his arrest, Ms Davenport referred to [43] of the agreed facts where it was stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The night before the Police executed the search warrant [the applicant] arrived with his brother Tom Kalemusic. According to “BE” that was supposed to be the last day of operation. Everyone started taking things because nobody had been paid”. 
        
       
      
    21 During the sentencing remarks, the Judge related at some length the facts as agreed in the statement. His Honour assiduously sought to determine the role that the applicant played in the joint criminal enterprise and carefully considered the question of parity of his sentence with those imposed on his co-offenders. His Honour observed that BE had been identified as a foreign-born expert chemist who was imported into Australia for the purpose of assisting in raising the yields from the manufacturing process being conducted at the plant. After BE arrived in Sydney, he contacted Steve and met him. The Judge said (ROS at 10): 
     
      
       
        
        “For a period of about two weeks BE was put up in various hotels by both Steve and [the applicant] before moving to the Colo Vale property in October 2005. When [the applicant] booked BE into a hotel he used his own name and paid cash. After the hotel stays, Steve, BE, Suteski and the applicant lived in the house at Lot 5 Drapers Road Colo Vale. They then commenced converting an open shed adjoining the house into a closed shed and set up and installed the laboratory. This work on the shed continued until the end of October. 
        
       
       
        
        The laboratory was constructed under the direction of Steve who had all the plans and layouts of what had to be done. BE described [the applicant] as a handyman.” 
        
       
      
    22 The Judge recounted that according to BE, the applicant came and went, that he did things for Steve and that according to BE that everyone started taking things because nobody was paid. The Judge noted that: 
     
      
       
      (i) The applicant was involved from a very early stage in the criminal enterprise. 
       
       
      (ii) A possible interpretation of BE’s description of the applicant as a handyman was limited to the applicant’s physical involvement in the construction and equipping of the laboratory. He found that his ability to assert himself spoke more of his confidence in his own place in the hierarchy. This was consistent, his Honour said, “ 
      with the other extract from BE’s description, that he was just sitting there taking a look at us. He clearly did not regard himself as simply one of the labourers 
      ” (ROS at 14) 
       
       
      (iii) The applicant had at the time of his arrest a very considerable amount of the two products made at the laboratory, namely MDMA and methylamphetamine. The Judge observed that the precise reason for the applicant having removed these quantities of illegal drugs had not been established. 
       
      
    23 The Judge stated that (ROS at 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “He may have been taking the substances to the alleged principal, Steve. He may have been taking the liquid methylamphetamine to be further processed to bring it into powder, or the already powdered MDMA to be then made into tablets. He may, as his counsel asserts, have only been holding these drugs as some form of surety against his ultimate payment. Without his explanation it is not possible to be certain. But what his actions do convey, to me at least, is a confidence in his own authority, his place in the hierarchy which confidence enabled him to take possession of this very valuable cargo and whilst armed, to carry it away from the site of its manufacture.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour went on to say (ROS at 14-15): 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst it is said that the laboratory was being closed down and that absent any cash payment, those who had been working there were taking possession of items as payment in kind, that is not universally true. Plawtschak had a quantity of equipment and unidentified, at least to me, liquids in his motor vehicle. He, however, as recorded earlier seems to occupy a position of some authority or at least a place closer to the organisational centre of this group than the others such as BE and the mere labourers Suteski, Vestroczi and Jossey. None of them appears to have taken any of the equipment and certainly none of the produce from the laboratory. For those reasons I would rank [the applicant] as more intimately involved with the organisation of this offence and manufacture than was the offender Suteski.” 
        
       
      
    25 Ms Davenport who appeared for the applicant at first instance had submitted to the Judge that there was parity between the roles played by the applicant and Suteski, that he was a “foot soldier and not a lieutenant”, which his Honour rejected. He considered that the applicant was “in general terms certainly no less culpable than BE”. The Judge found that the applicant’s role was of real significance in the execution of the criminal enterprise. His Honour accepted the Crown’s submission that the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offence of manufacturing not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug was not lower than the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of this nature. 
     
      
    26 The Crown submitted in this Court that the findings made by the Judge were open to him on the evidence and no error had been demonstrated. 
     
      
    27 The first ground of appeal raises the findings of fact made by the Judge. When findings of fact that were made by the judge at first instance are challenged, it is well established that this Court is bound by those findings unless they were not open on the evidence, or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505; R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 per Wood CJ at CL at [61]; R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505; Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105.  
     
      
    28 The identification by the Judge of the applicant’s involvement in the manufacture of the MDMA was an important part of the sentencing exercise. In making his assessment of the applicant’s role, the Judge was not obliged to accept the description given by BE in the agreed facts that the applicant was the “handyman” nor was the Judge bound to accept that the applicant’s possession of 1,477.4 grams of MDMA and 764.6 grams of methylamphetamine at the time of arrest resulted from him not being paid. An important distinction between the applicant and other co-offenders was that he was in possession of these prohibited drugs at the time of arrest.  
     
      
    29 The Judge was entitled to draw inferences from the agreed facts considered as a whole. A constraint upon his Honour’s findings of fact was that those made against the applicant had to be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. His Honour expressly recognised this constraint when he excluded from his consideration the allegations contained in the statement of facts which were before the sentencing judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal in BE’s case. His Honour said (ROS at 17): 
     
      
       
        
        “In that statement allegations were made against this prisoner and clearly since they are not repeated before me, they could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown.” 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour’s identification of the applicant’s role arose from his consideration of the applicant’s early involvement in the criminal undertaking, the assistance that he provided at Colo Vale and the large quantity of the prohibited drugs which he was taking away from the property. When all of the circumstances of the applicant’s participation in the joint criminal enterprise were considered in combination the inferences drawn by the Judge which were adverse to the applicant were open to him on the evidence. The Judge was entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant’s role was of real significance in the criminal enterprise and I do not detect error in the assessment of his role.  
     
      
    31 It seems to me in any event that the applicant was treated with a degree of leniency by the Judge. The sentences for counts 2 and 3 were subsumed in the sentence for count 1. The maximum penalty for count 2 was life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period was 15 years. The quantity of MDMA (1,477.4 grams) in the applicant’s possession was almost three times more than the amount prescribed for the large commercial quantity of MDMA (500 grams). The maximum penalty for count 3 was 20 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period was 10 years. The quantity of methylamphetamine (764.6 grams) in the applicant’s possession was more than three times the commercial quantity (250 grams) prescribed for that prohibited drug. These were serious offences which in my respectful opinion warranted some partial accumulation upon the sentence for count 1. The maximum penalty for count 4 (.22 calibre pistol) was 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 3 years. The extent of accumulation for this offence upon the sentence for count 1 was 14 months. As to the applicant’s sentence for count 1, the Judge had departed from the standard non-parole period of 15 years by 3 years 9 months because of the applicant’s plea and considerations of totality. In my opinion, the total effective sentence was not manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    32 This ground of appeal has not been established. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2:  
      The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the sentences imposed upon co-offenders. 
       
      
    33 The applicant’s parity argument focussed on the sentences imposed upon Eady, Cvitan and Suteski. Ms Davenport submitted that the applicant was in a subordinate role to Cvitan and to Eady. It was pointed out that the Judge found when sentencing the applicant that Cvitan was the “head of the operation”. Ms Davenport contended that Eady was an integral part of the manufacturing process and had been brought to Australia because of his expertise. Senior counsel argued that the applicant was entitled to feel a justifiable sense of grievance as the sentence imposed upon him was greater than the sentence imposed upon either Cvitan or Eady. The applicant’s role, it was said, was akin to that of Suteski and that, apart from the possession of the firearm, there was no justification for the disparity in the sentences imposed on each offender. 
     
      
    34 The parity principle is “an aspect of equal justice”: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301. As was pointed out by Dawson and Gaudron JJ “like should be treated alike, but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them”.  
     
      
       
      Benjamin Eady  
       
      
    35 Eady was charged with one offence, that is, manufacturing not less than the large commercial quantity of MDMA to which he pleaded guilty. Maguire DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment for 6 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 5 years. A minor offence of possession of 2.7 grams of cannabis leaf was taken into account on sentence on a Form 1. Substantial assistance had been given by Eady to police and his sentence was reduced by a combined discount of 50 per cent for assistance and the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    36 The Crown successfully appealed and the sentence was quashed: R v HFW (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 May 2007, unreported). James J (with whom Beazley JA and Hidden J agreed) assessed at [34] the objective seriousness of Eady’s offence as being “in about the middle range of objective seriousness” and considered that an undiscounted starting point of the head sentence of 16 years was appropriate. After the reduction of the combined discount of 50 per cent, Eady was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a 6-year non-parole period.  
     
      
    37 The Judge’s determination when sentencing the applicant that he was no less culpable than Eady, as I have previously indicated, was open to the Judge on the evidence. The undiscounted starting point, however, of Eady’s sentence for the manufacture was 16 years whereas for that offence the undiscounted starting point of the applicant’s sentence was 18 years. 
     
      
    38 There were relevant differences between the applicant and Eady. Eady was sentenced for a single count of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of MDMA. In addition to the offence of manufacture, the applicant’s criminality extended to the two counts of supply and the possession of the pistol. When Eady was sentenced, one matter on a Form 1 (possession of cannabis leaf) was taken into account whereas two Form 1 offences (possession of methylamphetamine and possession of ammunition) were taken into account when the applicant was sentenced for count 1. Eady had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and provided assistance to authorities for which he received a combined discount of 50 per cent. Maguire DCJ found that Eady was contrite and had good prospects of rehabilitation. Because of the assistance that Eady had provided, he would serve the whole of the term of imprisonment in protective custody, subjecting him to more onerous custodial conditions. The applicant had pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial and received a discount of one sixth for his plea. The Judge neither found that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation nor that he had expressed remorse. His Honour considered in the passage quoted at [16] above that the applicant’s criminal history of similar offending required more weight to be given to retribution and deterrence. The applicant had not provided assistance to authorities and would not be serving his sentence in protection. All things were not equal and I am not persuaded that the difference in the sentences imposed involves a marked disparity giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
       
      Tony Suteski  
       
      
    39 Suteski was charged with the one offence of manufacturing not less than the large commercial quantity of MDMA. He stood trial before the Judge (Freeman DCJ) sitting without a jury and was found guilty. Suteski was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. A Crown appeal against the leniency of the sentence was withdrawn.  
     
      
    40 When sentencing Suteski, the Judge characterised the offence as falling “just short of the mid range of objective seriousness”. The Judge found that Suteski had no organisational or entrepreneurial role in the manufacture. When sentencing the applicant the Judge ranked him “as being more intimately involved with the organisation of this offence and manufacture than was the offender Suteski.”  
     
      
    41 His Honour went on to say (ROS at 15): 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no parity as Ms Davenport argued, between these two and that is so not just because [the applicant] is facing additional serious charges, but the real reason for parity not being established is that I find their roles were not exactly similar or indeed the same at all.”  
        
       
      
    42 In determining the roles of the applicant and Suteski, the Judge had the advantage in each case of assessing the evidence first hand and I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in rejecting the applicant’s parity argument.  
     
      
    43 There were other differences between the applicant and Suteski. Suteski unlike the applicant was found to have “more than reasonable prospects of rehabilitation” and the Judge was satisfied that he had demonstrated contrition and remorse. Suteski’s prior criminal history did not require more weight to be given to considerations of retribution and deterrence. Furthermore, Suteski was charged with one offence. As in the case of Eady, all things were not equal and the difference in the sentences imposed upon the applicant and Suteski does not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
       
      Zdenko Cvitan  
       
      
    44 Cvitan was also charged with the one offence of manufacturing not less than the large commercial quantity of MDMA to which he pleaded guilty. Zahra DCJ sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 14 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 9 years 3 months. The sentencing judge found that Cvitan was involved at an early stage in the criminal enterprise, was instrumental as the point of contact with Eady on his arrival in Australia and following, assisted in the construction of the laboratory, had purchased equipment and materials, was involved in the manufacturing process, had some management role as he received reports from Eady and was motivated by profit. Zahra DCJ characterised the offence as falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    45 The Crown appealed against the manifest inadequacy of Cvitan’s sentence. Cvitan sought leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. In Cvitan v R; R v Cvitan [2009] NSWCCA 156, Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreed) concluded that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    46 Simpson J said at [64]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Once the finding that the offence was of mid-range severity is accepted (as here it must be) it is impossible to see any justification for any greater departure from the standard non-parole period than that allowed by the reduction in recognition of the plea of guilty. That would suggest that the sentence ought to have been one of a non-parole period of 14 years and 3 months.”  
        
       
      
    47 The Court, however, declined to intervene and re-sentence Cvitan due to considerations of proportionality between the sentences imposed on Cvitan and Suteski. The Crown appeal was dismissed.  
     
      
    48 One of the grounds of appeal raised by Cvitan was that of parity relative to the sentences imposed on the applicant and Suteski. It seems that Cvitan’s role had been distinguished from that of the applicant as there was no evidence that Cvitan was or was to be involved in the distribution of the drugs. Simpson J observed at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “T 
        his was in contrast to, for example, the role of David Kalemusic, whose pleas of guilty to the two offences of supply established that he was significantly involved in the distribution of the manufactured drug.” 
        
       
      
    49 And said at [83-84]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…I accept that parity considerations entitled Cvitan to a sentence below that imposed on Kalemusic. And that is precisely what was imposed.  
        
       
       
        
        That being the case, the parity argument regarding Kalemusic avails Cvitan not at all.”  
        
       
      
    50 Cvitan’s role was held to be more significant that Suteski and the relativity between the sentences imposed upon these co-offenders was considered to be “proportionally correct”. Leave to appeal was granted but the appeal was dismissed.  
     
      
    51 In the present appeal, the applicant’s argument of disparity is founded upon the submission that the applicant was in a subordinate role to Cvitan. When sentencing the applicant the Judge accepted that to be the case. Cvitan was, however, sentenced upon the basis that his role in the criminal enterprise was at a lower level than that of the applicant. Cvitan’s sentence for that reason alone does not give rise to a marked disparity such as to engender in the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance. It is not for this Court to question the factual findings that were made when Cvitan was sentenced. If Cvitan had been sentenced as being at the top level of the criminal hierarchy, I have no doubt that his sentence would have been significantly longer than that imposed. Furthermore, unlike the applicant Cvitan was charged with one offence.  
     
      
    52 Accordingly, I propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.  
       
      
     2. Appeal dismissed.  
     
      
    53 HARRISON J: I agree with Price J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The respondent to this Crown appeal was sentenced in the District Court on 2 February 2009 for two offences to which he had earlier pleaded guilty. The first offence was contrary to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act, being a specially aggravated break, enter and steal offence committed on 5 March 2008 (“the home invasion offence”). That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and there is a standard non-parole period prescribed of 7 years. The second offence was committed on the same date and was contrary to s 33 of that Act, being an offence of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm (“the wounding offence”). That offence also carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and has a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 
     
      
    3 The Judge sentenced the respondent on the home invasion offence to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months. That sentence dated from 15 April 2008 so that the non-parole period expires on 14 October 2011. The Judge sentenced the respondent on the wounding offence to a similar sentence but it commenced on 15 April 2009. The non-parole period for that offence expires on 14 October 2012 and that is the date upon which the respondent can first be considered for release to parole. The overall sentence was therefore 8 years with an overall non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. The Crown contends that this sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    4 The facts can be briefly stated. On 5 March 2008 the respondent and a co-offender named Douglas decided to steal steroids from the home of the victim of the wounding. Douglas informed the respondent that he would be armed. At about 10.20pm the two men drove to the victim’s house in Riverstone. Douglas produced a gun from beneath the seat of the vehicle and showed it to the respondent. The two men had made balaclavas from pillowcases earlier that day, and they put these on before entering the house. The respondent was armed with a hunting knife and Douglas with a handgun. 
     
      
    5 There were five persons residing at the premises at the time including the victim, who was aged 18 and his brother aged 20. The victim and another man named Ryan were watching television when the respondent and his co-offender arrived at the house. 
     
      
    6 The respondent and Douglas gained entry to the premises by the respondent kicking open the locked front door. They confronted the two men in the lounge room and demanded that they lie on the floor. Although they complied with this demand, Douglas struck Ryan to the back of the head with the weapon. The respondent took a number of vials of steroids from a cupboard in the kitchen. The victim’s brother became aware of the disturbance in the house and confronted the two men. The respondent ran from the house. A melee then ensued during which Douglas pointed the weapon at both the victim and his brother. The victim was able to grab the hand of Douglas that was holding the weapon and the firearm was discharged five times during the struggle. 
     
      
    7 At this time the respondent re-entered the premises with the knife in his hand. The victim confronted him and they struggled, during which the balaclava came off the respondent’s head. He was thus recognised by the victim and his brother who had known the respondent since he was a child. Ryan also recognised the respondent. The victim asked the respondent why he was doing this and he replied that he needed money. The victim forced the respondent to the ground and punched him repeatedly. The respondent then stabbed the victim twice to the chest and three times to the back. One of these wounds penetrated the victim’s lung. The respondent and Douglas then fled the premises. 
     
      
    8 The victim was taken to hospital and treated for his wounds including a drain placed in his chest. He was discharged from hospital on 10 March 2008. 
     
      
    9 On 8 March 2008 police approached the respondent in a vehicle in Tweed Heads. He was arrested but declined at that time to be interviewed. On 10 March he participated in an interview with police in which he admitted involvement in the offences. He described the stabbing as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…….. I grabbed the steroids, I grabbed the speed, and then on my way back out, Isaac [Douglas] got grabbed by two of ‘em, or three of ‘em, I don't know, I can't remember how many blokes were in the house, and then, like, I ran back inside and like, and whilst I was running back inside, I heard gunshots go off, like, fuckin, like I was shocked because, like, like, you know what I mean, like, I didn’t expect gunshots to go off, and yeah, like, I ran inside, and whilst like that, sort of got into a wrestle with two of ‘em or three of ‘em I can't remember, but they had me on me back and one of ‘em was beatin’ the fuck out of me, like, beatin’ me senseless, that’s how me face is all stuff[ed] up, and I blacked out, like two times, so I just started stabbin’ him, cause I fuckin’, I just freaked and like, yeah, and hesitated, I didn't know what else to do and that was me only way out of it, and then they identified me, because I used to know ‘em when I was little, like grew up with ‘em since [a] little kid and then yeah, we ran……………” 
        
       
      
    10 Later when asked specifically about the stabbing the respondent said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Mate I was just trying to get him off me, ‘cause he was like, had all his weight on top of me, I couldn’t, there, like, there was two of ‘em on me, I couldn’t, I just couldn’t get out of it, and I, ‘cause there was just too much weight on me……..And then, yeah, like, I blacked out, and then when I just started stabbin’ like…..” 
        
       
       
      He told the police he did not know whom he stabbed, how many times he stabbed the person or where he stabbed him. 
       
      
    11 The respondent explained to the police that he and Douglas had been to the premises earlier that day to purchase drugs, but the drugs, including steroids, were too expensive. Something about the attitude of the resident, with whom they dealt, upset the respondent and he took exception to the way they were treated. As a result they decided to do the robbery. He made the balaclavas about an hour or two before they left. The respondent’s girlfriend was present and unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade him. The respondent armed himself with the knife, “just if anything went wrong”. Although he knew that Douglas had a gun, he did not know that it was loaded. 
     
      
       
        
        The respondent’s subjective case 
        
       
      
    12 The respondent was born on 4 January 1989 and was aged 20 at the date of sentencing. He has a criminal record that commenced in 2004 when he was before the Children’s Court for offences including an aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to 18 months probation and a control order of 1 month. In 2005 he was before the court for break, enter and steal and aggravated break and enter in company. For the first offence he was placed on probation and for the second ordered to perform community service. In 2006 he was sentenced to a control order as a result of breaching the community service order and sentenced to a control order of 15 months for another aggravated break and enter offence. 
     
      
    13 In 2007 the respondent was dealt with in the Youth Drug Court for an offence of aggravated robbery and again sentenced to a control order for 15 months with a non-parole period of 7 months. He breached parole and in July 2008 was required to serve the balance of the control order. In February 2009 he was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment for an offence of damaging property. He was both on bail and parole when he committed the present offences. 
     
      
    14 There was a pre-sentence report in evidence. The respondent was described as being of “Aboriginal and Italian ethnicity”. Notwithstanding that his parents separated when the respondent was very young, he described being provided with a supportive home environment by his mother and his grandfather with whom the family resided. He described his relationship with his mother as “good”. He began using illicit drugs under peer pressure when aged 15. His mother described the respondent as “emotional”. He gave an account of being a victim of racism at school against which he retaliated with aggressive behaviour resulting in his expulsion. 
     
      
    15 At the time of the offending the respondent was unemployed and without finances. He told the officer preparing the report that he was under the influence of alcohol and withdrawing from drugs when he committed the offences. The respondent had been given the benefit of residential programmes to overcome his drug problems in 2006 but was discharged due to non-compliance. Probation records indicated that the respondent had relapsed into drug use in January 2008 after a short period of abstinence. He indicated to the officer preparing the report that he needed assistance to cope with life management and to avoid drug usage. He had expressed contrition for the effect of his conduct upon the victims. 
     
      
    16 A psychologist who had assessed the respondent for the purposes of sentencing described him as: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…….. a young aboriginal man of some ability. As well as testing in the upper levels of the average rate of cognitive ability, he has evidently some sporting prowess, which has been recognized with selection of the state and national competition. However, he has not realised this potential, due to his behavioural and drug history. He still only 20 years of age, and so could still reclaim a more productive and successful life course. Given his abilities and talents, (the respondent) has the potential to be an asset to society, rather than a liability. However he will need to take active responsibility to address his drug and lifestyle issues if this is to come to fruition.” 
        
       
      
    17 The respondent gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He said that at the time he committed the offence he was “a little short of cash” and he owed money for drugs. He had been using drugs for about four months prior to the offences while he was on parole. 
     
      
    18 He first went into adult custody on 10 March 2008 and before that time had served periods in juvenile detention. He was released from custody on 15 August 2007 and was on parole until 15 April 2008. Initially he was working as a forklift driver but resigned from that employment, as he was not receiving sufficient salary. He then was able to find some casual labouring positions. It was during this period that he recommenced his drug use. He acknowledged having undertaken drug courses in the past and said he found them helpful. His mother has offered him accommodation when released. He was being held on protection because of threats made by other prisoners and had been stabbed on one occasion while in custody. 
     
      
       
        
      The sentencing remarks 
      
    19 The Judge described it as a difficult sentencing exercise having regard, principally, to the respondent’s youth, on the one hand, and on the other hand, “quite apart from the objective seriousness of the current offences, there is a substantial criminal record consisting of similar offences”. 
     
      
    20 At the beginning of his remarks he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I say at the outset that the very high maxima imposed for both offences and the standard non-parole imposed for both are a very clear indication of the great seriousness with which the community regards these very prevalent offences. General and specific deterrence are on the authorities more than usually necessary considerations in relation to these very serious offences” 
        
       
      
    21 The Judge awarded the respondent a discount for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty of 20 per cent. He found that the home invasion offence was in the mid range of objective seriousness, on the basis that the respondent did not know that the gun was loaded and, therefore, the discharge of the weapon was unexpected. His Honour assessed the wounding offence as within the mid range of seriousness. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I do not think he intended to wound anybody with the knife as a positive matter, and I think that this occurred on impulse as a result of what happened in the melee, and the victim’s quite justified attack on the offender, that I think was by way of self-defence. That is no excuse for the wounding of course, but it does point to it being essentially unplanned, as opposed to there being a positive contemplation that the knife might be used if necessary.” 
        
       
      
    22 The Judge found that the respondent was remorseful and his prospects of rehabilitation were moderate. He determined that there were special circumstances being the need for a longer period of supervision to address the respondent’s drug rehabilitation and the fact that he was serving his sentence in an adult prison. 
     
      
    23 In relation to the fact that each of the offences carried a standard non-parole period, his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Standard non-parole periods on a plea of guilty must of course be approached having regard to the principles in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 and I have done so. I was not addressed at length about these principles when I indicated I was aware of them by either counsel, but shortly one must first regard the standard non-parole period as a very significant guidepost on a plea of guilty, and secondly one must, in considering whether or not to apply it, firstly reach a view as to whether the objective seriousness of the offence places it in the middle of the range for offences of its type or above or below the range, and secondly apply the subjective features of the offender before finally determining whether the standard non-parole period, or a non-parole period or greater or less than it should be applied. I have applied these principles in reaching the sentences imposed in this case.” 
        
       
       
        
      The Crown submissions 
      
    24 The Crown contends that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate in themselves and in combination because the Judge erred in the following respects: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(a) determining that the home invasion offence was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness; 
         
         
        (b) determining that the wounding offence was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness; 
         
         
        (c) in giving too much weight to the respondent’s subjective case when balancing it against the weight of the objective seriousness of the offences and the other aggravating features; 
         
         
        (d) in failing to properly have regard to the standard non-parole period of 7 years in relation to each offence;  
         
         
        (e) in failing to impose a sentence which reflected the objective seriousness of the offending and the totality of offending.” 
         
        
       
      
    25 The Crown also contends that the sentencing judge made two patent errors, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(a) his Honour erred in taking into account the actual wounding which is an element of the s 33 offence as an aggravating feature of the s 112(3) offence. 
         
         
        (b) his Honour erred in failing to take into account the aggravating fact that the respondent was on conditional liberty x 2, pursuant to s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in relation to both offences.” 
        
       
      
    26 The Crown argues that each of the offences was of such objective seriousness that the Judge ought to have found both to have been above the mid range of seriousness. In so far as the home invasion offence is concerned, the Crown argues that the Judge gave too much weight to the assertion by the respondent that he did not know that the gun was loaded, especially in light of the fact that he returned to the house armed with a knife having heard the gun discharge. The Crown contends that there were a number of aggravating features attending the commission of this offence, and not simply the fact that the co-offender was armed with a dangerous weapon. The aggravating features were: the offence was committed in company, corporal violence was used on the man Ryan and that the respondent knew that there were persons in the premises at the time of the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    27 The Crown acknowledges that it was an error for the Judge to take into account as an aggravating feature of the home invasion offence that the victim was wounded as that fact was itself the subject of an independent charge. However, the Crown complains that it was not open for the Judge to disregard the fact that the firearm was discharged as an aggravating feature on the basis that the respondent did not contemplate that the weapon was loaded. The Crown contends that the respondent was criminally responsible for the discharge of the weapon as part of the joint criminal enterprise into which he entered with the co-offender knowing that the co-offender was armed with an apparently working firearm. 
     
      
    28 The Crown contends that the wounding offence was a serious example of its kind notwithstanding the nature of the wounds inflicted because of the following facts: the use of a knife as a weapon, the offence was committed in company, and the offence was committed in the home of the victim. The Crown submits that the Judge was in error in his finding that the respondent did not positively intend to wound anybody. 
     
      
    29 The Crown argues that the judge failed to take sufficiently into account the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty, as a result of being both on bail and on parole at the time of the commission of the offences. This is not a matter to which any reference is made in the remarks on sentence. Yet, it is contended that the matter was of such seriousness as a matter of aggravation that a failure to mention the matter could be seen as a failure to take it into account. 
     
      
    30 It is argued by the Crown that the overall non-parole period failed to reflect appropriately the standard non-parole period for each offence, and that there were insufficient factors that would have warranted a reduction in the non-parole period to the degree as that determined by the Judge. This is so even if it is accepted that it was open to the Judge to find that each offence was in the mid range of seriousness and notwithstanding the pleas of guilty. In particular the Crown contends that the degree of accumulation between the two offences was insufficient to mark the seriousness of the two offences as independent but connected criminal offences. 
     
      
       
        
        The nature of the Crown’s appeal 
        
       
      
    31 The only ground of appeal relied upon by the Crown was that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. As was pointed out by the High Court in Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579, the particular allegation contained in the notice of appeal was that the Judge erred by imposing a sentence that was unreasonable or unjust. No specific error was raised in the grounds of appeal that the Judge failed to take into account a relevant fact or took into account an irrelevant fact or made some specific error of principle. 
     
      
    32 The Crown has, as has been the usual practice in this Court for many years, sought to advance specific reasons for the inadequacy of the sentence in written submissions filed in this Court and served upon the respondent. Some of those reasons amount to an asserted failure by the Judge to take into account a relevant matter, for example the fact that the respondent was on conditional liberty. No point was taken by the respondent about the manner in which the Crown had framed its ground of appeal or the manner in which it had argued the appeal in the written submissions. In fact neither counsel sought to amplify their written submissions by oral argument before the Court. The respondent sought to answer each of the Crown’s allegations in written submissions filed on his behalf. 
     
      
       
        
        The respondent’s submissions 
        
       
      
    33 The respondent accepts that the sentencing remarks fail to refer to a number of matters that were aggravating features of the offence. However, he relies upon the fact that the Judge, during the course of submissions referred to the sentence that he had in mind, being that which he eventually imposed. He also during exchange with counsel referred to aggravating features that he intended to take into account notwithstanding that he did not mention those factors in his sentencing remarks. The submission is that it must follow, at least by inference, that the Judge took those matters into account when determining the sentence that he had foreshadowed even though he did not refer to them in his formal remarks 
     
      
    34 It was submitted that the Judge took properly into account when deciding the respondent’s criminality on the home invasion offence that he did not know the gun was loaded and therefore the discharge of the gun was not an aggravating factor of the offence so far as the respondent was concerned. It was not that the Judge had revised his initial view that the offences were below the mid range of seriousness by reason of the respondent having re-entered the house after the weapon discharged. Therefore, it was submitted, the Judge did not make any error in determining the level of objective seriousness of the offence having regard to the respondent’s conduct. 
     
      
    35 It was submitted that the Judge’s assessment of the wounding offence as being in the mid range was also appropriate and that he took into account the significant aggravating factors, being that the wounding occurred in the victim’s home and the commission of the offence in company. It was submitted that only one of the injuries was serious and this was appropriate to the level of objective seriousness determined by the Judge. It was noted that the wounding occurred when the victim was attacking the respondent and the stabbing occurred in order to stop the attack upon him and make good his escape. 
     
      
    36 The respondent notes that there was ample corroboration of the respondent’s evidence and statement to police about the circumstances of the stabbing and that the Judge was entitled to find the facts of the stabbing as he did. It was conceded that the plea acknowledged that he acted with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm but that was in the context of trying to extricate himself from an assault upon him. 
     
      
    37 As to the failure to mention the fact that the respondent was on bail and parole, it was submitted that the Judge could not have been unaware of these matters because they were raised in the evidence and in addresses. The Judge was entitled to form his view of the prospects of the rehabilitation of the respondent having heard the respondent in evidence and having questioned him. It was submitted that there was ample material to permit the Judge to moderate the sentence to reflect the respondent’s youth, remorse, his family support and matters evidencing a change in the respondent’s attitude to drugs. 
     
      
    38 It was submitted that it was within the Judge’s discretion to impose a sentence that was significantly below the standard non-parole period although it was conceded that the Judge failed to give specific reasons for reducing the non-parole period. 
     
      
    39 The Court was reminded of the approach to be taken to Crown appeals and the relevant principles set out in R v AB [2005] NSWCCA 360 and of the passage from the judgment of King CJ in The Queen v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212 as to the exercise of mercy arising where “a judge’s sympathies are reasonably excited by the circumstances of the case”. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    40 In my opinion the sentences insufficiently reflect the objective seriousness of the two offences so as to be unreasonable and plainly wrong. This would be so having regard only to the maximum penalties prescribed. But the inadequacy is even more apparent when consideration is given to the standard non-parole periods as a guidepost to the appropriate sentence to be imposed for each offence. This is notwithstanding the pleas of guilty and the discount of 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas. 
     
      
    41 I am persuaded that, had the Judge properly considered the aggravating factors that applied to each offence, especially the fact that the offences were committed while the respondent was on conditional liberty for serious criminal offences of a similar nature, he could not have reasonably determined that a sentence with a total minimum period of custody of 4 years and 6 months could properly reflect the purposes of punishment that must be evident in the non-parole period. In my opinion the sentences imposed do not give effect to what the Judge said at the outset of his sentencing remarks about the seriousness of the offending, its prevalence and the need for both general and specific deterrence. 
     
      
    42 The respondent points out that there is a disconformity between the sentencing remarks, on the one hand, and matters referred to by the Judge in discussion with counsel, on the other, in so far as some matters that his Honour indicated he would view as aggravating factors during the Crown’s address were not referred to during the sentencing remarks. So in answer to the criticism made by the Crown that the judge failed to take into account a number of aggravating factors, the respondent relies upon comments made by his Honour indicating an acceptance of those matters as aggravating the seriousness of the offences during addresses. 
     
      
    43 This Court has shown a reluctance to take into account remarks made by a judge during counsel’s submissions as being incorporated by implication into the sentencing remarks. Yet the respondent asks the Court to do so in this case and, thereby, in effect, excuse the failure by the Judge to refer to matters that were of some significance in his evaluation of the seriousness of the offences and the relevance of the respondent’s subjective circumstances during the course of his remarks. 
     
      
    44 With respect to his Honour it is unfortunate that he felt some time constraint to resolve the determination of the sentence and its imposition upon the respondent by reason of the time of day and the pending list the next day. Sentencing can be complicated in this State particularly in light of the introduction of provisions such as s 21A and the standard non-parole period. Very experienced judges can fall into the traps that Parliament has unconsciously set for sentencing courts in the relevant legislation. 
     
      
    45 This matter was complex. There were two separate but related serious offences and in respect of each there was a standard non-parole period. In determining the objective seriousness of each offence there were a number of aggravating features to be considered and their significance assessed. Yet his Honour had to be careful not to double count matters of aggravation appearing in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 with the elements of the offences. The Judge clearly fell into error in double counting the wounding by finding it as an aggravating feature of the home invasion offence. 
     
      
    46 The Judge entered into a dialogue with both counsel. This is not meant as a criticism, but there was a degree of fluctuation in the sentencing judge’s stated position during the addresses. Nor were the addresses conducted in a formal, ordered manner: the Judge called on one side to answer a particular submission from the other side or to supply information. Again this is not to be taken as any criticism. However, in those circumstances and without his Honour having the assistance of a transcript, I am not persuaded that the absence of a reference by his Honour to matters of significance in his sentencing remarks can be overlooked simply because he may have indicated during addresses that he intended to take them into account. 
     
      
    47 The Judge determined the sentences “on the run” in that he formed a view about them during addresses and raised his intentions with counsel. Once more this is not to be taken as a general criticism of his Honour or the manner in which he approached his task. That is no doubt an appropriate course to take in a simple case where there are few matters to be taken into account and weighed against one another in the synthesis that results from a balancing of factors pointing in different directions. But that was not this case. In my opinion, and with due respect to the sentencing judge, this was a matter warranting a degree of deliberation in which due regard was paid to the submissions that had been made to him and the application of the various principles that operated. Such deliberation is not apparent from the transcript. 
     
      
    48 As is so often the case in sentencing remarks coming before this Court by way of a Crown appeal, there was a failure to give adequate reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. This was particularly so in this matter because the Judge found that each offence was within the mid range of seriousness. The simple fact that the respondent pleaded guilty was not a sufficient reason for the degree of departure from the standard non-parole period that there was in this case. 
     
      
    49 Here there were two offences each carrying a standard non-parole period of 7 years. Although they were connected offences in that they arose from the same events, they were very separate and distinct criminal acts and each warranted a significant sentence. The total criminality arising from these events was high. Even if it is accepted that it was open to the Judge to find that they were both, independently considered, within the mid range of objective seriousness, a combined head sentence of 8 years was in my opinion an unreasonable reflection of the totality of the serious criminality involved in them, as was a combined minimum term of imprisonment of 4½ years. His Honour’s discretion must have miscarried. 
     
      
    50 In any event, in my opinion, the failure by the Judge to refer in his sentencing remarks to the fact that the respondent was on bail and parole and the effect of that fact upon various aspects of the sentencing of the respondent reveals a failure to take into account a highly relevant fact that resulted in an error in the exercise of his discretion. 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The home invasion offence 
        
       
      
    51 The Crown contends that his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the home invasion offence. The Judge held it was in the mid range of seriousness. He indicated no more than that. In particular the Crown is critical that this assessment was based upon the Judge positively disregarding the fact that the weapon was discharged. 
     
      
    52 There were a number of aggravating factors present in this offence. The respondent conceded that the Judge was in error in rejecting those matters referred to in s 105A of the Crimes Act on the basis that the Crown had not alleged them in the indictment. It was unnecessary for the Crown to allege more than one aggravating factor: R v Li (NSWCCA, unreported, 9 July 1997). These factors were: that the respondent was armed with a knife; he was in company; corporal violence was used on the man Ryan; and the respondent knew that there were persons in the premises. Although the Judge indicated during the sentencing submissions that some of these matters would be taken into account under s 21A, they had a particular significance in this offence because each of them is a circumstance of aggravation that would have made the respondent liable to a more serious offence than a simple break and enter offence. 
     
      
    53 The Judge accepted that the respondent did not know the weapon was loaded. However, he was aware of the weapon before the home invasion and there was nothing to suggest that he did not believe it to be a real weapon capable of being fired. The plea to the offence accepted that to be so. In my opinion that fact was enough to make the respondent liable to the aggravating fact that the firearm was loaded and discharged during the course of the robbery. It was not the case that the respondent had made enquiry and had been told that it was not loaded. It was not as if the respondent was being found liable for another offence, such as would have been the case had some person been killed by the discharge of the weapon. In that case the prosecution would have to prove that the respondent contemplated the possibility that the weapon might be discharged. But that contemplation did not have to be found simply to prove a matter of aggravation that was not an element of the offence. 
     
      
    54 In any event the objective seriousness of the offence was not mitigated by the fact that the offender did not know that the gun was loaded. This is another instance of a judge taking into account as a mitigating factor that the offence was not aggravated. Had the respondent known that the weapon was loaded it would have been an offence well above the mid range of seriousness. The absence of that knowledge did not reduce the offence to mid range.55 In my opinion, if the offence was only in the mid range, which I doubt, it was at the very upper end of that range of objective seriousness. Under s 21A(2) there were further aggravating factors in that the respondent had a record of previous convictions for a similar type, the offence involved multiple victims, and the respondent was on conditional liberty. There was little by way of mitigation apart from the plea of guilty and what prospects of rehabilitation there was in light of the fact that he had previously been given the chance of rehabilitation without success. He had youth but that was of little mitigation in light of his criminal history and the nature of the offence. 
     
      
    56 In my opinion the least sentence that could have been imposed for that offence should have been 12 years less the discount of 20 per cent. There should have been a sentence of at least 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
       
        
        (b) The wounding offence 
        
       
      
    57 The Judge held that the wounding offence was within the mid range of objective seriousness. In coming to that view he found as a fact that the respondent was acting in self-defence and that the wounding was “essentially unplanned, as opposed to there being a positive contemplation that the knife might be used if necessary”. But of course the offender was armed with the knife when he entered the premises. He told police that he took it with him, “just if anything went wrong”: Q 117. He re-entered the premises, after hearing the shots fired, “to try and get [Douglas] out of there”: Q 99. 
     
      
    58 The charge to which the respondent pleaded guilty alleged that the respondent intended to inflict grievous bodily harm at the time of the wounding. The fact that the respondent wounded the victim with that intention in the circumstances that he re-entered the premises to assist his co-offender meant that there was little mitigation in the fact that he might have found himself in difficulties from his intended victims. A person arming himself with a weapon in order to commit a violent crime must inevitably contemplate that he might be required to use it in order to escape, including defending himself. This is especially so when he goes to the aid of a co-offender. All that could be said in the present case was that the respondent did not act with gratuitous cruelty in stabbing the victim for no apparent reason. The absence of that factor was not a matter of mitigation. The wounding was aggravated in that the victim was in his own home and one of the wounds was relatively serious. 
     
      
    59 Again, if that offence was mid range, it was in the upper area of that range. The only matter that reduced its objective seriousness was that the wounding was not in the worst category. There was little by way of mitigation except in the subjective matters and the plea of guilty. However, I am unpersuaded that the sentence standing alone was manifestly inadequate particularly having regard to the nature of the injuries. There was no evidence of continuing disability caused to the victim and, therefore, the nature and extent of the grievous bodily harm did not aggravate the offence. The respondent also had little record for offences of violence. 
     
      
       
        
        (c) The total sentence 
        
       
      
    60 I have already indicated my opinion that the total sentence imposed did not sufficiently reflect the total criminality involved in the two offences and that the overall non-parole period did not pay sufficient regard to denunciation and deterrence, both specific and general. Although the offences were connected in that they arose out of the one criminal enterprise, the wounding resulted in a significant increase in the criminality involved in the home invasion offence, notwithstanding the grave seriousness of that offence. Standing alone the sentence for the home invasion should have been at least 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The increase in the overall criminality as a result of the commission of the wounding offence was insufficiently reflected in an increase in the sentence for the home invasion offence by one year. Were this not a Crown appeal I would have increased the overall non-parole period as a result of the partial accumulation of the sentences for the two offences by at least 2 years. However it will be sufficient if there is an increase of 18 months by accumulation. 
     
      
    61 The backdating of the sentence to include part of the balance of parole to be served by the respondent was generous. It was not simply the commission of these offences that were breaches of the terms of his parole as he was also using prohibited drugs. However, the Crown has not complained about that matter and I would date the sentences from that chosen by the Judge. The Judge found that there were special circumstances and the Crown did not suggest that finding was erroneous. 
     
      
    62 In my opinion the Crown appeal should be allowed. There are no discretionary reasons for this Court to refuse to intervene in order to increase the sentence. The respondent should be sentenced to a total term of 10 years 6 months and an overall non-parole period of 6 years 6 months. 
     
      
    63 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The Crown appeal is allowed. 
         
         
        2. The sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed. 
         
         
        3. The respondent is sentenced on the offence of wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and a balance of term of 3 years 6 months to date from 15 April 2008. The non-parole period expires on 14 October 2011. 
         
         
        4. The respondent is sentenced on the offence of specially aggravated break and enter to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years to date from 15 October 2009. The non-parole period expires on 14 October 2014 the date upon which the respondent is eligible to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The Crown has instituted appeals asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentences imposed on 11 February 2009 by Phegan A/DCJ at Gosford District Court upon each of the three respondents, Cameron Lindsay Dixon, Adel Benjamin Pearce and Jamal Pearce. To avoid confusion concerning the two lastmentioned I will, without intending any disrespect, refer to them by their respective forenames. With the exception of one separate charge against Adel, the charges sought to fix individual culpability on all of the offenders as participants in an affray but a joint liability of Adel and Dixon for an offence committed by Jamal as principal. The proceedings at first instance and on appeal were heard together, but, of course, different factors are pertinent to the individual respondents. Each respondent pleaded guilty to the charges against him. 
     
      
    2 The facts found by the judge were extracted from an agreed statement which had been tendered. I will not repeat all of the detail which was recapitulated in his Honour’s remarks on sentence but I will chronicle prominent actions of the respondents which gave rise to the charges. 
     
      
    3 At about 3 am on 15 September 2007 the respondents were at a nightclub (Mojo’s) in Baker Street, Gosford. A fight among patrons, not initiated by any of the respondents, broke out. Security guards intervened to restrain the combatants and others began to join in. The owner of the club (Lawrence Baker) was restraining a person as a result of which he became wedged against a wall and unable to defend himself. Adel attacked him, punching him in the face three times. Mr Baker’s face was bruised and cut. Eight sutures were required to repair cuts to his nose and under both eyes. Adel was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Dixon and Jamal were not participants and were not charged in respect of this assault. 
     
      
    4 The melee continued as the removal of the respondents and others from the premises was undertaken. However, Dixon ran back and punched one of the persons in a group which had gathered near an entry door. Adel did something similar. Next, Dixon punched a security guard, Russell Walker, on the side of the head. Each of the respondents asked his Honour to take into account on sentence pursuant to the Form 1 procedure, an offence of common assault upon Mr Walker.  
     
      
    5 Adel and Dixon, as well as security guards and patrons, moved into the street. The product of a CCTV camera is described as showing a person (not identified) appearing to wave an extendable baton in a threatening manner. Jamal had (temporarily) left the immediate area. Dixon and a guard, Darren Devine, shaped up to each other in a stance such as boxers adopt but they then dropped their arms. Dixon ran and struck him in the face with his fist. This was the subject of a second charge of common assault asked by all the respondents to be taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    6 Jamal had returned to where people were gathered outside the Club and Adel and Dixon joined him. Jamal then took some beer bottles from a bin and commenced smashing them on the road. He threw the remnants of one bottle striking a person in the upper chest area. Adel also equipped himself with bottles which he threw, and at least one of them struck a person somewhere in the neck and shoulder area. Dixon did not arm himself with bottles but picked up a large piece of corrugated iron. 
     
      
    7 Two men were on the ground, wrestling. The respondents ran towards them. Adel threw another bottle which struck a man, Luke Barker, in the face. Dixon swung the iron sheet at one of the persons on the ground but it did not make contact. Jamal stamped on one of the men who was down on the roadway and struck him with a bottle which he was holding. He then threw the bottle, striking Mr Barker on the head. Adel and Dixon became engaged in a struggle with another man at the conclusion of which Dixon dragged him along the road, kicked him and then walked away. 
     
      
    8 It was the bottle thrown by Jamal which caused the most serious injury. Mr Barker suffered an indentation compression fracture of the skull as well as a crack fracture through the full skull thickness, fracture of the right zygoma, comminuted fractures of the right maxillary sinus, two separate fractures of the right zygomatemporal arch and head and facial lacerations. A titanium plate was required to be inserted in his cheek and his right retina was torn. He has resultant vision difficulties which assessment suggested could be permanent. 
     
      
    9 Arising out of the attack upon and the injuries suffered by Mr Barker, all respondents were charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause that harm. The violence used upon him and other persons described in the above brief sketch of the facts was the basis of a charge of affray against each of the respondents. 
     
      
    10 The prescribed maximum penalties for the relevant offences are as follows: for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, imprisonment for 25 years in respect of which a standard non-parole period of 7 years is set; for affray, imprisonment for 10 years and for assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Adel only), imprisonment for 5 years.  
     
      
    11 His Honour imposed these sentences on the respondents (I will note now and not recite the taking into account of the two offences of assault on each Form 1):  
     
      
       
      CAMERON DIXON 
       
      (a) For maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent: to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 21 February 2009 and expiring on 20 February 2011 with a balance term of 1 year. 
       
       
      (b) For affray: to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 21 February 2009 and expiring on 20 February 2010. 
       
       
      (c) Both sentences to be served by way of periodic detention. 
       
       
      ADEL BENJAMIN PEARCE 
       
       
      (a) For assault occasioning actual bodily harm: to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 8 February 2009 and expiring on 7 February 2010. 
       
       
      (b) For maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent: to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 8 May 2009 and expiring on 7 May 2011 with a balance term of 3 years 3 months. 
       
       
      (c) For affray: to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 8 May 2009 and expiring on 7 May 2010.  
       
       
      The effective sentence received by Adel Pearce was therefore a total term or head sentence of 5 years 6 months with a minimum custody of 2 years 3 months before eligibility for consideration of parole. The non-parole period is the equivalent to about 41 percent of the total term. 
       
       
      JAMAL PEARCE 
       
       
      (a) For maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent: to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 11 February 2009 and expiring on 10 February 2011 with a balance term of 3 years 3 months. 
       
       
      (b) For affray: to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 11 February 2009 and expiring on 10 February 2010. 
       
       
      The effective sentence received by Jamal Pearce was thus the sentence imposed in respect of the firstmentioned offence. The non-parole period (with which the fixed term is wholly concurrent) is equivalent to about 38 percent of the total term. 
       
      
    12 It is observed that his Honour purported to order the release of Adel and Jamal to parole at the expiry of their respective non-parole periods. As their longer sentences exceeded three years, actual release will be a matter for the parole authority and the date of expiry of the non-parole periods should have been specified as the earliest date of eligibility for parole: see sections 48 and 50, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    13 In each appeal the sole ground expressed in the Director of Public Prosecution’s notice was that the sentences (as detailed) “are manifestly inadequate”. Expression in that form accords with a long established practice in appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act and the prompt lodgement of notice would reflect a recognition that there should be only the minimum delay necessary in informing an offender that an increase in sentence is sought. If it is intended to allege specific error by the sentencing judge it has been the practice to identify contentions in the written submissions required to be filed in support of the appeal. That practice would perceptibly avoid any surprise or prejudice to the respondent. Nevertheless, the recent statement in the joint judgment in Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13 should not be overlooked: 
     
      
       
        
        “The particular principle which the Director sought to invoke in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentence passed upon the present appellant was the last category of case identified in the well-known classification stated in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposed in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The Director’s allegation in his notice of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the sentence passed was ‘manifestly inadequate’, was an allegation of this kind of error. It was not an allegation that the primary judge had acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her, had mistaken the facts or had not taken into account some material considerations. If a case of specific error of any of those kinds was to be made it would have been necessary to identify the asserted error  
        in the grounds of appeal 
        .” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    14 When the matter was raised at the hearing the Crown Prosecutor did not seek to amend or add to the expressed ground and, as I understood her, relied upon the matters to which she pointed as reasons for concluding that there had been what has generally been referred to as latent error in distinction from specific error of the type exemplified in House. 
     
      
    15 The focus of the Crown argument was upon the offence of intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm which it will be convenient to call the “s 33 offence” by reference to the provision in the Crimes Act. The Crown Prosecutor expressly noted that no complaint was made about the sentences imposed for the s 33 offence and the sentences for affray being served concurrently with each other and, for present purposes it will suffice to focus upon the former. That is not to say, of course, that in overall assessment the commission of the offence of affray will be ignored. 
     
      
    16 I turn to the individual respondents. 
     
      
       
      CAMERON DIXON 
       
      
    17 As the above sketch of facts demonstrates, the participation by Dixon did not result in significant injury which had been personally inflicted by him on anyone. Neither of the common assaults perpetrated by him on Mr Walker and Mr Devine involved an allegation of causation of harm. As the lowest category “actual bodily harm” includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim which is more than transient or trivial: R v Donovan 1934 2 KB 498, it can be inferred that these common assaults were of a low level of consequence. 
     
      
    18 Neither did Dixon personally equip himself with a bottle and therefore he did not throw or strike anybody with one. The sentencing judge found, and noted that it had not been suggested otherwise, that when Dixon wielded the piece of corrugated iron it did not make actual contact. His behaviour however clearly showed his guilt of the offence of affray. 
     
      
    19 His liability for the s 33 offence was not as immediately obvious. The Court enquired of the Crown Prosecutor about the basis of Dixon’s liability for that offence. It had been referred to in written submissions as a joint criminal enterprise and in response to enquiry it was said to consist of an agreement to engage in a fight involving the use of weapons, as a result of which the victim, Luke Barker, sustained the injuries above described. Whilst Dixon was undoubtedly involved in the affray and pleaded guilty to that count, which charged that he used unlawful violence towards Luke Barker and other persons, there was no evidence (derived from the agreed facts or elsewhere) that Dixon’s own conduct towards Mr Barker was different from that which he directed towards other persons. 
     
      
    20 In the course of argument the Court also drew attention to the express contention relating to the s 33 offence in written submissions on behalf of Dixon, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “The plea of guilty encompasses no more than an admission that the respondent was part of a joint criminal enterprise to cause injury to certain people, and he foresaw the possibility that the other co-offenders would cause Luke Barker grievous bodily harm. That is significantly less objectively serious than having an intention to cause Luke Barker grievous bodily harm.” 
        
       
      
     21 It is important to stress that the Crown accepted this submission and, in answer to specific inquiry, confirmed that it did not contest that part of the submission including, in particular, the final sentence in the extract just quoted. 
     
      
    22 The critical damage to Mr Barker having been a consequence of the use of bottles as weapons with which aspect Dixon was not personally involved, an assessment that the Crown case against him under s 33 charge was of low cogency is compelling. In that circumstance, Dixon’s plea of guilty was of enhanced value and offered significant confirmation of the harbouring of remorse. 
     
      
    23 The evidence included a summary of what had been captured by CCTV located in the vicinity of the club. It recorded times of various events with considerable precision and the accuracy of that record was not disputed. The s 33 offence was constituted by a co-offender arming himself with a bottle as the initial event by which Dixon could have the requisite mental state in accordance with the unchallenged submission. It can be deduced from the record that Dixon was in that state for a total time of about twenty seconds after which the offence was complete. His role in the affray also ended about fifteen seconds after the completion of the s 33 offence. The submission that Dixon’s culpability should be viewed as being encompassed in an extremely short period should be upheld. 
     
      
    24 There were significant matters of mitigation available to Dixon. He was twenty three years of age when he offended. His only conviction in New South Wales was for driving on a road, never having held a licence, for which he was fined. He has a conviction before a Magistrate’s Court in Queensland for “fraud”. It appears that, in a retail store, he exchanged price tags so as to pay a lesser sum for an item than he should have. It is perhaps curious that if he had stolen the item, thereby attempting to pay nothing, his record probably would show a conviction for some form of petty larceny, whereas for seeking to pay less than he should have, the record is of a conviction for a somewhat more ominous sounding offence.  
     
      
    25 This comparatively minor record would offer little weight against an entitlement to leniency. This was the way in which the sentencing judge obviously treated it. 
     
      
    26 As either new or fresh evidence, the respondent sought to tender (annexed to an affidavit by his solicitor) a report by a psychologist, Professor Hayes, and a letter of reference from a Mr Steve Ella, a drug and alcohol service counsellor. The tender was opposed by the Crown and it was indicated that a ruling would be given when judgment was delivered. For the purpose of making such a ruling, I have looked at the documents.  
     
      
    27 Professor Hayes saw the respondent on 28 April 2009. The appeal was heard the following day. Professor Hayes took some history from the respondent and administered some tests. Although it was mentioned that the respondent was aware that the “current proceedings” were an appeal, Professor Hayes’ opinion was directed to her view of his fitness to be tried. That is an issue which I would consider to be psychiatrically rather than psychologically determined but it is not necessary to pursue this matter. What counsel is seeking to rely upon are results and opinions contained in a report concerning the respondent’s intellectual functioning. The sentencing judge, noting that Dixon did not give evidence and counsel’s assertion that he had difficulty expressing himself, found that from reading his personal history he accepted that explanation for the failure to give evidence. What seems to be sought to be derived from the report is a statistical IQ assessment which would add little if anything to his Honour’s acceptance of the respondent’s handicap and the reasons for it.  
     
      
    28 Mr Ella’s letter self evidently relates to post sentence occurrences but these too are compatible with his Honour’s findings concerning the prospects of Dixon’s rehabilitation. The affidavit also exhibits a letter from an employer and a confirmation of Dixon’s diligent attendance at periodic detention. 
     
      
    29 On the issue of tender I would uphold the Crown’s objection. I would confirm however that I accept his Honour’s findings concerning the respondent’s handicaps and the afflictions which they imply.  
     
      
    30 There was before his Honour material concerning problems that Dixon had had with drugs and alcohol and his efforts to overcome them. It is not necessary to expand upon these matters. 
     
      
    31 The essential issue for the Court is whether the sentence has been shown to be manifestly inadequate. A conclusion needs to be based upon the cumulation of matters referred to in the foregoing. In my opinion it has not been demonstrated that the sentence received by Dixon is manifestly inadequate and I would dismiss the Crown appeal in his case. 
     
      
    32 I have not overlooked the Crown submissions concerning specific error to some of which I will refer in dealing with other respondents. Even if demonstrable error would make appellate intervention on sentence available I would refrain from so doing for the reason just expressed, namely, that the ground of manifest inadequacy has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      ADEL BENJAMIN PEARCE 
       
      
    33 The subject offences were committed on 15 September 2007 and the sentencing proceedings in the District Court were heard on 9 and 11 February 2009, submissions being made on the lastmentioned date. Adel had a record of prior offending extending from 2003 to 2008. The record was lengthened by various call-ups for breaches of bonds originally granted and, on one occasion, for revocation of a periodic detention order. I will not set out the record in full, however in February 2006 Adel was convicted of stalking or intimidating with intent to cause harm and of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, for which he was respectively, placed on a bond and required to serve 200 hours community service. In January 2007 he was called up for breach of the latter and the community service order extended for six months. In April 2007 he was called up for breach of the former and fined $1,000. In October and December 2007 he was twice again called up for breaches of the community service order in respect of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence. On the last occasion he was, in lieu, imprisoned for three months which was to be served by periodic detention. In March 2008 this was revoked and a fixed term of one month six days imprisonment ordered to be served. In July 2007, among other offences, Adel was convicted of affray for which he was fined $700 and placed on a good behaviour bond for 18 months. In December 2008, called up for breach of the bond, he was given a suspended sentence of nine months imprisonment and at the same time received a further suspended sentence of 12 months for resisting an officer in the execution of his duty. 
     
      
    34 In the meantime, in March 2008 he was sentenced to three months imprisonment for attempting to bring a contraband item into a detention facility. An appeal against this sentence was dismissed in May 2008.  
     
      
    35 The existence of this record offers a considerable hurdle to a claim by Adel for leniency. 
     
      
    36 As already observed, although the eruption which became the affray had obviously started, it was the independent assault occasioning actual bodily harm by Adel which was the first offence in time by any of these respondents. The victim, Lawrence Baker, sustained bruising as well as cuts. As earlier mentioned, the cuts required treatment including eight sutures under his eyes and across the bridge of his nose. Although it was a bottle thrown by Jamal which caused the very serious damage sustained by Mr Barker, Adel also harmed himself with bottles and was seen to be throwing them. 
     
      
    37 In his remarks on sentence the judge referred first to subjective matters concerning Adel. He accepted a history set out in a psychological report which described an unfortunate upbringing and a descent into drug abuse. He noted the evidence of the respondent, his partner who was at the time pregnant with his child, and his (and Jamal’s) mother. His Honour found that with the exception of cannabis, Adel had succeeded in abandoning the use of drugs completely. However the respondent continued to use cannabis and his Honour thought that there seemed to be a degree of dependence on that drug remaining. 
     
      
    38 His Honour found that the s 33 offence could be classified as “mid-range” for that type of offence. That finding is accepted by the Crown but it is contended that his Honour erred in using the term of seven years, the standard non-parole period prescribed for that offence as a “starting point” for sentence assessment. There was a plea of guilty and it is of course accepted that the applicability of the standard non-parole period needs to be understood in the light of authority such as R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 but it was argued for Adel that, although his Honour selected seven years as the notional starting point for sentence, he did not do so because it was the standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    39 Following reference to Way, his Honour mentioned the standard non-parole period and stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It provides at the very least some sort of starting point for what is generally described as the ‘mid range’ offence of this kind”. 
        
       
      
    40 I would reject the contention that the term of seven years was coincidentally chosen and I would uphold the Crown submission that his Honour’s remarks must be understood as choosing that period because it was the standard non-parole period. In that regard, error has been demonstrated. His Honour’s following remarks confirm the nature of the error as he continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “That leads me then to address the question, where in the general range the actions of the co-offenders in this case fall”. 
        
       
      
    41 Confusion is evident in using as a guide a figure which relates to non-parole period when considering the appropriate term or head sentence for the offence. I do not overlook the allied submission by the Crown that his Honour also erred in using the same facts as found to justify departure from the standard non-parole period and then to divide the sentence into non-parole period and balance term in favour of the offender but, the error abovementioned having been demonstrated, it is not necessary further to elaborate. 
     
      
    42 As is common in all instances, the issue is whether in the whole of the circumstances the sentence has been shown to be manifestly inadequate. The circumstances in which the injuries were inflicted upon Mr Barker and their very severe consequences have been set out above. The sentence imposed reflects a gross underestimation of the objective seriousness of Adel’s offending and falls below the lower point of discretionary range. In my view, in the case of Adel, the ground is made out. On the question of resentence account should be given, however, not only to such favourable subjective findings concerning the respondent as were made by his Honour but to additional material contained in the respondent’s affidavit which demonstrates a commendable response to custody thus far. Nor was he challenged upon these statements in the affidavit, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “6. They do random urines here but I haven’t had one. I am drug free and plan to remain so for the rest of my life. I’m happy to keeping having random urine testing. 
        
       
       
        
        7. I think about the offence. I regret all of it. I’ve put my name down to go to the Restorative Justice Unit. I want to apologise to the victim. I feel so sorry for him. I just think of how I’d feel if I was in his shoes. I look at it as if it’s my past life. I come from a good hardworking family. I want my brother and sister to look up to me. I don’t feel like the person I was anymore. The drugs stop you from seeing these things. I care now.” 
        
       
      
    43 Where this Court proceeds to resentence after successful Crown appeal, it is well established that the notion of double jeopardy be recognized and an amelioration applied to the new imposition. Taking all factors into account, I would assess an overall total sentence for the s 33 offence of 6 years 3 months. Reapplying the structure which included accumulation of 3 months for the separate offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, there would be an effective overall sentence of 6 years 6 months. I would continue a finding of special circumstances and divide the sentence for the s 33 offence into a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance term of 3 years 3 months. In overall effect the proportion between minimum custody and total term will be 50 percent as distinguished from the present proportion of 41 percent. It follows that the minimum time in custody before eligibility for parole will increase from 2 years 3 months to 3 years 3 months. 
     
      
       
      JAMAL PEARCE 
       
      
    44 The learned sentencing judge dealt with subjective matters concerning Jamal to some extent by simply noting a similarity with the factors which affected Adel. Jamal’s prior record had nothing like the length of that of his brother. Of significance were convictions in March 2006 of two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a charge of stalking or intimidating, for which he received 200 hours community service, a suspended prison sentence (8 months with a non-parole period of 6 months) and a bond to be of good behaviour for 18 months.  
     
      
    45 Of further significance was his Honour’s finding that, like Adel, Jamal had succeeded in terminating his use of “hard drugs” but he continued to use cannabis and “seemed even more reluctant than his brother to stop using it altogether”. 
     
      
    46 As a matter of objective seriousness, it cannot be overlooked that it was the act of Jamal personally in throwing a bottle that caused the very serious injuries to the victim of the s 33 offence. 
     
      
    47 I will not repeat what has been said in relation to the other respondents but in my view, even more emphatically than in the case of Adel, the sentence received by Jamal for the s 33 offence was manifestly inadequate. Although Jamal was the primary offender, he was nevertheless the youngest of the three respondents, and, as above noted, his prior record was far better than that of his elder brother. 
     
      
    48 Taking all factors into account (including his evidence which the sentencing judge accepted) I would assess the sentence for the s 33 offence to replace that imposed in the District Court by a sentence of 6 years and 3 months, accepting and continuing a finding of special circumstances I would divide into a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance term of 3 years 3 months. 
     
      
    49 This is identical to the term for that offence received by Adel but, of course, Jamal has not cumulation for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in which he was not involved. It follows that the non-parole period overall to be received by Jamal would be about 48 percent of total term as distinct from the present proportion of about 38 percent. 
     
      
       
       
      THE ORDERS 
       
      
    50 In the cases of Adel and Jamal the result which I favour can be reached simply by resentence on the count for the s 33 offence. It may be taken that the offences on the Form 1 have been taken into account.  
     
      
    51 I propose the following:

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: The appellant stood trial before Solomon DCJ and a jury on three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. He was found guilty on all counts, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 This is an appeal against conviction, on the ground - 
     
      
       
        
        “The verdicts of guilty on each count ought to be set aside as there was a miscarriage of justice arising from: 
        
        
         
        (i) The conduct of the trial by the Trial Advocate relying upon alternate and inconsistent bases of criminal responsibility concerning absence of consent, mistaken consent and vitiation of consent and recklessness; 
         
         
        (ii) Directions given by his Honour concerning consent and vitiation of consent and knowledge; 
         
         
        (iii) The late election by the prosecution to rely on recklessness and Section 61R(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900; 
         
         
        (iv) Directions given by the Trial Judge concerning recklessness and Section 61R(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900; 
         
         
        (v) Directions given by the Trial Judge concerning vitiation of consent under Section 61R(2) of the Crimes Act, 1900; 
         
         
        (vi) Directions given by the trial judge concerning the defence of honest and reasonable mistake as to consent; 
         
         
        (vii) By the conduct of the prosecution in introducing opinion and hearsay evidence concerning the ability of the appellant to comprehend and express himself in the English language; 
         
         
        (viii) Tactical considerations in and consequences of the framing of the Crown case.” 
        
       
       
      Evidence in the Crown case  
       
      
    3 Evidence in the Crown case was given by the complainant, and by each of the men Robert, Alex and Igor next mentioned. Evidence was also given by a police officer who responded to the complaint and a police officer involved in its investigation, and by a doctor who examined the complainant. In what follows I focus on evidence particularly relevant to the ground of appeal. 
     
      
    4 The complainant lived in a studio apartment. She had a boyfriend, Robert. One afternoon they met by arrangement at a café. The complainant was introduced by a mutual friend of Robert, Igor, to the appellant and another man, Alex.  
     
      
    5 That evening the complainant and the four men met again at a café close to the apartment. Alcohol was consumed. The complainant and Robert left the café and went to the apartment, where they had consensual sexual intercourse. When they left the apartment to return to the café they found the three other men outside the apartment block. The three men were speaking in Russian, and appeared to have been arguing. The complainant was concerned that the neighbours would be disturbed, and suggested that they all return to the apartment. 
     
      
    6 They did so, at about 9.30 pm. The complainant and the appellant had some wine. The complainant gave evidence that about three times the appellant pulled her into the bathroom and shut the door, and said that he liked her and “I want a woman like you”. She said that each time she told him that she was not interested in him, but was interested in Robert and they were together. When the appellant spoke to the complainant, he spoke in English. 
     
      
    7 At about midnight the men were talking about going out, but the complainant wanted to go to bed because she had to work the next day. Robert, Alex and Igor all left. The appellant remained, and the complainant told him that he had to go. He said that he did not want to go.  
     
      
    8 Then Robert returned with a DVD, saying that he had changed his mind and asking if he could stay and watch it. The complainant agreed, and said that the appellant could also stay and watch it.  
     
      
    9 The apartment had no chairs, and they sat on the bed to watch the DVD. The complainant lay facing the wall with her back to Robert, who sat behind her. The appellant was on the end of the bed with some pillows behind him. The complainant fell asleep.  
     
      
    10 The complainant woke up with someone’s arms around her. She was still lying facing the wall. She assumed that it was Robert.  
     
      
    11 According to the complainant, she was still wearing her dress but her underpants had been pulled down. An arm around her moved down and a finger was put in her vagina. She pushed the person away and said, “No, I don’t feel like this”. The person tried again, and she said no again. This went on for about five minutes. The complainant said that she “froze” from shock, thinking that it was Robert and not understanding why he was doing what he was doing.  
     
      
    12 The person tried to put his penis into her vagina, from behind as she continued to lie facing the wall, with partial success. The complainant did not recall how long this went on, but it felt like about ten minutes. She said no loudly and sternly and the person said yes in a soft voice with a Russian accent, about five or six times. The complainant did not think the voice was of someone other than Robert. 
     
      
    13 The person stopped, and the complainant “dozed off for a couple of seconds”. She then became aware that the person had moved to the bottom of the bed and was performing oral sex, putting his tongue in her vagina. Again she went into shock, and she said it felt as if this went on for about five minutes.  
     
      
    14 The complainant tried to kick the person off, and at that point realised that it was not Robert, but the appellant. She pushed the appellant away and screamed at him to leave. At that point Robert came back into the apartment, having earlier left to meet someone, and the complainant told Robert that the appellant had sexually assaulted her. The appellant told Robert in English that nothing had happened. There were more exchanges, in Russian, between the two men.  
     
      
    15 The complainant called the police, and eventually the appellant left. The record of the OOO call included - 
     
      
       
        
        “[The complainant] I have this guy that was in my room fucking touching me, trying to rape me. This friend of my, my boyfiend, who I thought was my boyfriend, he was in my room, in my bed touching me. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] He will not leave my flat, because he says he’s left his shoes here. I don’t give a fuck I just want him gone. Just, he was fucking touching, trying to touch me, he was trying to have sex with me and he won’t leave. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] Get out, do you understand, the police are on their way. I thought it was my boyfriend was just forcing me, you know, and then I turned around and realised it wasn’t even him. 
        
       
       
        
        000 Operator Do you know who this guy is? Do you know him? 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] No. he’s a friend of my boyfriend. I just met him tonight. 
        
       
       
        
        000 Operator Has he forced you into sex? 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] No, but he was touching me. He was, he was going down on me and he was touching me. He was trying to have sex with me. 
        
       
       
        
        000 Operator OK. 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] He was trying to have sex with me and I kept saying no but he kept going.” 
        
       
      
    16 The police attended at the apartment. The complainant was taken to a hospital, and then the police station. The evidence of the attending police officer included that the complainant said that she “thought it was Robert until I turned around”. The notes of the examining doctor included - 
     
      
       
        
        “Lying in bed with the boyfriend. Another male person was also present. Went to sleep. Remembers next that someone had his arms around her, thought it was her boyfriend. Began to touch her about the vaginal area, there was an attempt at penile penetration and thought it was rough. At that stage did not want penile penetration even though she did not realise that it was not her boyfriend. Stated that she did not want penile penetration to the other person. Still tried to have penile penetration. She pushed him away, did not realise that it was not her boyfriend. Was persistent but she kept pushing him away. She wrapped the blankets around her. He then began to have oral sex with her. She was lying on her side while he licked her vagina with his tongue. She pushed him away and he tried penile penetration again, pushed him away again. Realised that it was not her boyfriend. Got up, pushed him out of bed, began yelling. Then her boyfriend entered the room.” 
        
       
      
    17 The evidence of the investigating police officer included evidence in relation to the appellant’s use of English. I will say more of this when dealing with para (vii) of the ground of appeal. 
     
      
    18 In cross-examination the complainant agreed that the appellant was shorter and stockier than Robert, and that at the time Robert was clean shaven and the appellant had some facial hair. Robert spoke fairly good English but with an accent that was between mild and strong. The appellant spoke English with a strong accent and when he spoke to his friends he spoke in Russian. In cross-examination of Robert it was elicited that at some time he had told the appellant that the complainant was not his girlfriend. I will later briefly refer to some further cross-examination of the complainant. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s evidence 
       
      
    19 Again I focus on evidence particularly relevant to the ground of appeal.  
     
      
    20 The appellant gave evidence through a Russian interpreter. He did not deny the sexual intercourse, although he said that the order was finger in vagina, oral sex and penis in vagina, all with the complainant lying facing the wall. In relation to each count he said that he believed that the complainant consented to what he did, and that he did not at any time think that she did not want him to do what he did.  
     
      
    21 The appellant said that when they were all at the apartment he and the complainant went once into the bathroom, because he asked her something and she showed him something but he could not recall what it was that she showed him. He said that while he was in the bathroom he paid the complainant a compliment, trying to say that she was a pleasant, nice looking girl and he wished he had a girl like her and saying in English “I want a woman like you”.  
     
      
    22 They were watching a DVD, lying on the bed, when someone rang Robert on his mobile phone and Robert left. The appellant moved closer to the complainant and lay on his side and embraced her. He began to caress her, moving his arm on her belly and her breast. He was sure that the complainant was not asleep, and she took his arm or hand and moved it to her leg, to near the hip area.  
     
      
    23 The appellant said that he put his hand into the complainant’s underpants and tried to insert his finger into her vagina. He was exciting the complainant, and her breathing became heavier. He removed the underpants, and the complainant moved herself up a little bit. He moved down the bed and began licking the complainant’s vagina and then inserted his penis from behind. He heard sounds, somebody came in and he stopped. The complainant pushed him away. At no time did the complainant ever say the words, “No, I don’t feel like it”, nor did she push him away or elbow him.  
     
      
    24 According to the appellant, he knew that the complainant was not Robert’s girlfriend because Robert had said so. If he had known that the complainant was Robert’s girlfriend, he would not have had sexual intercourse with her.  
     
      
    25 Again, I will later briefly refer to some cross-examination of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Legislation 
       
      
    26 Section 61I of the Crimes Act provides - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Sexual assault 
         
         
        Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.” 
         
        
       
      
    27 At the time particular provision was made as to absence of consent by s 61R, since repealed. Similar provision is now made by s 61HA of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    28 Section 61R relevantly provided - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        61R Consent 
         
         
        (1) For the purposes of sections 61I, 61J and 61JA, a person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse is to be taken to know that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse. 
         
         
        (2) For the purposes of sections 61I, 61J and 61JA and without limiting the grounds on which it may be established that consent to sexual intercourse is vitiated:  
         
         
          
          (a) person who consents to sexual intercourse with another person:  
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person, or 
             
             
            (ii) under a mistaken belief that the other person is married to the person, 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            is to be taken not to consent to the sexual intercourse, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (a1) … 
           
           
          (b) a person who knows that another person consents to sexual intercourse under a mistaken belief referred to in paragraph (a) or (a1) is to be taken to know that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, and 
           
           
          (c) … 
           
           
          (d) a person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not, by reason only of that fact, to be regarded as consenting to the sexual intercourse.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 A short analysis at this point will be of assistance in considering the ground of appeal. 
     
      
    30 Under s 61I it was for the Crown to prove two matters in relation to consent: that the complainant did not consent, and that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent. 
     
      
    31 It would be proved that the complainant did not consent - 
     
      
       
      (i) if the complainant in fact did not consent; or 
       
       
      (ii) through the pathway of “taken not to consent” in s 61R(2)(a), if the complainant consented under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person. 
       
      
    32 That the complainant did not consent was in part an artificial construct, encompassing consent under a mistaken belief by virtue of “a deeming provision which extends what might be the limited denotation of the phrase ‘does not consent’ in s 61I”: Banditt v The Queen [2005] HC 80; (2005) 224 CLR 262 at [31] per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ. Proof that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent then depended on the basis on which absence of consent was proved.  
     
      
    33 If the complainant in fact did not consent, it would be proved that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent - 
     
      
       
      (i) if the appellant knew that the complainant in fact did not consent; or 
       
       
      (ii) through the pathway of “taken to know” in s 61R(1), if the appellant was reckless as to whether the complainant consented. 
       
      
    34 If the complainant consented under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person, it would be proved that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent, through the pathway of “taken to know” in s 61R(2)(b), if he knew that the complainant consented under a mistaken belief. 
     
      
       
      The Charges 
       
      
    35 The three counts of sexual intercourse without consent were based on the digital penetration, the penile penetration and the oral sex respectively.  
     
      
    36 Each of the counts in the indictment was in the same terms, namely, that the appellant - 
     
      
       
        
        “On 4 November 2007 at Bondi in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without the consent of [the complainant], knowing she was not consenting.” 
        
       
      
    37 The appellant’s legal advisers requested particulars. The particulars provided were - 
     
      
       
        
        “Count 1: it is alleged the accused did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] at the place referred to in the indictment by putting his finger in her vagina. [See paragraph 19 page 3- statement of [the complainant] dated 4 November 2007] – the Crown relies on non consent by [the complainant] in two ways (A) under s 61R(2)(a) under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the person (B) [the complainant] pushing the accused away and saying “No I don’t feel like it” and using her elbow to push the [accused] away. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: it is alleged the accused did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] at the place referred to in the indictment by putting his penis in her vagina [See paragraph 20 page 4 – statement of [the complainant] dated 4 November 2007] – the Crown relies on non consent by [the complainant] in two ways (A) under s 61R(2)(a) under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the person (B) [the complainant] pushing the accused away and saying “No” in a loud voice. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: it is alleged the accused did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] at the place referred to in the indictment by licking her vagina [See paragraph 21 page 4 – statement of [the complainant] dated 4 November 2007] – the Crown relies on non consent by [the complainant] in two ways (A) under s 61R(2)(a) under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the person (B) [the complainant] pushing the accused away.” 
        
       
      
    38 These particulars were concerned with absence of consent. They proposed, in reverse order to the analysis above, that the complainant consented under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person, and that the complainant in fact did not consent. At the trial and on appeal these were sometimes referred to as the first scenario and the second scenario, and I will adopt that convenient shorthand.  
     
      
    39 The particulars said nothing about the Crown’s case in relation to the appellant’s knowledge that the complainant did not consent. 
     
      
       
      The ground of appeal – other than paras (vii) and (viii) 
       
      
    40 The paragraphs for present consideration were a mixture of the conduct of the trial and the trial judge’s directions. The appellant dealt with them together “as they are linked by consent, and knowledge and the provisions of Sections 61R(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act 1900”.  
     
      
    41 It is necessary to say something of the course of the trial and identify the directions of which the appellant complained, with particular reference to the two matters of absence of consent and the appellant’s knowledge that the complainant did not consent. A significant issue on appeal was how recklessness was dealt with as the basis for knowledge that the complainant in fact did not consent, and I will emphasise some references to recklessness. 
     
      
    42 The Trial Advocate opened in relation to these matters - 
     
      
       
        
        “So in relation to the next element of the Crown has to prove – without the consent of [the complainant]. The Crown will prove that by calling her, giving evidence about what happened on that night. A further element the Crown has to prove is the accused either knew  
        or was reckless as to lack of consent 
        . The Crown will say it would have been perfectly evident of what happened on this night, that she was not consenting and the accused would have known that. So in relation to consent I will just say this at this stage, that also at the time had certain definitions under the New South Wales Crimes Act. I will say this at this stage, a person who consents to sexual intercourse with another under the mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person is to be taken not to consent to sexual intercourse. As I said, she believed that what was going on was her boyfriend. And also just in relation to consent, a person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not by reason only of that fact to be regarded as consenting to sexual intercourse. As you have heard from what I said, and I expect to hear from [the complainant], she will tell you exactly who she believed it was and what happened. Despite even that, she was still saying no, and he was saying yes and he still went through with it.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    43 Perhaps this could have been better expressed. It sufficiently indicated a Crown case of absence of consent because the complainant consented under the mistaken belief that the other person was Robert, but also a case that in fact she did not consent because she was saying no. It clearly enough foreshadowed a Crown case which included that the appellant was reckless as to lack of consent. Counsel for the appellant did not voice any complaint about the opening. 
     
      
    44 Counsel for the appellant also opened. After saying that there was no issue about the sexual intercourse because the appellant agreed that it took place, he relevantly said - 
     
      
       
        
        “What is in issue are the two elements that the Crown just referred to you [sic] – the element of consent, [the complainant’s] consent, as well Mr Bochkov knowing that [the complainant] did not consent. And the defence case is this. The Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that [the complainant] did not consent to sexual intercourse, and the defence case is that she did consent to sexual intercourse, and her consent was apparent from the actions that took place during the time of the sexual intercourse. The Crown has raised this issue of mistake, and the defence case is that [the complainant] did know who she was having sexual intercourse with. There was no mistaken belief on her behalf as to whom she was having sexual intercourse with, and that’s the second element of these offences. The third element, which is also in issue, is whether the Crown can prove beyond reasonable doubt that Vladimir Bochkov did not know that [the complainant] was consenting, and the defence case is by the actions that [the complainant] took part in it was clear to Vladimir Bochkov that she was consenting to the sexual intercourse. The defence case in this matter is that [the complainant] consented to sexual intercourse. After it had happened she regretted what took place and that is where the complaint came from. So that gives you some outline of what the issues are in this case.” 
        
       
      
    45 On the defence case, then, it was contended that the complainant was not under a mistaken belief and that she consented, and that her conduct was such as to indicate to the appellant that she in fact consented. As to the appellant’s knowledge that the complainant did not consent, the defence opening was apt to take issue with all of the three bases of knowledge that she did not in fact consent, recklessness as to lack of consent, and knowledge that she consented under a mistaken belief. 
     
      
    46 Consistently with the defence opening, it was put to the complainant in cross-examination that at the time she understood that the only person who could have been present was the appellant, with which she disagreed. She disagreed also that she assisted the person by the movements of her body. It was put that she knew that it was the appellant, again meeting disagreement.  
     
      
    47 The cross-examination of the appellant included putting that he wanted to have sex with the complainant, and that he was pretending to be Robert and wanted her to believe that he was Robert. It was put that he did not ask the complainant if she wanted to have sex, and he replied that he “never asked her about anything” and that “it was clear from the very beginning. If a girl does not offer any resistance as I was caressing her and cuddling her, it is all clear”. The appellant agreed that at no time did he “say it was you”. This cross-examination was material to the appellant’s knowledge that the complainant was under the mistaken belief that he was Robert, but also to recklessness as to lack of consent. 
     
      
    48 After the evidence concluded the trial judge held a discussion with the legal representatives. The effect of the discussion was as follows. His Honour obtained agreement that s 61R(2) of the Crimes Act, which by that time had been repealed, was in effect on the date of the offences charged against the appellant. Referring to a direction in the Bench Book prepared by the Judicial Commission, the direction concerning s 61R(2)(b) knowledge, he elicited that the Trial Advocate would be putting to the jury that there were “two scenarios”. One was consent under a mistaken belief (s 61R(2)(a)), as to which the Trial Advocate said he would be putting to the jury that a person who knew that consent was under a mistaken belief was taken to know that there was not consent (s 61R(2)(b)). The second was that, if the jury was not satisfied that the complainant was under a mistaken belief, the jury could still convict on the basis of evidence on which they could find that she did not consent and the appellant must have known that she did not consent. Counsel for the appellant agreed that there were the two scenarios.  
     
      
    49 As the transcript reads the discussion was rather elliptical, and so I have described its effect. In relation to the second scenario and knowledge that the complainant did not consent, it was in terms that the appellant “must have known”, not that he was reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting or not. The trial judge did, however, refer in relation to the second scenario to “the usual directions in relation to sexual intercourse”, which could include knowledge through recklessness. 
     
      
    50 The judge asked that “the matters of law” be “run past” him before they were put to the jury. There was a short adjournment. Upon resumption, and it seems so that matters of law could be run past him, the trial judge asked the Trial Advocate what he was going to say.  
     
      
    51 The effect of the explanation, which included adoption of a number of contributions from his Honour, was that the Trial Advocate would submit to the jury that the appellant could be found guilty in two separate ways. The first was that the complainant was acting under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person, believing it was Robert, and that that was taken to be absence of consent, and that a person knowing that consent was under a mistaken belief was taken to know that there was no consent. The other was - 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: … there is another scenario and that is the words and actions of the complainant in relation to each of the three counts. And as to knowledge, his knowledge which flows from the words and actions of the …  
        
       
       
        
        TRIAL ADVOCATE: I’ll say directly in the first two counts she said ‘no’, and the last count he would have known because she said no in relation to the first two counts”. 
        
       
      
    52 Recklessness as a means of proof of knowledge of absence of consent was not specifically mentioned, and “would have known” in the Trial Advocate’s response suggests actual knowledge. However, this also was elliptical.  
     
      
    53 Counsel for the appellant said that he had no objection to “that approach”, provided that it was for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was mistaken as to identity and it was not for the appellant “to identify himself in relation to s 61R in relation to mistaken identity”.  
     
      
    54 In his address to the jury the Trial Advocate said, in relation to absence of consent and knowledge of absence of consent - 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the issue of consent, the Crown also has to prove, apart from the fact that the accused had sexual intercourse with [the complainant], it was without the consent of [the complainant]. The Crown relies on two ways the Crown says you can find the accused guilty. The first one is that the consent she gave, and I will just take you to something his Honour will raise with you later, a person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and  
        was reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse is taken to know that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse 
        . A person who consents to have sexual intercourse with another person under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person is to be taken to not to consent to the sexual intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        So in relation to that, if you accept that on this occasion [the complainant] believed it was Robert and went along with it under the mistaken belief that it was him and she in fact did give consent that is taken not to be consent because she believed it was Robert. And a person who knows that another consents to sexual intercourse under a mistaken belief is to be taken to know that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse. So when I take you to how the Crown says that was proved, which I will do shortly, in relation to what [the complainant] says you will accept beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did know that she was not consenting. So that’s the first way the Crown says that you can find the accused guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        The second one is relying once again on the first element, sexual intercourse, no issue there the Crown says, without the consent of [the complainant]. The Crown says if you rely on what [the complainant] says – and I will take you to this in more detail, but she said no on more than one occasion, she said no after he put his finger in her vagina. She said no after he put his penis into her vagina and a t that stage she ways he said, ‘yes, yes, yes’, when she said ‘no, no, no’, so that, the Crown says, is without the consent of [the complainant], and the accused would have known that because she said that to him. She said she said it in a loud voice. He said he didn’t hear it. 
        
       
       
        
        The next element the Crown has to prove the accused either knew  
        or was reckless to lack of consent 
        . Once again the Crown says, relying on count 1 and 2, she said no. Count 3, because she had already said no, then the accused licked her vagina. So he would have known that she wasn’t consenting to count 3 on the indictment.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    55 In the first of these paragraphs the Trial Advocate used the words of s 61R(1) in the third sentence, with a minor change. He gave the effect of s 61R(2)(b), largely using its words, in the fourth sentence. As will be seen, it was later said that he was reading from s s 61R. It is rather odd that, in the part of the address apparently intended to put to the jury absence of consent under the first scenario, there was reference to knowledge of the accused through recklessness as to consent, but recklessness was plainly flagged.  
     
      
    56 Recklessness was again referred to in the fourth paragraph, appropriately in relation to the appellant’s knowledge of absence of consent. It was not clearly related to the second scenario, but when taken together with the prior reference to recklessness the Trial Advocate was maintaining a case of recklessness in the face of the complainant saying no, as well as actual knowledge through the complainant saying no. 
     
      
    57 Later in his address the Trial Advocate said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Just getting back to whether the accused would have known she wasn’t consenting in relation to count 2, as I said in relation to count 1 she had already said no. She was facing away from him, she said she said no. Count 2, she said no in a loud voice. The accused, she said, she recognised it was a Russian voice because it was fairly low saying, “Yes, yes, yes”, and [the complainant] said, “No, no, no”, and the accused, as we know, did put his fingers into her vagina. We know then from [the complainant] that shortly after that she dozed off and then she felt someone licking her vagina and once again there is no dispute that the accused admits he did do that. the Crown says bearing in mind what she said earlier the accused would have known she wasn’t consenting because she had said no in relation to count 2, no in relation to count 1.”  
        
       
      
    58 Counsel for the appellant took no objection to the Trial Advocate’s address.  
     
      
    59 In his own address to the jury, counsel for the appellant described the defence case as - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … that [the complainant] knew who she was having sexual intercourse with – that was with Vladimir Bochkov. There was no mistake by [the complainant] as to who she was having sexual intercourse with, and there could have been no mistake in relation to who she was having sexual intercourse with. [The complainant] consented to the sexual intercourse, and she indicated her consent by her actions at the time of the sexual intercourse, and it was after Robert Seleznev arrived that [the complainant] changed her mind and then took a number of further steps.” 
        
       
      
    60 Counsel identified as the elements to be proved by the Crown, beyond reasonable doubt, that the sexual intercourse took place without the consent of the complainant and that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent. As to absence of consent, counsel said that the Crown relied on two alternative means to prove lack of consent. The first was that the complainant must have been under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person, thinking it was Robert whereas it was the appellant. The second was that her actions indicated that there was no consent. He addressed on the facts as to each of these, to the effect that they had not been made out. He turned to whether the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting. He addressed on the facts, to the effect of inviting the jury to find that the complainant did not say no or that she did not wish to have intercourse and that her actions were actions which indicated to the appellant that she wished the sexual contact to continue. He submitted to the jury that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting. He further addressed on the facts, at some length, and invited the jury to “have real concern about the evidence of” the complainant. 
     
      
    61 At a break during his address counsel for the appellant provided to the trial judge directions he wished to be given, to all but one of which the Trial Advocate agreed. The materials before us did not disclose what they were. It was not suggested that they were material to the ground of appeal. 
     
      
    62 After the addresses concluded his Honour told the legal representatives some of the directions he proposed to give, it appears in large part reading from a written draft. They included the directions in fact given to which I later refer. Neither the Trial Advocate not counsel for the appellant sought to raise anything.  
     
      
    63 The summing-up was quite lengthy; as I have indicated, it relevantly followed the foreshadowed directions. 
     
      
    64 As to absence of consent, the trial judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown in respect of each count relies on two alternative positions regarding consent. I will now deal with the first position of the Crown. The first is that you find beyond reasonable doubt, one, that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse with the accused; two, under the mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused, that is, she believed the accused to be Robert Seleznev. In respect of each the Crown asks you to draw the inference – and I refer you back to my direction about inference – of mistaken identity of Robert Seleznev on the following evidence, one, that Robert Seleznev was the complainant’s boyfriend with whom she had sex that night. 2, the evidence that the complainant fell asleep in her bed and when she fell asleep she was next to Robert Seleznev who was watching television and that when Robert Seleznev left the bed the sexual activity by the accused began. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused on the other hand submits that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse with him under the mistaken belief as to his identity. In this regard the accused submits that the complainant consented to the sexual activity. Further, the accused first says that you cannot draw the inference that the Crown asks you to draw from the evidence, and further, the accused relies on the evidence as to the difference as to the size, built, accent and facial [sic] between himself and Robert Seleznev. The accused submits that the complainant did not have a mistaken belief. 
        
       
       
        
        I direct you that if you make the finding in respect of any count that the complainant consented to sexual intercourse with the accused under the mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused, that is, that she believed him to be Robert Seleznev, that in respect of that count, in law, the complainant is taken not to have consented to the sexual intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        The second and alternative position of the Crown, regarding the complainant not consenting to the sexual intercourse is this; in respect of count 1, the Crown asks you to infer from the following evidence that the complainant did not consent. One that the complainant when she felt a finger in her vagina pushed the finger aside and said “No, I don’t feel like this”. The activity continued and the complainant froze. In respect of count 2, the Crown asks you to draw from the following evidence that the complainant did not consent, that the complainant when she felt the person’s penis in the opening of her vagina, said “No”, about five or six times, and then she froze. In respect of count three the Crown asks you to draw the inference from the following evidence that the complainant did not consent, one, that the complainant went into shock when she felt a person put his tongue in her vagina, and then after what felt like five minutes she tried to kick that person off her. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused denies in respect of the first count that the complainant pushed his finger away. The accused denies as to the second count that the complainant said “no”. The accused denies in respect of the third count that the complainant tried to kick him off her. 
        
       
       
        
        Now the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt in respect of each count that the complainant did not consent. If the Crown has failed to do so in respect of any count, then the accused is to be found not guilty of the charge contained in that count.” 
        
       
      
    65 The trial judge then turned to “the third element which is that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting”. His Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the Crown in respect of each count relies on two alternative positions regarding the accused’s knowledge. The first position of the Crown applies to any count in which you have found, beyond reasonable doubt, that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse because of a mistaken belief that she was having sexual intercourse with Robert Seleznev. Here the Crown relies on the law that if the accused knew that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused, then the accused is taken in law to know that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse. If that be the case, then the accused would be found guilty of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of this element, the Crown asks you to draw the inference, and I remind you of the direction I gave you regarding inferences, that the accused knew the complainant consented to sexual intercourse because of her mistaken belief as to his identity from the following evidence: 1. that the accused saw the complainant and Robert Seleznev together as a couple during the evening of 3 and 4 November 2007. 2. that the accused saw the complainant lay on the bed in the apartment next to Robert Seleznev and saw Robert Seleznev hug the complainant. 3. the complainant was asleep and remained asleep when Robert Seleznev left the apartment in the early hours of 4 November 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused on the other hand submits that he did not know that the complainant had sexual intercourse with him because of a mistaken belief that it was Robert Seleznev having sexual intercourse with her. In this regard the accused firstly says that you cannot draw the inferences the Crown asks you to draw from the evidence, and secondly, the accused relies on the evidence of the differences as to size, build, accent and facial hair between himself and Robert Seleznev, and submits that the complainant knew she was having sexual intercourse with him, and not Robert Seleznev. Further, the accused submits that Robert Seleznev was not the boyfriend of the complainant when he had sex with her. 
        
       
       
        
        The second position of the Crown applies to any count in which you find that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse, having regard to her words and actions expressed to the accused. The Crown must prove the accused knew that the complainant did not consent. The test is a subjective test and not an objective test. You might ask yourself how, in the absence of an admission by the accused, the Crown can prove that the accused was aware that the complainant did not consent. I remind you of my directions regarding inferences, the Crown asks you to infer from other facts, which it sets out to prove that the accused must have known and that he did know that the complainant did not consent. In respect of count 1, the Crown relies on the following evidence for you to draw the inference that the accused knew that the complainant did not consent; one, evidence that the complainant pushed the finger which was inside her vagina aside and said “No I don’t feel like this”. The accused denies that the complainant said these words. 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of count 2, the Crown relies on the following evidence for you to draw the inference that the accused knew tht the complainant did not consent. The evidence that when the complainant felt the person’s penis at the opening of her vagina, the complainant said to the person five or six times, “No”. the accused denies that the complainant said those words. 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of count 3, the Crown relies on the following evidence for you to draw the inference that the accused knew that the complainant did not consent. The evidence that when the complainant felt a person putting his tongue in her vagina, she froze, and later tried to kick him off her. Further, in respect of this count, the Crown relies on the complainant’s earlier words uttered, when digital and penile penetration occurred. The accused denies that the complainant tried to kick him off her. Further, the accused denies that the complainant used the words she said she used at the time of the digital and penile penetration of her. 
        
       
       
        
        Now in a situation where the complainant does not in fact consent the accused’s state of mind at the time of the act of intercourse might be, yes, he knew that the complainant was not consenting, and that is a guilty state of mind. If the Crown has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that this was the accused’s state of mind at the time of the acts of intercourse in respect of the counts then the third element of the charge has been made out. 
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand, the accused’s state of mind might be that he honestly though wrongly, believed that the complainant was consenting to the intercourse, this is not a guilty state of mind. It is for the Crown to prove that at the time of intercourse the accused did not honestly believe that the complainant was consenting then you would have to say the third element is not made out and return a verdict of not guilty of that particular charge.”  
        
       
      
    66 The summing-up raised for consideration in relation to the second scenario “that the accused must have known and that he did know that the complainant did not consent”. There was no reference to recklessness. However, it will be noted that in the last of these paragraphs the trial judge gave the usual direction that if the appellant honestly but wrongly believed that she consented, the element of knowledge that she did not consent was not made out. I will refer to this later in these reasons. 
     
      
    67 The trial judge summed up at some length in relation to the facts, and summarised the submissions of the legal representatives. In doing so he described the Crown case as that the appellant “knew the complainant was not consenting 1. because he knew the complainant was having sexual intercourse with him because of the mistaken belief and 2. that he knew that she was not consenting by virtue of her words and actions”. In summarising the submissions of counsel for the appellant he attributed to counsel that the complainant knew she was having sexual intercourse with the appellant because of her actions but changed her mind when Robert arrived, and as to mistaken identity that for reasons counsel gave the complainant would have known that it was not Robert having sexual intercourse with her. In that summary he also attributed to counsel that “as to the Crown’s alternative position, that the complainant indicated her lack of consent to the accused”, the complainant’s actions indicated that she wished to have sexual intercourse and the appellant’s evidence that he did not hear the word “no” should be accepted. 
     
      
    68 When asked, at the conclusion of the summing-up, neither the Trial Advocate nor counsel for the appellant raised any matters.  
     
      
    69 The jury retired. Thereafter a note was received from the jury in the terms - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Please can we have the transcript of your summary with particular focus on each of the elements the Crown needs to prove. 
         
         
        2. The Crown mentioned ‘Reckless lack of consent”. Can you please clarify if this is law and if so clarify in more detail. 
         
         
        3. Can we please have these responses in written format.” 
        
       
      
    70 There was discussion between the trial judge and the legal representatives. Only the discussion concerning “reckless lack of consent” need be described.  
     
      
    71 The trial judge observed that he did not hear the Trial Advocate “say those words”. The Trial Advocate said that he had taken the jury to s 61R and read it out in his address. This was not entirely correct. I have set out above the relevant parts of the address, and in the sentence I have emphasised recklessness as to consent was relied on using the words of s 61R(1).  
     
      
    72 The Trial Advocate said that he should have asked the judge to give a direction on recklessness, but had not done so because the Bench Book said that such a direction is generally not required where the accused maintains that at all times the complainant, to his or her knowledge, consented. Attention was then directed to the proviso in the Bench Book that a direction on recklessness may nevertheless be appropriate if the circumstances of the case are such that, despite rejecting the accused’s version, a question of recklessness is still open to be considered on the Crown case. The Trial Advocate submitted that the direction should be given because - 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to this case in my submission your Honour should give the direction because in this case all the accused in evidence said as to why he believed she was consenting was because she ‘moved slightly’ or ‘moved a bit’. And he didn’t give any other explanation apart from the fact she moved throughout – he said what she doing to [sic] – she moved at various times. So in my submission it is a direction that your Honour should give in this particular case.” 
        
       
      
    73 Counsel for the appellant submitted to the contrary - 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour I respectfully submit that this is not an appropriate matter for a direction on recklessness. It was my understanding that recklessness was not part of the Crown case. There was some mention to it but the facts of this matter really don’t bear upon recklessness. There doesn’t appear to be a matter relying on recklessness your Honour there was a version given by the complainant and a version given by Mr Bochkov. And as your Honour has noted from the Bench Book a direction on recklessness is generally not required where the accused maintains at all times the complainant to his knowledge consented, and that is the accused’s case.” 
        
       
      
    74 The trial judge said that he “didn’t focus on [the Trial Advocate’s] reading of s 61R”, and that if he had done so he might have summed up quite differently or “may have asked you not to say it”. After referring to R v Kitchener (1993) 29 NSWLR 696, he said that “having regard to the fact that the Crown raised s 61R I should give the jury a direction in relation to recklessness”. 
     
      
    75 The trial judge explained to the legal representatives what he proposed to say. Both were content with it. The jury returned to court.  
     
      
    76 The following directions were given - 
     
      
       
        
        “The concept of recklessness is relevant to the third element of each count. That is that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused knew the complainant was not consenting. So I repeat the concept of recklessness is only relevant to the third element, which the Crown must prove, and that is they must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting to the sexual intercourse. The Crown referred to recklessness in his addresses to you. The concept of recklessness in this case only applies to the second position of the Crown, where in any count you find that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse, having regard to her words and actions. 
        
       
       
        
        [The] concept of recklessness does not apply to the Crown’s first position. So if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused,  
        because in those circumstances the law is that the accused is taken to know that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse 
        . So you only consider the concept of reckless if the Crown has not satisfied you of its first position, that the accused knew that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse, under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused because in those circumstances, the law is that the accused has taken, no [sic: is taken to know] the complainant did not consent. 
        
       
       
        
        So that means in any count where you find that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse, having regards to her words and actions, then and only then does the concept of recklessness arise and I am going to give you a direction as to how you deal with that.  
        Between the two positions on the one hand, the knowledge of the accused that the complainant did not consent and on the other hand a mistaken belief that the complainant did consent. There lies a third possibility 
        . That is where the accused is reckless, something I will explain to you in a moment, as to whether the complainant is consenting or not. 
        
       
       
        
        If the Crown has in your opinion established beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, without her consent and the accused was reckless as to whether the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse, then it is the law that the accused would be taken to know, that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        I will repeat that. If the Crown has in your opinion established beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, without her consent and the accused was reckless as to whether the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse, then it is the law that the accused would be taken to know, that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse. In order to establish that the accused was acting recklessly the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt, either one, that the accused state of mind was such that he simply failed to consider whether or not the complainant was consenting at all and just went ahead with the act of sexual intercourse even though the risk that the complainant was not consenting would have been obvious to someone, with the accused’s mental capacity if they had turned her or her mind to it. So it is the subjective test. Or two, the accused’s state of mind was such that the realised the possibility that the complainant was not consenting but went ahead regardless of whether she was consenting or not. Again, this is wholly a subjective test. Content with that direction Mr Crown? 
        
       
       
        
        TRIAL ADVOCATE: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Content with that direction Mr Fernandez? 
        
       
       
        
        FERNANDEZ: Yes I am your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: So I am going to stress something to you. That the concept of recklessness as I have described it to you, does not apply to the Crown’s first position. So if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused knew that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused,  
        of course in those circumstances, the law is that the accused is taken to know that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse 
        . The concept of recklessness only applies to the Crown’s second position and that is where [on] any count you find that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse having regard to her words and actions. Does that make sense to you?” (bold and underlining added) 
        
       
      
    77 His Honour then repeated his directions in relation to the elements of the offence, including the Crown’s alternative positions regarding consent and alternative positions regarding the appellant’s knowledge. In that connection he said - 
     
      
       
        
        “I now turn to the third element and that is that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting. The Crown in respect of each count relies on two alternative positions regarding the accused’s knowledge. The first position of the Crown applies to any count in which you have found beyond a reasonable doubt, that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse because of a mistaken belief she was having sexual intercourse with Robert Seleznev. Such a position, the Crown relies on the law,  
        that is the accused knew that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused, then the accused is taken to know that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse.  
        Now in respect of the Crown’s first position regarding this element, that is, that the accused knew that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse. The Crown asks you to draw the inference that the accused knew that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse because of her mistaken belief as to his identity from the evidence. … “ 
        
       
      
    78 After dealing with the appellant knowing that the complainant in fact did not consent, he said - 
     
      
       
        
        “I am now going to interpose the direction regarding recklessness. The concept of recklessness only applies to the second position of the Crown, where in any count you find that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse, having regard to her words and actions. The concept of recklessness does not apply to the Crown’s first position, so if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused, of course in those circumstances the law is that the accused is then taken to know that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse, beyond reasonable doubt, having regard to her words and actions, then the following direction applies regarding recklessness. 
        
       
       
        
        I repeat the direction regarding recklessness only applies as to the element where the Crown must satisfy you that the accused knew that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse.  
        Between the two situations I have explained to you, being on the one hand the knowledge of the accused that the complainant did not consent; on the other hand an honest though mistaken belief that the complainant did consent, there lies a third possibility, and that is where the accused is reckless 
        , something I will explain to you in a moment as to whether the complainant consents or not. 
        
       
       
        
        If the Crown has, in your opinion, established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, as evidenced by her words and actions, and the accused was reckless as to whether the complainant consented as to the sexual intercourse, then it is the law that the accused be taken to know that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        To establish the accused acting recklessly, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that the accused’s state of mind was such that he simply failed to consider whether or not the complainant was consenting at all, and just went ahead with the act of sexual intercourse, even though the risk of the complainant not consenting, it would have been obvious with the accused’s mental capacity had he turned his mind to it, and I do stress that the test is wholly subjective, that is, the accused’s state of mind; or (2) the accused’s state of mind was such that he realised the possibility that the complainant was not consenting but went ahead regardless of whether she was consenting or not. Again, this is wholly a subjective test.” (underlining added) 
        
       
      
    79 I have emphasised the particular passages of which the appellant complained.  
     
      
    80 The trial judge asked the legal representatives whether they were content with the directions. The Trial Advocate said that he was. From the absence of any request for correction, counsel for the appellant was also content.  
     
      
    81 In due course the jury returned with verdicts of guilty on all three counts. 
     
      
    82 I now go to the appellant’s submissions under the paragraphs of the ground of appeal presently under consideration. The overall submission was that there was a miscarriage of justice because of an unnecessarily complicated and confused trial and positive misdirections caused by a late shift by the Crown seeking to rely on recklessness. There were more particular submissions. 
     
      
    83 First, it was submitted that there was not a proper basis for a Crown case on the first scenario, and that the appellant was disadvantaged by the confusion that this brought into the trial. It was said that the complainant did not give evidence that she consented, but rather on her evidence she did not consent. She pushed the person away and said she did not feel like it, she said no again, she said no loudly and sternly, and eventually tried to kick the person off. A Crown case on the first scenario, it was submitted, was not open. 
     
      
    84 I do not accept the submission. Counsel for the appellant at trial can not have perceived that a Crown case on the first scenario was not open. He recognised it and responded to it, including by the cross-examination of the complainant putting that at the time she understood the only person who could have been present was the appellant – that is, that she was not mistaken as to the person’s identity. He was right to do so. While the complainant gave the evidence of resisting and saying no, she thought that the person was Robert. She had previously had consensual intercourse with Robert. While the periods were imprecise, the acts of the person went on over some time without decisive rejection by the complainant. In the circumstances, a jury could have found that she was consenting to sex with Robert despite her protestations, in which case mistaken belief was a prominent issue. In my opinion, it was open to the Crown to rely on the first scenario. 
     
      
    85 Then it was submitted that, if the alternative scenarios were to be relied on, there should have been alternatively framed counts in the indictment. It was said that the appellant was disadvantaged because, in the absence of separate counts for sexual intercourse without consent and sexual intercourse with consent under a mistaken belief, the minds of the members of the jury might not meet on an element of the offence. 
     
      
    86 This also can not have been seen as a difficulty by counsel for the appellant at trial, who took no objection to the framing of the indictment. The appellant was unable to provide authority to support the submission. I do not accept it. The relevant element in the offence expressed in s 61I is that the sexual intercourse is had without the consent of the complainant. Absence of consent may be proved by proof that the complainant in fact did not consent, or by reason of s 61R(2)(a) by proof that the complainant consented under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person. These were means of proof, not elements of the offence, and the indictment was validly framed. Appropriately, the alternative scenarios were then matters of particulars.  
     
      
    87 Authority is in fact against the submission. The members of the jury did not have to arrive at absence of consent by the same route, see for example R v Isaacs (1997) 47 NSWLR 374 at 377-80 in which the Court (Gleeson CJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL and Simpson and Hidden JJ) accepted that members of a jury could arrive at a verdict of manslaughter, which could be on the ground of provocation, diminished responsibility or manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, on different grounds. See also R v Klamo [2008] VSCA 75; (2008) 18 VR 644, where Maxwell P at [75] took up from R v Walsh (2002) 131 A Crim R 299 the “two distinct types of case”, one where there were alternative legal bases of guilt depending substantially on the same facts and the other where different discrete acts could prove an essential ingredient of the crime charged; unanimity on the basis of guilt is not required in the first case, into which the present case falls. Indeed, it may be that an indictment formed as suggested would give rise to problems of its own, such as duplicity or inconsistency of verdicts; it is not necessary to decide whether that is so. 
     
      
    88 The appellant then submitted that the Crown altered its position to rely on recklessness after the summing-up had been completed. In the written submissions it was said that the Crown “had not sought from beginning to last during the trial to advance a platform of recklessness as a basis for criminal responsibility”; that it was evident that recklessness was not part of the Crown case from the reliance on the alternative scenarios which “did not include recklessness”; that there was no cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown Prosecutor to raise recklessness as an issue; that “the problem arose because of the irrelevant reading of s 61R(1) to the jury during the Crown Prosecutor’s address”; and that the late reliance on recklessness led to confusing and erroneous further directions to the jury. In oral submissions it was accepted that recklessness was “read out briefly during the opening and it was read out consistent with the statute in the closing”, but it was said that recklessness had not been an issue because “it was not a case of recklessness but of two specific bases of alternative liability”. 
     
      
    89 I will come to the directions to the jury, but the submission is otherwise ill-founded. From the particulars, reliance on the second scenario was known. That the appellant knew that the complainant in fact did not consent would be proved if the appellant was reckless as to whether she consented. The particulars did not exclude reliance on recklessness. The Trial Advocate’s opening included reliance on recklessness as to lack of consent. On the evidence there was a basis for recklessness, see [94] later in these reasons. The Trial Advocate’s reliance on recklessness in his address to the jury, although perhaps not well expressed, was maintenance of an aspect of the Crown case which had always been present.  
     
      
    90 In particular, it is not correct that reliance on the alternative scenarios excluded recklessness. The alternative scenarios went to absence of consent, not to the appellant’s knowledge of absence of consent. Consistently with them, knowledge of absence of consent in the second scenario could be established through recklessness. The submissions erroneously failed to distinguish between the two elements of absence of consent and knowledge of absence of consent. 
     
      
    91 The trial judge did not take up recklessness as to consent in the directions proposed prior to the summing-up, and the Trial Advocate did not remind his Honour of that aspect of the Crown case. The jury was attentive, however, and asked for clarification. If it was appropriate to give a direction as to recklessness, and a correct direction was given, I do not think there was an irregularity bringing or contributing to a miscarriage of justice. Giving a direction as to recklessness then met an issue before the jury, to which the jury was alive, and no confusion or prejudice to the appellant was caused because the direction was supplementary to the previous summing-up. 
     
      
    92 Other than by the submission that the Crown case had not “advanc[ed] a platform of recklessness as a basis for criminal responsibility”, which was not correct, the appellant did not clearly argue that recklessness was not open to be considered on the Crown case. In my opinion, it was open to be considered.  
     
      
    93 The defence case was that the complainant in fact consented, and to his knowledge; within it could be that he honestly but wrongly believed that the complainant was consenting. The jury was directed accordingly. Contrary to the statement in the Bench Book, R v Kitchener at 700 does not say that in those circumstances a direction on recklessness is generally not required. The proviso correctly states that a direction may be appropriate.  
     
      
    94 Recklessness may be found in failure to advert at all to consent or non-consent: R v Henning (CCA, 11 May 1990, unreported); R v Tolmie (1995) 37 NSWLR 660. It includes indifference as to whether or not there is consent and awareness of the possibility of absence of consent and proceeding anyway: Banditt v The Queen at [16], [38]. The complainant was asleep, and the appellant took the place Robert had formerly occupied. He did not say anything or ask her anything. He explained that “[I]f a girl does not offer any resistance as I was caressing her and cuddling her, it is all clear”. On the Crown case the complainant said no. If this did not in the circumstances provide knowledge that she did not consent, it was a basis for recklessness: as was said by Carruthers J in R v Kitchener at 703, with the agreement of Kirby P and Smart J, “at times the line between knowledge and recklessness in that regard may be a fine one indeed”. In R v Henning the Court (Gleeson CJ and Campbell and Mathews JJ) said that “in the normal course of events recklessness will become a relevant issue only when there is a possibility of ambiguity in the signals of consent or non-consent emanating from the complainant or arising from the circumstances”, contrasting that with where the signals were “unambiguous and all one way”. The circumstances in the present case were not those of unambiguous non-consent.  
     
      
    95 A finding that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent could be made on the basis of positive knowledge that she did not consent, or on the basis of recklessness as to whether or not she consented. It was appropriate to give a direction as to recklessness. Even if such a direction had strictly been unnecessary, there would be no miscarriage of justice in giving a correct direction: R v Kitchener at 697 per Kirby P, 703 per Carruthers J; R v Henning. 
     
      
    96 That brings me to the directions. 
     
      
    97 I have put in bold three passages in the directions which the appellant submitted were in error. It was submitted - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … that the law is not that the accused is taken to  
        know 
         that the complainant did not consent because she had a mistaken belief as to the identity of the accused. Rather, Section 61R(2) simply provides that the consent given is vitiated”.  
        
       
      
    98 According to the submission, s 61I required the element of knowledge to be established, and vitiation of actual consent did not establish the element of knowledge. At another point it was submitted that “[i]t is not the position that the effect of Section 61R(2)(a)(i) has the effect [sic] that the law is that the Appellant has to be taken to know the complainant did not consent”. 
     
      
    99 The trial judge was dealing with the first scenario, that the complainant consented under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the appellant. It may be noted that he had given the same direction in the initial summing-up, see the first paragraph in the second extract from the summing up set out earlier in these reasons. Section 61R(2) is relevant to the first scenario, but the submission is founded on an incomplete regard to it. The words “without limiting …” in the chapeau to s 61R(2) refer to vitiation, and s 61R(2)(a) could be said to provide for vitiation of actual consent. But s 61R(2)(b) then deals with the separate matter of knowledge. Again the appellant’s submissions failed to distinguish between the two elements of the offence. The trial judge correctly directed the jury in accordance with s 61R(2)(b). 
     
      
    100 I have underlined two passages in the directions. The appellant submitted that the second of them was in error; although the appellant did not take issue with the first passage, it was a repetition of the first. The submission was not entirely clear, and was put in different ways. It was submitted that the effect of the passage was to put recklessness as an alternative to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake as to consent; that “the position of the Defence as to honest and reasonable mistake has become substituted for the first scenario relied upon by the Crown”; that this “invited the jury to find recklessness as an alternative to the defence raised”; and that “the concept of recklessness was presented as a mid-way position between one scenario relied upon by the Crown and the Defence raised of honest mistake, a compromise”.  
     
      
    101 The direction in this respect followed the direction suggested in the Bench Book. It could nonetheless be erroneous. But it was not. 
     
      
    102 The basis for the submission appears to be that the appellant was raising a defence of honest and reasonable mistake. That is not correct.  
     
      
    103 At common law honest and reasonable mistake of fact “will be a ground of exculpation in cases in which actual knowledge is not required as an element of an offence”: He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523 per Gibbs CJ. That is not this case. The relevant element of the offence was that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent.  
     
      
    104 The trial judge directed the jury that a state of mind of actual knowledge that she did not consent was a guilty state of mind and made out that element. As I have earlier noted, he also directed the jury that a state of mind of honest though wrong belief that the complainant consented was not a guilty state of mind and did not make out the element. The element is subjective. Honest though wrong belief was not a defence; it meant that the Crown had not proved that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent. And the belief did not have to be on reasonable grounds: Director of Public Prosecutions v Morgan (1976) AC 182, which also emphasised that mistake may negative an element of the offence and if so should not be spoken of as a defence. 
     
      
    105 So far as concerned with whether the appellant held an honest though wrong belief that the complainant consented, the submission also failed to recognise the relationship between that position and recklessness as to whether she consented. There would be knowledge of absence of consent if the appellant knew that the complainant in fact did not consent, or if he was reckless as to whether the complainant consented. Within the first of these, the jury was directed that, if the appellant held an honest though mistaken belief that she consented, knowledge of absence of consent could not be found. There was indeed another possibility, namely, that the appellant was not in a positive state of knowledge of absence of consent or belief that she was consenting, but was indifferent to whether she consented or was aware of the possibility of absence of consent and proceeded anyway: that is, was reckless as to her consent. I would prefer not to describe recklessness as lying between knowledge and an honest though mistaken belief. Rather, it is outside the issue of positive knowledge of the complainant’s consent, and if it must be placed spatially, it is a parallel possibility. But that description does not in my view suggest a compromise position.  
     
      
    106 On the evidence it was appropriate, and the jury could be directed as to recklessness as the pathway to knowledge of absence of consent provided by s 61R(1) of the Act, as well as being directed about positive knowledge of absence of consent. The direction did not substitute honest and reasonable mistake for the first scenario, whatever that may mean. The trial judge was dealing with the second scenario, and with recklessness within that scenario, and there was no question of substitution. Nor did the direction present recklessness as a midway position inviting compromise. 
     
      
    107 It is necessary to consider the appellant’s overall submission of an unnecessarily complicated and confused trial. Part of that submission appears to have been that the evidence did not permit the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the complainant consented under a mistaken belief as to his identity. That is not easily brought within the ground of appeal, and should have been the subject of a separate ground, but in any event I consider that it is without substance. The course of the trial was not ideal, but in my opinion it did not approach disadvantage to the appellant giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      The ground of appeal – para (vii) 
       
      
    108 The evidence of the investigating police officer included that, after the appellant was arrested - 
     
      
       
        
        “During the drive to Waverley Police Station I was having a conversation with Constable Tindale when I heard Bochkov say ‘You know it’s remarkable how quick the insurance is in this country. I lost my mobile phone one day and a couple of days later they paid me the insurance money. In my home country this would take weeks, maybe months’. This comment was off topic and surprising. It was in stark contrast to the English communication abilities Bochkov was displaying upon arrest at York Street, Sydney. Constable Tindale said ‘Mate appears that you can communicate quite well when you want to, is there any reason for that?’ Bochkov said ‘I don’t understand what you’re saying’.” 
        
       
      
    109 This was part of a statement of the police officer read by him as evidence, with the concurrence of counsel for the appellant. The reference to a stark contrast should be explained. Earlier in the statement the police officer said that when first approached at the time of his arrest the appellant conversed in “fairly good albeit slightly broken English” and with a thick Russian accent, but that when the appellant was told that he was going to be arrested he claimed not to understand and ceased conversing in English. The statement did include some further communications with the appellant in English before and after his arrest. 
     
      
    110 Counsel for the appellant must have known that the evidence about the insurance payment would be read, and did not object to it. The cross-examination of the police officer on the point was brief. He agreed that the appellant “has a very limited English vocabulary” and that when in the police vehicle his English was limited, and -  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. He never used the word ‘remarkable’ did he? 
         
        A. He did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He was telling you in very limited English about problems he was having with his mobile phone. Correct? 
         
        A. He was talking about problems he had with his mobile phone insurance.” 
        
       
      
    111 The appellant’s submissions were not entirely clear. It did not seem to be submitted that the evidence was inadmissible, and para (vii) in the ground of appeal was not in terms of inadmissibility. However, it complained of “the conduct of the Prosecution in introducing opinion and hearsay evidence … “.  
     
      
    112 The evidence was not hearsay evidence. Its relevance was not that the mobile phone had been lost and the insurance money paid with remarkable speed, but that the appellant had a facility in English. That had some relevance to other evidence of the appellant’s use of English, and more particularly to his understanding of the complainant saying that she did not feel like it and no and, as matters turned out, to his explanation for saying “I want a woman like you”. There was not so much opinion evidence as comment, in the police officer’s observation that what the appellant said was off topic and surprising and in contrast with the English communication abilities the appellant was displaying upon his arrest. The comment, however, was unremarkable, and properly open to the Trial Advocate in putting the Crown case to the jury. It can readily be seen that counsel for the appellant therefore took the forensic decision not to object.  
     
      
    113 The appellant’s facility in English was an issue at the trial. The complainant, Robert and Igor all gave evidence of the appellant’s use of English. The appellant was cross-examined to the effect that he had reasonable capacity in English and pretended after he was arrested that he could not speak English. The appellant agreed that he “did say the first phrase regarding my telephone, but the rest of it was quite different because I don’t have such command of English”.  
     
      
    114 The thrust of the appellant’s submissions was that the evidence suggested that the appellant “was a person of deceit or dishonesty”, which I take to be referring to the contrast with the police officer’s evidence that the appellant came to claim not to understand and ceased conversing in English. It was said that there was ineffectual cross-examination and the defence case did not include independent evidence of the appellant’s limited capacity in the English language, and that this contributed to the miscarriage of justice. It was said that there was “an attack upon the honesty of the Appellant in a way which was not made relevant to an issue at the trial, but reflected poorly upon the Appellant in terms of credit”; however, the submissions otherwise appeared to accept relevance.  
     
      
    115 In my view there was relevance, whatever the consequences for the appellant’s credit. Whether or not on discretionary grounds the evidence might have been rejected does not arise. The appellant appeared to retreat from this paragraph of the ground of appeal, saying in the written submissions that it was “conceded that Rule 4 could well be invoked concerning the issue and that alone this issue would not be of great significance”. It was said that “in the context of the nature of the trial received by the Appellant, the attention of the Court is drawn to this issue”. In my opinion, whether independently or as a makeweight in the ground of appeal, the complaint in para (vii) should not be upheld.  
     
      
       
      The ground of appeal – para (viii) 
       
      
    116 The appellant submitted that, in presenting a case of the two scenarios, the Crown “was motivated by desired tactical advantage, not by inferences properly open on the evidence of the complainant”, and was seeking unfair tactical advantage in having its case go to the jury notwithstanding that the complainant was not believed in her evidence that she did not consent. The unfairness was exacerbated, it was said, by the introduction of recklessness although that had not been part of the Crown case. It was submitted that there was a miscarriage of justice through “the conduct of the Crown … by seeking unfair advantage over the Defence”.  
     
      
    117 This was a strong submission of impropriety, not lessened by a purported qualification in oral submissions that the Crown’s conduct was “either design or accident”. It is sufficient answer that, for the reasons I have given, in my opinion it was open to the Crown to present a case of the two scenarios and recklessness was properly part of the Crown case. It is unnecessary to explore tactical advantage as occasion for miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    118 There was no unfair tactical advantage, and it is appropriate expressly to reject any suggestion of impropriety on the part of the Crown. 
     
      
       
      Evidence on appeal 
       
      
    119 The appellant sought to read affidavits of Lester Fernandez and Alexander Harmstorf, respectively counsel and solicitor for the appellant at the trial. Other than the letter providing particulars, which was an annexure to Mr Fernandez’s affidavit, the Court rejected the affidavits with reasons to be given later. 
     
      
    120 The affidavits dealt with three matters.  
     
      
    121 First, Mr Fernandez deposed that he took every objection he saw appropriate and did not refrain from taking an objection for tactical reasons. This was not relevant to the appeal. 
     
      
    122 Secondly, both affidavits expressed and explained the beliefs of the deponents that recklessness was not part of the Crown case. The appellant accepted that the subjective states of mind were irrelevant. Inconsistently with that acceptance, he submitted that the affidavits in this respect went to the decisions made by the appellant’s counsel and solicitor in preparing the conduct of the trial. The ground of appeal did not call for investigation of why decisions were made. This also was not relevant to the appeal.  
     
      
    123 The affidavit of Mr Harmstorf proffered evidence to the effect that the appellant’s capacity in the English language was poor. The appellant accepted that it was not fresh evidence. He did not advance a basis for its admission other than that “[i]t was material that was available [at the trial] and wasn’t called”.  
     
      
    124 In fact, only in part was the material available at the trial. Mr Harmstorf said that in acting for the appellant he was aware that the appellant’s English was very limited, and formed the view that the appellant could not understand what he said to him and frequently called his mother by telephone to translate. The remaining material was technically fresh evidence, being a post-trial TAFE record stating that the appellant “failed to complete our most elementary English language course” and a post-trial note in records of the Department of Corrective Services that the appellant “can speak very little/no English”.  
     
      
    125 This evidence was of unhelpful generality. The occasion for evidence material to the appellant’s use of English, as the evidence at the trial revealed it, was the trial itself, when it could be properly addressed. In my opinion, the significance of the material is not such that it should be admitted as further or fresh evidence.  
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    126 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1. As one would expect, Customs Officers have the power to question passengers arriving in Australia about goods in their possession. The officers need to find out if the goods might attract duties or excise, or indeed be prohibited goods, such as illegal drugs.2. What is also not surprising these days is that if someone admits to an official some wrongdoing, such as confessing to a crime, then what they say cannot be used against them in court, unless there is some independent and reliable record of what was said to the official. However, if the official does not expect an admission, such as in an informal conversation or volunteered information, then the requirements for an independent and reliable record may be relaxed.3. This case concerns the point at which a Customs Officer, as a questioning official, moves from questioning an arriving passenger under their general powers to questioning the passenger about a crime. That is an important point, because what is said by the passenger beforehand, even if damaging, may be used against them, because it was volunteered or unexpected. However, after that point any damaging admissions cannot be used unless they are appropriately recorded.4. The importance of this point of transition is recognised by the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth. Section 23V(1) provides a test for the point of transition. It is only when a person is being “questioned as a suspect” that any admissions or confessions will not be admissible against them, unless they are recorded.5. In this case, Mr Orellana arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on 18 November 2007. He was questioned by a number of Customs Officers before it was eventually discovered that his baggage contained a commercial quantity of cocaine, being an illegal drug. In conversations with two of those officials, Mr Orellana said things which the prosecution now wishes to tender against him in these proceedings, which are due to commence next Monday before a jury. In these proceedings, Mr Orellana is being prosecuted for the offence of importing a border-controlled drug, being a commercial quantity.6. The things said by Mr Orellana in response to the questioning by the two officials were not recorded in the way required by the Crimes Act. Mr Brassil of counsel, who appears for Mr Orellana, says that in those two conversations his client was being “questioned as a suspect”, so that the conversations are inadmissible since they were not recorded in accordance with the Act. Mr Walsh of counsel, who appears for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, says that the point of transition had not been reached where Mr Orellana was being “questioned as a suspect”, so that what he said can be used against him without a record of the conversations.7. It has been helpful to refer to a number of authorities on the meaning of words and the interpretation of this provision of the Crimes Act. Regina v Bina Raso (1993) 68 A Crim R 495 was a decision of the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal. In a joint judgment delivered by Phillips CJ and Marks J, their Honours made the following observation at 507 about the purpose of section 23V(1) of the Crimes Act:  
     
      
      “ 
      The section is aimed to remove controversy about what a suspect may or may not have admitted or confessed 
      .” 
       
      
    8. In this case, the meaning of the noun “suspect” and its derivatives will become relevant. Also of relevance - because of some of the evidence that was given - will be to contrast the meaning of “believe” and its derivatives. Those two words were the subject of consideration by the Full Court of the High Court in George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104. The Full Court delivered a joint judgment. Adopting what was said by Lord Devlin in the House of Lords in Hussein v Chong Fook Kam [1970] AC 942 at 948, the Justices of the High Court said that suspicion “in its ordinary meaning is a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking”. Their Honours adopted the illustration given by Lord Devlin in the short sentence: “I suspect, but I cannot prove.” The Justices of the High Court went on to say that the “facts which can reasonably ground a suspicion may be quite insufficient reasonably to ground a belief, yet some factual basis for the suspicion may be shown.”9. Their Honours referred with approval to remarks made by Kitto J in Queensland Bacon Pty Limited v Rees (1966) 115 CLR 266. Their Honours extracted a passage from Kitto J’s judgment which appeared at 303, where his Honour said that a suspicion “is a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust, amounting to ‘a slight opinion, but without sufficient evidence’.” Kitto J had quoted from the Chambers Dictionary.10. In George v Rockett at 116 of the joint judgment, their Honours set out their views on the meaning of the contrasting word, saying as follows: 
     
      
        
      “Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of the mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture 
      .” 
       
      
    11. Returning to the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment in Raso, I have derived considerable assistance from the judgment delivered by Ormiston J. His Honour agreed with the disposal of the case, but in a judgment of his separate reasons, gave considered and helpful attention to the operation of s 23V(1)of the Crimes Act. In so far as that section uses the verb “suspect”, Ormiston J referred to the passages in George v Rockett to which I have referred, and other authorities and then concluded at 527 that he was: “inclined to the conclusion that the word ‘suspect’ requires a degree of conviction extending beyond speculation as to whether an offence has been committed and requiring that it be based upon some factual foundation.” His Honour also expressed his understanding of the use of the word, ‘suspect’ in the context in which it is used in s 23V(1). At 528 his Honour said as follows: 
     
      
      “ 
      To characterise the questioning as an interview of a person ‘as a suspect’ would seem artificial unless a positive opinion had been formed as the section requires certain steps to be taken upon the basis that the person was being interviewed 
      .” 
       
      
    12. I add here that the section has evidently been amended since that judgment. The present word “questioned” has obviously been inserted instead of the word “interviewed”. Counsel agree that nothing turns upon that difference. 13. Ormiston J went on to say “that there would be no purpose to the addition of the words ‘as a suspect’ in the section unless it was intended that the official should have formed some opinion based, as I have said, on a factual foundation.” In illustrating his Honour’s observations he said that unless “baggage obviously consists of or contains prohibited goods, or unless the customs officers have other information that the passenger is bringing in prohibited goods, they would not have any factual basis for forming a suspicion of the relevant kind.” At 529 his Honour repeated that “some other evidence would be required above and beyond the mere process of questioning” which a customs officer is empowered to do under the Customs Act 1901.14. Finally so far as the authorities are concerned, Ormiston J made some remarks about the development of a suspicion on the part of a customs officer. His Honour said at 528: 
     
      
      “ 
      Whereas a deliberate decision to question a suspect has been taken in the circumstances first described, in the latter circumstances the degree of suspicion may have been growing intermittently and even unconsciously throughout the questioning and may vary from one investigating official to another. 
      ” 
       
      
    His Honour was contrasting circumstances where previous enquiries had disclosed a known offence with circumstances where a passenger was being subjected to routine questioning under the Customs Act.15. Mr Orellana in this case was questioned, as I have said, by two Customs Officers on his arrival. The first to question him was customs officer Jill Currey. She questioned Mr Orellana at about 12.15pm on the day. The questions and answers given in that conversation are challenged by Mr Brassil, who asserts that she was questioning him as a suspect. The other relevant conversation was between Mr Orellana and customs officer Graeme Campbell. Mr Campbell questioned Mr Orellana sometime between 12.30pm and 1pm, at a time which counsel agree was probably around 12.45pm. That is the second conversation which Mr Brassil asserts amounted to his client being questioned as a suspect. 16. I will consider first the challenge to the conversation between Mr Orellana and Ms Currey. Mr Brassil argues that the evidence points to the conclusion that Miss Currey must have regarded Mr Orellana as a suspect when she was questioning him at the relevant time. In accordance with the remarks of Ormiston J in Raso’s case Mr Brassil says that there is a clear factual foundation for what he asks me to infer was a positive opinion formed by Officer Currey. The factual foundation comprises evidence of the following circumstances which existed at the time of the relevant questioning. 
     
      
      (a) Mr Orellana arrived on what was regarded by Customs Officers and was described as a targeted flight. 
       
       
      (b) He arrived from a port in respect of which there was also suspicion. That port was in South America. (Those two factors are obviously closely related.) 
      
     
     
      
      (c) She had information that the bag accompanying Mr Orellana had not been packed by him, but by his girlfriend. 
       
       
      (d) She had information that his girlfriend had paid for his return trip to South America and that her occupation was a hairdresser. 
       
       
      (e) She had information from another officer that items in the bag comprising clothing were damp, crusty and appeared to be discoloured by some sort of substance. 
       
       
      (f) She herself examined those items of clothing and made similar observations. 
       
       
      (g) She was made aware of a particular test used by Customs officials to detect illegal drugs. This test was called an IonScan and it returned a positive result for cocaine when applied to the clothing which had the appearance which I have described. She was aware of at least two positive results which had been returned. 
      
    17. Mr Walsh argues that it is important to appreciate the nature of an IonScan test. It is what is described as a trace test. It picks up traces of a prohibited drug. But what it indicates, if positive, is that the item tested may have simply come in contact or been exposed to the prohibited drug in question. It does not demonstrate that the item in question contains the prohibited drug in any measure which might be regarded as contrary to the law. As Mr Walsh argued, the test does not provide a factual foundation that there was a substance in the clothing. He points to the fact that when given that information, Officer Currey proceeded to ask Mr Orellana further questions and arranged for further testing which was described as a substance test. Mr Walsh argues that what Officer Currey did provides the best insight into her state of mind. What she did was attempt to ascertain further information both from Mr Orellana and from further tests which, in his submission, amounted to something falling short of suspicion.18. When cross-examined about her state of mind by Mr Brassil, Officer Currey said that she “did not believe an offence being committed up until the time” that drug detector dogs were called in and reacted positively to the presence of drugs. She said that when that occurred it was the time when she should caution Mr Orellana and read him his rights. Asked specifically about her state of mind at ten past twelve, just before the questioning which is the subject of the challenge, she said that she “did not come to the belief that he had any concealment on him - I had not come to that belief”. Asked whether she would have been content for Mr Orellana to leave the passenger terminal, she frankly replied that she would not have been content until further testing. 19. In considering whether the evidence points to Officer Currey questioning Mr Orellana as a suspect, I take into account the meaning of the word suspect approved by the High Court as a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking and a slight opinion but without sufficient evidence. I also take into account Ormiston J’s development of the meaning of the word suspect as it is contained in s 23V as requiring a degree of conviction extending beyond speculation as to whether an offence has been committed and requiring that it be based upon some factual foundation.20. There was, it seems to me, a good deal of appropriate and professional speculation on Officer Currey’s part in determining whether or not Mr Orellana might have been the carrier of a prohibited drug. It is to be borne in mind that the nature of suspicion is something which does not involve proof, certainty, conviction or belief. In my opinion, the state of mind of Officer Currey at the time that she asked her questions of Mr Orellana were such that she regarded him as a suspect and was questioning him as a suspect.21. Clearly the nature of the questions which she asked concerned, or at least were exploring, the circumstances of him travelling to Australia from the country that he came from and why he had the clothes which were returning a positive reading on one test for cocaine. Were she questioning him based merely on the plane being a targeted flight and the fact that he did not pack the bag and his flight being paid for by somebody else then I might have regarded the questioning as mere speculation and appropriate enquiry. However, the fact that the luggage contained items of clothing which had the qualities which I have described and the fact that those items of clothing returned at least two positive results for cocaine, to my mind, provided a factual foundation beyond mere speculation to form the basis for those questions. The speculation in those circumstances, in my opinion, amounted to suspicion. I am affirmed in my view about that by the fact that she would not have been prepared to let him leave the airport at that time. That, to my mind, is consistent with a state of mind of suspicion as it related to the traces or evidence which she had of prohibited drugs being imported. 22. Because that conversation, it is common ground, was not recorded as required by Section 23V(1) of the Crimes Act I reject its tender as inadmissible under that provision. 23. I turn now to consider the second conversation tendered by Mr Walsh, namely the conversation with Customs Officer Campbell. Customs Officer Campbell was first called over by either Customs Officer Currey or one of her colleagues at about 12.30. In cross-examination, Mr Brassil asked him about his state of mind at that time when he was first called over and Mr Orellana was drawn to his attention. Officer Campbell frankly admitted that at that time suspicion in his mind attached to Mr Orellana. Mr Brassil posed the following question: 
     
      
      “Q And so you would say wouldn’t you, that at that moment in time when that information was conveyed to you, he was a suspect? 
       
      A. Yes.” 
       
      
    That is clearly, in my opinion, consistent with Officer Campbell regarding Mr Orellana at that point of time as a suspect. 24. Mr Walsh argues, however, that the relevant conversation with Officer Campbell did not occur until about a quarter of an hour later. After that quarter of an hour, Officer Campbell had knowledge of further tests. A number of narcotic tests other than the IonScan were performed between the time of Officer Campbell’s initial impression and the challenged conversation. All of those tests came back negative for cocaine. 25. Mr Walsh argues that it is very important that a distinction is made between Officer Campbell’s state of mind at the two periods. He points out, as Ormiston J observes, that a degree of suspicion may vary, not only vary from one investigating official to another, but may grow intermittently with one officer, hence a state of suspicion in one’s mind may diminish over time and this is exactly what Mr Walsh argues occurred so far as Officer Campbell was concerned. 26. With that in mind Mr Walsh questioned Officer Campbell in re-examination specifically about his state of mind just before the conversation with Mr Orellana which is challenged in these proceedings. The following pair of questions and answers are important: 
     
      
      “Q. Now I’m asking you if your state of mind concerning the level of risk at the time after the NARCO test has come back as negative? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q. Can you tell us what was? 
       
      A. Well, just going through a risk assessment process, we had a positive, a positive trace technology, IonScan or BioSens technology advising that there was possibly the concealment of cocaine there. There was visual marking on the clothing, but the method of testing which I thought was most reliable was returning a negative result, so I was not too sure, that’s where the doubt was. My assessment of the level risk, I believe, yes possibly we had something here, but I was not convinced because the NIK test was negative. I was still suspicious that an offence may be occurring, but I wanted something else to back up those other forms of technology.” 
       
      
    27. A number of observations can be made about that evidence. First it seems to me that officer Campbell was being commendably frank. Secondly, it is to be observed that the terms of reference used by him are not the same as the term of reference used by the Crimes Act which I have to apply. That is not something which I criticise officer Campbell about at all, as I observed in the course of argument. It is for me and counsel to ascertain the appropriate legal tests as part of our job and that can be attended, as this judgment illustrates, by a degree of subtlety. But the point is that Officer Campbell applied terms such as being “not too sure” and entertaining a “doubt” about the risk. He also indicated that he was “not convinced” that there was something illegal there. The third observation is that he frankly acknowledged in his evidence that he was “still suspicious that an offence may be occurring”.28. When I apply the accepted meaning of the word “suspect” which I have already referred to, it seems first that the qualifications used by Officer Campbell expressing his reservations are not relevant to my determination and secondly it seems that he did entertain a state of mind which amounted to a state of conjecture or surmise where proof was lacking, or a slight opinion, but without sufficient evidence. But the information and knowledge which he had been given earlier about the source of Mr Orellana’s flight and the positive IonScans in my opinion provided a factual foundation for what he frankly admitted was a suspicion that an offence may be occurring.29. In my opinion his state of mind could also be described as suspecting Mr Orellana of committing a crime at the time that he questioned Mr Orellana. Since his questions and answers were not recorded, they are not admissible under s 23V(1) of the Crimes Act and I reject the tender of that conversation as well.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    2 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (“the Act”) the circumstances of aggravation being that the victim was under the age of 16 years. There were two matters on a Form 1, being offences of aggravated acts of indecency contrary to s 61O, of the Act which were taken into account in respect of the sentence for the second count. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty for the offences contrary to s 61J of the Act is a period of imprisonment for twenty years. There is a standard non-parole period which is a period of ten years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 61O of the Act is imprisonment for five years. 
     
      
    4 For the first offence the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of five years imprisonment to date from 19 August 2007 and expire on 18 August 2012. For the second offence, and taking into account the two Form 1 offences, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years to date from 19 August 2008 and expire on 18 August 2013 with a balance of term of three years to expire on 18 August 2016. The applicant received a total effective non-parole period of six years and a balance of term of three years.  
     
      
    5 The respondent concedes that the imposition of a fixed term for the first offence was contrary to s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (see SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76]-[78]; KC v R [2009] NSWCCA 110 at [20]). Because that Act provides a standard non-parole period for these offences the court was required to set a non-parole period. The error was technical and does not operate to the disadvantage of the applicant but must be corrected by this Court. 
     
      
    6 During the course of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge referred to the two Form 1 offences as offences of “aggravated indecent assault” an offence contrary to s 61M of the Act whereas the offences were of “aggravated acts of indecency” contrary to s 61O. A maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment applies to the offence contrary to s 61M rather than five years for the offence contrary to s 61O. However, a reading of her Honour’s entire remarks indicates that the mistake was a slip and does not suggest a misunderstanding by her Honour of the nature of the Form 1 offences. 
     
      
    7 The application for leave to appeal seeks to raise one ground of appeal, being that the sentencing judge erred in her consideration of the standard non-parole period by failing to consider the putative mid-range offence when determining that the objective seriousness of these offences fell in the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    8 The applicant makes no complaint about her Honour’s statement of the relevant facts. The applicant was the victim’s, (who is identified by the initials DJ), natural father. At the time of the offences he had separated from the victim’s mother. 
     
      
    9 The victim was aged 11 years at the time of the offences. The first offence involved the victim rubbing lubricant on the applicant’s penis following which he penetrated her genitalia to some extent. The second offence occurred when the applicant and the victim were in bed together and, he being naked, had the victim rub his penis and then placed his fingers in her genitalia, which he penetrated “to some extent”. One of the matters on the Form 1 involved the applicant masturbating while his daughters were in the bed with him, the complainant being aware of the activity. The second matter on the Form 1 involved the victim masturbating the applicant. 
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge described the offences as involving very serious criminality. Apart from the age of the child victim her Honour emphasised that the applicant, being the child’s father, was in a position of authority in relation to her. Her Honour concluded that the offences would have had a significant effect on the child’s psycho-sexual development and may cause problems for her for many years to come. The relationship of trust with her father was broken.  
     
      
    11 Her Honour concluded that the offences occurred when the applicant was abusing alcohol and there was also a probability of a psychosis which resulted in him being disinhibited. Although not an excuse for his conduct her Honour concluded that these matters provided “in part some explanation” for his offending. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was 56 years of age at the time of sentencing. Apart from some traffic matters he has a minor criminal history, comprising convictions for knowingly taking part in the supply of Indian hemp (in 1991), goods in custody (in 1993) and receiving (in 1995). He has previously served two short periods of imprisonment. The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant’s record entitled him to some leniency but this must be balanced with the fact that the present offences were committed over a six month period during which they went undetected. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was born in New Zealand and moved to Australia in 1989. He told the psychiatrist who provided a report for the court that he had been sexually abused by a neighbour when he was aged between 8 and 12 years of age. Before he was taken into custody the applicant was self-employed as a bush furniture manufacturer. 
     
      
    14 The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge who concluded that “he seemed to have some insight into the gravity of his conduct.” He told the sentencing judge that he intended to take part in the sex offender’s program within the prison system and seek counselling for his alcohol and drug problems. His prison counsellor reported that “he was making a genuine attempt to address his alcohol and other drug issues.” 
     
      
    15 The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant was genuinely remorseful. He made admissions to police officers and expressed his shame at his past conduct on a number of occasions. In respect of the first count the prosecution case was dependent upon voluntary disclosure of the offence by the applicant which her Honour concluded was tangible evidence of remorse.  
     
      
    16 When he was seen by his treating psychiatrist, Dr Adam Martin, in prison in late 2007 and early 2008 the doctor concluded that the applicant’s insight was impaired and he made the diagnosis that he was manic with psychotic symptoms. However, at a later review Dr Martin concluded that the applicant has an underlying psychotic disorder which had responded effectively to medication. 
     
      
    17 As I have indicated the applicant pleaded guilty to the offences and the sentencing judge allowed a reduction of 25% for the utilitarian value of the pleas. Although her Honour acknowledged some difficulty in assessing the applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation she concluded that they would “appear to be reasonable”. With respect to the objective seriousness of the offence and the standard non-parole period her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I come now to consider whether it is appropriate to impose the standard non-parole period for either charge. As to the first charge, I am of the view that it is at the mid-range of objective seriousness for such an offence. It involved penile penetration of a child aged just 11, the lower limit for a s 61J offence which encompasses children up to the age of 16 years. While the degree of penetration was limited and there is no evidence of physical injury, the child was under the offender’s authority, he being her father. As to the second charge, while it involved digital rather than penile penetration and to a limited extent, the complainant’s age and the fact that the offender was the child’s father again places, in my view in the mid-range.  
        
       
       
        
        However, I have determined not to impose the standard non-parole period for either offence because of the pleas of guilty and the psychiatric evidence. In addition, in respect of the first offence another reason is the fact that the offender voluntarily disclosed this offence to the authorities. In respect of the second offence a further reason for not imposing the standard non-parole period is my finding of special circumstances.“ 
        
       
      
    18 It is apparent that although shortly stated her Honour was clear in her reasons for concluding that the offences fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness and explained her reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. However, the applicant complains that her Honour erred because she did not “postulate what the putative mid point offence was in relation to these offences”. Emphasis was placed on the reasons of the court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [72] where it was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is evident that the sentencing exercise which is now required for Table offences requires a critical focus, not only upon the objective seriousness of the particular offence before the court, but also upon the abstract, or putative, offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, in respect of which the standard non-parole period is specified.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Vu v R  
      [2006] NSWCCA 188 at [29], [30], [31]. 
       
      
    19 It was submitted that because the sentencing judge had not undertaken a comparative exercise between the instant offences and an hypothesised abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness her Honour had fallen into error. It was submitted that her Honour should have undertaken the analysis suggested by Simpson J in R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 where her Honour said at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The assessment of where the offence lies in the range of offences of its type is to be made by reference to all of the facts and circumstances of the offence, and to the range of offences of its kind which come before the court.” 
        
       
      
    20 Although a sentencing judge must by his or her reasons disclose that the objective seriousness of the instant offence has been determined after consideration of the range of objective seriousness which the offence contemplates, elaborate reasoning is not required in many cases. Apart from the passage emphasised by the applicant this Court emphasised in Way that the process must be approached intuitively and is “based upon the general experience of the courts in sentencing for the particular offence” (at [74]-[75]). The court said that the process of reasoning would: 
     
      
       
        
        “depend upon a combination of sentencing experience, which is based upon the range of incidents which go to make up cases of the relevant kind that come before the courts, combined with an understanding of the facts which are necessary elements of the offence, as well as those that are concerned with its consequences and the reason for its commission (at [79]).” 
        
       
      
    21 The court confirmed that the task required of the sentencing judge would not differ to any material extent from that which had always been necessary in evaluating the objective seriousness of an offence. The assessment of where an offence falls in the range of objective seriousness “involves a subjective judgment, based on experience, as well as information, which cannot be precisely and comprehensively articulated” R v JCE [2000] NSWCCA 498 at [19]; (2000) 120 A Crim R 18 at [19]. A sentencing judge is not expected to write an essay in jurisprudence when delivering remarks on sentence R v Duffy [1999] NSWCCA 321 (at [11]). 
     
      
    22 In the present case her Honour identified the critical matters which led to the conclusion that each offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness, being the age of the victim and the fact that she was under the applicant’s authority. Having regard to the elements of the offence both of these aspects were of particular significance when determining where the offences fell on the range of objective seriousness. When, as it happened, both matters were present a finding that the offence fell within the mid-range was clearly open. This Court has previously emphasised that the age of the victim is an important factor when evaluating the seriousness of the present offences. In R v JCE [2000] NSWCCA 498 at [13]. Her Honour also recognised and had regard to the fact that in each case that the degree of penetration was limited and that there was no evidence of physical injury. Her Honour obviously had in mind that either of these elements may be present when the offence is committed which, depending upon all the other circumstances of the particular offence, may bring it within the mid range or place it higher up the scale of objective seriousness. Although her reasons were not elaborate the nature of the statutory offences and the circumstances of the particular offences did not require any greater consideration of these issues. 
     
      
    23 It was submitted by the applicant that because the second offence involved digital penetration it must for that reason fall below the mid-range. This submission is contrary to the statements by this Court in R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 where it was emphasised that the seriousness of an offence cannot be defined by reference only to the nature of the penetration without consideration of all the other circumstances of the offence. In that case the court said that: “The type of penetration is simply one factor and by itself does not indicate how serious the particular offence is … The fact that it was not penile penetration does not mean that the offence is reduced to low range” at [36]. See also R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20 at [20]-[21], [26] and [56]. 
     
      
    24 Although her Honour found that the offences fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness she determined that the appropriate sentences should include non-parole periods significantly lower than is provided for a mid-range offence. In determining the appropriate sentence her Honour gave careful consideration to the applicant’s guilty plea, his voluntary disclosure of the first offence to the authorities and his psychiatric condition. To my mind no error has been demonstrated in the sentences imposed.  
     
      
    25 However, because, as I have indicated, her Honour did not comply with the provisions of s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act this Court must intervene and impose a parole period for that count. For the reasons given by her Honour when determining the appropriate non-parole period for count 2 the non-parole period for count 1 should be the same as provided for count 2. I would make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted and the appeal upheld in part. 
       
      2. The sentence imposed in relation to count 1 quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years to date from 19 August 2007 and expire on 18 August 2012 with a balance of term of 3 years to expire on 18 August 2015. 
       
      3. The appeal is otherwise dismissed.

   Remarks on SentenceIntroduction1 Alex Cittadini, the prisoner, appears today for sentence in relation to four offences of manslaughter, each committed on 16 September 2002, when the yacht “Excalibur” sank at about 9 pm in darkness approximately 20 miles off Seal Rocks, north of Port Stephens, as a result of which four crew members died. The deceased were Christopher Heyes (aged 51 years), Ann Maree Pope (aged 30 years), Peter McLeod (aged 51 years) and Tracy Luke (aged 32 years). The offence of manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The prisoner was found guilty by a jury on 2 April 2009 after a trial of approximately five weeks. A co accused, Adrian Presland, an employee of the prisoner, or his business, was acquitted of the same charges. The circumstances of his acquittal are reflected in a judgment delivered today on his application for a costs certificate pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967.2 The prosecution case against the prisoner was that he was guilty of manslaughter, by criminal negligence. As against the prisoner the Crown alleged that because the prisoner had contracted to construct Excalibur through a business known as ‘Applied Alloy Yachts’, which he controlled, he had a duty of care to the deceased persons. That, by his act or omission, he was in breach of that duty of care, causing the death of those persons, the acts or omissions meriting criminal punishment because they fell so far short of the standard of care that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have exercised in the circumstances. This breach of duty involved such a foreseeable high risk by such a reasonable person that death or really serious bodily harm would follow and the degree of negligence involved in either the acts or omissions of the prisoner were so serious that they should be treated as criminal conduct. 3 The Crown case against the accused particularly alleged that he either: 
     
      
      i. delivered the yacht knowing that the keel had been cut horizontally and then welded (the negligent acts) or, alternatively,  
      
     
     
      
      ii. as Manager of the business or company that constructed the yacht, he was under a duty to implement a system in the construction of the yacht that incorporated adequate and proper supervision and quality control, he failed to implement such a system, the failure caused, or resulted in, the delivery of a yacht with a defective keel that was the cause of the deaths. 
      
    4 The Crown case against Mr Presland was that he had cut and then welded the keel for one of four reasons posited by the expert metallurgist retained by the Crown and that he had done so on the instructions of Mr Cittadini or of his own motion. The weight of circumstances, in a circumstantial evidence case, to implicate Mr Presland, pointed to his innocence. Of course, the acquittal of Mr Presland does not automatically defeat the Crown case against Mr Cittadini as having directed the horizontal cut to be made, but it does, in reality, weaken that aspect of the Crown allegation against him. General principles on fact finding5 It is for the Court to determine the facts upon which the prisoner is to be sentenced, consistent with the verdicts of the jury. (R v Isaacs (1997) 90 A Crim R 587). Matters of aggravation require proof by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt and matters of mitigation require proof by the accused on the balance of probabilities, determined in accordance with the decision of the High Court in R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. In determining the facts that may be in dispute in this matter, the Court has had regard to both the oral and written submissions of the Crown and the prisoner. Sentencing Principles for Manslaughter6 The position so far as general sentencing principles are concerned for the crime of manslaughter are summarised in the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [133]-[135] and [141].7 His Honour said, with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Hall J:  
     
      
      “As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in R v Blacklidge (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, esp pp2-3.) In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder (R v Weinman (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252; R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]).” [133] 
      
     
     
      
      “It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation within any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter.” [134] 
      
     
     
      
      “For example where diminished responsibility is relied upon, the extent to which culpability is ‘diminished’ can vary considerably from case to case. Similarly, although it is possible to characterise a number of cases as “child-killing by a parent or carer”, it may never be possible to identify a sentencing pattern or tariff from the whole body of such cases. (See Hoerler supra.) This is not only because the number of cases in a particular category may be too few to establish a pattern or tariff. It is also because, within any such category, the relevant circumstances can vary over a wide range. This is also true in the case of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence (seeR v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43; (2003) 149 A Crim R 505).” [135] 
      
    Finally his Honour said at [141] 
     
      
      “I accept that the permissible sentencing range for manslaughter must be regarded as particularly wide.”  
      
    His Honour concluded: 
     
      
      “(The) agreed facts (on appeal) indicate a level of possibility, perhaps even a probability, with respect to both the possession of the knife and its use. There is nothing, however, to indicate precisely how probable was the Appellant’s reason to expect either of these matters. In particular, it is not clear how certain he was that one of his friends had a knife at the time.” [141] 
      
    There the Court was concerned to measure culpability by regard to the relevant knowledge, or extent of foresight, of consequences.The Facts of the Case8 The prisoner was the Managing Director of a group of companies that can be called generically “Applied Engineering”. They carried on business in Bayswater in the Melbourne metropolitan area in Victoria. This was a business concerned with engineering projects, primarily to construct industrial manufacturing equipment, in industries such as brick making. Mr Cittadini had contracted with Alan Saunders, a businessman, to build the yacht Excalibur for him upon designs supplied by a naval architect (David Lyons). The construction of the yacht included the construction of a keel that could retract into the hull to enable the yacht to moor in shallow waters. Both Mr Saunders and Mr Cittadini were members of the Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron, located on Port Phillip Bay at St Kilda. During the construction of the yacht the keel, contrary to design, was cut on both sides of the keel along horizontal lines. The sheets or “skins” on the starboard and port sides of the keel were thus separated and then the skins were welded back together. This was the relevant cut and (re)weld giving rise to the allegation of criminal negligence by both accused. Mr Presland, the foreman boilermaker, was primarily responsible for the construction of the keel. Many of the employees of Mr Cittadini worked on the yacht’s construction, though Mr Saunders, a shopfitter in business, did the internal fit out. The prisoner was hoping to treat this yacht as a ‘prototype’ for further yachts to be known as ‘Extreme 50’ series. The prisoner had built, at most a handful of yachts before, primarily as an interest rather than a business. Yacht building was never, at any relevant time, the core business of Mr Cittadini or his companies. However, he was an experienced sailor and knew a lot about yachts. 9 The welding on the starboard side cut of the keel skin was on average only forty five percent of a complete weld. There was little or no weld preparation. The keel was approximately three metres in length, the cutting of the keel occurred approximately one metre from the top of the keel. When the yacht was subjected to severe weather conditions whilst sailing back from Queensland to its home port of Melbourne, after participating in various races between Sydney and Southport and in the Whitsunday passages, the keel broke away along the horizontal line, or cut, most probably first on the starboard side of it where the weld was least satisfactory, after weeks or months of fatigue fracturing. This caused the yacht to capsize almost immediately. The four deceased drowned. Only the body of Mr Heyes was recovered. Two other crew members survived, Mr Rogers and Mr McDermott, luckily but heroically, when rescued a number of hours after the capsize by a freighter sent to their aid. Their story of survival was chilling but also awe inspiring. The capsize and its consequences is an enormously tragic affair. There are many risks in sailing on the open ocean even for the most careful of sailors, but whilst factors such as weather and submerged objects may be a risk to life and limb sailors should not be put at risk from negligent or incompetent workmanship in the building of yachts. The yacht, in a capsized state, with the ’stump’ of the keel still attached and sixty percent of the ram piston still attached, was recovered by New South Wales Water police, returned to port and subsequently inspected by various experts, particularly Mr Gray and Mr Burns for the investigators. They are metallurgists, with specialist knowledge of welding procedures.10 There was no issue at the trial that the cutting of the keel was contrary to design and that the cutting of the keel and its welding together was grossly negligent. The causal connection between the negligent acts as alleged and the deaths was not the subject of dispute although there was remoteness in time and place between the negligent acts and/or omissions and the capsize. 11 The construction of the keel involved not only the cutting of the stainless steel sheets to the shape of the fin and their welding together, but the construction within the keel of a “ram compartment”, extending from the top of the keel through to about the middle of the interior of the keel, into which was to be placed a hydraulic ram, connected to the bottom of the compartment at what was called a “clevis point” or attachment. The ram would operate within the hull to pull up or let down the keel, which would retract partially into the hull. 12 The evidence that unfolded at trial established the cutting of the keel and it’s welding had in effect been “covered up” by polishing along the weld line. The cutting of the keel and its welding was thus not readily apparent either to the trained, or the untrained eye. A photograph of the keel, probably taken after the horizontal cut and welding had been done, makes that clear. I am not satisfied that the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused Mr Cittadini directed, or even knew of, the horizontal cut. There is evidence available to show that the cutting and welding of the keel was done in circumstances where the prisoner would not have been aware that it had occurred and could have been done without him being consulted. In the Presland judgment I deal with the reasons for this situation. There is no evidence of anyone witnessing the cut and welding of the keel. Although the prisoner could do some welding, there is no suggestion he did the welding here.13 Not only was the defect latent, and unknown to the accused, but the person who perpetrated the cutting and welding of the keel may well have taken active steps to hide that fact from the accused. The prisoner was ‘the boss’, ‘what he says goes’, to quote or paraphrase one witness. I am satisfied that the evidence at the trial established that the reason for the cutting and re-welding was connected with the attempt to ensure that the ram compartment could house the hydraulic ram. This “motive” was, to my mind, made clearer (notwithstanding the possibilities suggested by Mr Gray the metallurgist) by the case conducted by Mr Presland, showing that he had constructed the first cover plate, but not the second cover plate to the keel. The “cover plate” was cut to assist in connecting the ram to the clevis point or attachment. The second cover plate, which was placed back in the skin of the keel after the horizontal cut had been made, was welded in a manner far inferior to the usual standard of Mr Presland’s welding. I am quite satisfied of the truth of Mr Presland’s denial that he not only did not do the horizontal cut and welding of the keel but that he did not cut or place the cover plate for the second time. 14 The cutting of the keel was a major variation to the keel’s design and in the absence of any evidence of an “economic” motive to cut the keel, it is apparent that the cutting of the keel and its welding was kept secret from the prisoner. There was evidence at the trial that the prisoner had made it clear that the skins of the keel were not to be cut. The cutting and the welding were, as earlier indicated, covered over by polishing. 15 The prisoner gave evidence on sentence of supervising the placement of the rudder housing or assembly, which was to be welded by Derek Harris. He was aware that Mr Harris had tacked the rudder housing into position and he left him to finish the work, however Mr Harris only stitch weld it and it was not completely welded. I accept this evidence as indicating that the prisoner put his trust in long term experienced employees to do work properly that they were capable of doing. I accept evidence that there have been changes at Applied Engineering in relation to its processes to ensure quality control. The business does not, and has not, built yachts since the capsize of the Excalibur. The prisoner was cross-examined by the Crown principally about matters relating to whether he ought to have had notice of the horizontal cut by further inquiry. The prisoner said that such markings as were on the keel which, as it transpired, disguised the horizontal cuts to the keel, were to his mind a “heat cleanup line” and that he made no inquiry beyond that assumption, nor in relation to grind marks along the heat line. Although Quality Assurance was raised with him, I must say that I have not been fully informed, nor even barely adequately informed (as with the jury), as to the detail of Quality Assurance steps that would provide a greater level of supervision and inspection that arose in this particular case and prevent this type of occurrence. It would seem that having regard to the basis upon which Mr Cittadini was found guilty that there is a real probability that even with appropriate quality assurance steps, a secretive “operation” to cut the keel would not have revealed itself to Mr Cittadini. 16 The failure to detect this secretive operation is the basis of the Crown case for negligent act by omission. The prosecution introduced into the case matters in evidence and in address which had nothing to do with the real issues for the jury to determine relating to Quality Assurance and the like. There was evidence available to the jury of steps that could be taken to overcome the problem of detecting a latent defect, such as radiographing the keel, more intense supervision and the like. It must be said that both by reference to the standards existing at the time of construction (2000-2002), the absence of Quality Assurance and other possible methods of checking procedures were explained by the absence of any requirement for them either in the demands of the naval architect, the owner or any industry standard. No party favoured this Court with the Coroner’s recommendations on this issue in late 2005, but I believe the Coroner made various recommendations in this regard.17 Whilst Mr Cittadini had constructed other yachts, this would appear to be the largest yacht construction in which he was involved. There was, to be fairly said, an element of inexperience in the background of the employees and Mr Cittadini himself in yacht construction generally, albeit that at various points very experienced tradesman were involved in various aspects of the construction. Mr Presland was a boilermaker and a perfectionist. The prosecution established to the jury’s satisfaction that the accused ought to have had a system in place to detect latent defects. Even the system implemented by Mr Brown, the yacht builder who’s statement was tendered because he was unavailable to be cross examined, short of x-raying the keel, did not appear to provide a fail safe method of avoiding secretive operations that must have occurred on this occasion. 18 I accept so far as the prisoner’s role was concerned that, for the principal tasks, competent and experienced tradesmen were employed, that responsibility for individual jobs was delegated by foreman to tradespeople and that foremen had general supervisory responsibility, as management expected in all the business’ work. Mr Cittadini expected his instructions to be followed, including instructions that the keel not be cut, and there were some spot checks from time to time. As the Crown put its case for omission, there were insufficient “spot checks” or other possible supervision. 19 The character of the horizontal cut, in defiance of Mr Cittadini’s orders and expectations, would not have been avoided by either pre-testing welders working on the yacht or prescribing particular weld procedures. The secretive character of the operation to do the cutting and the welding pre-empted any such requirements whether they were in place or not. I am satisfied that the prisoner is to be sentenced on the basis of a failure to put in place a system of adequate visual examination of the various stages of the construction. A reporting system clearly would not have been adequate to overcome the circumstances of this matter if someone chose not to report his own conduct. 20 It is in this context that the objective seriousness of the offending is required to be considered. As has been pointed out in submissions and was known well before the learned Chief Justice handed down his decision in R v Forbes, manslaughter is the most “protean” of offences. The submissions have focused upon categorising this particular offending within the range of offending contemplated as being manslaughter by criminal negligence. 21 I was taken by both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Odgers SC to a number of judgments, some from New South Wales, some interstate and some from England, purportedly providing assistance as to both principle and perhaps “tariff”. The English decision of R v Connolly [2002] 2 CR.App.R 509 cited by the prosecution was an “industrial” manslaughter case involving the death of four people, but otherwise bore little or no relationship with this case in any material respect. The criminal conduct arose from manslaughter by gross negligence involved a deliberate act on the part of the offender of disabling brakes on a “rail trailer”, which rolled down a gradient without brakes and killed four workmen and injured others. The “negligence” arose from a deliberate act, the appellant’s motive was profit, he had concealed the disablement and had attempted to obtain false assessments in order to deceive investigators. Naturally, sentences of imprisonment outside New South Wales provide little guidance given different sentencing regimes. In the matter of Connolly the complexities of “totality”, as arise in this matter, do not appear to have troubled their Lordships when they imposed concurrent sentences, unburdened as they are by Australian jurisprudence on the subject post Pearce v The Queen. 22 Some of the other “comparative” sentencing cases were concerned either with “motor manslaughter” or manslaughter by neglect of an individual victim. It should be noted that almost universally throughout the various authorities to which I was taken (Lawler v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 85, R v Susan Hall and Collin Hanslow [1999] NSWSC 738, R v ANG [2001] NSWSC 758, R v Yeoman [2003] NSWSC 194, R v HA [2008] NSWSC 1368), even where amongst those cases there were sentences imposed for negligent manslaughter, the circumstances were that the offender was directly aware of essential facts contributing to the circumstances of the death, or deaths. They are in fact by and large cases of unlawful and dangerous act or negligence by commission. Even a case safely to be categorised as manslaughter by omission, such as HA, had evidence of temporal proximity of the offender to the relevant events contributing to the death, knowledge of them and even an opportunity before the death to intervene to prevent the death occurring. 23 I appreciate, particularly in relation to manslaughter, that no general rules can be propagated. Generally the sentencing regimes for manslaughter offences reflect, subject to particular subjective circumstances, a diminution of culpability by reference to the extent of conduct and/or knowledge on the part of the offender. Manslaughter sentences for offences which might otherwise be murder, but for defences of provocation and diminished responsibility, are generally regarded as objectively more serious than crimes of manslaughter by criminal negligence. Cases of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act are also generally more objectively serious than offences of manslaughter by criminal negligence. Crimes of commission will be generally seen as more serious than crimes of omission. Of course, whilst this is generally true of sentencing over many years for the crime of manslaughter, there may be situations where manslaughter by gross negligence may be seen as objectively more serious than crimes involving either an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm with a statutory defence available or even unlawful and dangerous act. Many variable factors may arise for consideration such as the relationship between the parties, the time taken in planning or conducting the crime, immediate contrition on realising the consequences of one’s conduct, the degree of negligence and the like. The Crown conceded in this matter that on the facts of this case negligent manslaughter by omission was less culpable, or less objectively serious, than by acts of commission. At this point I acknowledge the interstate authorities to which I was taken, but feel that they add little to the jurisprudence within this State and certainly must be considered in the context of different sentencing regimes and even standards interstate.24 Each individual offence here, in the context of the conduct giving rise to liability for manslaughter, must be seen at the lower end of the scale of culpability and objective seriousness, primarily because the omission of the accused was the failure to implement a system of adequate supervision and quality control but in circumstances were there was no “recklessness” to foreseeable circumstances. The accused himself was unaware of both the fatal flaw in the yacht and the circumstances which gave rise to its creation because it was done secretively and where he would not have approved what was done. In fact, I am satisfied he would have rectified the fault if he knew. The prisoner in fact, by sailing on the yacht for ‘shake down’ cruises on Port Phillip Bay, put himself at risk equally with other people on the yacht at that time, although the risk of death no doubt was less on Port Phillip Bay in daylight than in the open ocean at night. On the other hand the omission(s) of the accused potentially put at risk multiple victims which ultimately militates in favour of the custodial option I have foreshadowed. 25 This may be categorised as an “industrial” or, particularly, a “consumer manslaughter” case, but that categorisation does not relieve it of its seriousness. There may be circumstances of death caused in the ‘work place’, or death to consumers from industrial processes, giving rise to liability for prosecution for manslaughter of considerable seriousness. The English authority to which I referred to earlier is a good example. However, sentencing individuals for industrial manslaughter (as opposed to sentencing breaches of Occupational Health and Safety legislation arising from deaths) are comparatively rare from what I understand of the researches of the parties. Certainly no New South Wales case has been brought to my attention of liability for manslaughter in an industrial or commercial context, on the basis of omission, as opposed to commission. This case would appear to be almost a unique example of manslaughter by omission. The bitterness over the search for justice as it is described by the family of the victims is understandable. This extends to blaming the prisoner for consequences for which he is not responsible, as arose in some of the victim impact statements, but there must be, in any context, some limits to the extent of criminal liability which will fall within the limits of liability for damages, or liability under relevant Occupational Health and Safety legislation. 26 I have to consider the “totality of the criminality” in the context of fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence in accordance with the majority views In R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 (at [45]). This is an expression which in many respects defies precise definition but has been the subject of comment in a range of cases including Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly in the decision of the majority at [45]. That decision of the High Court, coming in the context of an appeal against a refusal to stay proceedings followed by pleas of guilty, concerned with the implications of issue estoppel and “double punishment” has generated a body of jurisprudence in the law of sentence of considerable size and complexity. When one reads the various judgments opining upon the implications of Pearce, one is reminded of what appears in the same judgment before and after the obiter observations of their Honours at [45]. 27 The majority said, inter alia: “It is highly undesirable that the process of sentencing should become any more technical than it is already … it should, however be emphasised that (the enquiry as to whether “a single act is common to two offences whilst no always straight forward”) is not to be attended by excessive subtleties and refinements. It should be approached as a matter of common sense not as a matter of semantics …. Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision” (Pearce v The Queen at [39], [42], [46]). 28 These observations may be seen in the light of observations in other important cases decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court on sentencing since Pearce. In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 (at [126]) the Court said: 
     
      
      “Had there been an intention to convert sentencing to a precise arithmetic exercise….then those reference points would need to have been identified and consideration given to the weight to be attached to the adjusting factors. The absence of any provision of that kind (in Part 4 Division 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999) is a further pointer towards the continuation of a wide area of discretion, without resort to some rigid mechanistic or arithmetic approach, of the kind which would be untotally suited to the difficult task of sentencing.” 
      
    Or, as the High Court has observed: 
     
      
      “The core of the difficulty lies in the complexity of the sentencing task. A sentencing judge must take into account a wide variety of matters which concern the seriousness of the offence for which the offender stands to be sentenced and the personal history and circumstances of the offender. Very often there are competing and contradictory considerations. What may mitigate the seriousness of one offence may aggravate the seriousness of another. Yet from these the sentencing judge must distill an answer which reflects human behaviour in the time or monetary units of punishment.” (Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [77]) 
      
    29 Be that as it may, I am required to have regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 (approved in Gonzalez [2006] NSWCCA 4), where Hunt AJA said in a case where at first instance involved concurrent sentences arising from two counts of dangerous driving causing death where the respondent to the Crown appeal was involved in an impact with another vehicle in which he caused the death of the driver of the other vehicle and a passenger in that other vehicle. His Honour said, 
     
      
      “…. There are at least two distinct categories of cases in which problems with concurrency arise. The first is when the offender is being sentenced for discrete offences committed on different occasions. The concurrency of sentences for that category is now governed largely by  
      Pearce v The Queen 
       (1998) 194 CLR 610, which overruled the practice previously common in this State of fixing one of several concurrent sentences to reflect the total criminality of the offender for all the offences. The second category is where the one incident or enterprise gives rise to different charges, usually where there is more than one victim. That category has at least two sub-categories. An example of one of those subcategories is where the offender repeatedly fires a gun, injuring a number of different persons, each as a result of a different action by the offender, although part of the one incident, when it is appropriate to take into account the fact that the offences were substantially contemporaneous and connected …. The other sub-category is where the one action by the offender causes a number of people to be injured and where separate charges are laid in relation to each victim. That is the present case.” [21] 
      
     
     
      
      “In this second sub-category, it is easy for the sentencing judge to consider the sentencing process as being related to a single action which has created multiple victims, and therefore to fall into the error of imposing wholly concurrent sentences, each of them having been assessed on the basis that the existence of the multiple victims aggravated that sentence. Section 21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which identifies the fact that an offence involved multiple victims as an aggravating factor, may (read in isolation) unfortunately lend credence to that approach. …. Such an approach overlooks the fact that, in a case such as the present, there are two counts, each identifying one of the victims and each requiring a separate sentence. It is completely contrary to principle to aggravate each of those sentences on the basis that each offence resulted in multiple victims: Regina v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 at [28]–[29]”. [22] 
      
     
     
      
      “In a case falling within the second sub-category, separate sentences should usually be fixed which are made partly concurrent and partly cumulative, each such sentence being appropriate to the existence of only one victim and the aggregate of the sentences reflecting the fact that there are multiple victims resulting from the same action by the offender. The extent to which there should be an overlap in the partial accumulation will depend on what is required to represent the totality of the criminality involved in the one act of the offender. This, it seems to me, follows naturally from Pearce at [45]–[48] — and cases such as Regina v Weldon (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 at [46]–[53] and Regina v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [38], [49] — when applying the general principles relating to the aggregation of sentences to this particular sub-category”. [23] (See also Howie J at [27] in  
      Gonzalez 
      ). 
      
    30 To the judgments which were raised in the sentencing of this matter might be added R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 in the judgment of Hall J for the Court of Criminal appeal at [52] 
     
      
      “(1) It is well established that questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary. What is important is that, firstly, an appropriate sentence is imposed in respect of each offence; and, secondly, that the total sentence imposed properly reflects the totality of the criminality:  
      Regina v Wilson  
      [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38] per Simpson, Barr and Latham JJ agreeing. 
      
     
     
      
      (2) In  
      Regina v Weldon; Regina v Carberry 
       (2002) 136 A Crim R 55, Ipp JA at [48] stated that it is “not infrequent that, where the offences arise out of one criminal enterprise, concurrent sentences will be imposed” but his Honour observed that “this is not an inflexible rule” and “[t]he practice should not be followed where wholly concurrent sentences would fail to take account of differences in conduct”. 
      
     
     
      
      (3) The question as to whether sentences in respect of two or more offences committed in the course of a single episode or a criminal enterprise or on a particular day should be concurrent or at least partly accumulated is to be determined by the principle of totality and the relevant factors to be taken into account in the application of that principle. See observations in this respect of Howie J in  
      Nguyen v Regina  
      [2007] NSWCCA 14 at [12]. 
      
     
     
      
      (4) In applying the principle of totality, the question to be posed is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other offence. See generally  
      Regina v MMK 
       [2006] NSWCCA 272 at [11] and [13],  
      Cahyadi  
      (supra) at [12] and [27] and  
      Vaovasa v Regina  
      [2007] NSWCCA 253. 
      
     
     
      
      (5) If the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other, then the sentences ought to be concurrent, otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the totality of the two offences:  
      Cayhadi 
       (supra) per Howie J at [27]. 
      
     
     
      
      (6) If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality:  
      Cayhadi 
       (supra) per Howie J at [27]. 
      
     
     
      
      (7) Whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other calls for the identification and an evaluation of relevant factors pertaining to the offences. These will include the nature and seriousness of each offence. 
      
    There is also the judgment of Howie J in Cahyadi v Regina (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 (at 47). 31 I sought assistance from counsel as to what the concept of “totality of criminality” meant in the context of “post – Pearce” principles for sentencing for multiple offences, arising out of the one action, or in this case, omission. In R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 (at 260), Street CJ discussed the principle in practical terms, albeit pre Pearce. In a nutshell his Honour for the Court held: 
     
      
      “The effect of this practical consideration is always to produce an ultimate aggregate which is less than that which will be arrived at by a straight forward adding up of the terms appropriate for the offences if each were viewed alone. In carrying out this process of adjustment, it is both inevitable as well as proper that the ultimate decision be arrived at in the light of the totality of the criminality involved in all the offences. …. Where the principle of totality comes into effect … the important factor is the practical significance of the sentencing order.” 
      
    32 The method his Honour described however probably would not survive post Pearce principles. In Mill v The Queen (1998) 166 CLR 59 (at 62-3), the High Court said that the totality principle had been described succinctly by the leading legal academic, DA Thomas, in his work “Principles of Sentencing”, where the leaned author said: 
     
      
      “The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentence, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is “just and appropriate”. …. The Court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences.” 
      
    33 The High Court said in Mill that an appropriate result may be achieved either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent. The High Court even suggested “lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate”, a view not embraced by the majority in Pearce. 34 The judgment in Pearce does not with any precision shed any helpful light upon what constitutes “totality” of criminality. Here, ultimately one must conclude that the consequence of the omission causing four deaths, represents greater criminality than that resulting in one death. But the effect of the increase of the sentence by accumulation must be mitigated by the singular character of the offending, noting that the offending may have caused (by the capsize of the yacht), no deaths, one death or even more than four deaths, depending upon a range of variables of which the prisoner could not have any reasonable foresight.35 The Crown’s position is that the circumstances of the matter were such that there should be some concurrency and some accumulation of all the sentences to be imposed, as I understand the Crown’s position, “Each sentence should be determined to partially accumulate each sentence upon the other”. The defence position is that in the circumstances primarily the sentences should be concurrent with each other. Alternatively, there should be partial accumulation of some sentences. Senior Counsel for the prisoner submitted further that even if the sentences were accumulated the sentences could be suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. My understanding of the operation of s 12, without being pointed to authority to the contrary, is that there is no requirement to fix commencement dates in relation to the sentences of imprisonment suspended under that provision. S.12 expressly excludes the operation of Pt 4 of the Act, which provides for the backdating of commencement dates and accumulation of sentences, subject to s.99(1) of the Act. Given the character of the orders and their purpose it is not possible to partially accumulate terms of imprisonment to be suspended, pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, either in practical terms or as a matter of law. It would be absurd to give a commencement date for a sentence of imprisonment, which is suspended, if the bond could be revoked, long after the period fixed had expired, for a breach on the last day of the bond and obviously before enforcement proceedings. The Victim Impact Statements36 A number of Victim Impact Statements have been prepared by various persons both primary and secondary victims. These statements were read by Mr McDermott, the skipper at the time of the capsize, who harboured personal responsibility for the loss of his crew, Annabelle Lane, the sister of Christopher Heyes, Mr Heyes brother Samuel Heyes, Christine Heyes, Mr Heyes widow, and David Heyes, another brother. Other victim impact statements were tendered from Joy Oakley the mother of Tracey Luke, and a brief note expressing the distress of Mavis Pope OAM, the mother of Ms Pope. The sudden, unexpected death of a loved one is a shocking experience and lingering questions as to how it happened, why it happened and who was responsible no doubt add to the distress of loved ones. The reading of victim impact statements is a very emotional event for all concerned. In accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I have regard to those statements and noted the impact upon others of these events. Whilst the death of Mr Heyes’ mother shortly after his drowning was raised in several impact statements is very sad, it is not a matter for which Mr Cittadini can reasonably be held accountable and responsible for sentencing purposes. I would be disappointed if the victims were advised that that event could reasonably be regarded as a relevant matter to this sentencing process. One of the most disturbing aspects of dealing with victims of crime in sentencing proceedings for Judges is calming false expectations and misunderstandings they have of the sentencing process or dealing with misleading information that victims are given about what material is relevant in sentencing and what outcomes are realistic. 37 One other matter that needs to be addressed to the families of the victims is that my responsibility is not to sentence Mr Cittadini solely to the satisfaction of relatives of the deceased and other victims. There are many interests involved, including theirs, and many complex rules to recognize. Most importantly, the imposition of a penalty imposed upon any person responsible for the death of another is never to be taken as a measure of the worth of the deceased's life. The sentencing of offenders, as I have explained elsewhere, for the crime of any manslaughter is a complex area with many considerations, some pointing in different directions, to paraphrase the words of the High Court in Veen (No 2) v The Queen.Subjective circumstances38 Mr Cittadini was born on 16 February 1959 and is thus now aged 50 years. He was 43 years of age at the time of the commission of the offences. 39 He has no prior criminal convictions. He did not raise his good character at the trial, which is surprising in the absence of convictions and the positive evidence of good character before this Court on sentence, not challenged by the prosecution. 40 Apart from various references, to which I will refer, and the evidence of the prisoner I have a report from the Victorian Department of Justice, Community Corrections Division. In that report, not unnaturally, Mr Cittadini maintains that he was unaware of the defect in the keel. The report confirms what is available from other evidence that Mr Cittadini is a married man with children, aged 15 (a son) and 17 (a daughter). He has strong support from his immediate and extended family. There are no outstanding health issues although there was some immediate anxiety as a reaction to the events giving rise to the charges, which Mr Cittadini addressed by psychological counselling. 41 He has been employed by and/or managed the Applied Engineering Group since 1976. This group of companies is a family concern, started by his father. He has at least one sibling (Albert) involved in the business, as I understand the situation. He has had various management roles and has been described at various points as “Managing Director”, although presently a professional Chief Executive Officer manages the various companies. Some evidence was given at the trial of the liquidation, or receivership, of some of the Applied Engineering Group companies, but so far as can be understood by this Court, at this time, the business in general terms is a going concern. 42 The report from Community Corrections notes that the prisoner is not affected in any way by drug or alcohol issues and is, as one would expect, assessed at a low level of reoffending. Given almost the unique circumstances of this prosecution and conviction I have no doubt that the prisoner will pose no threat or concern for the community in any respect. The Community Corrections report indicates that the Service has in fact little to offer. 43 The prisoner gave evidence before the Court on sentence, although he did not give evidence in his trial. He gave evidence in a matter of act, straight forward style.44 He explained that he had been the Managing Director of the Applied Engineering Group of companies since 1996 and before that had been involved in project management work, with an electrical trades background. At the present time the Applied Engineering Group employs about 70 people on a full time basis with a number of temporary employees, many of the employees (as was the case with witnesses at the trial from the business) having worked for the company for many years. He had been a member of the Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron for twenty five years and was Club Captain and on the Sailing Committee at one point. 45 He said in evidence that his reaction to hearing of the deaths of the crew of the Excalibur was one of shock and confusion. The prisoner was unavailable and sent his brother Albert to inspect the yacht once it had been retrieved by the Sydney Water Police. He denied that he knew that the keel had been cut through and welded back together and gave evidence that when he realised that that was the cause of the yacht capsizing he had a “sinking feeling” and anger, realising that “things happened on our watch”. I accept the evidence of the prisoner that he cooperated with the police investigation and cooperated with the Coronial inquest. The full picture in a technical sense did not emerge for Mr Cittadini until the “second part” of the inquest in 2005. The prisoner gave evidence of anxiety issues arising from the circumstances of the death and the strain of the subsequent litigation. I accept that his son has suffered difficulties because of the publicity, particularly publicity arising out of his father’s prosecution, as has the daughter to a lesser extent. The prisoner has given evidence that since 2002 he had barely sailed having lost interest in the sport. He takes general responsibility for these events but maintains his innocence, It must be said that the line between guilt and innocence, in a case such as this is blurred.46 I heard oral evidence from Peter Ellett, a retired businessman and one time owner and manager of very large brick construction companies. He was impressive. One business of which he was the Chief Executive Officer before he retired had five hundred employees and an annual turn over of over $90 million. There were other companies beforehand that he managed or owned with significant numbers of employees and large turn over. In his business career over thirty years he had dealt with the Cittadini family whose business appears to have largely been concerned with the engineering of brick making equipment. Mr Ellett attested to the high standards of the Applied Group of companies and the honesty and professionalism of Mr Cittadini in his business and technical dealings. Angelo Greco, now the Chief Executive Officer of the “Applied Group” of companies, had worked with Mr Cittadini for five years before giving evidence and spoke of his professionalism, his ethical approach to business and his outstanding relationship with his staff. He said that the prisoner embraced resolving problems and achieving perfection in his work, sometimes going back to redesign items of equipment notwithstanding the financial loss. He noted the adverse reaction upon the stability of the corporation’s business from Mr Cittadini’s conviction. Keith Sherwood, another businessman but a competitor in providing equipment for the heavy clay industry since 1978, had in fact before that worked for Mr Cittadini’s father and had known Mr Cittadini since he was a child. He said that the reputation of the Cittadini companies in the industry was of the “highest level”, the work produced by the Applied Group was of the “highest quality” and Mr Cittadini was highly regarded for his business ethics. He was a lifetime sailor and had seen three boats manufactured by the Applied Group before the manufacture of Excalibur, and he thought that the other boats had been built, from his experience, to a “high standard”. 47 There were a large number of references from company directors, business colleagues and competitors (including those who gave oral evidence), family friends, former employees and contractors, clients and yachting colleagues and general associates. One could not do justice to the detail of all the referees opinions but to summarise, the evidence from the references establishes that Mr Cittadini is a devoted family man, who was also an energetic, hard working, ethical, businessman. The prisoner has always had concern for his employees and is well regarded by them. The delivery of defective equipment, as occurred in this case, was uncharacteristic of the standards generally applied by the Applied Group, particularly in respect of projects personally supervised and/or directed by the prisoner. I accept in his private life he has supported community organisations, particularly the Scout movement and has generally behaved as a responsible community and business citizen.48 Mr Cittadini is regarded as an honest man, to which his background attests, loyal to friends and family, honest and trustworthy. Within the industry in which Mr Cittadini’s business career has been concerned the brick making equipment industry. He has a reputation for competence, professionalism and ethical behaviour. In summary the evidence reveals that in his private and business capacities the prisoner is a man of excellent character. The offending conduct is uncharacteristic. It represents a lapse of his usual standards.49 With regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I am to have regard to the various matters identified as the “purposes of sentencing”. Clearly, where lives are lost as a consequence of the criminal conduct of an offender, issues including, denunciation, punishment, accountability as well as deterrence, both general and personal, will inevitably arise for consideration. These various matters reflected in statements of principle from cases such as Blacklidge, quoted by the Crown in his written submissions and cited by the learned Chief Justice in Forbes, have to be assessed for their weight upon the facts of the case. Whilst conceding that general deterrence arises, its significance will vary. This case is an example of where less weight may be given to general deterrence, given the circumstances, although general deterrence is still a relevant consideration. It is difficult to see how on can deter others from crimes of “omission” given the circumstances of this case. I note however that there will be classes of “industrial manslaughter”, or the killing of consumers by industrial processes, where general deterrence may loom very large indeed. In the light of the events since the commission of these events these offences, and the circumstances of the offences themselves, personal deterrence seems to be of little significance. The totality of the evidence does not suggest the prisoner needs to be deterred from committing further offences of this, or any other type. The prisoner of course must be made accountable for his responsibility as determined by the jury’s verdict. What denunciation would be appropriate is difficult to identify when the failings of the prisoner turn upon matters of supervision which, even if improved, may not have detected the defect in the keel. Clearly there must be punishment, given the consequences. I must promote his rehabilitation as well.50 In this matter the issue of the delay in the prosecution arises. I have not been provided with any evidence from the Crown to justify the delay in this matter, particularly between the referral by the Coroner until the filing of the bill in an ex-officio indictment. I am told in the Crown’s submissions there was a “lengthy police investigation” made more difficult by the fact that many of the witnesses or potential witnesses were in Victoria. There was a Coronial inquiry examining a wide range of issues. There was only one application for adjournment of the trial, and that must have arisen in October or November last year (thus any delay by reason of either one of the parties in this Court amounted to only three months). All this may explain a delay in the Coroners inquiry, but not other delays up until the bill was filed. The inquest did not conclude until over three years after the yacht sank. Without ascribing fault, it certainly cannot be said to be the fault of the prisoner, or his former co accused. I must confess to constant astonishment at the inordinate delays that occur after inquests, Commissions of Inquiry, Reports from ICAC and the PIC, before people are charged by ex officio indictment and brought, usually, before this Court. Certainly, in this matter, it is no fault of the accused and no fault of the victims. Everyone is the poorer for delay. When it is all said and done the most adversely affected (except where that person is responsible for the delay which is not the case here) is the accused whose “fate” has been left in a state of suspension for a period of time. It is to be remembered that he and Mr Presland were interviewed over 6 years before the trial commenced.51 In any event, the Crown acknowledges there was “some delay”. I accept the submission of the accused in this regard that there has been significant or substantial delay as identified through no fault of the prisoner. I accept that the prisoner has been in a state of suspense and anxiety since he became aware of the possibility that criminal charges may result, that in the meantime he had cooperated with the investigative process involved in the Coronial inquest. I note that he has been on bail and complied with his bail conditions, attending to the proceedings in Sydney from interstate frequently over an extended period of time. I note that the prisoner expected the trial to commence in October and again, through no fault of his, and of course no fault of the prosecution, the prosecution appealed the decision of the first trial judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal over an admissibility issue. The resultant delay not only causing added expense but ultimately leading to the trial being stood over to February of this year. Although the prisoner does not appear to require “rehabilitation”, the period since September 2002 has seen changes in the approach of his business to aspects relevant to the safety of users of his products. The delay is a mitigating factor, but not of the character or extent that was considered appropriate in R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517, 52 I have regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. There are no aggravating factors arising under s 21A(2) that I can identify or that have been identified in submissions (s.21A(2)(m) does not apply in its terms, noting the remarks of Hunt AJA earlier cited). The relevant mitigating factors arising under s 21A(3) are:  
     
      
      i. The offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
      
     
     
      
      ii. The prisoner does not have any record of previous convictions. 
      
     
     
      
      iii. The prisoner was at the relevant time a person of good character and has since this offence continued to be a person of good character, and 
      
     
     
      
      iv. He is unlikely to re-offend. 
      
     
     
      
      v. He has excellent prospects of rehabilitation. 
      
    53 I accept, as I have earlier indicated, the prisoner’s cooperation with the investigators by providing an interview to New South Wales police and cooperating with the Coronial inquest, giving evidence without taking an objection. At trial he made a number of admissions at the commencement of the trial, including as to the cause of the capsize of the yacht and his responsibility as a supervisor of the construction of the yacht.54 One matter arising from the submissions relating to purported “aggravating features” that requires comment is the submission that the prosecutor made that “the only reason, or motive, behind such offending was financial gain, as the evidence showed it cost more to put systems of supervision and quality control into place”. This submission was not pressed and there was no objective basis for even putting it. When the prisoner gave evidence the prosecutor did not put this matter to Mr Cittadini. In any event, issues of motive to some extent fall away given the basis upon which manslaughter by negligent omission arose on the facts of this case. 55 I further take into account that this litigation involving Victorians and concerning acts or omissions in Victoria has been played out in New South Wales. As I told the widow of Mr Heyes, I understand this has placed an added strain on everyone involved, victims and accused, financially and I would suspect emotionally, with the strain and trouble of constant travel. Of course, had the Victorian authorities exercised jurisdiction who knows what might have happened. There may not have been a trial, because one could see that reasonable minds may differ as to what the evidence was capable of establishing. For sentencing purposes, I note the expenses, beyond the usual vicissitudes of defending oneself, borne by the prisoner and this added strain. Further, the prisoner will spend this sentence in New South Wales some distance from Victoria in circumstances over which he had no control. This is a very different case from that of a foreign national or someone from interstate who deliberately comes to this State to commit a crime. Any hardships, beyond the usual, in such a case are not usually relevant, as many authorities from superior Courts make clear. This situation is different and I have taken that into account. 56 Another relevant matter is the effect upon the prisoner’s family of the prisoner’s incarceration as well as the stigma of conviction and sentence. This is not an “exceptional case” as discussed in Edwards (NSWCCA – 12 December 1996 – unreported), but the sentencing of the prisoner occurs at a time when his children are still at school emotionally and physically grounded within the family unit. Although there is wider family support, his immediate family loses its principal source of financial support.Conclusion57 In sentencing the prisoner I have had regard to s.5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I have determined, in the context of the maximum penalty that a term of imprisonment ought be imposed for each offence, some sentences partially accumulative upon others to reflect the ‘totality’ of the criminality exposed in the charges. The terms of imprisonment cannot be suspended because of the length and structure of them. In fixing the sentences, I have determined that the sentences for the partially accumulative sentences involve ‘special circumstances’, pursuant to s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 warranting an adjustment of the relevant non parole periods to varying degrees. Those special circumstances include, the accumulation of those sentences, the need for the prisoner to receive the assistance from Community Corrections to adjust to community living on release from custody, the need for an appropriate period of supervision to deal with post release issues. The prisoner, I am informed, is to be sentenced on the basis of the repealed s.44, also with regard to s.47 of the Act. Order58 Thus, in respect of the offences of manslaughter in Counts 1 & 2, the prisoner is convicted, sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the period of 2 years and 6 months on each count, to commence today and expire on 9 January 2012. In respect of each sentence I fix a non parole period of 1 year 6 months to expire on 9 January 2011. In respect of Counts 3 and 4 in the indictment the prisoner is sentenced to imprisonment for the period of 2 years 6 months, to commence on 10 January 2010, to expire on 9 July 2012. In respect of that sentence I fix a non-parole period of 1 year, to commence on 10 January 2010 and to expire on 9 January 2011. At the conclusion of the non-parole period I direct that the prisoner be released to parole, to be supervised by the New South Wales Parole Board, through Victorian Community Corrections.

   JUDGMENT – Application for Certificate pursuant to Costs in Criminal Cases Act 19671 Adrian John Presland (the applicant) seeks a Certificate pursuant to s 2 Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (“the Act”) in respect of his acquittal on four charges of manslaughter preferred by the Director of Public Prosecutions on 24 February 2009. The applicant was found ‘not guilty’ in respect of each count on 1 April 2009. The co-accused, Alexander Cittadini, was found ‘guilty’ in respect of each count the following day.The background2 The applicant was employed as a foreman/boilermaker at a business that was controlled by the co-accused and his family. That business, hereinafter, will be referred to as “Applied Engineering”. Mr Cittadini had contracted in April/May 2000 through a business vehicle called “Applied Alloy Yachts”, controlled by him and part of the Applied Engineering Group, to construct a yacht with a fellow member of the Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron, Mr Alan Saunders. When built it became known as “Excalibur”. It began sailing in early 2002. It was a ’50 ft’ yacht, to be part of a series to be called ""Extreme 50” yachts. Excalibur was constructed with a ‘fatal’ flaw in its keel. The keel had been cut horizontally on both sides of it and the cut welded back together, probably, in my view, to fit a retractable ram with a ‘piston’ attached designed to raise the keel when moored in shallow waters. The Crown case against the applicant was that he fabricated and “constructed” the keel and that he was the person that made the horizontal cut and welded it negligently. The Crown case, in summary, against Mr Cittadini was that he knew of the horizontal cut to the keel and permitted the cut and weld to be done, or, alternatively, he failed to provide an adequate system of supervision to prevent the cutting and welding occurring. 3 The keel comprised two sheets of ‘SAF 2205 – stainless steel’ that were cut, fabricated, rolled and ultimately welded together in a manner that is shown in a generally representative way in Exhibit 1 at the trial. The keel when completed had a compartment extending from the ‘top’ of the keel into its interior to a depth of approximately a metre between the gussets, or ribs, that helped stabilise the structure. Into this compartment the hydraulic ram was to fit, to be connected at the base of the compartment to a ‘clevis’ point or attachment, so that the keel could be raised. Mr Presland also constructed a ‘box’ on top of the keel above and around the ram compartment. The keel was constructed in the applicant’s work area forming part of one of two or three separate factory buildings and areas, each dedicated to different factory activities such as boiler making, fitting and turn and the like. The keel once completed was ultimately attached to the hull and the yacht completed but for rigging and other scantlings in an area separate from the applicant’s work area (see Exhibit D series).4 Excalibur after shake down sails on Port Phillip sailed to Sydney then sailed in a race to Southport. On 16 September 2006 it competed in “winter” races in the Whitsunday Islands. It was returning to its home ‘base’ at Melbourne when it sank off the New South Wales coast approximately 20 miles east of Seal Rocks. Six crewmembers were on board. Four of them died by drowning. Only one body was recovered. The cause of the capsize was that the keel “broke in half” under the pressure of the conditions, with the bottom half of the keel breaking away along the line of the horizontal cut and the welding line, first on the starboard side (after extensive fatigue cracking over weeks or months), then the port side line broke away within minutes. When the yacht was recovered after capsize, a stump of the keel was still intact and about 60 percent of the ram piston. Hence, four charges of manslaughter by reason of criminal negligence were brought against the two accused for their role in the construction of the keel or (in the case of Mr Cittadini) for permitting the yacht to be delivered with this serious defect. Relevant Legislation and Principles to be applied5 The Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 1967 relevantly provides: 
     
      
      “s.2 The Court or Judge ….. in any proceedings relating to an offence … punishable … upon indictment may - 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted … as to the information then under inquiry ….. grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in  
        s.3 
         relating to those proceedings. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      s.3 (1) a certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court …… granting the certificate –  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances”. 
        
       
      
    6 The relevant provisions of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act have been considered in a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. An important judgment concerned with their interpretation relevant to this matter is the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1991) 24 NSWLR 550. In that matter the Court held: 
     
      
      “… (T)he task of court or judge, justice or justices in specifying their opinion is indeed to ask a hypothetical question, (as set out in s.3(1)(a)). But that question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial, during the trial or afterwards, admitted under s.3A of the Act. All of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision maker.  
      The decision maker must then ask whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have reasonable to institute the proceedings 
      ” (559G-560B) – emphasis added. 
      
    7 In Mordaunt v DPP [2007] NSWCA 121, McColl JA gave a succinct but detailed summary of the principles to be applied from the decided cases in relation to applications for a Certificate under the Act. These are set out at [36] of her judgment and the relevant matters to this application she identified may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
      i. The  
      Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
       is reforming legislation with a beneficial purpose designed to confer valuable privileges upon persons who succeed in criminal prosecutions; its provisions should not be narrowly construed so as to defeat the achievement of its general purposes. 
      
     
     
      
      ii. The “institution of proceedings” in s.3 refers to the time of arrest or charge not to some later stage such as committal for trial or the finding of a bill. 
      
     
     
      
      iii. The applicant for a s.2 certificate bears the onus of showing it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings. It is not for the Crown to establish, or the Court to conclude, that institution of proceedings was, or ought to have been, reasonable in the circumstances. 
      
     
     
      
      iv. The task of the Court dealing with an application under the Act is to ask the hypothetical question: “if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted, would it not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings?” 
      
     
     
      
      v. The judicial officer considering the application must find what were “all the relevant facts” and assume the prosecution to have been “in possession of evidence of” all of them and must then determine whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of those facts before the proceedings were instituted “it would not have been reasonable to institute (the proceedings)” – an applicant for the Certificate must succeed on both the “ 
      facts issue 
      ” and the “ 
      reasonableness issue 
      ”. 
      
     
     
      
      vi. The hypothetical question is addressed to the evidence of all the relevant facts whether discovered before arrest or at any other time, including after the trial, if admitted under s.3A of the Act. All of those facts must be considered. The relevant facts are concerned with the threshold question posed by s.3(1)(a); other facts will also be relevant and admissible going amongst other things to the question posed by s.3(1)(b) and to the ultimate question whether, assuming that the Court is of the opinion required to be specified, it should exercise its discretion under s.2 (of the Act). 
      
     
     
      
      vii. Courts should not attempt to prescribe an exhaustive test of what constitutes “unreasonableness” for the institution of the proceedings, but the matters that are set out in subparagraphs (h)-(n) of [36] of  
      Mordaunt 
       are germane (set out in (viii)-(xi) below in part). 
      
     
     
      
      viii. The reasonableness of a decision to institute proceedings is not based upon the test that prosecution or agencies throughout Australia use for the discretionary test for continuing to prosecute, namely whether there is any reasonable prospect of conviction …. the test cannot be a test of reasonable suspicion which might justify an arrest and it cannot be the test which determines whether the prosecution is malicious. 
      
     
     
      
      ix. The fact a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a prima facie case does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution; there may be cases where there is contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of the evidence. 
      
     
     
      
      x. The fact that a Court concluded the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessarily indicative of unreasonableness, neither is the entering of a judgment of acquittal. 
      
     
     
      
      xi. S.3 of the Act calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence … matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially in the realm of the ultimate fact finder. If the question for a jury depended upon “word against word” in the majority of such cases it would be quite reasonable for the prosecution to allow those matters to be decided by the jury. It would be different where the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit. 
      
     
     
      
      xii. It is relevant to have regard both to the information in the possession of the prosecuting authorities and the conduct of the defendant, given the adversarial nature of a criminal prosecution. 
      
     
     
      
      xiii. S.3(1)(b) recognises tactical considerations are legitimate in the defence of criminal charges.  
      
     
     
      
      xiv The judge must form the relevant opinions and also exercise the residual discretion contemplated by s.2 to grant a certificate. 
      
    8 In Regina v Bernard Lawrence Johnston [2000] NSWCCA 197, the majority of the Court rejected the argument that the relevant discretion to grant a certificate (or not grant a certificate as the case may be) was that it was proper to prosecute because “it is necessary that justice be seen to be done”. Her Honour Justice Simpson, stated: 
     
      
      “I would …..expressly reject the argument by the Crown that a relevant consideration in the evaluative process and the exercise of the discretion is that “it is necessary that justice seem to be done”. The perception that justice is done is not advanced by the unreasonable institution of criminal prosecutions nor those based on evidence known to be inadequate to sustain a conviction” [19]. (Also see [16]). 
      
    Course of the Proceedings9 Before the trial commenced there was a coronial inquest held in 2005. The matter was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and on 14 December 2007 the learned Director filed an indictment alleging four offences of manslaughter against Mr Presland and Mr Cittadini. The trial of the two accused commenced on 23 February 2009, with the acquittal of the applicant in early April, which provides jurisdiction for this application to be made.10 On acquittal the Court was advised of Mr Presland’s intention to make application for a certificate under the Act. That application was heard on 22 May 2009. Both parties provided written submissions, with the applicant filing an affidavit from his solicitor, part of which was objected to by the prosecution and rejected. The details of the rulings I made on admissibility of parts of that affidavit I need not dwell upon for the purposes of determining this application. I have had regard to the evidence at trial and the limited additional evidence on the application from the applicant (s 3A(1)(b) of the Act). There is no further evidence from the respondent. The evidence from the affidavit of the solicitor I have taken into account are paragraphs 1-3, 27-30 inclusive, although the determination of this application primarily proceeds on the basis of the evidence at trial.Submissions of the Parties11 The applicant submits, in the context of the character of the Crown case against him (para 8-9 – applicant’s submissions), that given it was an entirely circumstantial evidence case to prove Mr Presland’s guilt, it was essential for the prosecution to exclude the reasonable possibility that someone else, other than the applicant, was responsible for the horizontal cutting of the keel and the re-welding of it. Having regard to the relevant legal tests, and “all the relevant evidence”, it is submitted that the evidence inconsistent with guilt was “overwhelmingly strong” and that the prosecution had not reasonably instituted the proceedings. 12 Matters identified as showing the “inevitability” of acquittal, in the context of the case conducted by the prosecution, included evidence at trial that: 
     
      
      i. other persons had opportunity to cut the keel and re-weld it, 
      
     
     
      
      ii. evidence at trial established the applicant’s standards as a tradesman were inconsistent with the level of craftsmanship particularly in the re-welding of the keel, 
      
     
     
      
      iii. there were other persons employed by “Applied Engineering” who were not good welders, 
      
     
     
      
      iv. there was a reasonable possibility that different welders were responsible for different quality of welds, 
      
     
     
      
      v. there was evidence to show that the applicant had no connection with work involved in fitting the hydraulic “ram”, one reason advanced at the trial for making the horizontal cut, 
      
     
     
      
      vi. no rational or plausible reason was ever advanced for Mr Presland to have made the horizontal cut, 
      
     
     
      
      vii. there was evidence that, given the time it would have taken to make the horizontal cut and re-weld it, this could have been done without the applicant knowing that it had occurred and the polishing of the weld and the like covered up the horizontal cut to the point that nobody noticed it, 
      
     
     
      
      viii. the applicant always denied being responsible for the horizontal weld, 
      
     
     
      
      ix. the applicant’s good character was inconsistent with guilt and supported his credibility in his denial. 
      
    13 It is submitted for the applicant that not only was it impossible for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that the accused was responsible for the horizontal cut and weld, but that “no inference was capable of being drawn beyond reasonable doubt” that it was Mr Presland who carried out the relevant horizontal cut and re-welding. Furthermore, no act or omission of the applicant contributed to the institutional continuation of the proceedings. It was agreed by the applicant that whilst the inference of innocence was not the only inference available, it was an inference that the prosecution had failed to negative.14 The respondent in its submissions concedes that the applicant was not responsible for any act or omission that contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings that was not reasonable.15 In its submissions the respondent states that the inference of the applicant’s involvement in the “cut and weld” was a matter to be considered in the context of all the evidence, including that the applicant had disputed before the trial that the construction had been completed before the horizontal cuts and re-welds had been carried out but changed his position in the course of the trial. The respondent did not concede that the prosecution was always going to be incapable of proving what it was required to be proved. It submitted that the ultimate issues for determination were exclusively in province of the jury and that in the circumstances where the matters for determination were “quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder”, there was no unreasonableness in instituting the proceedings (R v Manley (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 (at 206)).16 Furthermore, the Crown submits that there was “nothing in the evidence that establishes that someone other than the applicant” was responsible for the horizontal cut and re-weld. The respondent submits that the issue of what inferences were to be drawn was a matter for the jury hearing all the evidence not a situation where there was only one inference available adverse to the prosecution. The prosecutor conceded in his oral submissions that the inference of innocence does not have to be ‘overwhelmingly strong’ for a certificate to issue, but because there were reasonably competing inferences or hypothesis this was exclusively for the jury.17 In these circumstances where there was a prima facie case and where the evidence fell “far short” of proving that the applicant did not carry out the contentious cutting and re-welding there was nothing that supported the proposition that it was not reasonable for the respondent to have instituted the proceedings. The issues relating to his good character and competence did not militate in favour of the applicant’s contentions.18 It is submitted by the Respondent that not only was it reasonable to have instituted proceedings but failing to do so would have “invoked a real sense of disquiet in the community”. Other parts of the written submissions were concerned with objections to evidence which have been dealt with and need not be discussed here.Consideration19 The Crown case to prove the ‘guilt’ of the accused (as opposed to proving that he fabricated and constructed the keel, which he admitted) was, ultimately, entirely circumstantial. Of course, as is well known, a circumstantial evidence case can be as compelling, if not more so, than a case dependent upon direct evidence inculpating the relevant accused. 20 In order to prove the guilt of the accused, the prosecution sought to establish that Mr Presland was the person who relevantly cut and welded together the keel. It relied upon proof of the fact, uncontested, that the keel ought not be cut (it had the potential to weaken the structure of the keel) but also that the welding was of poor workmanship and incomplete. The combination of the cutting of the keel and the welding was grossly negligent such as to establish the crime of manslaughter in respect of the each of the resultant deaths. These issues were not generally disputed. There was some evidence that if ‘properly’ welded with adequate preparation and ‘full penetration’ welds, the keel’s skins, theoretically at least, should be as strong as if not cut. If properly welded however, there probably would not have been any trial. The “starboard weld” of the horizontal cut was on average only to 45 percent of penetration, the port side weld was more complete, but both welds had poor preparation.21 The keel was designed to be a retractable keel, that is a keel that could be raised within the yacht’s hull cavity. The construction of the keel required the joining of two sheets, or “skins”, of SAF steel 8 mm thick, these skins being bent, or rolled, to provide an aerofoil shape, welded together at the rear and each welded to a leading edge tube (or pipe), referred to in the trial as “the leading edge”, presumably to make the keel water-tight and/or ‘aerodynamically’ functional. From the top of the keel into the interior of the keel space between the two skins a ram compartment was constructed into which was to fit the hydraulic ram which would lift the keel upwards or downwards to facilitate the mooring of the yacht in shallow waters. The main experts who gave evidence, Mr Gray and Associate Professor Yeomans, generally agreed that, putting aside the timing of the horizontal cut to the keel, Exhibit 1 is a reasonable diagrammatical representation of the steps in the construction of the keel. These experts were reasonable, pragmatic undogmatic witnesses and ultimately they were generally in agreement. Mr Gray in the prosecution case made many concessions that supported Mr Presland’s case. Exhibits J and K, various photographs taken from Mr Gray the prosecution’s lead metallurgist, fairly show the detail of welding work associated with horizontal cut to the keel and in other parts of the keel, including the respective “cover plates”, that were placed on the starboard side of the keel to enable access to the ram compartment I presume to help fit the hydraulic ram to the bottom of the ram compartment or inspect the keel internally.22 The key to the prosecution case in summary was that Mr Presland built the keel fin (constructed separately to the hull), but not the bulb at the end that provided ballast weight, that the cutting of the keel and the welding occurred before the completion of the construction of the keel, including the attachment of tube (or pipe) at the leading edge of the keel and a ‘box’ on top (still seen on the keel stump produced at trial), and that, in these circumstances, only the applicant would have been responsible for the cut and welding back together of the separated pieces of keel skins. There was no evidence of anyone else working on the keel fins, except Mr Harris a boilermaker/welder who helped out. There was however no evidence that the accused was observed cutting the keel and welding it as alleged. It was agreed at trial that the horizontal cut occurred after the first cover plate for the ram compartment placed on one upper side of the keel had been made by Mr Presland, but before a second, or replacement, ram cover plate, apparently bigger than the first, was cut and had been welded into place. It did not matter, on one view, for the purposes of proof of guilt, as to what was the reason for the horizontal cut and welding. On the other hand, as the evidence suggested that the fitting of the hydraulic ram had nothing to do with the applicant, the Crown case was stronger if another reason could be established or pointed to in the evidence. There were three or four possibilities identified as reasons for cutting the keel in the view of Mr Gray, the prosecution’s lead expert on metallurgy issues. These included, an inference that the cutting and the welding was to accommodate the aerofoil shape of the keel, to overcome shrinkage from welding the skins and gussets or ribs, to bend the sheets down to be welded together or, to enable the ram “compartment” to be expanded or adjusted to house the hydraulic ram to be fitted or inserted. 23 Mr Presland, at an early stage of the investigation, was interviewed in Victoria by New South Wales Police in January 2003 and admitted to building the keel. At that time it would appear the investigators had information from an expert metallurgist about some aspects of the keel’s construction. I understood the complete opinions of Mr Gray, or any other expert, were not available. Certainly they were not disclosed to Mr Presland in the questions he was asked. He suggested in this interview that the keel had been cut and welded after the completion of the keel by him, which included the welding of various ribs to enable the two sheets of the keel, or skins, to be connected, the making of the aerofoil shape, the construction of the ‘box’ on top and the placing of the ‘tube’ or pipe at the leading edge. He did not mention any cuts to the keel fins, just the probability of bending them. The expert evidence, produced by the Crown at trial, was capable of establishing that the horizontal cut to the keel and the welding occurred before the leading edge tube had been attached, as there was no evidence of any grind marks, consistent with the cutting of the keel with a 9 inch grinding disc, upon the tube or in the vicinity of the welding of the tube to the skins or gussets. The accused produced evidence from a very highly qualified metallurgist (Assoc. Prof. Yeomans) who gave evidence at the trial that his examination permitted a possible conclusion that the cut to the keel occurred after the leading edge pipe was connected. But the significance of that opinion and any conflict in the evidence on this issue fell away as an issue for consideration as the real issues in the trial progressed. In any event the accused, in the context of his denials was not in a position to say when the cut occurred. It was such a significant alteration to the keel’s fabrication it was natural for him to assume at the time of interview it happened after the keel passed out of his hands. He was building the keel over a number of months from after July 2000 (when the SAF steel was delivered) until 2001. He had other jobs to do unrelated to the yacht.24 One of the significant features of the evidence in the case, putting aside for the moment the sworn denials of the accused concerning cutting the keel and then welding it back together, was that the welds that Mr Presland admitted to having done, such as the internal welding of the gussets used to join the skins together, welding along the lead edges with seal welding, the welding of the first cover plate, and the like, were of “good commercial quantity” and were satisfactory and adequate for the purposes of constructing a keel that would be “fit for purpose”. The evidence of the welding of the skins at the horizontal cut line together and the welding of the second cover plate, was universally agreed between the metallurgists to be not of good commercial quality, in fact of very poor quality. There was evidence of very poor welding in another area of the yacht, the rudder housing under the wheel for which there was no responsibility on the part of the applicant. Nor was there any suggestion to the applicant that he was responsible for that welding.25 A matter advanced by the prosecution to the jury in its closing address, was that the cutting of the keel at the heart of the Crown case was concerned with various aspects of the construction of the keel, and/or the fabrication of the fins, and that it did not have anything to do with the fitting of the hydraulic ram, or the construction of the ram compartment, because the fitting of the ram occurred after the construction of the keel. The Crown suggested to the jury that one reason for cutting the keel was that the keel was bent or distorted in its shape by the effect of the welding which had taken place to attach the port side to the starboard side and/or to fit the various ribs or gussets comprising the internal structure. Alternatively, it was suggested the cutting of the keel was associated with shaping the fins. It was said that any distortions in the shape of the keel through its construction would not have been removed by the means claimed by the accused to have been used to give effect to the aerofoil shape, such as heating along the line of the keel approximate to where the horizontal cut was placed and the use of a device called a “porta power (sic)”. The prosecution’s contention in the closing address in this respect was different from its contention in its opening address that the cutting of the keel was related to the fitting of the hydraulic ram. This significant change in its case as to the reasons for the accused to cut its keel reflected, in my mind at the time, the disarray of the prosecution case on this issue of ‘motive’ or ‘reason’ to do the horizontal cuts given the evidence at trial which could reasonably have been anticipated by it. Evidence was available at trial from the applicant by production of invoices and delivery documents that the ram was ordered in August 2000 and delivered in September 2000, while the keel was still being constructed. Inadequacies in the size or shape of the ram compartment could have been identified weeks or even months before the applicant completed construction of the keel, while the keel was in the applicant’s work area. 26 One reasonable view is that the prosecution changed its ‘theory’ for the applicant’s conduct because it did not suit the way the evidence had unfolded. It reasonably ought to have been anticipated that the applicant was not concerned with fitting the ram into the ram compartment. In fact it appears the evidence available to the prosecution never suggested that the applicant had anything to do with fitting the ram. Further, the evidence at trial, at least, established and that the cutting and welding could have been done within the applicant’s work area and disguised without the applicant knowing it had occurred. The cutting and welding could be done in a day’s work or possibly slightly longer. Mr Presland obviously was not at the work site all the time, many other employees had access to the factory area and polishing of the steel obliterated the horizontal cuts and welding.27 It was also part of the Crown’s argument in closing and on this application that the accused had “changed his position” in his evidence at trial, from the account he gave when interviewed by police on or about 28 and 31 January 2003 in a couple of respects. The accused suggested to the investigating police then that no horizontal cuts could or were made before he finished his work on the keel. Further, he could not recall any cuts made by him in the area of the horizontal cuts to the fin. As to this latter aspect he recalled the heating process in general terms. He did not remember cutting the skins. Not only in the accused’s evidence at trial, but also beforehand during the prosecution case in cross-examination of particular Crown witnesses on the topic, such as Mr Harris and the metallurgist Mr Gray, it was suggested that minor nicks at the edges of the keel, at the forward and aft ends, were done by the applicant to deal with “creasing” which had occurred when the surface of the skins had been heated and pushed down to give effect to the rolled or curved shape of the keel profile. These matters were raised with Mr Gray on 2 March 2009, very early in the prosecution case, well before the applicant gave evidence. Related to this assertion was the accused’s account of heating the skins horizontally, forward to aft, to aid the bending process when applying ‘G’ clamps and the polishing or cleaning up that followed to remove the mark or line caused by the heating. Mr Harris’s recollection of events at trial supported the accused’s version of events, and the sequence of events, in which Mr Presland and Mr Harris were involved together in the construction of the keel, primarily between stages one and seven of the schematic drawings made by Mr Presland (Exhibit 1). The creasing effect at the edges requiring nicks to be made at the edges to clean up and smooth out those areas. Mr Gray and Associate Professor Yeomans, acknowledged the potential for creasing at the outer edge of the skins and the use of nicks, ‘dressing’ (or bashing down) them and welds on the area of the nicks to smooth them out. These creases and “nicks” could have been obliterated by the horizontal cut of the keel. 28 This purported “change” in the account given by Mr Presland was not a dramatic shift in his recollection. The circumstances of it are rationally and reasonably explained given the limited opportunity Mr Presland may have had to reflect upon the technical aspects of the construction of the keel at the time of the police interview in the absence of any real detail provided to him of the opinions available to the police from Mr Gray, or others, or the absence t the investigation at that time of the opinions of Mr Gray. The detail of what he was able to tell the police, in the absence of access to detailed information available to the police or available at trial, of what he did in the construction was neither surprising nor unusual in the circumstances. Such detail as he gave the police must be seen in the context of his adamant denial that he had not cut the keel or welded it back together as was suggested. Mr Gray was still preparing reports during the inquest in 2005. Certainly based on the questions asked of the applicant in January 2003, the full technical picture interpreting the sequence of the construction of the keel was not available, nor were all relevant findings disclosed to the applicant. Most importantly, these nicks, dressing down and welding were minor matters, every day occurrences for boilermakers. The applicant was being questioned about a major attach upon the integrity of the strength of the steel. This was not reasonably to be regarded as a deliberate change in his recollection.29 The other “change” suggested by the respondent particularly in its written submissions on this application was a concession by the applicant in evidence, not previously made when interviewed 6 years before that the cut and weld occurred before the attachment by him of the leading edge tube. This concession was merely a concession with an awareness of all the relevant information. As he claimed he had no knowledge of the cut and weld to the keel and as it could have been ‘concealed’ from him, or not apparent given other work done by the applicant such as polishing the heat line, it did not matter whether the applicant made the concession, or not, for him to be acquitted. Proving that the horizontal cut happened during the fabrication of the keel did not exclude the reasonable possibility that someone else did it. He denied at all times making the horizontal cuts and welds and the evidence which the prosecution could reasonably have anticipated demonstrated that he had good reason not to notice it whilst he continued his work.30 Although the Crown sought to suggest to the jury that Mr Presland had ‘suspiciously’ changed his account, this was not the only interpretation a fact finder might make of Mr Presland’s evidence. The jury would have appeared to have rejected this argument, but that is neither here or there. His assertion that in this particular case his memory had improved as more and more information was provided to him was entirely understandable, given the fact that the construction of the keel that took place over many weeks and the evidence revealed that it was a pick up, put down job where Mr Presland was as foreman responsible for supervising many other works or projects within the factory. The cutting and welding of the keel could have been done with a days work. The overwhelming weight of evidence was that the horizontal cuts and the welding, once polished up, would not have attracted any suspicion to Mr Presland or anybody else continuing to work on the construction of the keel, as would the replacement of the original cover plate constructed by Mr Presland. The facts were clear from the evidence at trial, within the prosecution’s own case, that when the keel finally left Mr Presland’s workshop once he had completed his tasks, including attaching the leading tube, if he had not undertaken the horizontal weld and welding and had not been told about it, he might reasonably have not been any the wiser that it had occurred. His and Mr Harris’ evidence of use of heat to bend the keel skins and polishing the markings, irrespective of whether the surface of the keel would be covered by other material, was supported as a reasonably correct step in the process of fabrication by Mr Gray for the prosecution. 31 As there was a reasonable explanation for him being unaware that the horizontal cut and welding had occurred in the context of his consistent denials, other matters which have been adverted to in the applicant’s submissions taken into account as well, lead to a conclusion that his acquittal was inevitable. This did not turn upon ‘word against word’. This other evidence underscored what was clear from the totality of the expert evidence and the maintained denials of wrongdoing by the accused and strengthened an inference or conclusion inconsistent with guilt. Some of these matters have been referred to before in different contexts. They included:  
     
      
      (i) Unchallenged evidence that the welding that Mr Presland admitted to, or was otherwise proven to be his, was of a far superior quality to that of the person who welded the horizontal cuts to the keel. The evidence from the main experts, particularly Mr Gray and Associate Professor Yeomans, was to the effect that it was inferior welding which ordinarily one would not expect from a person of Mr Presland’s skill. Mr Gray agreed that welds admitted by Mr Presland on the original cover plate were possibly not made by the same person(s) who did the poor welds on the second cover plate which remained when the yacht was inspected after capsize. 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) Given the time taken for the construction of the keel to occur, the workforce and the layout of the factory, there was ample opportunity for other persons or another person, to horizontally cut the keel and weld it back together in the absence of Mr Presland.  
      
     
     
      
      (iii) There was evidence that there were a large number of people who could weld but of whom most, not necessarily coincidentally, were of a less skilful standard than that consistently displayed by Mr Presland during his employment.  
      
     
     
      
      (iv) There was evidence that Mr Presland himself knew that to horizontally cut and weld the skins of the keel would cause a weakness to its structural integrity and that he would not do that, either of his own motion and/or without consulting someone superior to him such as Mr Cittadini.  
      
     
     
      
      (v) He had no reason to horizontally cut and weld the keel skins back together. 
      
    32 As the evidence in the joint trial unfolded, it is open to finding that the Crown failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Cittadini himself was aware of the horizontal cut and welding, or that the Crown had not proven that he directed it, or approved it. In fact the evidence pointed the other way. 33 For the purposes of the ultimate conclusion as to whether I should order the issue of a certificate under the Act, I am setting aside two matters, one at least raised by the applicant as militating in favour of the grant of a certificate. Firstly, Mr Presland was a very impressive witness who was unshaken by the Crown. This matter goes to credibility, properly a matter for the jury. Secondly, the accused was a man with no prior criminal convictions who produced positive evidence of good character in addition to meticulous workmanship throughout the Crown case. His letter of resignation, tendered in evidence at trial, in its terms and effect was powerful evidence of his protestations of innocence to a person who, on one view of how the prosecution ran its case, was concerned to suppress the truth. It was clearly prepared without regard for any future litigation. The prosecution opposed its tender for reasons that were not clear. This evidence was relevant to the issue of credibility of the accused’s denials and the likelihood of guilt. The evidence of general good character, as opposed to workmanship and professional responsibility relevant to facts in issue, I need not consider.34 Reference was made by the respondent to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Manley v Regina [2000] NSWCCA 196, to which I referred when I summarised the prosecution’s submissions. It should be noted that Wood CJ at CL, as part of the majority and approving the observations of Simpson J, rejected a contention put by the prosecution in that appeal that,  
     
      
      “In determining whether it was or was not reasonable for the DPP to institute the proceedings, it was proper to take into account matters of public policy such as the necessity to ensure that justice is seen to be done in serious cases of criminality etc”.  
      
    35 He was of the view that  
     
      
      “such considerations are irrelevant to the evaluation, by the hypothetical prosecutor, of the evidence, the knowledge of which is imputed to the prosecution.” [17]  
      
    36 He noted that the independence of the Director’s office is not threatened by a construction of the provision which directs attention to the evidence of the relevant facts in an individual case. 37 He said:  
     
      
      “It would be unacceptable to impose some qualification upon the section designed to encourage prosecutions in order to satisfy some ill defined community interest in bring a particular accused, or kind of matter before the courts. Indeed, to do so may only serve to threaten the independence of the DPP” [18]. 
      
    38 Here the Crown suggested that not to prosecute Mr Presland would have caused “disquiet in the community”. Given the Allerton test of what material the prosecution must consider there would be no reasonable basis for such claimed disquiet in the minds of a fully informed “community”. Neither the prosecution or the Courts should pander to the whims of the ill informed or those who have no interest in justice being seen to be done.39 Of course Manley was a case where an accused was found guilty by a jury, but acquitted by a Court of Criminal Appeal on the same evidence, because the verdict was plainly “unjust and unreasonable”. Sully J (in minority) approved what Blanch J had held in McFarlane (12 August 1995 (unreported)) that it may be unreasonable to have prosecuted the accused because the evidence favouring him was “overwhelmingly strong”. The majority agreed with Blanch J that in such circumstances “it would be open to find that it had been unreasonable to prosecute”, noting however that the Court did not suggest that a certificate will be granted to a successful accused only where the evidence favouring him is “overwhelmingly strong” [42]. Simpson J likewise did not believe that the need for “justice to be seen to be done” was a relevant consideration, or one of any weight. 40 In analysing the Crown case in Manley, Simpson J was of the view that the conflicts in the testimony amongst the expert witnesses that the Crown itself had called, led to a conclusion that no verdict of guilty was reasonable and that, also, taking into account evidence available to the defence, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings [77]. Although Manley is a very different case from this case for determining whether a certificate ought be issued, the conclusion must ultimately be the same in this matter, as in that case. The submission of the prosecution about supposed “community disquiet” by not prosecuting can also be seen to be rejected by the observations of Simpson J in Johnston, earlier quoted. 41 Looking at the matter from the perspective of the prosecutor’s submissions concerning cases of competing inferences available from the evidence, the fact that there were reasonable competing inferences as to whether the accused was guilty required some judgment by the prosecution as to whether it was “reasonable to institute the proceedings” as that expression is understood in the authorities. It was not “reasonable” that the matter could be just “left for the jury”, particularly where, as a matter of logic, left with a reasonable hypothesis of innocence the jury would, if acting on instruction, inevitably acquit. There will be cases where there is “contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect the prosecutor to make some evaluation of the evidence”. This was such a case. 42 The course of the trial from the applicant’s perspective and approach was largely plotted in Mr Gray SC’s opening address on behalf of the applicant immediately after the prosecutors opening. Having correctly characterised, in essence, what the Crown case was in relation to Mr Presland (see transcript p118 l.20 ff), he then set out in summary what he anticipated would emerge from the evidence (in the prosecution’s case as it turned out) identifying 8 points or issues (see p 118 l.35 – p1201.9) relevant to how the supposed logic of the Crown case fell down. That the matters Senior Counsel anticipated at the beginning of the trial unfolded (putting aside other technical or expert evidence in the trial that was capable of militating in favour of acquittal) underscores what might reasonably have been anticipated by he prosecution to put findings of guilt against Mr Presland beyond reach. 43 One other aspect of the respondent’s submissions given on 22 May was the contention that no evidence emerged at the trial as to who did cut and weld the keel. It is reasonable for the prosecution to assume that the accused bears no onus, he is presumed to be innocent. The accused had maintained that he was innocent and did not know how the cut occurred. He could not know on that version who did it. It is not to point in this matter that the evidence did not identify another person who did the cut and the welding. This proceeding was a criminal trial, not an inquisition. If there was such evidence that would be an additional reason for the applicant to the acquitted. But is not decisive or even persuasive in the circumstances of this application.44 In the context of the state of the matter after Mr Presland was interviewed by police in 2003, given his admission that he constructed the keel, there may have been a basis for a “reasonable suspicion” justifying his prosecution on the basis of his admissions and in conjunction with other evidence. There may have been even a belief by individuals considering the matter that there was a “reasonable prospect of conviction” with that admission and other evidence relating to the cause of the capsize. However, despite the matters relied upon for that possible reasonable suspicion, the prosecutor would have had to also consider Mr Presland’s straightforward denials and the other aspects of the matter inconsistent with guilt that might reasonably have been anticipated, as exemplified by the opening address of Senior Counsel for the applicant. As the matter advanced during trial with evidence of Mr Presland’s skills and responsibilities, the operation of the factory, the process of manufacture, the relevant date of delivery of the hydraulic ram to the construction of the keel and other matters, the reasonableness of the institution of the prosecution of Mr Presland receded. 45 I am mindful of course that an application for a verdict by direction was refused at the end of the prosecution case. Here, as the judgment I gave on this application makes clear (R v Presland [2009] NSWDC 71) I was compelled by higher authority not to direct an acquittal. Of course, a prima facie case established, does not mean that it is reasonable to launch a prosecution, as the authorities make clear. An application for a “Prasad” direction to the jury was not sought. It may be said that at the end of the Crown case it was not practical for it to be given, without a “mini summing up” which the authorities on such matters do not encourage. A “Prasad” direction also denies the prosecution an opportunity to put its case in summary to the jury. Here, of course, another complication may have been that if a “Prasad” direction was given in respect of Mr Presland, there would have been inevitable unfairness to Mr Cittadini for whom, in any event, this joint trial did not kindly treat, given the fact that Mr Presland raised his good character and Mr Cittadini (who as it turned out had no prior criminal convictions) did not, Mr Presland gave evidence and Mr Cittadini did not. Conclusion46 For the reasons above I have come to the conclusion that it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings against the applicant because, had all the relevant facts been available to the prosecution, they pointed away from Mr Presland as the person responsible for the horizontal cut and the welding, or, at least, contradicted that conclusion and left his acquittal as inevitable. 47 Further, having formed the opinion that it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings and noting no act or omission of the applicant contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings I have also concluded that, taking into account all that has been put by the respondent and the applicant, I should not exercise the residual discretion of the Court not to issue a certificate. No good reason for that has been identified.Order48 As I am of the opinions required pursuant to s.3(1) (a) and (b) of the Act it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion pursuant to s.2 of the Act to order a certificate to the applicant, the Court orders the issue of a certificate to the applicant, Adrian John Presland.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court by his Honour Judge Solomon on 7 December 2007 after he entered a plea of guilty on 9 October 2007 to breaking into a private house at Middle Cove on 6 July 2006 and stealing property valued at $40,000. The charge was laid pursuant to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It attracts a maximum penalty of 14 years. The applicant was arrested on 31 January 2007 on the basis of a match between his DNA and blood deposited at the premises. 2 His Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 1 month dating from 7 December 2007 with a balance of term of 2 years and 2 months.3 The challenge to the sentence is that it is manifestly excessive in light of his Honour’s finding that the offence was below the mid-range of objective seriousness. Support for that submission is said to derive from the Judicial Information Research System (JIRS) statistics which reveal that in only nine per cent of sentences for offending against s 112(1) which attracted full-time custody was a non-parole period imposed greater than 2 years and 1 month and only three per cent of sentences attracted a total term of imprisonment greater than or equal to 4 years and 3 months. 4 The applicant’s counsel frankly conceded that the statistics are a “blunt tool” consistent with this Court having repeatedly cautioned against the utility of referring to the JIRS statistics in assessing the appropriateness of a sentence under review. As Rothman J emphasised in Robertson v R [2007] NSWCCA 270; 177 A Crim R 121 the principal signposts for sentence are the maximum sentence provided for by the Parliament and the general principles of sentencing that apply in the sentencing exercise. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “…The use of statistics as a measure of the appropriateness of the sentence has the effect of creating a self-fulfilling range of sentences, which may bear little relationship to the maximum sentence imposed by the legislature.” 
        
       
      
    5 The Crown submitted, correctly in my view, that the inherent limitation on the utility of the statistics is most pronounced in relation to offences which involve a potentially diverse range of criminal conduct as is the case with an offence under s 112(1). In addition, it is self-evident that the greater number of factors specific to an offender, the smaller the statistical base from which might be identified a range of penalties. That is exemplified in the applicant’s case. There were only four offenders within the applicant’s age range who were also sentenced for a single count following a plea of guilty accompanied by a record of previous conviction of the same type.6 Whilst it is true that only one per cent of the statistical base of 854 cases attracted a sentence of 7 years, signifying that none of the offences were appropriate to be described as worst case given the statutory maximum of 14 years, the fact that 60 cases attracted a total term of 5 years does no more than establish that in commencing to calculate the applicant’s sentence at 5 years, his Honour determined that it was a term of imprisonment commensurate with his assessment of offending below the mid-range, despite the fact that it might be said to be at the upper end of that range.7 The starting point of 5 years prior to the discount for the plea of guilty must also be viewed as fairly reflecting the interplay of two features of aggravation as provided for in s 21A(2)(d) and s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”). The first concerned the applicant’s record of previous convictions, including an offence of break enter and steal in 2004 for which a term of imprisonment was imposed in the Local Court but which was suspended following an appeal to the District Court. His Honour also noted a spread of offences of stealing and receiving stolen property over a ten year period commencing in 1990. I note that the applicant was 35 years of age as at the date of sentence. It is not submitted that his Honour took account of the applicant’s prior conviction inconsistent with the approach dictated by this Court in R v McNaughton [2006] nswcca 242; 163 A Crim R 381. 8 In addition, his Honour was also satisfied as provided for in s 21A(2)(g) of the Act, that the loss and damage occasioned by the offence was substantial, by inference at least, not simply by reference to the monetary value of the property stolen but also because personal items of no monetary value but of significant personal value were also taken. His Honour needed to be satisfied that the value of property stolen was substantial beyond reasonable doubt before taking it into account as a feature of aggravation. There is no challenge to that finding. 9 In determining an appropriate sentence his Honour was obliged to have regard to matters mitigating the objective seriousness of the offending as provided for in s 21A(3) of the Act. His Honour did this by applying a discount of 15 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty which included a positive finding that this reflected genuine contrition. In circumstances where the plea of guilty was entered the day before the date listed for trial this was a generous finding as was his Honour’s finding that special circumstances were made out justifying disturbing the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total term as provided for in s 44 of the Act. His Honour found special circumstances on the basis that there was a demonstrated need for ongoing institutional support with a view to the applicant’s rehabilitation upon his release. In light of a positive urinalysis result on 6 December 2007 (the day before the applicant was arrested) to the presence of prohibited and prescription drugs whilst the applicant was subject to supervision following sentence being imposed in the Local Court in August 2006 - a matter which his Honour correctly described as not assisting the offender - the finding of special circumstances may also be regarded as a generous finding in the applicant’s favour.10 In passing sentence his Honour was concerned to ensure that the sentencing order reflected not only the need for general deterrence but, given the applicant’s particular circumstances, the need for a degree of individual deterrence. 11 In my view the sentence comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 1 month equating to less than 50 per cent of the total term was within the bounds of his Honour’s sentencing discretion and does not otherwise reveal manifest error warranting the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    12 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
      2. The appeal be dismissed. 
       
      
    13 HODGSON JA: I agree. 
     
      
    14 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     
      
    15 HODGSON JA: Those are the orders of the Court.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 12 June 2009 Bennett DCJ, pursuant to s 20 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, granted leave to the Crown to amend the indictment in proceedings brought against the applicant, so as to include counts 1 through 12 as proposed in a form of indictment presented in the Crown's application.  
     
      
    2 The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that decision pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    3 The charges against the applicant originate from events in 2006. On 31 August 2006 the applicant arrived from overseas at Sydney International Airport with a Sharpe laptop and a portable video recorder. These items were seized by customs for examination.  
     
      
    4 On 5 September 2006 the applicant was charged with a single offence falling under the general description of ""importing child pornography,"" this being based on material found on the laptop. This charge was one under s 233 BAB of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).  
     
      
    5 A report dated 18 December 2006, prepared by a forensics expert Mr Buller, was served on the applicant; and among other things it included an annexure with 130 pages of emails from the computer commencing in 1999, including emails purportedly sent by a person named John Cutter. These included four emails in March 2000, which later became the basis of counts 8 to 11 in the form of indictment.  
     
      
    6 There was a committal hearing in August 2007, and the applicant was committed for trial to take place on 26 November 2007.  
     
      
    7 On 2 November 2007 the Crown served the applicant's then solicitors with a tendency notice, referring to the John Cutter emails.  
     
      
    8 On 28 November 2007 the applicant entered a plea of guilty, but on 17 April 2008 he applied successfully to withdraw this plea. A trial was then listed for 3 November 2008. The Crown sought to vacate that date because of the unavailability through illness of Mr Buller. That date was vacated and a new trial date given, namely 23 February 2009.  
     
      
    9 On 12 November 2008, the Crown was given leave to file a fresh indictment with 4 counts, being 3 separate counts of importing child pornography and one count of importing child abuse material, which dealt separately with different categories of material found on the laptop. The Crown was ordered to serve the evidence on which it relied by 12 December 2008.  
     
      
    10 An expert report by a new expert Mr Daniels was served on that date, but further reports by Mr Daniels were served on 14 January 2009 and 25 February 2009. The trial date was vacated and a new date was fixed for the trial, namely 20 July 2009.  
     
      
    11 On 4 March 2009, when the trial date was fixed, the Crown Prosecutor answered a question from the judge as to whether there was any prospect of fresh material by saying ""In the way of evidence no""; but he said there would be graphs, charts etc. It appears that on that occasion a timetable was set by which that additional material would be notified to the defence by 26 June.  
     
      
    12 The subject application to amend the indictment was served on 23 March 2009 and heard on 1 June 2009. The proposed indictment included 3 additional counts similar to the previous 4 counts based on material in the video recorder. It also included 4 counts of an offence that can be described as encouraging child sex tourism, under s 50 DB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), and also one count of using the internet service to access child pornography, this being an offence under s 474.19 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).  
     
      
    13 The statutory provisions having some relevance to the Crown's application and to the application before this Court, are ss 20 and 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        20 Amendment of indictment 
         
        (1) An indictment may not be amended after it is presented, except by the prosecutor: 
         
         (a) with the leave of the court, or 
          
         (b) with the consent of the accused. 
         
        (2) This section does not affect the powers of the court under section 21. 
         
        (3) For the purposes of this section, an amendment of an indictment includes the substitution of an indictment.  
         
         
        21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial 
         
        (1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case. 
         
        (2) If of the opinion: 
         
         (a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or 
          
         (b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment, 
          
          the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment. 
          
         
        (3) If of the opinion that the postponement of an accused person’s trial is expedient as a consequence of it having amended an indictment or ordered a separate trial of a count, the court may make such order as appears necessary. 
         
        (4) An order under this section may be made either before trial or at any stage during the trial. 
         
        (5) The following provisions apply if an order is made under this section for a separate trial or for the postponement of a trial: 
         
         (a) if the order is made during the trial, the court may order that the jury be discharged from giving a verdict: 
          
           
           (i) on the count or counts in respect of which the trial is postponed, or 
            
           (ii) on the indictment, 
            
           as the case may be, 
           
          
         (b) the procedure on the separate trial of a count, and the procedure on the postponed trial, are to be the same in all respects (if the jury has been discharged) as if the trial had not commenced, 
          
         (c) subject to the Bail Act 1978, the court may commit the accused person to a correctional centre. 
         
        (6) Any power of the court under this section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes. 
        
       
      
    14 The primary judge noted arguments for the applicant to the effect that it would be unfair to permit the Crown to proceed on the proposed indictment, because of the Crown's delay in bringing the additional counts, the Crown's delay and breaches of directions in serving evidentiary material, the lack of adequate explanation for these delays, and the prejudice to the applicant in the preparation of the case.  
     
      
    15 The primary judge also noted an argument to the effect that counts 8 to 11 should not be included because of the distinctly different timeframe, and because the offences were of an entirely different nature.  
     
      
    16 In relation to the latter argument, the primary judge asserted that s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act was not relevant to the present application although, in the light of the arguments developed, it was possible that an application relying on that provision might be pursued before the trial judge. On that basis and having considered the other elements of unfairness and prejudice raised by the applicant, the primary judge considered that the application of the Crown should be granted.  
     
      
    17 On this application, Mr Bellanto QC for the applicant submitted that the primary judge was in error in the way he dealt with issues of the kind dealt with in s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act. He submitted that if the Crown was seeking leave to amend an indictment so as to include additional charges, the onus was on the Crown to negative issues of the kind raised by s 21(2). He submitted that the applicant could not have a fair trial in relation to the counts concerning the importation in August 2006 if the trial also concerned alleged events occurring in 2000. He submitted that although the events alleged in 2000 could possibly be relevant to the question of the applicant's knowledge of the contents of the computer in 2006, any probative value in relation to the 2006 charges would be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice within s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. He submitted that for that reason, it would be unfair to the applicant to have those counts concerning the events of 2000 included, because that would pre-empt the possibility of the 2000 material being excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    18 Mr Bellanto submitted that that error of the primary judge, coupled with the unfairness of allowing amendments so prejudicial to the applicant in the circumstances of delays and breaches of directions by the Crown, justified the intervention of this Court so as to at least exclude from the indictment counts 8 to 11. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion, it was incorrect for the primary judge not to address issues of the kind dealt with in s 21 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Act in resolving the Crown's application. In my opinion, where the Crown seeks leave to amend an indictment so as to bring about a position there where there will ordinarily be a single trial of a number of charges included in the amended indictment, the Crown does have an onus to prove that such a single trial would not unfairly prejudice or embarrass the accused and that it is not desirable that there be separate trials. For that reason, in my opinion, on that aspect of the matter there was error by the primary judge, which makes it appropriate for this Court to consider whether a single trial would unfairly prejudicial or embarrass the applicant and whether it is desirable that there be separate trials.  
     
      
    20 In my opinion, on the material presently before this Court, a single trial on all the proposed counts would not unfairly prejudice or embarrass the applicant; and it is not desirable that there be separate trials.  
     
      
    21 The applicant's defence is essentially that he did not know the material in question was on the laptop or the video recorder, and that he was not the author of the emails. In order to seek to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did have this knowledge and was the author of the emails, the Crown wishes to rely on a whole history of material entered on the laptop throughout the period from about 1999 to about 2006, including material added in intervening years. The Crown wishes to rely on that material in combination with other evidence to make out a circumstantial case, in relation to the 2006 charges, that the applicant knew of the relevant contents of the laptop, and in relation to the 2000 charges, that he was the author of the emails.  
     
      
    22 It may be that there are particular parts of particular emails in respect of which it might be said that the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value, and if so those parts could be excluded. But in my opinion, this is not the case in relation to the particular emails relied on for the 2000 counts. That view of course is reached merely on the material that is presently before the Court, and it is not a view intended in any way to bind the trial judge.  
     
      
    23 The four particular emails are thus part of the history to which I have referred, which cumulatively may be considered as having substantial probative value. If the trial judge considered that directions were necessary in relation to any possible prejudice, then such directions could be given.  
     
      
    24 One other reason why I have reached the view that I have is that the matters based on the 2000 emails are the more serious charges, so that the perhaps more pressing question is whether the 2006 material could be unfairly prejudicial in relation to the 2000 charges. When one considers the matter in the light of the overall history sought to be relied upon by the Crown, in my opinion, again on the material presently before this Court, it would not be unfairly prejudicial.  
     
      
    25 For those reasons, the error I have identified by the primary judge would not in my opinion affect the result. In respect of the other matters raised before the primary judge and dealt with by him, I do not think there was any error by the primary judge in relation to those discretionary matters. For those reasons I would propose that leave to appeal be refused.  
     
      
    26 One final matter is that we have been told that, despite what was foreshadowed by the Crown in March this year, that there has been further significant evidence served by the Crown on 26 June. I would express no view as to whether this would justify an adjournment of the trial which is presently fixed to commence this Monday. That is a matter that can be considered by the trial judge.  
     
      
    27 HOWIE J: I agree. I would simply add a short comment on the suggestion that His Honour's discretion miscarried in so far as there was delay in the application by the Crown to seek leave to amend the indictment to add counts 8 to 11. The suggestion of unfairness or oppression arising from that delay is mainly in terms of the Crown's failure to comply with directions that had been given to it in relation to the filing of material to be relied upon by the Crown and that by reason of the delay in adding the charges based upon the emails there was occasioned to the applicant irremedial prejudice in conducting his defence to the first counts on the indictment; that is counts 1 to 7 and the indictment as a whole. I am prepared to accept a submission of the applicant that had there been a stay application in relation to the counts on the indictment, the onus would be upon the applicant, that is the accused, to show that unfairness or oppression arose from the charges or the combination of charges on the indictment as amended. I also accept that on the present application the onus fell upon the Crown to satisfy the court that the addition of counts 8 to 11 did not render the proceedings oppressive or unfair in that the applicant would be prejudiced in defending the indictment as a whole. I am prepared to accept an argument that the judge perhaps misplaced the onus in this regard but I do not believe that on the material before this Court the proceedings have been rendered oppressive by the delay in amending the indictment by counts 8 to 11 in view of the fact that the applicant knew he was to stand trial in relation to a number of counts arising from material found on his laptop and the portable video player. While the Crown's delay and its apparent failure to adhere to directions is justifiably open to criticism, it is not of such a degree in my view so as to warrant a refusal to grant leave. The usual way in which the court deals with prejudice caused by delay is to fashion directions to ensure that the jury are made aware of any prejudice arising as a result of that delay either that which can be identified or that which can be presumed by the delay and the jury takes that prejudice into account in deciding whether the Crown has proved the charges beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    28 I am persuaded on the material before the Court that any prejudice flowing to the applicant by delay from the Crown seeking to amend the indictment to add these additional counts can be addressed by suitable directions. Given the nature of the evidence and the identifiable issues to be determined by the jury I am satisfied that no prejudice will flow in the determination of the various counts on the indictment by the inclusion of the other counts. If necessary, although I do not believe it will be likely to arise, the trial judge can give directions to the jury to prohibit any tendency or propensity reasoning flowing between the various counts on the indictment.  
     
      
    29 I agree with the Presiding Judge on the material before the Court the Crown has satisfied this Court that leave should be granted and should have been granted for the amendment of the indictment by the addition of counts 8 to 11.  
     
      
    30 FULLERTON J: I agree with the orders given by the presiding judge.  
     
      
    31 HODGSON JA: The order of the court is the application for leave to appeal is refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: The appellant stood trial on two charges of indecent assault and one of sexual intercourse without consent. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to imprisonment for an overall non-parole period of 5 years and total term of 8 years.  
     
      
    2 The appellant appealed against conviction and applied for leave to appeal against sentence. The grounds of appeal were - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The verdict of the Jury was unreasonable having regard to the evidence. 
         
         
        2. The sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Berman in the District Court of New South Wales on 3 October 2008 was excessive.” 
        
       
      
    3 For the reasons which follow, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed, and leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and the appeal upheld as to the sentence for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
       
      The facts in outline 
       
      
    4 A detailed account of the facts is not necessary in order to appreciate and deal with the appellant’s submissions. The essential question at the trial was whether the appellant had forced himself upon the complainant, it being the appellant’s case that the complainant had initiated and encouraged what took place. 
     
      
    5 The complainant was a store manager in a supermarket in a Sydney suburb. The appellant from time to time worked at the supermarket as a loss prevention officer, depending on where his employer sent him.  
     
      
    6 On 5 December 2006 the complainant commenced her shift at 6 pm. The appellant was due to finish his shift at 8pm. Another loss prevention officer, Mr Fouad Fanosh, was also on duty. The complainant’s duties included faxing to head office the time sheets and other paperwork in relation to loss prevention officers at the end of their shifts.  
     
      
    7 On the Crown case, on occasions earlier in the year the appellant had said things to the complainant indicating an interest in her, but she had brushed him off.  
     
      
    8 On the evening of 5 December 2006, the appellant remarked in the tea room on the complainant’s beauty to the day shift manager, Mr Chris Gunn, in the presence of the complainant and her sister Selma who also worked at the supermarket. 
     
      
    9 The appellant then approached the complainant while she was having a cigarette outside just before starting work. He said that he really liked her and wanted to spend ten minutes with her. She said she was not interested. The appellant approached the complainant again in the supermarket as she was marking prices, saying she was such a beautiful person. He asked her to fax his paper work. She refused as it was too early, and told him to go and do some work.  
     
      
    10 According to the complainant, she received a page from Selma at the back dock and went there to help unload a truck. The complainant was pushing a cage loaded with goods in the back dock when she saw the appellant motioning to her. She said she ignored him and hid behind a cage. The appellant went into the back dock and asked the complainant to fax his paperwork. She agreed, as it was approaching 8 pm. 
     
      
    11 They went upstairs to the manager’s office, the complainant intending to get a max unit (it seems a device concerned with prices). The complainant opened the office with a key. Across the passageway was the cash office containing the fax machine. As they were going upstairs the appellant said to the complainant that he just wanted to spend ten minutes with her, which she said was not going to happen. 
     
      
    12 When they were in the manager’s office the complainant sat at the desk and began to make entries in the computer concerning pricing. The appellant put his paperwork in front of her and said he wanted to talk to her. She asked what there was to talk about, and he said something in Iraqi. The complainant said in evidence that she did not quite pick it up except for a part she did understand, which was “If you do tell anybody I hope the worst happens to you”.  
     
      
    13 The appellant said, “If you tell anyone about this, please don’t tell anyone about this”. He closed the door. Some more things were said which need not be recounted. The appellant came around to next to the complainant. He pulled her head towards him and kissed her, and then attempted to kiss her a second time. She pushed him off, and as she did he bit her lip which cut it. 
     
      
    14 The appellant put his hand down the complainant’s shirt and grabbed her breast and sucked her nipple (count 1), then took her hand and placed it on his erect penis outside his pants (count 2). He took her head and forced her mouth onto his penis (which had then been freed from his pants) for a few seconds, saying, “This won’t take long” (Count 3). She pushed him away, and the appellant masturbated until he ejaculated onto the carpet. These events were accompanied by various protests by the complainant, who was shocked and scared.  
     
      
    15 The door opened and Mr Fanosh walked in. He asked what was wrong with the complainant. The appellant said she was faxing their paperwork through. Mr Fanosh asked why the complainant’s shirt was all funny. The complainant did not answer because she could not talk. 
     
      
    16 The complainant went across the passageway and faxed the paperwork. She felt like vomiting and leaned forward, but controlled herself. She returned and gave the paperwork to the appellant and told him to go. The appellant asked for her phone number and she refused. He called her a stupid bitch and said he would give her time to think about it, and left the office. 
     
      
    17 The complainant remained sitting in the manager’s office for about ten minutes. She washed her face, hands and mouth. She heard her name called and went into the tearoom, where Mr Fanosh said she had not signed his paperwork. She signed it, then returned to the manager’s office for a couple of minutes. She picked up the max unit, and went down the stairs and sat at the bottom of the stairs for some time. She then returned to her duties. This was elaborated through some CCTV footage, see later in these reasons. 
     
      
    18 The complainant did not at that time tell anyone what had happened, as she was too scared. She telephoned her best friend, Ms Nicole Gabboury, who did not answer. On the next day she telephoned Ms Gabboury again, and told her what had happened and that the appellant had “forced me to give him a head job”. She told Ms Gabboury that she was too scared to say anything, but Ms Gabboury said it was assault and she should tell her boss.  
     
      
    19 At the same time after the complainant had spoken to Ms Gabboury a work colleague, Mr Milija Nikolic, asked what was wrong with her lip. She asked him what he would do “if someone forced themselves on you”, and on his inquiry elaborated, “In a way where if you don’t want to be kissed then and you pushed somebody off you”. Mr Nikolic said that was sexual assault and asked if that was what happened to her lip. They did not speak more because other persons were nearby. A little later, outside the supermarket, the complainant told Mr Nikolic that a loss prevention officer forced himself onto her and made her give him a head job. Mr Nikolic told her to tell the boss.  
     
      
    20 The complainant sent a text message to her boss, Mr Tim Triantafillou, as a result of which they spoke late the next day. She told him what had happened.  
     
      
    21 This led to the complainant going to the police. She saw Sergeant David King and then Detective Senior Constable Ainsley Hodges. 
     
      
    22 Some CCTV footage for 5 December 2006 was in evidence. 
     
      
    23 The footage for the cash office showed the complainant apparently distressed. She was shown touching herself in the chest area, which she said when taken to it was because she felt like vomiting, and with her hands over her face, which she said was because “I didn’t want to believe what was happening or what just happened. I – like I felt yuck.” 
     
      
    24 The footage for the area at the bottom of the stairs showed the complainant coming down the stairs holding the max unit and apparently sitting on a bottom step. She was obscured by a cage of goods, but said she sat there because she felt light headed. She said that some other employees passed and asked if she was alright, and she said she was. She regathered herself, and after some minutes the footage showed that she engaged in conversation with employees, in particular an employee Jack. According to the complainant Jack was making fun about Selma’s trial make-up for her wedding, and the footage showed the complainant laughing and bending over laughing and pushing Jack away. She said in cross-examination that this was putting what had happened behind her and putting on a brave face and getting back to work. 
     
      
    25 Evidence was given by Selma, Mr Gunn, Mr Fanoush, Ms Gabboury, Mr Nikolic, Mr Triantafillou, Sergeant King and Detective Senior Constable Hodges. Subject to the appellant’s submissions to which I will come, their evidence generally supported the Crown case as presented through the complainant’s evidence. It need not be detailed. It was a strong Crown case, ultimately dependent on acceptance of the complainant’s evidence, but gaining force in particular from the evidence of complaint. 
     
      
    26 The appellant did not give evidence. The police ERISP interview with the appellant was tendered, in which he said that the complainant invited him into the manager’s office instead of the cash room and closed the door, and kissed him and said that she wanted to “do it with you” and really liked him; she took his hand and put it on her breast and unzipped his jeans, and the oral sex was then performed. He said that the complainant urged him to keep it a secret. 
     
      
    27 Consistently with the appellant’s account in the interview, it was put to the complainant that she had been flirting with the appellant, and had suggested that they go into the manager’s office and had initiated the sexual contact. It was put to her that she had told the appellant not to tell anyone because they might lose their jobs, and had only gone to the police because the supermarket’s reporting process had begun (which scarcely touched on why the complainant began the process). The jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what happened was as the complainant said.  
     
      
       
      The conviction appeal 
       
      
    28 The sole ground of appeal was that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable having regard to the evidence. As was said in Zaphir v R [2009] NSWCCA 124 at [75] - 
     
      
       
        
        “The test in determining such a ground remains that stated in  
        M v The Queen 
          
        [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; see also  
        Jones v The Queen 
          
        [1997] HCA 12; 191 CLR 439;  
        MFA v The Queen 
          
        [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606;  
        Markuleski v R 
          
        [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82. That test is simply stated as whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. In reaching that determination the appellate court must bear in mind the advantage held by the jury in its assessment of the evidence, having been able to observe the witnesses, and the manner in which they gave evidence. It must also make its own assessment of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    29 The appellant submitted that the test was not satisfied because of inconsistencies within the complainant’s evidence and inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence and the evidence of other witnesses. He also submitted that the complainant’s demeanour in some of the CCTV footage was not consistent with her account of events. 
     
      
       
      (a) The complainant’s evidence 
       
      
    30 The appellant asserted four inconsistencies. 
     
      
    31 First, the complainant’s understanding of Iraqi. The complainant is Lebanese. As I have said, her evidence included that in the manager’s officer the appellant said something in Iraqi of which she understood, “If you do tell anybody I hope the worst happens to you”. The complainant agreed that she told the police that the appellant was Iraqi and would attempt to say things to her in Iraqi which she could not understand because she was Lebanese, and that she also told Mr Gunn at one point that she did not understand what Iraqi people were saying because it was not her language. The appellant said that this was inconsistent with her understanding part of what was said in the manager’s office. 
     
      
    32 The submission failed to have regard to other evidence. The complainant’s evidence included that Lebanese and Iraqi had a similar dialect, and that she could understand some Iraqi words. She said that she had told the police that she would try to remember what had been said, and that she had done so much later. General inability to understand Iraqi is consistent with limited understanding of some words. It was a matter for the jury to assess whether, on the evidence as a whole, there was inconsistency, and to the extent that there was what effect that had on their acceptance of the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    33 Secondly, the complainant at the bottom of the stairs. The complainant said that as she sat on the stairs people walking past asked what was wrong, she said that she was fine, and other than that she “didn’t say anything to anybody”. The appellant submitted that she conceded in cross-examination that she was on the phone, probably to her sister Antoinette and probably either telling her sister to come to work or to bring some food to eat.  
     
      
    34 The complainant did not concede this; she only agreed that a particular phone number was her sister’s number. Even if she had, the earlier answer was in the context of speaking to persons passing as she sat on the stairs. Again, it would have been a matter for the jury to assess any inconsistency and its effect. 
     
      
    35 Thirdly, hiding in the dock area. The complainant said that when the appellant approached her in the dock area she hid behind a cage in order to avoid him. She said she “mentioned” that to Detective Senior Constable Hodges. It was not in her statement. Detective Senior Constable Hodges said that she did not recall the complainant telling her that she hid behind the cage, and if she had been told it she would have included it in the statement.  
     
      
    36 A “mention” may not have triggered the police officer’s attention. There was arguably a discrepancy, although scarcely an inconsistency in the complainant’s evidence, and again it was for the jury to determine the significance, if any, of the matter.  
     
      
    37 Finally, the complainant yelling out. The complainant agreed that she said in her police statement that she “yelled out”. The statement was not in evidence, but from elsewhere this was about thirty seconds after the appellant had forced her mouth onto his penis. Taken to this, the complainant said, “I didn’t yell out. I said, ‘stop’ or ‘we have got to stop’ can’t remember”. In re-examination she said that the words she yelled out were, “What the fuck are you doing”, which she had said in her evidence in chief was her response to the appellant having forced her mouth onto his penis. 
     
      
    38 The appellant said that there was inconsistency in the denial, “I didn’t yell out”. Yelling out can mean a loud unintelligible sound or saying something loudly. The denial may have been of the former, consistently with saying loudly stop or what are you doing. If there was an inconsistency it was hardly significant, but what to make of this evidence was readily within the jury’s assessment.  
     
      
       
      (b) Other witnesses 
       
      
    39 The complainant gave evidence that, when the appellant asked in the tea room who was managing that night, Mr Gunn said that the complainant was and the appellant said, “Oh she is so beautiful”. Mr Gunn said in cross-examination that he could not remember any further conversation after being asked who was the manager that night. There is no inconsistency unless it be postulated that Mr Gunn would have remembered. That can not readily be said, but again it was a matter for the jury. There is little significance in this.  
     
      
    40 I have referred to the complainant’s evidence that Mr Fanosh asked what was wrong and why her shirt was all funny. Mr Fanosh said in chief that when he entered the office there was silence, so he asked what was happening. In cross-examination he was asked whether he told the police that he could not remember what the complainant and the appellant said “but they told me something like nothing happened”, and he answered, “Really I can’t remember but yeah”. He said he could not remember saying anything about the complainant’s shirt and “it’s like everything’s normal”. 
     
      
    41 There is a degree of discrepancy, but very much tempered by Mr Fanosh’s inability to remember: perhaps discrepancy to the extent that so far as he recalled things appeared normal. Again, it was for the jury to determine the significance, if any, of the matter. 
     
      
    42 The complainant said that she had two conversations with Mr Nicolic, the first precipitated by his asking what happened to her lip. Mr Nicolic could not recall any conversation other than that the complainant asked what he would do if he was harassed at work, and had no memory of the complainant providing any details of the harassment. He had no recollection of commenting on the complainant’s lip. He did recall that the complainant appeared “a bit stressed”, and “seemed fairly serious” in comparison with usually being happy and smiley and bubbly. After they spoke he went back to his duties and “for the rest of the night she seemed fairly normal to me”. 
     
      
    43 There was arguably discrepancy if it be thought that Mr Nikolic would have remembered the lip and being told what had occurred, on the basis that that was not normal in the life of a supermarket employee. But Mr Nikolic did recall reference to harassment and the complainant appearing stressed, so even if he had not been told in greater detail what had occurred there remained support for the Crown case. Once more, it was a matter for the jury to assess the discrepancy and what effect it had on their acceptance of the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    44 The complainant said she was paged by Selma and assisted Selma at the back dock. The appellant submitted that Selma “said she definitely did not see her sister while unloading the trucks”. That is not so. Selma said that she “would have been” unloading trucks for the first hour or hour and a half; she agreed with the question, “So you would not have seen your sister while you were unloading the trucks, is that what you are saying”; and she agreed with the next question, “So we can take that as definite”. She otherwise gave no evidence one way or the other about the complainant being in the dock area. This did not rise above Selma’s reconstruction that, because she was in the back dock, she would not have seen the complainant, without direct attention to the complainant’s evidence of being paged by Selma. 
     
      
    45 Ms Gabboury’s evidence of the complainant describing what had happened included that at the end the appellant told the complainant not to tell anyone and closed the door and walked off. The appellant submitted that there was inconsistency because this left out Mr Fanosh coming into the manager’s office. There was discrepancy only if and to the extent the complainant would be expected to have told Ms Gabboury about Mr Fanosh coming into the manager’s office. The complainant did not give evidence that she told Ms Gabboury this. It is difficult to see inconsistency, but again it was a matter for the jury. 
     
      
    46 Mr Triantafillou’s evidence included the complainant telling him that the appellant put his penis in her mouth, she pushed him away, and he then put his penis back in her mouth and said, “Just a little longer”. The appellant submitted that this was inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence that the appellant put his penis inside her mouth and she pushed him away. He submitted also that there was inconsistency because the complainant did not tell Mr Triantafillou anything about Mr Fanosh coming into the manager’s office. In fact, in her evidence the complainant said that she was “forcing myself off” and he was “pushing me in”, and the first inconsistency is far from clear. The second is in like position to the Mr Gunn inconsistency last mentioned. Both inconsistencies, if they existed, were once more matters for the jury. 
     
      
    47 I have referred to Detective Senior Constable Hodges’ evidence that she was not told about hiding behind a cage in the dock area. The appellant submitted that there was also inconsistency in that, while Detective Hodges’ evidence was that she did see a cut on the complainant’s lip, it was too small to photograph and was on the inside of the lip. It was submitted that this was inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence that Mr Nicolic saw the cut and asked her about it. There was over a day between the occasions, the effect of which on the obviousness of the cut was not explored. That there was a cut, attributed by the complainant to the appellant’s attentions, is clear enough. So far as of any significance, once more this was a matter for the jury. 
     
      
    48 The inconsistencies assessed by the complainant, so far as they might have been thought by the jury to exist, were scarcely on critical matters. Many, although not all, were relied on by counsel for the appellant in his address to the jury. I have indicated as to the separate matters that each was for the jury to assess and to determine what effect it had on their acceptance of the complainant’s evidence. The separate matters must be taken together for their cumulative effect. In my opinion, neither individually nor together do they cast doubt on acceptance of the complainant’s evidence such that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. 
     
      
       
      (c) The CCTV footage 
       
      
    49 The CCTV footage was played to us in the appeal. 
     
      
    50 In the footage of the cash office the appellant appeared to be deeply distressed, and the footage was entirely consistent with her evidence. The appellant submitted that her demeanour was also consistent with concern that she had almost been surprised by Mr Fanosh in consensual sexual activity with the appellant. That is not my reaction to the footage, and at the least it was open to the jury to consider that it provided support for the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    51 The initial footage of the area at the bottom of the stairs was consistent with the complainant’s evidence of sitting on a bottom stair feeling unwell, and again it was open to the jury to consider that in this respect it provided support for her evidence. As manager, she would ordinarily have been attending to her duties rather than sitting on the stairs.  
     
      
    52 The complainant was then shown laughing with Jack and others. Jack did not give evidence. The appellant submitted that her demeanour in this respect was not consistent with being distressed from having the appellant’s attentions forced upon her. That was a valid point to make to the jury, but it was open to the jury to accept that, as was the effect of the complainant’s evidence, the complainant managed to compose herself sitting at the bottom of the stairs and was able to put on a brave face and carry on with apparent normality.  
     
      
    53 I take account of the CCTV footage in these respects as well as the inconsistencies asserted by the appellant. For the ground of appeal, it is necessary for the Court to make its own assessment of the evidence and determine whether, on the whole of the evidence, the jury could be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. I have had regard to the whole of the evidence. In my opinion, it was well open to the jury to be so satisfied. 
     
      
       
      The sentence appeal 
       
      
    54 For each of the offences of indecent assault the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment. For the offence of sexual intercourse without consent he was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years and a total term of 8 years. The sentences were made wholly concurrent. They commenced on 11 August 2008, the day on which the appellant went into custody.  
     
      
    55 The offences of indecent assault carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The appellant submitted that the sentences for the offences were excessive “having regard to the form of the indecent assaults and the circumstances in which they occurred”.  
     
      
    56 The submission was not developed, and it was observed in the appellant’s submissions that as the sentences were wholly concurrent there was no effect on the overall sentence. On no view could the sentence for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent properly result in a non-parole period of less than 3 years imprisonment, and the concurrency was and is appropriate. Accordingly, the appeal in this respect has no practical significance. It is sufficient that, while the indecent assaults were relatively brief, and were less intrusive to the complainant than other possible forms of indecent assault, they were very much forced upon her. In my opinion the sentences were within the range open to the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    57 The offence of sexual intercourse without consent carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment. The appellant submitted that the sentence for the offence was excessive “having regard to the form of the sexual intercourse and also the circumstances in which the particular form of intercourse occurred and the subjective circumstances of the Appellant”. This was developed by submissions concerning objective seriousness and the weight given to subjective circumstances and prospects of rehabilitation, with provision also of sentencing statistics from the Judicial Commission database. 
     
      
    58 The sentencing judge said, after describing what had occurred - 
     
      
       
        
        “These were serious offences. The offender was given not the slightest reason to think that the complainant might either be romantically or sexually interested in him, but he seems not to have cared, deciding to indecently touch [the complainant], then forcing her to perform oral sex upon him despite her making it clear that she did not want that to happen.” 
        
       
      
    59 The sentencing judge later said - 
     
      
       
        
        “I did mention that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent carries a standard non-parole period of seven years. On occasions courts have attempted to categorise various forms of sexual intercourse with suggestions occasionally being made that some forms of sexual intercourse are necessarily less serious than other forms of sexual intercourse. However those remarks do not appear to have been followed in other cases. 
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied that the appropriate way of looking at the various forms of sexual intercourse is not to apply blanket determinations that one form is always more serious than another, but to look at all the circumstances in which the particular form of intercourse occurs. Thus for example whilst it may be thought that digital penetration will usually be less serious than other forms of sexual intercourse, that would not automatically be the case. In order to decide the seriousness of a particular act of intercourse much more needs to be looked at than the form the intercourse takes. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case, as I mentioned, the form of intercourse was fellatio. I take into account that the penetration of [the complainant’s] mouth by the accused’s penis was relatively quick and that he did not ejaculate in her mouth. He did however physically force [the complainant] to perform the fellatio upon him when he grabbed her head and forced it towards his penis. Primarily because of the relatively short period of time that the offence took, I will find that it is slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.” 
        
       
      
    60 The appellant submitted that this was erroneous because it failed to take account of the facts that there was minimal removal of the complainant’s clothes (said to reduce the humiliation to the complainant), that there was minimal use of physical force and that when the appellant was pushed away he did not persist.  
     
      
    61 Removal of the complainant’s clothes was not of great significance when the form of sexual intercourse was forced fellatio, and the judge was correct to have regard to the circumstances of the particular offence rather than place the form of sexual intercourse in some kind of hierarchy (see per Simpson J in R v AJP [2004) NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [24]). Forced fellatio is quite capable of achieving or exceeding the mid-point of objective seriousness (see ibid). The physical force used by the appellant cannot correctly be described as minimal, and failure to persist when he appeared to have achieved his objective of stimulation did not lessen the seriousness of the offence. In my opinion, it was open to the judge to place the offence slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    62 The appellant then submitted that the judge did not give sufficient weight to the appellant’s subjective circumstances. It was said that the appellant had no significant record of previous convictions, and that the sentencing judge had found that he was “doing his time in custody particularly hard” and was affected by his conditions of custody more than most other prisoners. It was said also that there was error in declining to find that the appellant had good prospects of rehabilitation, given the support he had from his fiancé and his community, his lack of any previous criminal antecedents and the particular deterrent effect of “doing his time in custody particularly hard”.  
     
      
    63 The sentencing judge recognised all these matters. As to the second, his Honour said that while the appellant was then on protection, it could not be assumed that that would continue or that, even on protection, the conditions of custody would be worse than in the general prison population. However, in my opinion there is a difficulty as to prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    64 His Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        “It is difficult to find that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and, in fact, I cannot make that finding. The most obvious impediment to that finding being made is that the offender continues to maintain his innocence. His failure to admit his guilt suggests that nothing, apart of course from the sentence I must impose upon him, will prevent him from in future doing something similar to what he has done in the past.”.  
        
       
      
    65 At this point in his remarks his Honour did not acknowledge the matters favouring unlikelihood that the appellant would re-offend to which he had earlier referred. His only stated reason for declining to find good prospects of rehabilitation was that the appellant continued to maintain his innocence. That is by far from necessarily inconsistent with unlikelihood that he would re-offend; there can be rehabilitation without confession, and offenders found guilty after a trial are not all but automatically deprived of a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation unless they then acknowledge their guilt. I consider that his Honour gave that matter undue weight without proper regard to the otherwise favourable matters. 
     
      
    66 The statistics from the Judicial Commission database were provided without explanation of whether or how they supported the appellant’s submissions. The sentence imposed on the appellant is to the upper end of the range of sentences disclosed by the statistics. In the light of what I have said, it is necessary that the appellant be re-sentenced. In my opinion, a lesser sentence is warranted. With due recognition of the seriousness of the offence, in all the circumstances the appellant should be re-sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    67 I propose the orders - 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted; appeal allowed. 
       
       
      3. Uphold the sentences on Counts 1 and 2. Quash the sentence pronounced on 3 October 2008 on Count 3 in the District Court. In lieu thereof sentence the appellant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 11 August 2008 and expiring on 10 August 2012 and a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 11 August 2012 and expiring on 10 August 2015.

   JUDGMENT1. Mr Raymundo Antonio Orellana is being prosecuted by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. He was charged by the Australian Federal Police with importing a substance being a border controlled drug. The drug is alleged to be cocaine and it is also alleged that it was a commercial quantity of cocaine. The offence is alleged to have been committed on 18 November 2007. It is an offence against s 307.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 of the Commonwealth.2. Mr Walsh, of counsel, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions has tendered part of a record of interview between Mr Orellana and the Federal Police which contains, he argues, admissions which are relevant to the fault element of the crime that Mr Orellana is charged with.3. Mr Brassil, of counsel, who appears for Mr Orellana objects to the tender. His objections are in reliance upon the Evidence Act 1995, specifically sections 85, 89, 90, 135 and 138. An earlier reliance on s 137 of the Evidence Act has now been withdrawn. 4. In this judgment I will determine the objections raised by Mr Brassil to the admissions of the record of interview into evidence. 5. At the commencement it is convenient to set out some findings which I have made concerning the evidence which has been called before me on a voir dire which was conducted in accordance with s 189 of the Evidence Act on the question of the admissibility of the evidence. 6. The evidence tendered by Mr Walsh comprises a relatively small part of a more extended interview conducted by the Australian Federal Police with Mr Orellana. The whole of the interview was recorded on video. Parts of the interview were recorded on audio tape. Part of the evidence relied upon by Mr Brassil are what appears on the video so far as the behaviour of his client and the interviewers are concerned. 7. The video has been played in its entirety before me and I closely observed Mr Orellana’s behaviour during the course of the interview. Because the video helpfully contained a reference to the time I will make these findings by reference to the time or approximate time which appeared on the video screen relevant to my findings.8. At 19:16 when the interview resumed after a toilet break Mr Orellana appeared to be quite animated on the telephone with the interpreter. At 19:21 he appeared to be focused and paying attention when speaking with the interpreter on the phone. He was leaning forward towards the phone. 9. I suspend my findings here to record that Mr Orellana’s first language is not English; it is Spanish. The interview occurred in an interview room with a telephone which was on loud speaker. On the other end of the telephone was an accredited interpreter in Spanish. Most of the questions and answers were interpreted by that interpreter between the two languages. Occasionally Mr Orellana volunteered answers himself in English. I return now to my findings. 10. At 19:23 he appeared to be relaxed. He was laughing at an incidental exchange between himself and the police. At 19:24 he was asked if he wanted a cigarette and he declined saying perhaps later. At 19:29 he appeared to be focused and animated, talking about his friend James Lopez.11. At 19:37 he was drinking some water and leaning forward; he appeared to be engaged and listening intently to the interpreter on the telephone. At 19:48 he was asked whether he wanted a drink. At 19:49 he was wiping his face and his water had apparently run out.12. At 19:52 he was sitting and waiting for some time in silence. I did not detect any signs of sleepiness or stress. He appeared to be quiet and still.13. At 20:01 he appeared to be tired. His head was resting on his hand or had been resting on his hand at that stage for some minutes. At 20:03 he rubbed his eyes and put his hand through his hair. At 20:10 his chin was rested upon his folded arms on the table.14. At 20:18 he was leaning forward and listening. At 20:20 some audio tapes were changed. He was alert, nodding and engaged. At 20:23 there was either a yawn or perhaps a sigh. At 20:30, which I note was at the time that the relevant questions and answers occurred which are tendered by Mr Walsh, he appeared to be leaning towards the phone and listening carefully. At that stage he showed no obvious signs of tiredness or over-extension. He appeared animated and was using gestures and gesticulating. 15. At 20:32 the police stopped the interview so that he could follow up the need to obtain a solicitor. At 20:37 he was still focused and animated towards the end of the interview.16 A second finding I make concerns an argument by Mr Brassil that the Federal Police had breached s 23G of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth. The effect of such a breach is relied upon in a number of respects related to his arguments concerning the admissibility of the record of interview under the Evidence Act.Section 23G subs (1) provides as follows: 
     
      
      “ 
      ’Subject to s 23L, if a person is under arrest or a protected suspect, an investigating official must, before starting to question the person, inform the person that he or she may: 
       
       
       (a) communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a friend or relative to inform that person of his or her whereabouts; and 
       
       
       (b) communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a legal practitioner of the person’s choice and arranged, or attempt to arrange, for a legal practitioner of the person’s choice to be present during the questioning; and the investigating official must defer the questioning for a reasonable time to allow the person to make, or attempt to make, the communication and, if the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present, to allow the legal practitioner to attend the questioning. 
       
       
      and the investigating official must defer the questioning for a reasonable time to allow the person to make, or attempt to make, the communication and, if the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present, to allow the legal practitioner to attend the questioning.” 
       
      
    17. Section 23L provides for an exception to the provision which I have just read out in that it does not apply “if, and for so long as, the official believes on reasonable grounds that: 
     
      
      (a) compliance with the requirement is likely to result in:  
       
       
        
        (i) an accomplice of the person taking steps to avoid apprehension; or 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the concealment, fabrication or destruction of evidence or the intimidation of a witness; or 
        
       
       
      (b) if the requirement relates to the deferral of questioning - the questioning is so urgent, having regard to the safety of other people, that it should not be delayed by compliance with that requirement.” 
       
      
    18. In this case Mr Brassil pointed to the commencement of contact between his client and the Federal Police at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport where he first came under the attention of Customs Officers and then Federal Police when he arrived at the airport on 18 November 2007. That first contact was some time between 3 or 4 o’clock in the afternoon. The record of interview, part of which is tendered by Mr Walsh, commenced at 6.50 pm in a Federal Police office at the airport. Mr Brassil points to the delay between the initial contact and the commencement of that interview. 19. It was during the commencement of that interview that an opportunity was offered to Mr Orellana to contact a lawyer and to contact his friend James Lopez. Federal Agent Walloscheck was the Federal Police Officer who conducted the record of interview. He was accompanied by another Federal Police Officer. One of the issues was why there had been a delay in not allowing Mr Orellana to contact his friend. 20. Evidence was elicited about that from Federal Agent Walloscheck who pointed out that at the time that they first had contact with Mr Orellana at the airport he knew that he had a telephone, that is Mr Orellana, with some missed calls and that he, Mr Orellana, had received a telephone call when he arrived at the airport.21. The reason that Mr Walloscheck says he was not prepared to let Mr Orellana contact James Lopez immediately was that the police wanted to make a criminal history check on Mr Lopez. The reason for that was it may disclose that that person was a person of interest to the police. As Federal Officer Walloscheck observed in his evidence, a person “who continuously rings someone is generally either waiting outside or may have something to do with import.” The person that Mr Orellana wanted to contact may have been, as Officer Walloscheck said, part of the syndicate. He may have been an accomplice in the offence and early contact between Mr Orellana and that person could result in, as the police officer said, “loss, concealment, destruction, evidence, that sort of thing, future search warrants, all that becomes relevant.” To my mind it was not at all unreasonable for the police to defer the opportunity for Mr Orellana to contact a friend or relative because the police believed on reasonable grounds that such a contact was likely to result in an accomplice either avoiding apprehension or concealing evidence.22. A second point made by Mr Brassil was the delay in Mr Orellana being afforded an opportunity to contact a lawyer. Mr Brassil cross-examined Agent Walloscheck extensively on this question. To my mind the answers that he gave explaining the reasons for delay at the airport were quite satisfactory and acceptable. One of the things that needed to be done first was the completion of a property record. That involved ascertaining and recording just what property Mr Orellana had with him in case that became an issue later on. Another issue was the appropriate place for him to be interviewed where there were appropriate facilities. That place was the Australian Federal Police office at the airport rather than the Customs office. 23. Once the interview commenced, the police officers enquired about Mr Orellana’s need for a lawyer in the course of explaining to him his rights and indeed the interview was suspended for the purpose of him exercising his right to obtain a lawyer. 24. I am not satisfied that there has been any breach of s 23G(1)(b) affording Mr Orellana an opportunity to communicate with a lawyer. In any event I do not regard the questioning which occurred before the commencement of the formal record of interview as such that it would warrant the need for him to communicate with a lawyer. The interview itself, which contained what Mr Walsh argues are admissions or confessions, contained also opportunities for Mr Orellana to contact a lawyer.25., The next preliminary finding that I make concerns the administration of a caution to Mr Orellana. There were a number of breaks in the interview. After each break, or almost every break, the police administered the caution to Mr Orellana. It is true, and not surprising, that there were some misunderstandings at times about what the caution meant. However, the relevant questions relied upon by Mr Walsh were asked and answered shortly after the police asked this series of questions: 
     
      
      “ 
      Q 164. No worries, and at the moment you are happy to proceed? 
       
      A. What do you mean? 
       
       
      Q 165. You’re happy to keep talking with us and answer questions? 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
       
      Q 166. And you understand that it’s your choice, you don’t have to answer my questions? 
       
      A. Yes, to answer or not to answer. 
       
       
      A. ORELLANA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.” 
       
      
    It is agreed that of the two answers referred to in the last passage, the first represents that given through the interpreter and the second one given by Mr Orellana directly. 26. To my mind Mr Orellana fully understood the nature of the caution and his choice of answering questions or not at the time that he answered the questions which Mr Walsh relies upon. 27. The next finding concerns the answers which Mr Walsh wants to tender being said by Mr Brassil to have occurred immediately after his client said, “No reply today until I speak to the solicitor.” That is quite right. The response to that assertion by his client is contained in the question, so to speak, which immediately followed it at question 179 where the police officer said, “Sure. No worries.” It was in response to that observation, which I note was not a question but an acknowledgment of what Mr Orellana had said, that he volunteered the first passage which is relied upon as an admission. What follows was a series of clarifying or acknowledging responses from the police officer which prompted the other passages which Mr Walsh relies upon as admissions.28. A further finding I make concerns some observations made by Mr Orellana himself during the course of the interview which are relevant to his state of mind or health. Following question 85 the following three questions and answers appear: 
     
      
      “Q 86. No worries. Do you feel well enough to participate in this interview? 
       
      A. INTERPRETER (Answering on behalf of interviewee): How can I put it? You have a kind way of doing things. 
       
       
      Q 87. Okay. Thank you.  
       
      A. Yeah, I, your not heavy. 
       
       
      Q 88. Sure.  
       
      A. ORELLANA: That’s okay.” 
       
      
    In the last exchange, “Orellana” is in capitals and it is agreed the answer is one given by Mr Orellana himself in English. 29. Having made those findings, I turn now to consider the objections outlined or relied upon by Mr Brassil by reference to the Evidence Act.30. Mr Brassil argued so far as section 85 of the Evidence Act is concerned that the evidence was not admissible because the circumstances were not such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admissions relied upon by the prosecution were adversely affected.31. As Wood CJ at CL observed in R v Moffatt (2000) 112A Crim R 201 at 211, ([46]), the correct approach to Section 85 of the Evidence Act is as follows: 
     
      
      “ 
      If upon the evidence led on the voir dire...a question legitimately arises as to whether the circumstances were such that the truth (or untruth) of the admission might have been adversely affected, then it falls to the Crown to establish upon the balance of probabilities...that it was unlikely that this was the case.” 
       
      
    32. Mr Brassil pointed to the vulnerability of his client exhibiting tiredness. He pointed to the fact that he was required to use an interpreter because his first language was not English. He referred to over-talking, which I take to mean two people talking at once, and to one passage where the transcript reveals that the person who translated the Spanish was not able to understand the Spanish being said by his client, hence the word “indistinct” appeared in the transcript. 33. In my opinion from the findings which I have made of Mr Orellana during the interview, his condition was not such that the truth of his admissions, if they were such, would have been adversely affected. The presence of an interpreter, necessary for a person who does not have English as their first language, is not an unusual circumstance at all, nor is over-talking on occasions. The fact that there was no complete translation of one passage is not a matter relevant to the question posed by Section 85 of the Evidence Act. It is a question which may arise and be addressed by evidence during the course of the trial. In my opinion, the evidence is not inadmissible by virtue of Section 85 of the Evidence Act. 34. Mr Brassil next relies upon Section 89 of the Evidence Act, arguing that a jury may draw an unfavourable inference because of Mr Orellana’s stated desire, on more than one occasion, to speak with a lawyer. The relevant provision for my purposes in is s89(2) which provides that evidence from which an unfavourable inference to a party may be drawn “is not admissible if it can only be used to draw such an inference.” I understand that to mean that the evidence is only inadmissible if the only available inference is one unfavourable to the party. In my opinion other inferences, which may well be available and which would not be unfavourable to Mr Orellana in the circumstances, are that his request for a lawyer stemmed from being uncertain or cautious or panicking or indeed exercising a good deal of common sense. If requested by Mr Brassil, it would seem to me at this stage to be appropriate for me to give to the jury a direction that they should not draw any unfavourable inference from his desire to speak to a lawyer, pointing out that there are inferences available which are not at all unfavourable and which make a lot of sense. To my mind the evidence does not fall within Section 89 and I do not regard the evidence tendered as inadmissible because of that provision.34. Mr Brassil next relies upon s 90 of the Evidence Act arguing that, having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to his client to use the evidence. Mr Brassil points to various factors here, including a passage in the interview where his client asks a question to the effect of “What is going to happen about going to court?” and was told that the police would do the interview and then they would go from there. Mr Brassil argued that that approach by the police affects the voluntariness of his client’s responses. 36. It is appropriate at this point to refer to what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said about police questioning in the Regina v Quach (2002) 137 A Crim R 345. At 368 ([100]) Sully J, with whom James J agreed, referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s judgment in Regina v Plevac (1995) 84 A Crim R 570. Sully J set out the statement of relevant principles concerning police questioning from that case. There were three principles, and they are as follows: 
     
      
      “ 
      1. Police may, in the course of investigation, interrogate a suspect who is willing to answer their questions, and that interrogation may include putting to the suspect the facts as the police know, or believe, or suspect them to be, in order to ascertain, if anything, the suspect will say about them. 
       
       
      2. But questioning must be fair and must not amount to ‘intimidation, persistent importunity or sustained or undue insistence or pressure’...but questioning is not to be regarded as unfair merely because it is persistent. 
       
       
      3. Police should not persist with such an interrogation after the suspect has indicated that he or she does not wish to answer further questions...although merely because a suspect says he does not wish to answer, or not answer, any further questions does not render inadmissible answers to further questions which the suspect does answer provided the questions are fair and proper and the answers are otherwise.” 
       
      
    37. The overall impression I received from viewing the whole of the record of interview which was taped on video was that the police were doing their best to be fair to Mr Orellana. One needs to bear in mind that it is the job of police officers to investigate crime and to obtain evidence as part of the investigation of the crime. They are required to be fair to suspects. To my mind, what occurred in this record of interview was an appropriate combination of the police responsibilities of investigating crime in order to ascertain whether there was any evidence of criminal activity in this case together with treating the suspect fairly. He was given opportunities for breaks and he was made clearly aware of his rights and he was given opportunities to contact lawyers and, at the appropriate time, friends as well.38. One of the matters relied upon by Mr Brassil was that some of the answers provided by his client were unclear and their value as admissions were reduced significantly. As part of the answer to question 179, Mr Orellana said “Because when I was upstairs I told him, so I had my suspicions when I went to Argentina. I spoke, not with you Michael, with someone else.” That was the interpretation provided by the interpreter (the reference to Michael being to Federal Agent Walloscheck). Immediately after that Mr Orellana added in English “The lady, one lady.” He acknowledged that the lady was from Customs. Mr Orellana went on to say through the interpreter that he had “explained to the other person that I was, some suspicion about something that I don’t really want to say anything just in case I - make a mistake.”39. I assume for the purposes of this argument that there will not be, in the Crown case, any evidence of any admission to a Customs officer consistent with what Mr Orellana appears to be asserting at that point in the record of interview. It may be that what he said to a person upstairs, to a female Customs officer upstairs, remains unclear. But what is, in my opinion, clear is that he repeated to the police what he claimed to have said upstairs and adopted it. Bearing in mind that and the other matters that I have referred to, in my opinion I do not regard there to be any basis for me to refuse to admit the evidence of the admission tendered by Mr Walsh because of anything in the circumstances from which I would conclude that it would be unfair to Mr Orellana to use the evidence against him.40. Mr Brassil relied upon Section 135 (b) and (c) of the Evidence Act arguing that parts of the evidence could be misleading or confusing or cause a result in undue waste of time. He argued that the passage which I have referred to which is noted in the transcript as being “indistinct” may be misleading or confusing. I do not agree. In my opinion that is a matter which can be resolved during the trial by evidence if that is needed. Indeed in the voir dire, Mr Brassil called evidence which purported to explain what was said by his client at that point of the interview where the person who translated for the transcript clearly was not able to understand. That is not, in my opinion, something which is likely to be misleading or confusing. It is simply a matter which, if appropriate, needs to be attended to by evidence.41. Mr Brassil further argued that it was unclear what his client was referring to by referring to his conversations with the female Customs officer upstairs, for the reasons which I have already given. I do not regard that as something which is capable of being misleading or confusing because what he told the police clearly constituted a repetition - or arguably constituted a repetition and adoption - of whatever it was that he said. 42. As to a waste of time, his argument after some discussion reduced itself to an assertion that the time would be wasted because of the answer to the one question which contained in the transcript the word ‘indistinct’ and which may need to be the subject of further evidence. As I said, Mr Brassil called evidence on that topic on the voir dire and the evidence lasted only a few minutes. If there was the need to call evidence on that point it would not, in my opinion, cause or result in any undue waste of time.43. Mr Brassil’s final point is that I should, in the exercise of my discretion under Section 138 of the Evidence Act, determine that the admissions were obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law. The contravention of the Australian law which he relies upon are the breach of Section 23G of the Crimes Act. For reasons which I have already given, I do not regard that provision as having been breached.44. Mr Brassil’s asserted impropriety is the claim that his client did not comprehend the caution and that the opportunity to contact a friend or lawyer had been inappropriately deferred. For reasons which I have already given, I do not accept either of those submissions.45. Even if I was wrong on either of those findings I would exercise my discretion to admit the admissions in any event. The probative value is significant and, being a claimed admission, is obviously important in the proceedings. Returning to the probative value, I say it is significant because Mr Orellana refers to suspicions and one of the fault elements can be satisfied by evidence of recklessness. 46. The offence is a very serious one. Indeed it carries the highest penalty of life imprisonment. I would not regard, if I was wrong, the impropriety or contravention as grave. If Section 23G had been breached or any inappropriate deferral had occurred, the circumstances were such at the airport with the need for the police to make a judgement about ascertaining the property that was on Mr Orellana, ascertaining the identity of the person whom he might want to contact and ascertaining the availability of appropriate facilities for him to be interviewed to result in any impropriety or contravention being not grave. Nor would I regard it as deliberate or reckless.47. For those reasons, I find that the evidence was not obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law. And if I am wrong, then I regard the desirability of admitting the evidence as outweighing the undesirability of admitting the evidence which was obtained in the way that it was. 48. For those reasons, I would not exercise my discretion against the admission under Section 138 if that were to arise.49. For all of the above reasons I regard the evidence tendered by Mr Walsh as admissible.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 LATHAM J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a number of sentences imposed on 18 April 2008 by Blackmore SC DCJ (the Judge) following pleas of guilty to four offences. The offences and the sentences imposed in respect of each of them are :- 
     
      
      (i) Aid and Abet the manufacture of a commercial quantity of cocaine (maximum penalty life imprisonment) for which the applicant received a sentence of 22 years imprisonment. 
      
     (ii) Trafficking a commercial quantity of cocaine (maximum penalty life imprisonment) for which the applicant received a sentence of 15 years imprisonment. (iii) Dealing in the proceeds of crime ($600,000:00) (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment) for which the applicant received a sentence of 10 years imprisonment. (iv) Dealing in the proceeds of crime ($150,000:00) (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment) for which the applicant received a sentence of 8 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 There were two further offences, namely Possess a marketable quantity of cocaine (21.6gms) and Dealing in the proceeds of crime ($50,000:00), that were taken into account on a schedule. The possess charge, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, was taken into account when the Judge sentenced the applicant on offence (ii). The dealing in proceeds of crime charge, carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment, was taken into account when the Judge sentenced the applicant on offence (iv).  
     
      
    4 A significant measure of accumulation resulted in an aggregate sentence of 36 years, with a non parole period of 22 years. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was part of a group of men who arranged for the extraction of approximately 34 kg of cocaine from 45 bags of imported Lucuma powder (a Peruvian fruit) in early 2006. The applicant’s role included ensuring the rented factory premises were suitable for the extraction process, negotiating the rent with the owner of the factory premises (Weterings) and arranging for the payment of that rent. The applicant, with two others, transported the chemicals necessary for the extraction to the factory and supplied provisions to the men undertaking the extraction. The applicant visited the factory a number of times, paid Weterings an extra sum of money, and took away a quantity of cocaine and the residue from the extraction process. A number of telephone intercepts established that the applicant was a trusted deputy of the syndicate’s principal. The applicant was integrally involved at all stages of the importation, manufacture and supply of the cocaine. 
     
      
    6 The applicant contends that the sentences were individually and collectively manifestly excessive. In relation to the sentences imposed for the individual offences, the applicant also raises a parity issue on the basis of the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders. A further ground, which asserts that the sentence proceedings miscarried because the Judge mistakenly recorded a submission made by the Crown, is pressed independently of the manifest excess ground. It is convenient to deal with that ground first.  
     
      
      The Sentence Proceedings 
       
      
    7 During submissions on sentence on 7 February 2008, senior counsel for the applicant proposed an aggregate sentence of 20 years imprisonment with an aggregate non parole period of 12 years. Immediately thereafter, the Judge queried whether it was possible in Commonwealth matters to impose a determinate non parole period where a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed, commenting that “that may or may not be in prospect”. 
     
      
    8 The Crown representative disavowed any submission that a life sentence was appropriate, primarily on the ground that the aggregate sentences received by the co-offenders required a proportionate response. The Judge noted the Crown’s position, but went on to say :- 
     
      
       
        
        This man was involved in four distinct aspects of this, different to everybody else involved. He was involved as a reasonably significant player in the production of 30 kg of cocaine. He was involved in a very significant sale of 6 kg of the drug. Both of those offences carry life imprisonment. He did so in circumstances where he’s previously been sentenced to 12 years in jail for drug importation. In addition to that he has laundered money to an overseas source who must be regarded as a principal. General deterrence in those sorts of cases would demand a very significant sentence. All knowingly done. The fourth offence perhaps isn’t as significant but those three offences are, taking them to my mind, well away from anybody else that I've looked at, and the accumulation of sentence must recognize those facts. 
        
       
      
    9 The Crown agreed with these remarks. A short time later, the Crown submitted that ""given the principles of parity and a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity"" an appropriate aggregate sentence would be a minimum of 22 years with an aggregate non-parole period of 13 or 14 years. Following some further remarks by the Crown in relation to the applicant's co-offenders, his Honour said :- 
     
      
       
        
        But none of these other offenders have been sentenced in respect of the second matter. As I said to your opponent, in my view, it's probably the most serious matter that he is facing. The trafficking matter. To traffic 6 kg of the drug having previously been in jail for trafficking a drug is a very serious offence and it raises the prospect of receiving the maximum penalty. I'm not suggesting he is necessarily going to get it, but in combination with all of these other factors it doesn't seem to me necessarily to be removed as a possibility. ………………………………………………… 
         
        I'm only throwing these things out, I'm not trying to say that I have made up my mind about these, I haven't at all. I just wanted to have this sort of debate about the sentence because it is a particularly serious offence involving, as it does, not simply involvement in one aspect of -- which is often the case – one aspect of the drug trade, but he has involved himself in every aspect of the drug trade. Admittedly not as a principal, but as perhaps the second, the third in command, or something of that sort, but obviously somebody who is well ingrained inside the organisation, not at the bottom of the range, not absolutely the top of the range, but certainly somebody for whom our community wants to assume that if they are detected they are going to get a very, very significant sentence because general deterrence demands that much. ………………………………………. 
         
        And I just cannot see for the life of me that 14 years as a non-parole period is going to register that sort of disapproval that I'm talking about, and the parity issues just don't really exist, they are illusory. 
        
       
      
    10 Further discussion between the Crown and the Judge centred on “whether it would be appropriate to impose life”. At the end of the Crown’s submissions, the Judge said “I mean ultimately there is not that much between you from what you’ve said, a non parole period of 14 or 12.” The Crown remarked a short time later, “obviously it is a matter entirely for your Honour, but I have regarded the sentences imposed on the co-offenders as a significant matter in determining whether an even higher sentence than say 22 with 14 on the bottom is appropriate.” 
     
      
    11 When senior counsel for the applicant responded, the Judge accepted that he should not impose a life sentence in opposition to the Crown’s submission.  
     
      
    12 This aspect of the submissions was reflected in the remarks on sentence, delivered on 18 April 2008, to the extent that the Judge noted that :-  
     
      
       
        
        there was some debate during the proceedings as to whether the offences were ones that should be placed in the most serious category, requiring the imposition of a life sentence with respect to two of them. However, the Crown did not submit that such a penalty is appropriate and of course counsel for the offender submitted that it should not be applied. I will say no more about the debate and I will not apply such a sentence in this case.  
        
       
      
    13 The Judge then referred to the applicant's personal circumstances and to the fact that the applicant did not suffer any major health issues, or mental health issues. The following appears thereafter :- 
     
      
       
        
        He is understandably anxious to know his future, although he could have been under no misunderstanding that it is likely that he will spend a significant part of the rest of his life in custody. In that regard,  
        the Crown submitted in sentencing proceedings that I would impose a minimum term of something like 22 years imprisonment with an additional term of between 12 and 14 years 
        . 
        
       
      
    14 The Judge then reviewed the sentences imposed on the co-offenders and concluded that :-  
     
      
       
        
        whilst they provide some assistance as to the level of sentence to be imposed, that assistance is minimal in the determination of the sentences to be imposed on the offender. The principal consideration in this offender’s case is what should be the total sentence imposed. The offender's activity, whilst involving the commission of separate offences, can legitimately be seen as one series of logical steps being taken by a person who was involved in the manufacture of drugs, knowing that the precursor had been imported, through to the selling of those drugs and the laundering of the proceeds of the drugs overseas. That is not to say that the sentences imposed here could or should be concurrent. In my view they are separate offences and will require some degree of accumulation. On the other hand, any significant accumulation of the penalties could easily lead to a disproportionately long sentence when totality is considered. 
        
       
      
    15 An aggregate sentence of at least 48 years was nominated by the Judge as a starting point had the matters gone to trial. Immediately thereafter, the Judge said that the applicant's early pleas of guilty called for the application of a 25% discount on “the sentence” that might otherwise have been imposed. Following a discussion about the proportion between the non-parole period and the parole order, the Judge proceeded to sentence the applicant on the individual offences.  
     
      
    16 The aggregate sentence of 36 years represents a 25% discount on 48 years, suggesting that the discount was applied to the nominal aggregate sentence and not to the individual sentences imposed. This conclusion is fortified by the fact that sentences of 22, 10 and 8 years can only be reached after the application of a 25% discount to 29 years 4 months, 13 years 4 months, and 10 years 8 months respectively. It seems unlikely, in my view, that sentences of this nature were adopted by the Judge as “starting points”. Application of the discount to an aggregate sentence does not, strictly speaking, conform to the requirements of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, and presents some difficulties for the applicant's argument on the parity ground and the manifest excess ground. 17 It is however obvious from these extracts that the Judge’s reference during the remarks on sentence to the Crown’s submission on the issue of aggregate sentence misrepresented that submission. The error was brought to the Judge’s attention by the applicant’s representative as soon as the remarks concluded. Counsel repeated the Crown submission that 22 years was the proposed aggregate sentence, with a 12 to 14 year non parole period. His Honour then said :- 
     
      
       
        
        It’s not the way I noted it, but if that's what the Crown thought was appropriate then I am completely against both of you. You will have to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal and see whether they agree with you. In my view, 12 years would be totally inappropriate, and I ask that those further remarks be taken included with the sentence judgement. 
        
       
       
      Material Error 
       
        
      
    18 The applicant concedes that the Judge was not bound by the Crown’s submission on the appropriate range of sentence. However, it is submitted his Honour obviously took into account, and was strongly influenced by, his recollection of the Crown’s submission, given the correspondence between the sentence imposed and the incorrect notation. Thus, it is said that the sentence proceedings were infected by error.  
     
      
    19 Mere identification of an error in the sentencing proceedings is not sufficient to enliven s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The error must be a material error, that is, not technical or trivial in nature. If it has the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this Court has an obligation to re-exercise that discretion and substitute another sentence, unless satisfied that no lesser sentence is warranted in law. It is not necessary for the applicant to persuade the Court that the sentences are manifestly excessive before he may succeed on this ground : Baxter v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 237 ; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284.  
     
      
    20 The error in this case may be regarded as analogous to the application of an erroneous maximum penalty, in so far as an inference is available that the Judge’s sentencing discretion was exercised, in a significant respect, having regard to the error. At some stage between 7 February and 18 April 2008, the Judge was considering the sentences to be imposed upon the basis that the Crown proposed a 36 year aggregate sentence, although that was never the case.  
     
      
    21 Regardless of the misunderstanding as to the Crown’s submission, it is clear from the exchanges between senior counsel and the Judge on 7 February that the Judge’s preliminary view of the applicant’s criminality was that it was considerably greater than the Crown submissions suggested. Most of the discussion initiated by the Judge centred on the potential imposition of a life sentence. Whilst he accepted that the Crown did not support that outcome, the Judge obviously had in mind an aggregate sentence of more than 22 years. Nonetheless, it is questionable whether, absent the error, an aggregate sentence 14 years higher than that proposed by the Crown would have been imposed. Accordingly, it is open to the Court to conclude that the error was material.  
     
      
    22 The applicant has made good this ground of the appeal. I defer a consideration of whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law pending the outcome of the remaining grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The Parity Ground 
       
      
    23 There were a number of co-offenders who were sentenced by different judges for their respective part in aiding and abetting the manufacture of cocaine, possessing cocaine for the purposes of supply, and money laundering. The applicant claims that the nature of these offences and the subjective circumstances of each offender allow a meaningful comparison to be drawn between the sentences imposed upon those co-offenders and the sentences imposed upon the applicant. That comparison, it is submitted, gives rise to a disparity in each case that satisfies the test in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. 
     
      
    24 The Judge spent some time in the course of the sentencing proceedings considering the question of parity. It has already been noted that the Judge ultimately considered the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders to be of minimal assistance. In summary, the Judge said :- 
     
      
       
        
        None of the other participants identified in the facts who have been dealt with committed the combination of offences carried out by this offender, or had been previously convicted of a large drug importation offence. Whilst the roles of some of the offenders might be able to be equated with respect to individual offences, at least to some extent, even in that regard there are clear differences. It was submitted that the trafficking case might be compared to the case of Carlos Garcia Sevantes (sic), but with respect, the facts were quite different. Carlos Garcia appears to have been warehousing drugs on behalf of others. He was caught in possession of some 5 kg of cocaine. The offender’s role in trafficking appears to be more significant. He was controlling both large quantities of drugs and receiving money from the sale of those drugs. He was apparently acting as a large-scale drug seller, even though it is also apparent that he was doing that at the behest of other people. There are also significant differences between the offender and Carlos Garcia. Garcia was 23 years of age at the time of the offence, with no convictions whatsoever. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court and received a discount of 25% on sentence. His total sentence was nine years imprisonment with a six-year minimum. 
         
        Another offender specifically referred to on sentence was the man Weterings. It was he who provided the factory unit for the washing of the drugs. He did so knowing that the drugs were in effect being manufactured in that unit. He received a sentence of seven and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four and a half years, but in that case the sentencing judge allowed him a discount of 40% due to his plea and assistance. Again, in my view, his role was vastly different to the role played by this offender, and whilst views might differ, in my view it was less significant. 
        
       
      
    25 The Judge indicated that, in addition to these two co-offenders, he had reviewed each of the remarks on sentence in relation to the co-offenders Julian Galego Lavelle, Jose Louis Acosta and Marie Simona Maldonado (the offender's wife). It is not submitted that any part of what the Judge expressed above is inaccurate. Rather, the submission is that the differences cannot explain the magnitude of the departure from the individual sentences imposed upon the relevant co-offenders. 
     
      
    26 The comparison now sought to be drawn by the applicant, between the sentence imposed on the applicant and that imposed upon the co-offender Weterings for the offence of aid and abet manufacture of commercial quantity of cocaine (34 kgs in each case), relies in part on a starting point of 29 years for the applicant, on the basis that the 25% discount was applied to the individual sentence. However, it does not appear that the Judge approached the sentence in that way.  
     
      
    27 No complaint is made about the Judge’s finding that this offence, albeit not at the top of the range, was “in the upper range of seriousness”. Nor is it submitted that the Judge’s assessment of the applicant’s criminality in respect of this offence erred in some respect. The Judge referred to the extremely large quantity involved, the fact that the applicant entered into the project knowing that the precursor materials had been imported from overseas, and the fact that the applicant had previously been convicted of a large-scale importation of cocaine and had served a lengthy period of imprisonment, having been released in late 1997. 
     
      
    28 Taking these matters into account, and having regard to the application of the discount to the aggregate sentence in the applicant’s case, the better analysis is that there was no “starting point”. A sentence of 22 years was thought to be appropriate to reflect the applicant’s criminality on this count, whereas a sentence of 12 and half years was considered appropriate in the case of Weterings, before the application of a discount of 40%. Thus, the alleged disparity resides in a sentence almost twice the length of the nominal sentence imposed upon Weterings, not three times greater, as the applicant submitted. 
     
      
    29 Some of the relevant factors that distinguish the applicant from Weterings are only obliquely mentioned by the Judge, when concluding that Weterings’ role was vastly different to that of the applicant. Weterings was introduced to the syndicate in mid-January 2006 and was arrested on 12 June 2006. The sentencing judge found that the offender was aware from the outset of the syndicate’s operation within his premises. He purchased a quantity of alcohol to be used in the extraction process, together with other items of hardware, on the instructions of others. In terms of this offender’s criminality, the sentencing judge found that ""he was not the organiser or importer of the drugs and had nothing to do with the planning. But his limited role, as set out, was described as ‘significant’ in that it allowed the cocaine production operation to continue for 10 weeks and produced 30 kg of cocaine.” Weterings had a minor criminal history for property offences and had never served a term of full-time imprisonment. He suffered from a number of health problems of an ongoing nature.  
     
      
    30 On the basis of these factors alone, there was ample justification for a sentence, on the most serious of the applicant’s offences, that was significantly greater than that imposed upon Weterings. Given the pivotal role played by the applicant in the enterprise and his criminal history, I am not persuaded that a sentence of 22 years is so disparate that it would engender in a reasonable person a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    31 On the charge of trafficking in a commercial quantity of cocaine (6 kgs), the applicant sought to establish disparity with Carlos Cervantes. However, Cervantes was charged with and sentenced for possession of a commercial quantity of cocaine, on the basis of his storage of 5.6 kgs of the drug for on-sale. Admittedly, this offence and the applicant’s offence carry the same maximum penalty, but there the similarity ends. Cervantes was described by the sentencing judge as “at least” in the middle of the drug trafficking hierarchy, having been recruited for the warehousing role by the applicant. A sentence of 9 years imprisonment, with a non parole period of 6 years, was imposed, after taking into account an early plea of guilty and prior good character.  
     
      
    32 Once again, taking into account the applicant’s senior role in the hierarchy, the fact that he was sentenced on the basis that he organised and controlled the supply of the cocaine into the community through a network of dealers, the fact that a further serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment had to be reflected in the sentence on this charge, and the applicant’s prior criminal history, I am not persuaded that the parity principle has any role to play in respect of the sentences imposed upon the applicant and Cervantes. The Judge was alive to these differences and sentenced accordingly. 
     
      
    33 That leaves the two money laundering charges. The amount of money the subject of count (iii) was more than $600,000:00. The applicant was recorded in a telephone conversation on 10 April 2006 confirming that he had given $740,000 to two co-offenders for the purposes of remitting money overseas. The amount of money the subject of count (iv) together with the offence on the schedule was $200,000:00. Similar conversations occurred in relation to the transfer of money, being the proceeds of cocaine sales, on 1 and 12 June 2006. Whilst these offences consist of discrete episodes of criminality, the Judge imposed wholly concurrent sentences on the basis that the offences involved ""the same activity committed around the same time with respect to the same general pool of money which had in turn been obtained from the sale of the same original quantity of drugs.""  
     
      
    34 The applicant seeks to compare the sentences of 10 years and 8 years respectively with the sentences imposed on the applicant's co-offenders, namely, Julian Lavalle, Jose Acosta and Maria Maldonado, with particular reliance on Lavalle.  
     
      
    35 The co-offender Lavalle was sentenced in relation to two counts of dealing with money being the proceeds of crime in the total sum of $450,000:00. A further offence related to possessing money reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime in the sum of $38,900. Lavalle was said to be central to the movement of money from Australia to South America. He was convicted after a long trial but had no prior criminal record. He was sentenced to an overall sentence of 8 years and 8 months. It is pertinent to note that one offence carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, another offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, and the possession count carried a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment. The sentences imposed on each charge were entirely concurrent, but for a period of two months. 36 The co-offender Acosta pleaded guilty to dealing with money being reckless as to the fact that it was proceeds of crime. It carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The charge related to the sum of $335,000:00. His role was below that of Lavalle. Acosta also had no prior criminal history. He received a sentence of 4 years and 3 months. 
     
      
    37 Maria Maldonado pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering to the total value of $480,000:00. Two offences carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, while the third carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. She had no criminal history. Mrs Maldonado received a total sentence of 6 years and 6 months imprisonment. 
     
      
    38 It is evident that all of these co-offenders were sentenced in respect of only one offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, and absent further offences on a schedule. The applicant faced two offences, each carrying a 20 year maximum penalty, together with the offence on the schedule which carried a 15 year maximum penalty. For these reasons alone, parity ceases to have any real significance. In any event, I reject the proposition that the Judge must be taken to have commenced the sentencing exercise on these counts at 14 years and 12 years respectively, for the same reasons outlined at [15]. In addition, the particular relevance of the applicant’s criminal history and the considerably greater sum of money comprehended by the applicant’s offences distinguish him markedly from these co-offenders.  
     
      
    39 Before leaving this ground, reference ought be made to a submission by the Crown that a comparison between co-offenders who are sentenced in relation to some, but not all, of a number of offences was of little value. Reliance was placed on R v Hoole (unreported) NSWCCA 17 March 1989, in particular the following aspect of Hunt CJ at CL’s judgment:- 
     
      
       
        
        Whenever a judge has to sentence an offender in relation to multiple offences, it is necessary for him to ensure that the total head sentence which he imposes does not exceed the period which is appropriate to the overall criminality involved in all of those offences.  
        It does not usually matter how that total head sentence is made up 
        .  
        Sometimes, it is appropriate to telescope the individual terms so that the total when they are added together does not exceed the appropriate figure 
        ; sometimes, it is appropriate to make concurrent some or all of the individual terms where otherwise they may have been ordered to be served cumulatively. 
         
        For those reasons, where two or more offenders are sentenced in relation to multiple offences (whether by the same or different judges), and where they are co-offenders in relation to some but not all of the multiple offences for which each was sentenced, there is little if any value in attempting to compare the individual sentences imposed upon the different offenders in relation to the same offence. 
        
       
      
    40 These remarks preceded the High Court’s decision in Pearce v The Queen by almost ten years. In the light of that decision, I doubt that the italicised passage from Hoole is still good law. Given that it is a discredited approach to sentencing for multiple offences that informed the conclusion in the second paragraph of Hoole above, this aspect of the decision is no longer persuasive.  
     
      
    41 I am mindful of the decision in R v Zabul [2001] NSWCCA 455 where Wood CJ at CL and Grove J applied the second paragraph from Hoole, set out above, in circumstances where three co-offenders received the same effective sentence for a series of armed robberies, although each of them were sentenced for a different number of offences, and one of the co-offenders was on a bond at the time. Zabul is the only post-Pearce decision of this Court that refers to this aspect of Hoole with approval. However, the Court was considering a parity argument based upon the aggregate sentence in each case, not one that sought to compare the individual sentences imposed in respect of each offence that was common to the three co-offenders. That may explain why there was no reference to Pearce v The Queen.  
     
      
    42 Ultimately, the Court in Zabul determined that any reduction in the sentence of the offender, assuming that disparity existed, would result in an inadequate sentence. That is the matter of principle for which Zabul stands : see R v Lam [2003] NSWCCA 162 ; (2003) 140 A Crim R 435.  
     
      
    43 In those circumstances, I would not approach the resolution of this ground in the manner suggested by the Crown. However, the applicant’s argument on this ground has no merit.  
     
      
      Whether the Sentences are Individually Manifestly Excessive. 
       
      
    44 Senior counsel for the applicant argued that the cases relied upon by the Crown during the sentence proceedings, for the purposes of inviting a comparison between the criminality of the applicant and the criminality disclosed by those cases, are themselves indicative of the manifestly excessive sentences passed in the applicant’s case. They are all cases concerning the importation of, or possession of, or attempting to possess, or conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of cocaine or heroin. They bear some relationship to the applicant’s offences in so far as an amount in excess of 2 kg of the relevant drug was imported in each case, and was in various stages of distribution. The maximum penalty in each case was life imprisonment.  
     
      
    45 The fact that the applicant was charged with a relatively new offence (manufacture), which captures the extraction of a drug from another substance after importation, is not a meaningful point of departure. However, as I have already noted, a fundamental and flawed step in the applicant’s argument is a “starting point” for the manufacture offence of 30 years, and for the trafficking offence, a “starting point” of 20 years.  
     
      
    46 An examination of those cases and others, where the circumstances of the offending correspond most closely with that of the applicant, tends to undermine this ground. Dealing first with the manufacture offence, and leaving to one side Crown appeals (R v Mo (2007) 169 A Crim R 60 ; R v El Hassan (2003) 141 A Crim R 346), the applicant’s submissions refer to two District Court sentences, R v Steven James 27 August 2004 and R v Chatman 8 September 2000.  
     
      
    47 The former was characterised as a middleman, involved in planning and financing a conspiracy to import 30 kgs of cocaine. James had a prior conviction in the USA for possessing 2 kg of cocaine. After a plea of guilty and the provision of assistance, together justifying a 50% discount, James was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Two factors are relevant to the comparison – James was not considered a senior player in the hierarchy and the offence was not complete. Notwithstanding these differences, a sentence of 20 years imprisonment before the application of the discount in James’ case suggests that there is nothing remarkable about the applicant’s sentence for an offence that resulted in the distribution of cocaine into the community. 
     
      
    48 Chatman is hardly a relevant comparator. He had no relevant criminal history, played a minor role as an electrician who was to be paid for opening an autoclave machine in which the cocaine had been imported, and was sentenced for attempting to possess a commercial quantity (17 kgs) of cocaine, after pleading guilty and offering assistance. 
     
      
    49 In Mazzitelli v Regina [2002] NSWCCA 436 ; (2002) 135 A Crim R 132, the offender (a co-offender of Chatman) was convicted after trial on a count of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine (17 kgs). Mazzitelli had an important role in arranging for the importation of the autoclave machine, although he was not responsible for planning the enterprise. He had no relevant criminal history and had never been in custody. This Court held that a sentence of 19 years and 8 months, after adjustment in accordance with s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), was not excessive. Relevantly, the Court remarked that a “starting point” of 28 years was not excessive. Once again, far from assisting the applicant, this decision supports the Crown’s contention that the sentence was well within range.  
     
      
    50 One further decision is worthy of note. In Wilfredo Roland Vasquez-Felipe v R [2006] NSWCCA 411 ; (2006) 167 A Crim R 321, this Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of 12 years and 6 months for an offence of aid and abet the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine (3.7 kgs). The offender pleaded guilty and had no relevant prior criminal history. He managed the importation of a number of suitcases, the lining of which consisted of a resinous substance. The offender then oversaw the extraction of the cocaine from the resin. The sentence was imposed after the application of a discount of 30% to a “starting point” of 18 years. The criminality of this offender mirrors the applicant’s criminality to a significant degree. When one factors in the applicant’s involvement in the importation of almost 10 times the quantity of cocaine, there is no scope for complaint.  
     
      
    51 I turn to the applicant’s argument with respect to the trafficking offence. The applicant refers to four District Court matters between 2003 and 2006. Three of them involve the possession or importation of lesser quantities of cocaine (between 1.5kgs and 4.15kgs) than the applicant’s case (6kgs). The remaining matter involved the possession (not trafficking) of 8kgs of cocaine by a person of prior good character. One other of the four offenders was of prior good character, while the other two had criminal records unrelated to drug offences. Bearing in mind those factors, the sentences ranged between 6 years, for attempting to possess 1.5kgs (a traffickable quantity), and 12 years 6 months, for possessing 8kgs. In my view, these decisions do not demonstrate that a sentence of 15 years for the trafficking of 6kgs of cocaine, taking into account a further offence of possession, and the applicant’s criminal history, was outside the Judge’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    52 In R v Otto [2005] NSWCCA 333, this Court substituted a sentence of 10 years and 6 months in lieu of a sentence of 14 years and 6 months for the importation of just over 2 kgs of cocaine. The offender had worn a corset under his clothing containing the cocaine. He had no criminal history and pleaded guilty at the Local Court. In R v Anderson [2004] NSWCCA 317, the Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of 14 years for being knowingly concerned in the importation of 7.55kgs of cocaine. The offender was one of three men who boarded an aircraft with blocks of cocaine strapped to their bodies. That sentence was imposed after trial and after adjustment in accordance with s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914. That suggests a sentence of about 20 years imprisonment since the repeal of s 16G.  
     
      
    53 In R v Mascaro-Varillas [2002] NSWCCA 524 ; (2002) 157 A Crim R 355, a sentence of 15 years imprisonment was upheld for an offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of 2.9 kgs of cocaine, after a plea of guilty. This was a sentence imposed before the repeal of s 16G, indicating a starting point of about 22 years. The offender was a principal with no prior criminal history.  
     
      
    54 The above examples are but a rough guide to the range of sentences imposed for Commonwealth offences dealing with quantities of cocaine between 2kgs and 10kgs. Direct comparison with sentences imposed for trafficking in a commercial quantity of cocaine under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) cannot be made, owing to the absence of reported cases. The Crown did not refer the Court to particular cases, either in NSW or elsewhere, in answer to the applicant’s argument on this ground. Notwithstanding the limitation on the above analysis, the range of sentences imposed in the cases to which the applicant referred are entirely consistent with the sentence imposed on the applicant for the trafficking offence, together with the offence on the schedule. In particular, Anderson and Mascaro-Varillas do not support the applicant at all. 
     
      
    55 The criminality of the applicant in the commission of this offence went well beyond the importation and possession of the cocaine. The Judge recorded in his sentencing remarks the circumstances surrounding the commission of this offence. In brief, once the cocaine had been extracted, it was stored in an apartment in Campsie, from which it was sold by the applicant via a network of dealers who were in regular contact with a co-offender. Moreover, the 5 kg of cocaine found in the apartment on 12 June 2006 was of a different origin to the cocaine extracted from the Lucuma powder.  
     
      
    56 There was evidence from telephone intercepts of the applicant's mobile phones indicating that between 10 April and 2 June 2006, the applicant was actively trading cocaine and accounting for the proceeds of sale to other offenders. During the applicant's interview on 12 June 2006 he admitted that between the middle of April and the beginning of May 2006, he sold 4 kg of cocaine to a Lebanese man and 1 kg to a Chinese man, each kilogram selling for $150,000, for which the applicant received a commission of $25,000. This offending called for a considerable term of imprisonment in its own right. For my part, I regard the Judge’s finding that this offence fell in the middle of the range of objective seriousness as a generous one. 
     
      
    57 The Judge also considered the money laundering offences as mid-range. No complaint is made about that characterisation of the offences. Sentences of 10 years and 8 years imprisonment are consistent with this finding. I do not accept that the Judge adopted a “starting point” of approximately 14 years and 12 years respectively. 
     
      
    58 The decision of Ansari v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 204 ; (2007) 173 A Crim R 112, cited by the applicant on this ground, is distinguishable on the basis that it was a Crown appeal, but more importantly, the offenders in that case were convicted of offences each carrying a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment. Whilst the amount of money involved in that case exceeded one million dollars, the mental element was one of recklessness, not intention. R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342 ; (2006) 167 A Crim R 436 also concerned an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment and was a Crown appeal. 
     
      
    59 In R v Guitierrez [2004] NSWCCA 22, the sentence initially determined for an offence of dealing in proceeds of crime in excess of $100,000:00 was 7 years. That sentence was then reduced in compliance with s 16G and by a further 15% for assistance. When seen in that light, the applicant’s sentences for laundering considerably larger sums of money do not seem excessive. 
     
      
    60 Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1 ; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 is not an appropriate case for comparison. The two offences the subject of appeal in that case carried a maximum penalty of 2 years and 15 years respectively. Both offences concerned a total of $240,000:00. 
     
      
    61 The sentence for one count of money laundering in the sum of $319,000:00 in R v Capar [2005] NSWCCA 402 was not in issue on the appeal. The sole ground was alleged error in the discount for the plea of guilty. A sentence of 6 years and 9 months was not disturbed by the Court. Like Guitierrez, this appears wholly consistent with the applicant’s sentence for one offence involving a much larger sum of money and with the sentence for another offence, which took account of an additional money laundering offence on a schedule.  
     
      
       
      Whether the Sentences are Collectively Manifestly Excessive. 
       
      
    62 The method of accumulation reveals that the applicant is to serve 14 years imprisonment before the sentence for the manufacture offence commences. The sentences for the money laundering offences commenced on the day the applicant was taken into custody (12 June 2006) and the sentence for the trafficking offence starts 5 years later. In effect, the applicant will serve a non parole period equal to the whole of the sentence for the manufacture offence. 
     
      
    63 This measure of accumulation must be considered against the background of the following remark by the Judge :- 
     
      
       
        
        The offender’s activity, whilst involving the commission of separate offences, can legitimately be seen as one series of logical steps being taken by a person who was involved in the manufacture of drugs, knowing that the precursor had been imported, through to the selling of those drugs and the laundering of the proceeds of the drugs overseas. …. In my view, they are separate offences and will require some degree of accumulation. On the other hand, any significant accumulation of the penalties could easily lead to a disproportionately long sentence when totality is considered. 
        
       
      
    64 There is no doubt that the applicant’s offences were very serious and that very little, if any, leniency could be extended to him in circumstances where a previous term of imprisonment for a like offence had done nothing to deter him. Both general and specific deterrence were important factors in the overall sentence to be imposed. Of particular relevance to the degree of accumulation is the fact that some of the cocaine, the subject of the trafficking charge, was not sourced from the product of the importation. The trafficking and the manufacture offence each carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Judge was correct to regard the range of aggregate sentence and aggregate non parole period suggested by the parties as an inadequate reflection of the totality of the applicant’s criminality.  
     
      
    65 The applicant and the Crown were unable to point to any other case of multiple offences of this nature. The applicant’s submission on this ground does however gain strength from the Judge’s error in the transcription of the Crown’s submission. The sentencing discretion has miscarried in the House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 sense, once it is accepted that the Judge took into account an erroneous consideration.  
     
      
    66 In R v Lee [2007] NSWCCA 234, McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Howie J and Hall J agreed, had regard to a schedule of national cases that were provided by the Crown, relating in part to the importation of cocaine above the commercial quantity. A perusal of that schedule at [36] reveals a number of offenders who received non parole periods ranging from 13 years to 26 years, and head sentences of between 18 years and life, for offences relating to the importation of quantities of cocaine ranging between 77kgs and 707kgs. Obviously, the quantity of the drug was but one factor in the assessment of criminality. The role of the offender in the importation was also of considerable importance. These sentences were imposed on offenders whose role was variously described as “important”, “mid-level executive”, “leading organiser”, “substantial”, “significant”, “crucial” and “critical”. Some had prior relevant convictions. 
     
      
    67 Of immediate relevance are the cases of R v Flavel [2001] NSWCCA 227, R v Gonzalez-Betes [2001] NSWCCA 226 and R v Campillo Vaquere [2004] NSWCCA 271. These three offenders were all involved in the importation of 172kgs of cocaine on a yacht from South America. They each played an important role in the organisation and supervision of the importation. Campillo Vaquere had a prior drug conviction. A life sentence was imposed in each case with non parole periods between 22 and 25 years for a single offence of importation.  
     
      
    68 Similarly, in R v Bartle & Ors. (2003) 181 FLR 1, two offenders who played leading organisational roles in the importation of 383kgs of cocaine on a vessel from Bora Bora via New Zealand, and who had previous drug convictions, received a life sentence with a non parole period of 25 years.  
     
      
    69 In R v Suarez-Mejia (2002) 131 A Crim R 564, R v Reaves (2004) 147 A Crim R 26 and R v Espiella-Velasco [2006] WACCA 31, three co-offenders, each with prior drug convictions and each with a pivotal role in the importation of 707kgs of cocaine from the US by ship, each received a life sentence with a non parole period between 18 and 26 years. 
     
      
    70 True it is that these offenders were sentenced in respect of one offence, but these cases provide some insight into the criminality inherent in a non parole period in the order of 22 years. Given the magnitude of these importations, it is difficult to maintain that the criminality of the applicant, even allowing for the combination of offences, is on par with these examples. In addition, the Judge was ultimately persuaded that a life sentence was not appropriate, but then proceeded to impose a non parole period that is generally consistent with such a sentence.  
     
      
    71 For these reasons, I have come to the view that the aggregate sentence and non parole period are manifestly excessive. The degree of accumulation requires some re-adjustment, although I would not be disposed to reduce the aggregate sentence to the level submitted by the Crown at first instance. The applicant’s criminality was greater than that submission suggested. 
     
      
       
      Re-Sentencing 
       
      
    72 An affidavit was received by the Court in the event that the applicant was re-sentenced. It establishes that the applicant is currently held at Lithgow and has undertaken vocational training. He is employed in a responsible position and has not had any disciplinary action taken against him.  
     
      
    73 The applicant is presently 52 years of age and has been a resident of Australia since he was 17 years of age. He has always been gainfully employed. His personal circumstances are unremarkable. He is of sound health, and has been separated from his wife of 23 years (a co-offender) for a number of years. There are three children of the relationship, who remain supportive of the applicant.  
     
      
    74 The Judge fixed a non parole period at about 60% of the aggregate sentence on the basis that the applicant would be elderly upon his release. There is no reason to depart from that proportion, given that the applicant will serve a very lengthy, albeit reduced, aggregate sentence.  
     
      
    75 I propose the following orders :- 
     
      
      (i) Leave to appeal granted and appeal allowed. 
      
     (ii) Quash the sentences imposed on 18 April 2008. (iii) On the offence of dealing in money being the proceeds of crime to the value of approximately $600,000:00, the applicant is sentenced to 10 years imprisonment to date from 12 June 2006, expiring 11 June 2016. 
     
      
      (iv) On the offence of dealing in money being the proceeds of crime to the value of approximately $150,000:00, the applicant is sentenced to 8 years imprisonment to date from 12 June 2006, expiring 11 June 2014. A further offence under s 400.5(1) of the  
      Criminal Code Act 
       is taken into account in imposing this sentence. 
      
     (v) On the offence of trafficking a commercial quantity of cocaine, the applicant is sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, to date from 12 June 2010, expiring 11 June 2025. A further offence under s 307.9(1) of the Criminal Code Act is taken into account in imposing this sentence. (vi) On the offence of aid and abet the manufacture of a commercial quantity of cocaine, the applicant is sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, to date from 12 June 2012, expiring 11 June 2034. (vii) A non parole period pursuant to s 19AB of the Crimes Act of 17 years is imposed, to date from 12 June 2006, expiring 11 June 2023. The applicant is eligible for release to parole on 12 June 2023.76 HARRISON J : I agree with Latham J.

      JUDGEMENT ON APPLICATION FOR A CERTIFICATE PURSUANT TO THE COSTS IN CRIMINAL CASES ACT 1967, SECTION 2 
      
    Introduction1 On 15 June 2009 the Applicant appeared for trial upon an indictment containing one count contrary to section 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence charged is included in the definition of prescribed sexual offence in s 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Accordingly, the evidence of the complainant was presented in camera, and I made an order proscribing the publication of her name or any information that would allow her identification. In keeping with that course, I shall hereinafter refer to her by her initials or the term “complainant”.2 Moreover, as the Applicant was acquitted at the conclusion of the Crown case, I shall not refer to him by name, the citation for this judgement will use his initials.3 The Crown alleged that Applicant, 
     
      
      On or about 2 November 2008 at North Strathfield, in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with A F without the consent of A F and knowing that she was not consenting. 
      
    4 The Applicant pleaded not guilty and a jury was selected. The trial proceeded until the close of the Crown case on 17 June 2009, whereupon counsel for the Applicant asked in the absence of the jury that I inform them of their right to return a verdict of not guilty at that point in accordance with the principle enunciated in R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161; 2 A Crim R 45. 5 I accepted the submission and when jury returned to the courtroom I directed them as requested. They retired and returned shortly thereafter to deliver their verdict of not guilty. Thereupon they were discharged from further service, and as there was no reason for the Applicant to be further detained he was discharged.6 Counsel for the Applicant thereafter foreshadowed an application for a certificate pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967. The matter was adjourned to allow the application to be prepared, and for the Crown to respond.7 The application was heard on 20 July 2009. Evidence was led from the Applicant’s solicitor, and correspondence was tendered. After submissions I adjourned the matter for my decision on Friday 24 July 2009. For reasons not relevant to this matter I was unable to sit that day and the matter was re-appointed to 23 July 2009 at 9:30 am when I announced my decision to grant the certificate, with my reasons to be published when revision of my draft was complete. I signed and issued the certificate settled by the parties.8 My intention was to publish my reason upon my return from the Goulburn sittings listed over the following two weeks, but because of a trial that extended well beyond the estimate it was given I was detained there until my return to Sydney on Tuesday 18 August 2009. The parties were informed that I would provide this judgement on or about 21 August 2009, and accordingly I now publish my reasons for the decision to grant the certificate.The Evidence at Trial9 Whether the Applicant was guilty or not guilty of the charge depended entirely upon the evidence of the complainant. If the jury were unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that she was reliable and credible, the only course they could properly take was to acquit the Applicant. In my assessment the complainant did not present as a credible witness. Moreover, the evidence from other witnesses called by the Crown offered but the barest support for her allegations and in many instances was diametrically opposed to what the complainant said.10 The Crown case was that the Applicant and the complainant were both serving members of the Royal Australian Navy deployed on different ships. In addition to his accommodation on his ship, the Applicant rented an apartment in a complex at North Strathfield with two other seamen. A number of defence personnel occupied apartments in this complex. The complainant lived on her ship.11 By Saturday, 1 November 2008 both the Applicant and the complainant had shared an intimate relationship of some months. That evening they attended a barbecue with a number of other male and female members of the service in an apartment downstairs from where the Applicant was living, during which they argued. The complainant alleged that she thereafter went to bed in the Applicant’s apartment, and that he later came into the bedroom, removed his clothing, and against her protestations had penile vaginal sexual intercourse. She reported the allegation to police the following Thursday.12 The complainant’s evidence included the following propositions: 
     
      
      ·  
      The night before the barbecue and the alleged sexual assault she stayed with the Applicant at the apartment. The next day they went to the beach together at Maroubra and returned about mid afternoon. 
       
      ·  
      About a quarter to seven she went to the barbecue in the courtyard off a downstairs apartment occupied by other naval personnel with whom they were friends. They were drinking alcohol at the barbecue, but the complainant said that she was in control notwithstanding the 6 to 10 drinks of bourbon and coke that she’d consumed. 
       
      ·  
      When she went downstairs to the barbecue the Applicant went to Homebush to pick up his former girl friend, Dale Kratzman, to bring her to the barbecue. 
       
      ·  
      About midnight the Complainant left the barbecue to retrieve her jumper from the Applicant’s apartment. She found the bedroom door locked, and so knocked and called out that she wanted to get her jumper. There was no response. She went to the balcony crying upon the realisation that he was in the bedroom with his former girl friend. In the apartment they argued about what had happened in the bedroom. The argument continued downstairs. 
       
      ·  
      She alleged that once things calmed, the Applicant asked whether she wanted to resolve their difference through sex. She said no, went upstairs, and dressed into her pyjamas and went to bed. The Applicant accompanied her to the apartment, but remained in the lounge room with a computer game. She watched a movie on a lap top computer for an hour, and then the Applicant entered the room and asked her if she wanted to have sex. She said no. He was undressed. He entered the bed, forced her pants off, forced her legs apart as she attempted to keep them together, and as she cried and repeated her requests for him to stop he penetrated her vagina with his penis. 
       
      ·  
      After this she rose from the bed, went to the bathroom and showered for half an hour feeling pain in her vagina and to her head from when it was pressed against the wall. She dressed and went to the apartment downstairs where she spoke to Michael Lloyd, one of the occupants there. She could not recall what she said, but he allowed her to sleep on his bedroom floor. 
       
      ·  
      The next morning she returned to the Applicant’s unit. He wasn’t there. She changed from her clothes and went to bed and slept.  
       
      ·  
      In the early afternoon she went with the Applicant to the beach at Maroubra, and alleged a conversation in which she told him that he had hurt her. She said that she went with him because she wanted to forgive him and didn’t want to lose their relationship. She stayed with him that night for the same reasons. 
       
      ·  
      On Monday she returned to work and spoke to her friends about the incident but couldn’t recall what she said. She spoke to an officer about all that occurred, but could not remember on what day she did so. 
       
      ·  
      She said that on the Sunday night she telephoned her father in Queensland but spoke to him only briefly as he was going out. She spoke to him again on the Monday night and told him what had happened, but could not recall what she said. In cross examination she was reminded of her statement, and that she there said she called her father from her ship about 1:30 pm on the following Monday and told him the Applicant had hurt her, and that he advised her to speak to someone on the ship. 
       
      ·  
      She said that she and the Applicant mutually ended their relationship on the Monday night. 
      
    13 The complainant was cross-examined on behalf of the Applicant in the course of which a number of propositions put to her were rejected. The witnesses who followed her gave evidence of those various propositions, which if true and correct, were inconsistent with her evidence regarding her conduct proximate to what she described as forceful sexual intercourse without her consent, made clear by her repeated requests for him to stop as she cried.14 Able Seaman Michael Lloyd occupied the apartment downstairs where the barbecue was held. He shared his apartment with another two servicemen. He described his recollection of the barbecue and of those who attended. All were drinking and he thought they were all intoxicated. About midnight he went to bed with a girl named Cindy. About half an hour later the Applicant came into the room and said that he and the complainant had argued. He said he wanted to end the relationship with the complainant. He appeared to be drunk. After about 10 minutes one of the others came in and took him away to speak with the complainant. Cindy also left the bedroom to speak with the complainant. She returned and remained with Mr Lloyd until he rose at 5:30 am the next morning to return to duty. He did not see the applicant or the complainant again, but saw the complainant later that night. 15 He returned home about 5:00 pm on Monday evening. The complainant came to the apartment sometime that evening, and in his bedroom told him of how she and the Applicant argued. She said that they tried to have sex, that half way through she said stop, but that he continued and used his body weight to keep her down, and pushed her against the wall striking her head. She said that she still loved him. She had a small lump on the back of her head. 16 The next morning, Tuesday, he walked with her to the train station. He subsequently went with her to the Kings Cross Police Station.17 In response to cross-examination he confirmed the statement he made to police when the events were fresher in his mind. He acknowledged the following: 
     
      
      ·  
      He saw no one sleeping on the floor of his bedroom in the early hours of the morning after the barbecue. 
       
      ·  
      He did not have any conversation with the complainant in the early hours of the morning after the barbecue. 
       
      ·  
      The complaint made by the complainant on the Monday evening was in terms that she was keen to have sex with the Applicant but half way through she wanted to stop. 
       
      ·  
      The complainant said that she was “pissed off” with the Applicant because of his contact with his former girlfriend. She was crying when she said this. She told him that she loved the Applicant, would be with him for a very long time, and was going to introduce him to her father. 
      
    18 Nicholas Rollins shared the apartment with Mr Lloyd. He first met the Applicant at the barbecue but knew the complainant from two earlier recent occasions. He described the barbecue and who attended. He met the Applicant’s former girl friend at the barbecue and spent time speaking with her. He spoke of the following: 
     
      
      ·  
      About 10:30 pm or 11:00 pm the Applicant took Ms Kratzman to his apartment so that she could use the bathroom.  
       
      ·  
      The complainant at the time was outside near the barbecue. About 10 minutes after they left she said that she was going to check on them. She returned about 15 or 20 minutes later, upset, with tears in her eyes. The Applicant and Ms Kratzman returned a minute or so after the complainant. 
       
      ·  
      The Applicant and the complainant went aside from the others and spoke together. He remained speaking with Ms Kratzman. 
       
      ·  
      About 1:00 am or 2:00 am the guests began to leave. Ms Kratzman was intending to stay and sleep on the lounge.  
       
      ·  
      The Applicant and the complainant came into the apartment yelling at each other. They were relatively drunk. Their argument continued for about half an hour. Ms Kratzman went to speak to the complainant, and Mr Rollins spoke with the Applicant who was crying and saying that the complainant didn’t trust him. Mr Rollins offered encouragement suggesting that her behaviour was because of the alcohol and that all would be well in the morning.

      He and Ms Kratzman slept in the lounge room, and Mr Lloyd and Cindy slept in his room. He was the last to retire, after some tidying up. He rose at 7:30 am, had some breakfast, and continued to tidy. The others progressively woke up, and eventually went outside to have coffee. These included Michael Lloyd, but Mr Rollins acknowledged that he might have been mistaken about his presence. 
       
      ·  
      The Applicant and the complainant came downstairs. They were together outside in the courtyard; she sat on his lap sharing hugs and kisses.  
       
      ·  
      The Applicant took Ms Kratzman home about 9:30 am or 10:00 am, and the complainant burst into tears. Thereafter the complainant began to ring him every 5 or 10 minutes. She did so perhaps 8 or 9 times. Mr Rollins heard the Applicant say he would be only 5 minutes in one of the calls when the complainant put her phone on loudspeaker mode. He saw a text message from the Applicant informing the complainant that he had just dropped Ms Kratzman off and would be back shortly. 
       
      ·  
      Later that day the Applicant and the complainant went out.  
       
      ·  
      The following day, Monday, he was a member of the group that travelled to work together by the train, including the Applicant and the complainant who sat together. 
       
      ·  
      He saw the complainant on Monday at work somewhere between 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm when she showed him messages on her phone from the Applicant. These were,  
      “I can’t do this any more. I’m struggling. It’s over.” 
       
      ·  
      He saw the complainant the next day when she said to him,  
      “I have some news. I was raped on the night of the barbecue.” 
      
    19 Donald Cantlon is another member of the navy who lived in this complex and attended the barbecue until 9:30 pm or 10:00 pm when he left to go to Parramatta. The next day he saw the complainant and the Applicant together. The complainant telephoned him after work on Monday and she met him in the driveway of the complex. She told him that there was an incident involving the Applicant on Sunday morning, that she said no, but that it wasn’t enough. She said that she had told her father and a friend. In cross examination he was reminded that she also told him that she had broken up with the Applicant that afternoon, and that the relationship had been the happiest she’d had.20 Matthew Carter is another member of the navy. He was sharing the apartment with Mr Lloyd and Mr Rollins. He knew the complainant vaguely before these events, and met the Applicant that night. At the barbecue he heard the Applicant and the complainant arguing but did not hear what was being said. He went into the city later in the night and returned in the early hours of the morning. When he woke up he went out into the courtyard and saw the complainant and the Applicant sitting beside each other talking. He went to work on Monday, and that afternoon at home, after work, spoke to the complainant. She told him she and the Applicant had broken up by text message. In cross-examination he confirmed that he saw the complainant and the Applicant hugging during the morning after the barbecue. After she said she’d been raped, she stayed in Michael Lloyd’s bedroom for about two weeks.21 Nigel James Davidson is a friend of the complainant. He said the complainant called him about 4:30 pm on the Monday 3 November 2008 and said she had a verbal argument with her partner, he went out drinking and came home drunk, and asked to have sex but she said no. She appeared to be upset. She called again about an hour later with the same information. In cross-examination he confirmed that she also said that she had not consented and that there’d been sex. Call charge records showed that a call was made to this witness from the complainant’s phone about 4:22 pm that day.22 GRF is the complainant’s stepfather. She has taken his name and I have therefore used his initials to protect her identity. He had not met the Applicant but was told of him by the complainant. He and the complainant have a close relationship. She called on Thursday, 6 November 2008 and told her mother that she wanted to speak to “my Daddy.” He knew by this that something was wrong. She said to him that the Applicant had taken advantage of her and that she’d said no. He had no recollection of speaking to her on the Sunday or Monday before. He said he would have remembered calls on those days if they were regarding what she told him on the following Thursday. In cross examination he was asked if she had said anything to him in terms that the Applicant had hurt her like what happened to his eldest daughter. He had no recollection of any such conversation, and knew of no such incident involving his eldest daughter.23 Christine McFadden is a serving member of the navy, and worked with the complainant on her ship. She was also at the barbecue and stayed the night at Mr Lloyd’s apartment. She has known the Applicant’s former girlfriend, Ms Kratzman, for three years. She gave evidence of the following: 
     
      
      ·  
      She saw the Applicant and the complainant arguing on the patio area at some time between 6:00 pm and about 9:00 pm when the complainant was yelling at the Applicant.  
       
      ·  
      Afterwards she went with the Applicant and Ms Kratzman to the upstairs apartment because she knew the complainant did not want the Applicant and Ms Kratzman to be alone together. They sat together on the lounge, but Ms Kratzman went into the Applicant’s bedroom because she did not want participate in conversation between Ms McFadden and the Applicant regarding the complainant.  
      
    24 At that point in her evidence the witness became quite emotional so I adjourned the trial until the following day when she gave the balance of her evidence. It was quite apparent that she found the stress of giving evidence about matters involving the complainant, her friend, overwhelming, and yet she did so ultimately with composure and clarity. I found her to be a credible witness. Her evidence continued with the following facts: 
     
      
      ·  
      Whilst upstairs the complainant came to the apartment, banged on the door and entered. The Applicant had gone to speak with Ms Kratzman in the bedroom. The complainant banged on that door. An argument between the complainant and the Applicant followed on the balcony.  
       
      ·  
      Ms McFadden and Ms Kratzman returned to the apartment downstairs. They slept there on the lounges that night. 
       
      ·  
      The complainant came downstairs crying and went into Mr Lloyd’s room, but Ms McFadden could not say for how long. She rose shortly before 6:00 am to go to work.  
       
      ·  
      On Monday at work before lunch the complainant told Ms McFadden that the Applicant had pushed her up against the wall and raped her, and she advised her to report the matter to the Duty Officer. The complainant showed her a small bump on the back of her head. 
      
    25 In cross-examination Ms McFadden was reminded of her statement. She agreed that the complaint to her could have been made either on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday after the barbecue. She spoke of her conversation with the Applicant during the barbecue when she expressed some confusion about his feelings. She said that the complainant had yelled out for the Applicant not to go up to his apartment with Ms Kratzman. When the complainant attacked the door at the apartment upstairs she was angry and it was as if she was trying to rip the door down. When the complainant returned downstairs she said that she and the Applicant were in the process of breaking up, but that she couldn’t lose him.26 The last witness to speak to these events was Dale Yvette Kratzman, the Applicant’s former girlfriend. I found her to be a credible witness. She has known the Applicant since October 2007 and they were boyfriend and girlfriend for about six weeks from January 2008. Her evidence included the following: matters: 
     
      
      ·  
      She confirmed that the Applicant took her to the barbecue and the following morning drove her home.  
       
      ·  
      She was introduced to the complainant as his girlfriend.  
       
      ·  
      About 6:30 pm or 7:00 pm she used the Applicant’s bathroom. When she came out the Applicant had come up with another young man.  
       
      ·  
      Later in the evening the Applicant was intoxicated and asked to speak with her. They went to his apartment. She asked Ms McFadden to go with them when the complainant told him not to go up there with her. The complainant was yelling, but she thought that the Applicant calmed her down.  
       
      ·  
      Upstairs he expressed his feelings, but she did not want to hear him speak of these matters and told him to speak with Ms McFadden. She went into his room and listened to music on her iPod to avoid the risk of overhearing the conversation. The Applicant came into the room and went to the lock the door, but she told him not to. She heard the complainant yelling outside,  
      “Don’t be in the room with her. Don’t be doing anything with her.”  
       
      ·  
      The Applicant went to open the door, but as he and the complainant were both pulling at it and thereby preventing it from opening, she accused him of having locked it and of cheating with Ms Kratzman.  
       
      ·  
      Ms McFadden took her downstairs, after telling her that she thought the complainant might attack her. She wanted to go home, but decided to sleep there. Mr Rollins was on one lounge, and she was on the other. They provided her with pyjamas.  
       
      ·  
      About twenty minutes after she returned downstairs there was a lot of screaming and yelling as the complainant and the Applicant came into the apartment. She said there were a series of text messages thereafter from the Applicant, to which she replied, from about 1:50 am until about 2:30 am along the lines of,  
      “What are you doing? I can't sleep. I don't want to be up here.” 
       He may have also said something like, “C 
      an I come down 
      .” He also called her from his mobile for a 30 second conversation at the conclusion of which he said,  
      ""Oh crap, she's coming now. I've got to go"". 
        
       
      ·  
      She woke about 6:30 am. Those present began tidying up whilst she sat with the complainant and talked. The complainant said that she hadn’t slept, that she was worried about the Applicant, that she loved him, and that she would do anything for him. In a later conversation the complainant asked whether the Applicant had said anything to Ms Kratzman.  
       
      ·  
      On Monday afternoon the Applicant sent Ms Kratzman a text saying that he was breaking up with the complainant. She next heard from him by text message sent as he was leaving the police station, telling her that the complainant had alleged the sexual assault. He told her that they’d had sex, but that it was consensual. 
      
    27 In cross-examination she was referred to her statement and acknowledged its contents. She said that she had not wanted to be involved in any embarrassment between her former boyfriend and his new girlfriend. She added that the complainant told her of boyfriends in the past who had cheated on her and her fear that the Applicant would do the same. She confirmed that the complainant had said to her, “He won’t talk to me. I love him so much. I’ll do anything for him. I just want to get away from here. We need to be alone.” She confirmed that she saw the complainant and the Applicant in the courtyard together the morning after the barbecue. He was standing and the complainant stood in front of him, pulled his arms around her, and held them against her stomach. He went and sat with others. She followed and she sat on his lap, but stood up when he told her she was hurting him. 28 Dr Rosalie Isaacs examined the complainant and confirmed the complaint of tenderness to the back of her head. There were no objective indicia of injury such as bruising, abrasion, or apparent swelling. Other evidence did not corroborate the complaints of pain and discomfort, including upon urination. The complaint attributed to the complainant on this occasion was in terms that in the early hours of Sunday, 2 November 2008, her partner came to bed; they had discussed sex earlier in the evening and she had refused to have sex; when he came to bed she again said no to sex; he came up behind her and held her down around her ribs with one hand while he pulled down her pyjamas with the other hand; he rolled her onto her back and lay on top of her. Traces of human blood were detected on the sheets and on the high vaginal swab taken at the examination were of no significance.29 The police officer in charge, Plain Clothes Senior Constable Dingle, gave uncontroversial evidence, and through him the Crown presented photographs of the premises, telephone call charge records, and the statements made by the complainant.The Prasad Direction30 There was no challenge to the complainant’s evidence of sexual intercourse at the time alleged. However, the other evidence presented did not support the evidence from the complainant that it was without consent. Indeed, in my opinion the evidence led was inconsistent with the proposition that it was without her consent. 31 First, the complaints attributed to the complainant by others were significantly different in the details provided. Secondly, there was no such complaint until after the Applicant terminated the relationship with his text message to the complainant. Thirdly, there was evidence of her patent jealously of the association between the Applicant and Ms Kratzman at the barbecue, and the following morning after the alleged offence. Fourthly, notwithstanding her description of an experience that could only have been humiliating, painful, and distressing, she was overtly affectionate with the Applicant the following morning, went to the beach with him that day, spent that night with him in his apartment, and travelled to work with him showing further affection. Fifthly, when he left to take Ms Kratzman home during the morning after the barbecue, she persisted in calling or sending text messages to him, thereby further demonstrating her anxiety over the Applicant and Ms Kratzman, further indicated in comments attributed to her about them in his absence. 32 This conduct does not sit at all comfortably with the allegation that the Applicant hours before had non-consensual and forceful sexual intercourse with the complainant. For these reasons, I came to the view that it was appropriate to inform the jury that they could return a verdict of not guilty at the close of the Crown case if that was their unanimous decision.Evidence Led Upon the Application33 The evidence given in support of this application came from the Applicant’s solicitor, Gerry Tzortzatos. On 4 February 2009 his firm sent correspondence to the police officer in charge with details of the instructions given by the Applicant, ultimately borne out by the evidence from the witnesses called in the Crown case. This was marked Exhibit 1. The letter sought further information, including with regard to the telephone communications relevant to the alleged offence to and from the complainant in the days following. The correspondence was copied to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.34 In response to this letter the police re-interviewed the complainant and provided a further statement taken from her on 25 February 2009. This was marked Exhibit 2. In paragraph 4, in contrast to the evidence she gave in the trial, the following appears, 
     
      
      After the incident when I had a shower I did go downstairs and speak with Michael Lloyd. By this stage the party had diminished after the argument. Michael was fairly intoxicated and I told him about the incident but because he was drunk I decided I would speak to him the next morning, but didn’t speak to him til (sic) the Monday. 
      
    35 Although this is more closely aligned with the evidence of Mr Lloyd, it does not sit comfortably with what Mr Lloyd said of the participation of Cindy with whom he slept that night, and her apparent role in attempting to calm emotions. Neither does it accommodate the recollections of the other witnesses about the distress of the complainant borne of her concern that the Applicant was engaging with Ms Kratzman.36 The statement also refers to the proposition that she did not complain to her stepfather as she claimed in her evidence in telephone calls to him on Sunday and Monday. The policeman taking the statement referred her to call charge records whereupon she remembered that she spoke to her father on the Sunday. Her statement provides the following recollection of that call: 
     
      
      … I can’t remember word for word but I think I said something along the lines of that KT hurt me and it was the same as the way Michael hurt Kylie. Kylie is my sister who was the victim of a Sexual Assault when I was very young. My sister is 13 years older than me. 
      
    37 She continued that her father was apparently busy, or that she was attempting to make the call when the Applicant was briefly out of the house, and so she told her father she would call him later in the week. She telephoned her father on Thursday and told him what had happened. These assertions are challenged by the evidence of her stepfather who was adamant that he would have remembered any telephone conversation in which there was even the implication of distress, and that he had no knowledge of any such incident involving the complainant’s sister.38 There are other representations in the statement regarding the telephone texts and communications. She confirmed that the Applicant sent her the message ending the relationship, and said there was further contact about her collecting property from his apartment, that they could remain friends, but that she did not know what she was going to do about the sexual assault. She claims in the statement that they decided mutually to end the relationship.39 She spoke of the Applicant retrieving his keys from her on the Tuesday, at which time nothing was really discussed. The statement then continues in paragraph 10, 
     
      
      Through that week, things got on top of me about what had happened and by Thursday I had decided to go to Kings Cross Police. 
      
    40 There is also an email between the Applicant’s solicitor and his counsel regarding a conference with another seaman, Matthew Gray, who returned to the apartment that he shared with the Applicant on the Sunday morning after the barbecue. This became Exhibit 3. Mr Gray is attributed with having seen the Applicant sitting on the couch, with the complainant lying with her head on his lap, watching television together. There was no complaint of any misconduct or injury. They both appeared to be “hung over”.41 Mr Tzortzatos gave evidence of the conference with Mr Gray. He acknowledged in cross-examination that he did not ask the police to take a statement from Mr Gray, and offered no reason for not doing so. I do not see this as an impediment to the success of this application. The police were responsible for the investigation of the matter, and were on notice from the correspondence Exhibit 1 of the instructions from the Applicant to his lawyers. Mr Gray was a co-tenant of the Applicant, and one would have thought that the investigation should have extended to his interview in light of the information that was offered by way of the outline of instructions clearly explaining the Applicant’s position regarding the allegations against him. It could not be said that the omission of those representing the Applicant in not requesting that Mr Gray be interviewed and a statement taken contributed to the continuation of these proceedings.42 If the trial continued beyond the close of the Crown case the Applicant was to give evidence and Mr. Gray was to be called in the defence case.43 Counsel for the Applicant has ventured the submission that upon a proper understanding of the material the Crown had to offer in this trial, it was always burdened with a complainant who was so wanting in credit that the outcome in the trial was inevitable, and accordingly, this is an appropriate case for the granting of the certificate sought: Regina v Hatfield [2001] NSWSC 334; Regina v Manley (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 per Wood CJ at CL at [206].The Legislation44 The Costs in Criminal Cases Act provides relevantly, 
     
      
      2(1) The Court or Judge … in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may: 
       
        
        (a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted …, or  
         
        (b) ..., 
        
       
      grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to  
      in section 3 
       and relating to those proceedings. 
      
     
     
      
      3(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge … granting the certificate: 
       
        
        (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and  
         
        (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. 
        
       
       
      3A(1) For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in section 3 (1) (a) to  
      all the relevant facts 
       is a reference to:  
       
        
        (a) the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and  
         
        (b) any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge …, and  
         
        (c) any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that:  
         
          
          (i) relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and  
           
          (ii) were not adduced in the proceedings. 
          
         
        
       
      
    Consideration of the principles to be applied45 It is for the Applicant to satisfy the Court that it was not reasonable to institute these proceedings: Regina v Manley ibid. Section 3(1)(a) of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act requires an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence and particularly the extent to which there is any inherent weakness in the prosecution case: Regina v Manley ibid per Wood CJ at CL at [14]. 46 There is no all-embracing statement of the circumstances in which it would be unreasonable within the meaning of these provisions to have instituted proceedings. Whether it was unreasonable in this case depends upon its own peculiar facts: R v John Fejsa (1995) 82 A Crim R 253. 47 Even in cases where there is a prima facie case it might have been unreasonable to prosecute. On the other hand an acquittal does not of itself indicate that a prosecution was unreasonable.48 The applicable principle is succinctly stated at Wood, CJ at CL in Regina v Manley ibid at [14]: 
     
      
      Given the wide variety of cases that might arise for consideration I am … reluctant to attempt any exhaustive definition of the test. It seems to me that the section calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence, and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt, or inherent weakness in the prosecution case. Matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder whether it be judge or jury.  
      
    49 His Honour’s remarks with regard to matters of judgement concerning credibility, demeanour and the like, are apposite.50 The critical question is that which is posed by paragraph 3(1)(a) of the Act namely, whether, if the prosecution had before the proceedings were instituted been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings: Mordaunt v Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWCCA 121 at [36-e]. At paragraphs [36] to [37] McColl JA extracted the relevant principles with reference to earlier authority.51 I have also reviewed the judgement of Blanch J in Regina v McFarlane (Unreported, Supreme Court, 12 August 1994) embraced in R v Fejsa ibid, and endorsed in Regina v Pavy (1997) 98 A Crim R 396, and by Wood CJ at CL in Regina v Manley ibid, whereupon his Honour expressed the views to which I have earlier referred.52 Consistent with comments made by Wood CJ at CL are the following remarks of Hunt J in Regina v Dunne (Unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 17 May 1990), 
     
      
      It would for example, be an unusual case in which it was held that it was not reasonable for the prosecution to allow a case to go to the jury simply because an issue of self defence – even a relatively strong case of self defence – was to be raised. Nor is it sufficient to establish this issue in favour of the applicant for a certificate that, in the end, the question for the jury depended upon word against word (leaving to one side the correct formulation of the onus of proof). In a majority of such cases, it would be quite reasonable for the prosecution to allow those matters to be decided by the jury. It would however, be different where the word upon which the Crown depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit. 
      
    53 Counsel for the applicant submitted that the complainant in this matter was so lacking in credit, of which there could be no doubt in light of the conflict between her assertions and the evidence given by the remaining witnesses, each of which gave evidence reflecting the content of their statements, each corroborative of the other but for matters of no consequence. It was submitted that if armed with that material immediately before the initiation of the prosecution, it would not have been reasonable for the prosecution to institute these proceedings. It was submitted that the case to be presented against the Applicant was always weak and that there was never any likelihood that he would be convicted. 54 I agree with this submission. The concluding words in the passage from the decision of Hunt J. are apposite. At the conclusion of the Crown case, as indicated earlier, I believed it appropriate to allow the jury to consider whether or not to acquit the Applicant at that point without further evidence or the submissions of counsel. My assessment of the complainant was that she did not present as a credible witness, that she was without any support from the other witnesses called, and that her evidence was inconsistent with the representations by the other witnesses called in the Crown case.55 There is no evidence of any act or omission of the Applicant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings: s 3(1)(b) Costs in Criminals Cases Act. The determination of the application turns upon the issue of whether it would not have been reasonable to institute proceedings if the Crown had at the time the Applicant was charged known all of the relevant facts exposed by the evidence adduced in the crown case at trial: s 3(1)(a) Costs in Criminals Cases Act; Regina v Hatfield ibid at [13].Conclusion56 This was a matter upon which the success of the prosecution depended entirely upon whether or not the complainant was to be accepted as accurate and credible beyond reasonable doubt in respect of the allegation that the Applicant had penile vaginal intercourse with her against her express rejection of his proposal that they have sex. It is true that the direct evidence of whether or not the sexual intercourse was without consent could only have come from the complainant and the Applicant. Had there been no other evidence, this would have been a case of word against word, which, in light of the aforementioned authorities, would have been a matter for determination by the jury. I would not have been prepared to issue a certificate in those circumstances.57 However there was a wealth of other direct evidence of facts and circumstances from which the only rational inference to draw in my opinion was that there was no sexual intercourse between the Applicant and the complainant without her consent such as she alleged. 58 I am of the opinion that if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts of which there was evidence at the close of the Crown case in the trial, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and that there was no act or omission of the Applicant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings.59 For these reasons I granted the certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminals Cases Act 1967.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: I invite Johnson J to deliver the first judgment.2 JOHNSON J: The applicant, Ahn Tuan Ta, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed at the Parramatta District Court on 15 August 2008 with respect to two counts of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon under s 97(2) Crimes Act 1900 and one count of attempted robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for twenty-five years. There is no standard non-parole period for this offence. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had pleaded not guilty to each charge and was convicted on all counts following trial by jury. Each offence was committed on 15 February 2007. The following sentences were imposed for the offences: 
     
      
       
      (a)  
      Count 2 
       - attempting to rob Colin McNamara of certain property, a quantity of cash, the property of St Patrick’s Tavern, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, a pistol - non-parole period of three years to date from 24 April 2007 and expire on 23 April 2010 with a balance of term of two years to date from 24 April 2010 and to expire on 23 April 2012; 
       
       
      (b)  
      Count 1 
       - robbing Christopher Walker of certain property, the sum of $49,605.00, the property of St Leonards Tavern, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, a pistol - non-parole period of four years to date from 24 April 2008 and to expire on 23 April 2012 with a balance of term of two years to date from 24 April 2012 and to expire on 23 April 2014; 
       
       
      (c)  
      Count 3 
       - robbing Daren Adler of certain property, the sum of $41,725.10, the property of the Madison Hotel, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, a pistol - non-parole period of four years to date from 24 April 2009 and to expire on 23 April 2013 with a balance of term of two years to date from 24 April 2013 and to expire on 23 April 2015. 
       
      
    5 The total effective term with respect to the three offences comprised a non-parole period of six years to date from 24 April 2007 and to expire on 23 April 2013 with a balance of term of two years to date from 24 April 2013 and to expire on 23 April 2015. The Applicant was arrested on 24 April 2007 and has been in continuous custody since that date.  
     
      
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    6 The sentencing Judge made findings of fact with respect to the offences. What follows is drawn from those findings.7 At about 1.34 am on Thursday, 15 February 2007, two men ran into the St Leonards Tavern, Pacific Highway, St Leonards (Count 1). One man was armed with a samurai sword and the second man was armed with a pistol. The two men had got out of a red Subaru WRX driven by the Applicant. The Applicant parked the vehicle and went to the door of the hotel, yelling to his accomplices to open the door. Each of the three men wore gloves and hoods which disguised their faces. Events inside the hotel were recorded by CCTV. The three offenders yelled at patrons and staff to stay on the ground. The manager was directed to take the offenders to the office and open the safe from which cash was removed and placed into a shopping bag. Whilst that was happening, one of the offenders took another staff member to empty money out of cash registers. The manager was then directed to open all the poker machines and remove cash from them. 8 The Applicant moved between various parts of the premises, ensuring that the patrons and security guards stayed down. At one point, he walked over to one of the security guards and told him to get up, at the same time pointing to the gun which the security guard had in his holster. The security guard feared that he was about to be shot. The Applicant directed the guard over to the bar area and walked away. During the course of the robbery, the three offenders communicated by way of two-way radio. One radio transmission overhead by witnesses expressed words to the effect “It’s all good, it’s all good, we’ve got it under control”. As they were leaving the premises, one offender was heard to say “Let’s go, let’s go”. A total of $49,605.00 was taken during the robbery. 
     
      
    9 The Applicant and his co-offenders then travelled directly into the city of Sydney. At about 1.45 am, they attempted to commit an armed robbery at St Patrick’s Tavern located in King Street, Sydney (Count 2). The Applicant parked the red Subaru WRX outside the hotel and the co-offenders forced their way through the locked front doors of the premises by kicking them in. CCTV footage depicted one of the offenders holding a gun and the other a samurai sword. Hotel staff, including a security guard, were in the process of closing the premises for the evening. When staff heard noises coming from the doors, they telephoned the police. They then fled into the fire stairs where they waited, until the offenders had left. CCTV footage from inside the hotel showed the offenders trying unsuccessfully to force open the bar till. After a short while, they fled and got back into the vehicle which quickly drove away.  
     
      
    10 The offenders then travelled to Surry Hills. At about 1.50 am, they committed another robbery at the Madison Hotel located at 52 Devonshire Street, Surry Hills (Count 3). They were observed to arrive in the Subaru vehicle which stopped directly outside the hotel. Two of the offenders ran into the premises and confronted staff. One offender was armed with a samurai sword and the other with a pistol. One of the bar staff, Matthew Bevan, attempted to escape by running outside. When he did so, the Applicant, who had remained in the car, drove it directly at him. This forced Mr Bevan to take cover behind a vehicle parked nearby in order to avoid being hit. The Applicant yelled out to him “Get inside or I’ll fucking shoot you”.  
     
      
    11 Once inside the hotel, the two co-offenders ordered staff to the ground before gaining access to the cash registers. One offender confronted the hotel manager and required him to open the hotel safe and remove cash from it. Whilst doing this, the manager heard the offender say “Check the two-way”. Just before they fled the hotel, one robber spoke into his two-way radio and said “Yeah, Ok, Ok” and then yelled out to the second robber “Let’s go, let’s go”. A total of $41,725.10 in cash was taken and the three offenders sped away in the Subaru vehicle. 
     
      
    12 At about 10.15 pm on Friday, 16 February 2007, the red Subaru was located in Alexandria on fire. The fire was extinguished and a search of the vehicle revealed, amongst other things, a sledgehammer, 11 poker machine cash boxes, the remains of a scanner or portable radio and the remains of two samurai swords. Subsequent examination of the vehicle established that it had been stolen from Alexandria on 20 December 2006. 
     
      
    13 During the period prior to the offences, the Applicant’s telephone was the subject of a telephone intercept warrant. A number of telephone calls were intercepted between the evening of Wednesday, 14 February 2007 and the afternoon of 19 February 2007 which provided cogent evidence of the Applicant’s involvement in the subject offences. 
     
      
    14 The Applicant was arrested at his residence on 24 April 2007. Execution of a search warrant upon the premises revealed, amongst other things, a Subaru ignition module with a key in it, these items being capable of starting and running a 2000 model Subaru Impreza WRX. The Applicant was interviewed by police and denied his involvement in the offence. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    15 The Applicant was born in August 1983. He was 23 years old at the time of the offences and 25 years old at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    16 The Applicant has a prior criminal history. In 2001, he had convictions which resulted in control orders in the Children’s Court for using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension, larceny, driving a conveyance without consent of the owner, assault police and entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offence. 
     
      
    17 In February 2003, the Applicant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment for three offences of driving whilst disqualified.  
     
      
    18 Between 2003 and 2005, the Applicant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment for aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence and assault police officer in the execution of duty causing actual bodily harm. 
     
      
    19 On 30 November 2005, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, with a non-parole period of 12 months, for driving whilst disqualified. The present offences were committed on 15 February 2007 whilst the Applicant was on parole.  
     
      
    20 A pre-sentence report recorded that the Applicant’s past response to supervision ranged from superficial to complete non-compliance.  
     
      
    21 The Applicant was born in a refugee camp in Hong Kong to parents of Vietnamese descent and had come to Australia in 1985. He has a history of illicit drug use and problem gambling.  
     
      
    22 A psychological report was also tendered on sentence which touched upon aspects of the Applicant’s background and offending behaviour.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    23 The Applicant advances the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ground 1 - the learned sentencing Judge erred in relation to the degree of partial accumulation.  
       
       
      (b) Ground 2 - the sentences were manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    24 It is appropriate to consider the grounds together. 
     
      
    25 Ms Nash, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that the sentencing Judge erred by imposing a period of partial accumulation of 12 months in respect of each of the individual sentences. It was submitted that a greater degree of concurrency was appropriate in the circumstances. She submitted that all three offences were part of the one criminal episode, emphasising the relatively short period of time over which the three offences were committed. Whilst accepting the sentencing Judge’s description of all three offences as being very serious and sophisticated criminal offences, it was submitted that the criminality of the attempted robbery offence was of a lesser order than that of the actual robberies and that this ought to have been reflected in the sentence passed. 
     
      
    26 It was noted that the sentencing Judge had found special circumstances and had fixed a non-parole period which was 60% of the head sentence on the attempted armed robbery offence and 66.67% on each of the armed robbery offences. However, as a result of the partial accumulation of 12 months for each sentence, the effective non-parole period comprised 75% of the effective total term.  
     
      
    27 Whilst acknowledging that the determination concerning accumulation and concurrency is essentially discretionary, it was submitted that error was revealed in the sentences imposed in this case. 
     
      
    28 With respect to the second ground, it was submitted that the sentences imposed upon the Applicant were manifestly excessive as a result of the suggested error with respect to accumulation, so that some other sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    29 The Crown pointed to submissions made in the District Court where it was accepted by the Applicant’s then counsel that a degree of accumulation with respect to each sentence was appropriate. In this Court, it was contended for the Applicant that this submission advanced at first instance was erroneous. The Crown submitted that these were three entirely unrelated serious offences, two of which resulted in substantial amounts of money being obtained. The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the sentencing Judge’s approach to accumulation and totality for these serious crimes. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    30 An assessment whether offences form part of the same criminal enterprise is relevant to the question of concurrency and accumulation of sentences: Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 14 at [12]; R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [48]-[52]; R v Fadi Jajou [2009] NSWCCA 167 at [56]-[61]. 
     
      
    31 In my view, the present offences ought not be treated as forming part of the one criminal enterprise. These were three planned and co-ordinated offences, two of which involved completed offences of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon and one of which involved an attempted offence of the same type. In effect, the Applicant and his co-offenders, using a stolen vehicle, “hit” three separate licensed premises one after the other in different parts of Sydney. A pistol and sword were brandished and persons were threatened and put in fear. There were three separate groups of persons who where terrorised by the offenders. More than $91,000.00 in cash was obtained from two of the premises. The robbers were disguised and wore gloves, and used two-way radios to communicate with each other. The offences reflected a significant degree of criminal professionalism, executed with a degree of military precision. 
     
      
    32 The proper exercise of sentencing discretion demanded a degree and, in my view, a significant degree, of accumulation of the sentences to be imposed for the three offences. The Applicant has not demonstrated any error which could operate in his favour with respect to accumulation and totality in this case. 
     
      
    33 To the extent that complaint is made concerning the degree of accumulation for the attempted armed robbery offence, I detect no error on the part of the sentencing Judge. A shorter sentence was imposed for this offence, and the degree of accumulation allowed was open to his Honour. 
     
      
    34 His Honour made a generous finding of “special circumstances” leading to the imposition of a non-parole period for each offence which was less than 75% of the full term. The Applicant complains, however, that the total effective non-parole period represented 75% of the total effective term of imprisonment. Section 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is concerned with the relationship between the full term and the period on parole in relation to each particular offence for which an offender is being sentenced. When sentencing for multiple offences, s.44, although not irrelevant, does not mandate a relationship between an overall non-parole period and the remainder of the overall sentence: Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [11]. The Applicant has not demonstrated error in this respect. 
     
      
    35 Even if some error had been demonstrated with respect to sentence, the Applicant has not demonstrated that some lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed for these three offences: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Indeed, the sentences imposed were, in my view, lenient for offences of this gravity. The objective seriousness of these offences was high. The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for 25 years. The offences were committed whilst the Applicant was on parole and his subjective circumstances did not assist him on sentence. Far from the sentences being manifestly excessive, they were lenient having regard to the circumstances of the offences and the offender. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    36 It has been the practice of this Court to readily grant leave to appeal against sentence. The question whether leave ought be granted should remain a live one, to be considered by reference to the merits of the application. The present application is devoid of merit. 
     
      
    37 In my view, leave to appeal against these sentences ought be refused.38 BASTEN JA: I agree leave to appeal should be refused for the reasons given by Johnson J. This course should be adopted as an indication of the Court’s opinion as to the lack of real prospects of the proposed appeal.  
     
      
    39 RS HULME J: I also agree with the orders proposed and with Johnson J’s reasons. I would, however, go further. I regard the sentences that were imposed as manifestly inadequate. That that is so is demonstrated by a brief comparison of the circumstances here with those which were contemplated by this Court in the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
     
      
    40 In that case, the Court said that an appropriate sentence for one offence in the circumstances there considered was a sentence which involved a full term of imprisonment of between four and five years. Here the effective full term imposed on the three offences was eight years.41 I turn to the comparison of the circumstances outlined in R v Henry and those here. The first referred to in Henry was “a young offender with no or little criminal history”. The Applicant here, aged 24, might have come within the description “young offender”; he did not fall within the description “with no or little criminal history”. Apart from a significant number of driving offences, he had 10 convictions for offences of dishonesty, including three for aggravated break, enter and steal.  
     
      
    42 The second situation contemplated in Henry was “weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury”. That description reflected the fact that Henry was concerned with an offence under s.97(1) and which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 20 years. The offence here was under s.97(2) and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 25 years. The presence of a samurai sword and pistol in this case demonstrates greater seriousness. 
     
      
    43 The third matter contemplated in Henry was a “limited degree of planning”. Here it is clear the planning was extensive and the three offences were carried out, as the sentencing judge observed, “with military precision”. 
     
      
    44 The fourth matter in Henry was “limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof”. The circumstances here, with one qualification to which I will come, were comparable. 
     
      
    45 The fifth matter in Henry was “victim in a vulnerable position, such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver”. Clearly, the employees subjected to the threats here answered that description. 
     
      
    46 The sixth matter in Henry was “a small amount taken”. In the two completed offences here $49,000.00-odd was taken in one and $41,000.00 in another. By no stretch of the imagination could those sums be regarded as being anywhere close to the prescription of “a small amount taken”. 
     
      
    47 The next matter in Henry was “a plea of guilty”. Here, there was no plea of guilty and that distinction alone would tend to increase the sentence from the range envisaged in Henry by something of the order of one-third. 
     
      
    48 The qualification to which I referred earlier when I mentioned “limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof” is as follows. In R v Henry it was contemplated that the threat would be to one victim. In the case of each offence here, there were a number of victims, each of whom was subjected to the trauma of being threatened with a gun and/or samurai sword. The fact that there were so many more victims alone would have justified a very substantial increase in the sentence by comparison with that of Henry. 
     
      
    49 It is incomprehensible that, having referred to Henry in his remarks on sentence, his Honour did not reflect the differences to which I have referred in the sentences he imposed.  
     
      
    50 There is one other matter to which I would refer. His Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to aggravating factors the Crown submitted and I agree that there is a record of previous convictions relevant only on the question of individual deterrence.”  
        
       
      
      
       
      That proposition is wrong. It flies in the teeth of what the High Court said in  
      Veen v The Queen (No 2) 
       (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477-478. 
       
      
    51 I regret the fact that, as a practical matter in the absence of a Crown appeal, this Court is not able to substantially increase the effective sentence imposed.  
     
      
    52 BASTEN JA: The order of the Court is: 
     
      
       
        
        Refuse the application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by the District Court on 15 August 2008.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: Jamie Wayne Lee Aslett (the appellant) was tried before a jury in the District Court at Parramatta in respect of four charges, each said to have been committed on 29 May 2006. The charges were: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        Aggravated take and drive motor vehicle with person therein (contrary to s 154C(2) 
         Crimes Act 
         1900) (“the Act”). Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non parole period of 5 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        Aggravated take person with intent to obtain advantage (contrary to s 86(2)(a) of the Act). Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 20 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: 
         Aggravated indecent assault (contrary to s 61M(1) of the Act). Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 7 years with a standard non parole period of 5 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: 
         Robbery in company (contrary to s 97(1) of the Act). Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 20 years. 
        
       
      
    3 Mr Aslett pleaded not guilty to each count. After a short trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of all charges. On 8 May 2008, the appellant was sentenced to an aggregate term of 8 years 6 months with a non parole period of 6 years. The earliest date upon which Mr Aslett will be eligible for parole is 9 November 2013. 
     
      
    4 Mr Aslett appeals against his conviction in respect of all offences. He also seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    5 Before going to the Notice of Appeal, I should briefly describe the circumstances relied upon by the Crown as giving rise to each offence. 
     
      
       
      The incident. 
       
      
    6 The complainant was a female student aged 20 years. On Monday 29 May 2006, she went to a cafe in Parramatta at about 9.00 pm to meet two friends. She was driving her father’s car, a red Ford Mondeo. She parked in a carpark behind the cafe. 
     
      
    7 At 10.45 pm or thereabouts, she left the cafe. She was alone and crossed the carpark, which was almost empty. She went directly to her car and once sitting behind the driver’s wheel, placed her bag beside her. As she was about to start the car, there was a knock on the window. She saw someone standing outside the vehicle on the passenger’s side. He had his hand back as if to punch the window. She turned her head away as this person punched the window, shattering the glass. The police later searched the carpark and found glass. 
     
      
    8 The complainant quickly learned that there were in fact two men outside her vehicle. One entered through the front door, telling her to get into the back. The other entered the vehicle through the back door. She squeezed between the driver’s seat and the passenger’s seat into the back. The man in the back then directed her to get down. He pushed her head so that she was in a “crunched up ball position”. She remained in that position throughout her ordeal. She never saw the face of either man and was therefore in no position to describe them or identify them.  
     
      
    9 A demand was made for her bag, her phone and her money. She told them where the bag was, which they then searched. She had two mobile phones, $80 in cash and an ATM card. She was asked how much she had on the card. She said that she was not sure. She was also unsure of the location of the nearest ATM. The driver, at this point, threatened her. He reached behind and put his hands down the front of her pants saying: “Don’t fucking lie”, or “Don’t lie or we’ll rape you.” He demanded her PIN number, which she provided. The car was started and the search began for an ATM.  
     
      
    10 The car was driven to the Tollgate Hotel at Parramatta, where there was an ATM. She was asked to repeat the PIN number, which she did. The driver repeated it back, but did so incorrectly. He then got out of the vehicle and entered the hotel. The other man remained in the back of the vehicle throughout. 
     
      
    11 The driver returned to the vehicle within a short time, saying that the PIN number was incorrect. She was told to type her PIN number into the phone, which she did. As she did so, she said that there was a daily limit of $800 on the account. The driver then left the vehicle and returned a short time later. 
     
      
    12 Bank records relating to the complainant’s account were tendered as part of the Crown case. There were two transactions late on 29 May 2006. The first was at 11.06 pm when an incorrect PIN number was entered. The second was at 11.10 pm when $800 was withdrawn. 
     
      
    13 The complainant, in her evidence, said that at one point the person in the back put his hand over her mouth and nose. She noticed there was material, maybe a glove, on his hand. He also touched her breasts and buttocks on the outside of her clothing. In contrast, when she described the action of the driver in putting his hand down the front of her pants, she made no reference to material or gloves. 
     
      
    14 Once the driver returned with the money, the vehicle left the carpark. The person in the back returned her purse, saying that all her cards were still inside it. A short time later the vehicle stopped. She was told to get out and not to look at them as she did so. She did as she was told. The vehicle then drove off. She had been inside the vehicle for a little over thirty minutes. The vehicle was later recovered by the Police near the Parramatta Leagues Club, where it had been abandoned. 
     
      
    15 Once released, the complainant went to a Thai restaurant which was nearby and made a 000 call. The call was made at 11.20 pm and was recorded. As she spoke to the operator, she looked through her purse and discovered a photo identity card. The recorded conversation was in these terms: (Exhibit C) 
     
      
       
        
        “XIAN: He even left his licence here with me. 
        
       
       
        
        Operator: You’re joking. Does it look like him? 
        
       
       
        
        XIAN: I didn’t see him but the name is Jamie Wayne Lee, it’s a photo card.” 
        
       
      
    16 The photo identity card was that of the appellant. It was a plastic card the same size as a driver’s licence, with a photo of the appellant. However, it was blue, unlike a driver’s licence which is white and yellow. 
     
      
    17 There was no challenge to the complainant’s evidence. The Crown case included CCTV footage taken at the entrance to the Tollgate Hotel between 11.00 pm and 11.10 pm. It showed a male person approaching and speaking to the security guard at 11.02 pm. The same male person then approached again and, on this occasion, entered the hotel. He was shown leaving at 11.05 pm. He returned at 11.08 pm and then left once more at 11.09 pm. Two frames from this footage became Exhibit O. They were of poor quality, not clearly showing facial features. They did, however, give some indication of the clothing worn by the driver. The person was depicted wearing a white jacket, a black T-shirt which had white writing in two locations, and a black baseball cap with a white logo on the front. 
     
      
    18 The security guard from the Tollgate Hotel was called to give evidence. Indeed, it was his evidence which is said to give rise to the errors which are the subject of this appeal. When giving evidence, he made an in-court identification, which I will shortly describe. Before going to that evidence, I should refer to an aspect of the police investigation, which is relevant to the security guard’s testimony.  
     
      
    19 After the 000 call, the complainant was interviewed by the police in the early hours of 30 May 2006. The police took possession of the photo identity card of the appellant. They then obtained a search warrant in respect of his home. At 7.20 pm on 31 May 2006, a search was conducted pursuant to the warrant. A dark baseball cap was found in what was described as “the first bedroom”. It had a white motif of the New York Yankees on the front. The police also took possession of a black T-shirt which had been hanging on the clothesline. There was white writing on the front of the T-shirt in two locations. With some charity, the cap and the T-shirt broadly resembled the cap and the T-shirt in the photographs extracted from the CCTV footage (Exhibit O). On 28 June 2006, that is almost a month later, Mr Aslett was arrested. Upon arrest he was photographed from various angles. The photographs ultimately became an exhibit (Exhibit S). They were professional photographs and very clear. 
     
      
    20 Returning to the day of the incident, the police interviewed the security guard within a short time of the occurrence. He had started work that evening (29 May 2006) between 9.00 and 10.00 pm. He recalled an altercation where he was attempting to calm those involved. As this was happening, he noticed someone approaching the entrance to the hotel, who appeared to be under age. He also noticed a red Ford Mondeo in the carpark. He asked for identification. The person produced his driver’s licence. He was then allowed into the hotel. Shortly after, he came back out. He went to the car, checked the “trunk”, and came back to the hotel a second time. 
     
      
    21 The security guard said that he had “two good looks at him”. He was young, very jumpy and nervous. He provided the following description: (T 28: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “A. He had a ponytail at the time, long hair, baseball hat, very short and small, baby face.” 
        
       
      
    22 When cross examined, the security guard elaborated. He said that the man was about 150 cm tall, or even shorter (T 35). He was a “short guy with a pony tail”. He added: (T 36) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. ... You told the police that the – one of (the) things you noticed about this person that stuck out was the amount of hair, is that right, lot of hair? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the other thing that stuck out for you about this person you saw at the hotel was that person had long sideburns? 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    23 The security guard also said he had a goatee beard. He was wearing a white T-shirt and cargo pants. 
     
      
    24 Having given a statement on 1 June 2006, incorporating this information, the security guard was interviewed a second time after the appellant had been arrested and photographed. On 6 July 2006 he was shown an array of photographs, that is, five weeks after the incident. The array included the photographs of Mr Aslett. He said this: (T 36) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And it was done on a computer screen, and each individual photograph came up and you were able to look at them and you were asked to sign a form at the end as to whether or not you could identify anyone is that right? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that’s after you’d looked at these photographs? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And there was a question in that form to the effect that you were not -- 
         
        A. Sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No, I’ll just read out the question to you, and this is at the end having looked at all of these photographs the 20 of them, you were asked this question, have you seen any of these persons under any circumstances, and you answered, no I haven’t, is that correct? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that was a form filled in by the officer who did this photographic display is that right? 
         
        A. Mm that’s correct.” 
        
       
      
    25 As mentioned, when the security guard gave evidence, he identified the appellant, who was then sitting in the dock. I will deal with that evidence more fully below, in the context of Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    26 Evidence was tendered that a number of items were sent for fingerprint analysis. No identifiable fingerprints were found. Various items were tested for DNA, but no match was found. Neither the black T-shirt nor the baseball cap seized from the appellant’s home was tested for DNA. 
     
      
    27 The appellant gave evidence denying each charge. He acknowledged, however, that the photo identity card was his. It had been issued on 21 April 2006 (Exhibit B). The identity card, incidentally, depicted the appellant facing the camera. He appeared to have relatively short hair. He said that on 29 May 2006, the day of the incident, he looked the same as in the photo identity card (T 122: 7.11.07). He said he did not have the card with him that night. He only carried it with him when he wanted to buy cigarettes or enter a hotel. He had a number of cousins and they regularly swapped clothes. He provided an elaborate account of his whereabouts that evening.  
     
      
    28 The appellant also said that he was not wearing the black T-shirt that night. He had a number of hats, but could not recall a black cap with a New York Yankees logo on it. He said that he had never had long sideburns, nor a goatee beard. Indeed, he could not grow facial hair, except in a small area on his chin, “about 20 hairs, if that” (T 123). When cross examined he was not asked whether he ever had a pony tail. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    29 The conviction appeal identified two grounds as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1: 
         The trial miscarried owing to the failure of the Judge to discharge the jury on the application of trial counsel following the in-court identification by Mr Bozkent, the security guard, of the appellant whilst he was in the dock. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2:  
        The trial Judge erred in failing to give adequate directions in relation to the identification evidence. 
        
       
      
    30 The sentence appeal identified the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1:  
        The sentencing Judge erred in failing to properly apply the standard non parole period in relation to Count One (aggravated taking and driving a motor vehicle) such that he failed to determine an appropriate sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2:  
        The sentencing Judge erred in fixing terms of imprisonment when sentencing the applicant for offences carrying standard non parole periods as s 45(1)  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999 prohibits this. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3:  
        The sentences are erroneous as they contain an element of double punishment for the fact that they were committed by the applicant while he was on parole. 
        
       
      
    31 I will begin by dealing with the conviction appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Refusal of application to discharge. 
       
      
    32 The Crown opened the case before the jury, describing the events of that evening. The assumption was made that Mr Aslett was in the back seat and his companion was the driver. That, no doubt, was a reasonable assumption on the material then available, since the security guard had seen the driver and had then not identified Mr Aslett when shown his photograph. The prosecutor said this: (T 7: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “... the Crown says that one of the persons got into the driver’s seat and another one, the accused, got into the rear seat. There is various demands for the money and phone and she was searched.” 
        
       
      
    33 The Crown then provided the jury with an outline of the case against Mr Aslett in respect of the aggravated indecent assault, again describing the actions of the person in the back seat, not those of the driver: (T 7: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that while the accused was searching her the accused ran his hands over the complainant’s buttocks and breasts ... ” 
        
       
      
    34 The Crown later added these words, again describing the actions of the person in the back seat: (T 7: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “At one stage the Crown says the accused placed his hands over the complainant’s eyes and nose and she could feel material on his hands and the Crown says that that’s indicative that the accused in the back seat was wearing gloves and the Crown says that is important because there was forensic or scientific examination of the car and no fingerprints were found.” 
        
       
      
    35 According to the Crown, only the driver left the vehicle. The back seat passenger remained with the victim.  
     
      
    36 When the security guard was called, he gave an answer, identifying the accused who was then in the dock. The transcript is as follows: (T 26: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And while talking to those men, trying to calm them down, did you notice anything or any one approaching? 
         
        A. Just this gentleman behind you was coming up to the pub and – “ 
        
       
      
    37 Counsel for the appellant, in the absence of the jury, made an immediate application for a discharge. He referred to the in-court identification and said this: (T 31: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “... In my submission it can’t be overcome by any directions and so what we have before the jury is a witness, a very crucial Crown witness, purporting to identify this man in court.” 
        
       
      
    38 The debate on the discharge then began. It included the following exchange: (T 31/32: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I might be a bit confused but isn’t it your case that the accused was in the back of the car and remained in the back of the car throughout. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, our case is the accused is the driver your Honour. There’s something I have to correct on my opening but -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well then I was totally confused. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That was based on your Honour that I said the person groped her, sorry touched her breasts and buttocks and that turned out to be the person in the passenger seat. But your Honour I’ll have to correct that in front of the jury ...” 
        
       
      
    39 His Honour repeated that he was confused because he thought “it was the other way round”. The Crown prosecutor then said this: (T 32: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
         “I think I may have gotten myself confused when the witness herself said that she was touched on the breasts and buttocks by the person sitting next to her ...” 
        
       
      
    40 But the Crown, wrongly, wished to take full advantage of the identification. He said this: (T 32: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: ... Well your Honour it’s very interesting in fact had he picked the photo, the person from the photo identification array, your Honour would have had to have warned the jury about the fact that photos are only two dimensional, that mistakes are made. He comes back into court and sees the person in full 3D. It wasn’t a line-up, it was a photo array, just not enough and it’s a matter for the jury in the end what they make of the fact that when looking at photos he couldn’t pick someone but when he saw him alive and in the flesh he was able to say – “ 
        
       
      
    41 Counsel for the accused then responded in these terms: (T 33: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “WILLIAMS: -- cases such as Alexander and the long line of cases warn of in court identification, particularly your Honour where there has been a lack of identification at another time. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I would have thought it helped you. 
        
       
       
        
        WILLIAMS: In my submission it doesn’t. Because a witness sitting here and saying the man sitting behind you Mr Crown is the –“ 
        
       
      
    42 His Honour ruled that he would not discharge. He did not provide reasons. The jury was brought back. No direction was given concerning the in-court identification. Rather, counsel for Mr Aslett was then invited to cross examine. 
     
      
    43 On this appeal, attention was drawn to Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427, where Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ identified the issue on an application for discharge in these terms: (at 440/441) 
     
      
       
        
        “... No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event tht occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellate court say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable? ...” 
        
       
      
    44 In Qoro v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 220, Johnson J (Giles JA and Hall J agreeing) summarised the issue in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “29. The failure to discharge a jury is not a ground of appeal in itself. The appeal is against conviction:  
        Maric v The Queen 
         (1978) 52 ALJR 631 at 634. The question on appeal is whether there was such a high degree of necessity for the jury’s discharge on 7 September 2006 that the failure to order such a discharge has resulted in a mistrial... Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. This Court must decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice:  
        Crofts v The Queen 
         at 441.” 
        
       
      
    45 These statements of principle assume that reasons have been given by the trial Judge for his or her refusal to discharge. That is plainly desirable, either at the time of the ruling or soon thereafter. 
     
      
    46 Here there were no reasons. One must go to the transcript to determine what the trial Judge’s reasons were. The Crown, in its submissions, encapsulated those reasons, as they emerged from the transcript, in these words: (CS: para [20]) 
     
      
       
        
        “... It can readily be inferred from the remarks of his Honour that he concluded the evidence was relevant, admissible and there was little danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant, indeed, quite the opposite. ...” 
        
       
      
    47 Assuming that to be a sufficient statement of his Honour’s reasons, it may be said at once that the evidence was certainly relevant. The only issue in the trial was the issue of identity. The security guard, in the evidence which provoked the discharge application, identified Mr Aslett as the person who sought entry to the hotel, a red Ford Mondeo vehicle waiting in the carpark. 
     
      
    48 In Crofts v The Queen, the Court drew attention to the “seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issue”, when referring to the matter which provoked the discharge application. Here, the in-court identification was plainly serious. Indeed, it transformed the Crown case. The case opened, and the case Mr Aslett expected to meet, was a circumstantial case. The Crown sought to draw the inference that Mr Aslett was involved in these offences from a combination of circumstances. On paper, the security guard appeared to be a witness who assisted Mr Aslett. He had been shown a good photograph of him five weeks after the incident, yet he failed to identify him. He also provided a description of the person he dealt with to the police. That description, in some respects, did not match Mr Aslett, as I will later describe. Once the security guard identified Mr Aslett in court, the Crown case appeared immeasurably stronger. He became a witness unmistakably adverse to Mr Aslett, as his counsel recognised. The suggestion by his Honour that his evidence “helped Mr Aslett” was, with respect, clearly wrong. Certainly there was a contradiction in his evidence. However, the contradiction was between his expected evidence, where he was not able to identify Mr Aslett from photographs, and his evidence in court, where he said he could, having seen him in the flesh. 
     
      
    49 Was the evidence admissible? Absent compliance with the conditions of s 114(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (which required an identification parade subject to certain exceptions, which were not demonstrated), the evidence was not admissible (R v Taufua (unreported, NSWCCA, 11.11.96) (Priestley AP, James and Barr JJ); R v Tahere [1999] NSWCCA 170, per Spigelman CJ at para [32]). The evidence was not led by the Crown. It was volunteered by the security guard. However, when considering the discharge application which immediately followed, it was not recognised that the evidence was inadmissible. 
     
      
    50 The Crown suggested that it could be inferred that his Honour saw “little danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant, indeed the opposite”. Unfair prejudice, in this context, meant prejudice arising from the likelihood that the jurors may give the evidence more weight than it deserved, or that it may divert the jurors from their task (Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; (2001) 208 CLR 593, per McHugh J at 609, para [51]). 
     
      
    51 The dangers of identification evidence are well known. They were described in Domican v The Queen [1991-1992] 173 CLR 555 in the following terms by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ: (at 561) 
     
      
       
        
        “... the seductive effect of identification evidence has so frequently led to proven miscarriages of justice that courts of criminal appeal and ultimate appellate courts have felt obliged to lay down special rules in relation to the directions which judges must give in criminal trials where identification is a significant issue.” 
        
       
      
    52 In-court identification has been recognised as presenting danger in an acute form. In Davies & Cody v The King [1937] 57 CLR 170, the Court (Latham CJ, Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ) said this: (at 182) 
     
      
       
        
        “Similarly, if a witness is shown a single person and he knows that that person is suspected of or charged with the crime, his natural inclination to think that there is probably some reason for the arrest will tend to prevent an independent reliance upon his own recollection when he is asked whether he can identify him.  
        This tendency will be greatly increased if he is shown the person actually in the dock charged with the very crime in question 
        .” 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
      
    53 In Alexander v The Queen [1980-1981] 145 CLR 395, Mason J made the following comment: (at 426/7) 
     
      
       
        
        “... Traditionally it has been accepted that a witness identifies the accused at the trial as the person whom he observed at the scene of, or in connection with, the crime. This ‘in court’ identification, sometimes described as primary evidence, is of little probative value when made by a witness who has no prior knowledge of the accused, because at  
        the trial circumstances conspire to compel the witness to identify the accused in the dock 
        . ...” 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
      
    54 Gleeson CJ, in Festa v The Queen (supra), made the following statement, although he recognised that there was no absolute rule that such evidence must be rejected: (at 399) 
     
      
       
        
        “18. Of all forms of identification evidence, one of the most notoriously dangerous is in-court identification, which is usually performed in circumstances that strongly suggest the answer that is ultimately given. Even here, however, there is no absolute rule requiring rejection of such evidence; and there may be circumstances in which it is appropriate to allow it. ...” 
        
       
      
    55 The security guard did not know the appellant. He was not identifying someone with whom he was familiar. He had been shown an array of photographs by the police some time before he gave evidence, which included a photograph of Mr Aslett. There existed, in these circumstances, the danger described as “the displacement effect”. In Alexander v The Queen, Stephen J said this: (at 409) 
     
      
       
        
        “... there is the ‘displacement’ effect. Having been shown a photograph, the memory of it may be more clearly retained than the memory of the original sighting of the offender and may, accordingly, displace that original memory. Any subsequent face-to-face identification, in court or in an identification parade, may, on the identifying witness’s part, in truth involve a matching of the man so identified with the remembered photograph, which has displaced in his memory his recollection of the original sighting.” 
        
       
      
    56 The trial Judge, in determining that the matter should proceed, did not advert to these issues or recognise the prejudice associated with them. If the trial were to proceed, it was important that the jury be immediately told that the in-court identification was of no value on the identification issue (as the witness must inevitably point out the person who is on trial), that being a direction suggested by the bench book. It was also important that such a direction should be repeated and emphasised in the summing up. However, no such directions were given.  
     
      
    57 I believe that the jury should have been discharged. I would find error. The evidence was inadmissible. It had little probative value. It was highly prejudicial. It went to the heart of the matter in contest, namely the identity of Mr Aslett. The evidence changed the entire complexion of the case from a circumstantial case to a case with direct evidence of Mr Aslett’s involvement. There was, I believe, the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice unless the jury was discharged. 
     
      
    58 The trial had just begun. The security guard gave evidence on the first day. There was little inconvenience in starting again. Further, the Crown case, as described during the debate on the discharge application, was a different case from that opened. Indeed, it appears that the change occurred opportunistically, once the security guard made his in-court identification, as the Crown recognised the advantages arising from it. The trial Judge said that he was confused. The Crown acknowledged error in his opening. It was most unsatisfactory. It was also unfair. The change by the Crown added to the risk of miscarriage and the need for a discharge. 
     
      
    59 The Crown, on this appeal, relied upon the proviso in the event of error. It is useful to consider Ground 2 and the course of the trial when dealing with the issue of whether the accused lost the chance of an acquittal fairly open to him. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Inadequate directions on identification. 
       
      
    60 At the end of the evidence and before addresses, there was a discussion concerning directions to be given in the summing up. The discussion included the following exchange: (T 3: 7.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Yes, I had in mind giving a special direction as to the weight that they could put on an in-court identification. Is there a standard wording for that in the bench book? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, it doesn’t happen often so we’ll have to check that for your Honour as well. There certainly is standard -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Presumably it will say something like it should be given extremely little weight? 
        
       
       
        
        WILLIAMS: Yes –“ 
        
       
      
    61 The bench book in fact said this, concerning an identification by a witness in court: 
     
      
       
        
        “... a direction should be given at the time – and repeated, if appropriate, in the summing up – that such evidence is of no value to the identification issue (as the witness must inevitably point out the person who is on trial) and that the evidence is given only in order to complete the picture and to avoid any speculation as to why it was not given.” 
        
       
      
    62 Counsel for Mr Aslett sought the warnings required by s 116 and s 165(1)(b) of the Evidence Act. The Crown then addressed. The Crown’s address included these words, referring to identification from photographs (such as that attempted unsuccessfully by the security guard): (T 9: 8.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “... Here we have and quite interesting because his Honour will warn you about the circumstances of the identification being made and what was the light like, what was the distance. Had a positive identification been made, based on the computer pictures at the police station, one of the warnings you would’ve been given was it’s only a two dimensional computer picture, so be particularly careful because a two dimensional is different to a three dimensional. ...” 
        
       
      
    63 The Crown then dealt with the evidence of Mr Bozkent, the security guard. He concluded his address on this aspect with these words: (T 10) 
     
      
       
        
        “... I’ve been through Mr Bozkent’s evidence and I would say that that of itself would satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was this accused who did the four offences which I’m about to touch upon.” 
        
       
      
    64 That can only have been a reference to the in-court identification. Mr Bozkent had not identified Mr Aslett in the photo array. So a matter which the standard directions suggested by the bench book was “of no value to the identification issue” was put forward by the Crown as sufficient proof of identity beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    65 Counsel for Mr Aslett then addressed. He drew attention to Mr Bozkent’s failure to identify Mr Aslett when shown the photographs five weeks after the incident. He contrasted that with his ability eighteen months later, when confronted by the accused in the dock, to say: “Yes, that’s him sitting in the dock” (T 20). 
     
      
    66 His Honour then summed up. The summing up included the following: (SU 16) 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown relies on the identification of the accused by Mr Bozkent while he was in the witness box. I need to give you a special direction in relation to identification evidence.” 
        
       
      
    67 His Honour then gave what may be termed “general directions on identification”, warning that it may be unreliable, such that special caution was required. He added that such a warning was given in every case where identification was disputed (SU 18). His Honour then said this in relation to the in-court identification of the accused: (SU 18) 
     
      
       
        
        “In the context of the identification of this accused by Mr Bozkent in court however, you were asked to take into account the fact that he did not recognise him from photographs taken in the identification process only a short time after the offences. You can also take into account the fact that when an accused is sitting in the dock, as he was at the time of that identification, certain assumptions might be made on the part of the person identifying them, merely because he is sitting in the dock.” 
        
       
      
    68 No objection was taken by counsel then appearing for the appellant. No request was made for a redirection. The Crown drew attention to Rule 4. 
     
      
    69 The obligation upon the trial Judge under s 116 of the Evidence Act is identified in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        s 116 
          
        Directions to jury 
        
       
       
        
        (1) If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in so informing the jury.” 
        
       
      
    70 The section repeats, in an abbreviated form, the obligations identified by the High Court in Domican v The Queen (supra), where the Court said this: (at 561/2) (authorities omitted) 
     
      
       
        
        “Whatever the defence and however the case is conducted, where evidence as to identification represents any significant part of the proof of guilt of an offence, the judge must warn the jury as to the dangers of convicting on such evidence where its reliability is disputed. The terms of the warning need not follow any particular formula. But it must be cogent and effective. It must be appropriate to the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the jury must be instructed ‘as to the factors which may affect the consideration of [the identification] evidence in the circumstances of the particular case’.  
        A warning in general terms is insufficient. The attention of the jury ‘should be drawn to any weaknesses in the identification evidence’. Reference to counsel’s arguments is insufficient. The jury must have the benefit of a direction which has the authority of the judge’s office behind it.  
        It follows that the trial judge should isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance which may reasonably be regarded as undermining the reliability of the identification evidence.” 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    71 Whilst his Honour gave directions on the special need for caution generally, he did not, in my view, relate that need “to the circumstances of the case” (s 116(1)(b)). Specifically, he did not, with his authority as the judge, identify the weaknesses in the identification evidence (cf R v Akgul [2002] VSCA 222; (2002) 5 VR 537 at 543, para [25]). 
     
      
    72 Here, there were a number of weaknesses in the identification evidence. First, the security guard was identifying a stranger whom he had seen during a six minute interval as he sought entry to the hotel and then passed back and forth. No doubt he was one of many he dealt with that evening. 
     
      
    73 Secondly, within five weeks of the incident, the security guard was shown an array of twenty photographs. The array included a clear photograph of Mr Aslett (Exhibit S). He was not able to identify any person within that array. Then, after an elapse of eighteen months, the security guard said that he recognised Mr Aslett in court, when in the dock. There was the risk in such evidence of “the displacement effect” (cf R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37 at para [80]). 
     
      
    74 Finally, and contrary to the submission made by the Crown in address, the in-court identification was of no value on the issue of identification. It was to be contrasted with an identification parade, which is the usual means by which identification evidence is introduced. In R v Adamson (unreported, NSWCCA, 26.11.92), Gleeson CJ said this, referring to identification parades: (at 3) 
     
      
       
        
        “... in an ordinary identification parade, steps are taken to ensure that the suspect does not stand out from the group in which he is placed. The persons involved in the parade should so far as possible consist of persons who resemble the suspect in height, general appearance and position in life. ...” 
        
       
      
    75 In contrast, when a person is sitting in the dock on trial, he does stand out. Indeed, the circumstances conspire to compel the witness to identify the accused (Mason J in Alexander v The Queen (supra para [53])), and “strongly suggest the answer that is ultimately given” (Gleeson CJ in R v Adamson (supra para [74])). 
     
      
    76 In my view there was error. I would uphold Ground 2. 
     
      
    77 The Crown urged the application of the proviso. It described the case against the appellant as one of “overwhelming strength”. I believe that significantly overstates the strength of the Crown case. The discovery by the complainant of the photo identity card in her purse was, unquestionably, important evidence, incriminating Mr Aslett. His explanation (that he regularly swapped clothing with his cousin) was thin. The issue nonetheless remained how the card came to be in the purse of the complainant. That issue was not dissimilar to the issue that arose in Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; (2007) 235 CLR 521, where the appellant’s cap with his DNA was found at the scene of the robbery. In the context of that case, Gummow and Hayne JJ said this: (at 534/5) 
     
      
       
        
        “44. On its face the DNA evidence appears overwhelming and the appellant’s explanations for how a cap with his DNA came to be found at the scene of the robbery were thin. (He asserted that the robber must have planted the cap there and he offered some suggestions of who might have procured that.) But the apparent thinness of this explanation for the incriminating evidence of the cap may, we do not say must, have taken on a different appearance if his alibi witnesses had given evidence and were believed. 
        
       
       
        
        45. It may readily be accepted that the evidence called at the appellant’s trial demonstrated, beyond reasonable doubt, that the cap found at the robbery scene was his cap. But a further question had to be decided. Was it the  
        appellant 
         who had taken the cap to and dropped it at the robbery scene? No one said the robber had worn the cap. Had someone else taken the cap there, whether in the overalls the robber wore or the bag the robber carried, and dropped the cap? That was what the appellant sought to put in issue with the alibi evidence, not whether the cap found was his. ...” 
         
        (emphasis in original) 
        
       
      
    78 Here, the other evidence tending to identify the appellant was not overwhelming. The photo identity card incorporated a photograph taken five weeks before, which did not suggest long hair (Exhibit B). The security guard’s description did not match Mr Aslett in all respects. He told the police, moreover, that the person he dealt with handed him a driver’s licence (T 82). Whilst there are similarities between a driver’s licence and a photo identity card, there are also differences. The security guard, as a person on the door of a hotel, was aware of these differences. He gave the following evidence, when shown the photo identity card (Exhibit B): (T 28: 5.11.07) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. If you could just look at exhibit B please? Are you able to recall if that’s the identification you looked at? 
         
        A. I actually remember a driver’s licence. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If you could hand that back but that’s not a driver’s licence, is it? 
         
        A. I know, that’s right.” 
        
       
      
    79 The CCTV footage did not greatly assist. No doubt the security guard checked the identity of the person he admitted to the hotel against the card he was shown. However, that does not establish that the card he was shown was a photo identity card as opposed to a driver’s licence, and much less that the card he was shown was the photo identity card later found in the purse of the complainant. 
     
      
    80 I am not persuaded that a jury, on the evidence properly admitted, and acting reasonably and properly directed, would inevitably have convicted the appellant (Festa v The Queen (supra) per Hayne J at para [229]). It is not appropriate to apply the proviso. It is unnecessary to consider the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    81 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Convictions quashed and sentences set aside. 
       
       
      3. The appellant should have a new trial. 
       
      
    82 JOHNSON J: I agree with Kirby J.

   JUDGMENT1 HER HONOUR: On Monday 27 July 2009 Brendan Cutmore and Edward Davis were arraigned for the purpose of some preliminary legal arguments on an indictment containing four joint counts being aggravated break and enter with intent to steal, aggravated break enter and steal, attempt aggravated break and enter with intent to steal and be carried in a conveyance without the owner’s consent. Mr Cutmore was also charged with an assault. 2 On Tuesday 28 July I excluded evidence of photographic identification of both accused pursuant to section 137 Evidence Act1995. The Director of Public Prosecutions thereafter directed that there be no further proceedings against both men. 3 Mr Cutmore and Mr Davis then made an application for a certificate under the Costs In Criminal Cases Act 1967. Each bears the onus of showing that the test in the Act has been met. The Crown opposes the granting of a certificate. 4 On the applications I have considered all of the material I considered in the voir dire on the identification evidence, which was essentially the Crown brief, plus the New South Wales Police Services Procedures on Identification Evidence which were tendered in this application.5 Ms Kluss for Mr Cutmore also notionally tendered on this application the judgment I delivered in excluding the identification evidence. The Crown submitted that that judgment is not a “relevant fact” to be taken into account in considering the test in the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. I agree. 6 Section 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act provides that a Court may, where after the commencement of a trial a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken, grant to the accused a certificate specifying the matters referred to in section 3 of the Act relating to the proceedings. A trial includes preliminary proceedings such as a voir dire, as was held in this trial. 7 The test in section 3 of the Act, and as has been considered in R v Pavy (1997) 98 A Crim R 396 and other authorities, for whether a certificate should be granted is if the prosecution had been in possession of all the relevant facts or evidence, as known at the time of the application, before the proceedings were commenced, would it have been reasonable to institute proceedings. 8 I will summarise the Crown case to put the applications in context. The Crown allegations were that three men travelled from Armidale to Walcha in a stolen car. Shortly after midnight on 27 February 2008 they were detected breaking and attempting to break into commercial premises in Walcha. There was evidence of three premises broken into or disturbed and some property stolen. Two men were observed by one of the shop owners and three men were observed at close quarters by a witness Clinton Lyon. It was the Crown case that they were the two accused and a young person, and that Mr Cutmore assaulted Mr Lyon. The three men left in a stolen car. Mr Lyon gave a description of the men, including their clothing, and on 29 February identified three men in photographs. 9 The stolen car was pursued by police near Armidale and collided with a tree. The young person was detained by police. Two other men left the car and the scene. A police officer picked up a glove near the car. Later DNA consistent with Mr Davis’s was found to be one of two contributors to DNA in this glove. 10 Some items of property stolen from the same house as the stolen car was found in some premises in which Mr Cutmore and Mr Davis were present when police entered to search the premises. An issue about the legality of the search was raised at the commencement of the trial but was not determined before the Director’s decision. The issue raised was that the address on the warrant to permit a search of the premises was incorrect.11 In respect of the application Ms Kluss on behalf of Mr Cutmore submitted that the fatal nature and quality of the identification evidence had always been apparent from the commencement of the proceedings, that the identification procedure was not an unusual procedure, that it was not conducted in accordance with the Police Service’s Procedures and that there was no act or omission by the accused which brought into operation section 3(1)(b) of the Act.12 Ms McSpedden on behalf of Mr Davis submitted that the blatant departure from the Police Service’s Procedures deprived the identification of any ability to be validated or forensically examined, and secondly, that the clothing worn by the accused in the photo array should have been checked before the identification procedure was undertaken. 13 In opposing the applications the Crown submitted that it was not unreasonable for the prosecution to have instituted proceedings had all the relevant facts been known, and secondly, that in the exercise of the Court’s discretion I should refuse the applications. The Crown also referred to comments made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Pavy and James J in KJF (Supreme Court, 7 December 2007, unreported) about the Applicants being legally aided, although in each of those cases that did not preclude the grant of a certificate and indeed legally it does not do so. The Crown submitted that the facts show a strong case that burglaries were committed, that an assault was committed and that a stolen car was driven and that the hypothetical prosecutor could not second guess that a trial judge would exclude the identification evidence. He referred me to the decision of Chahal v Director of Public Prosecutions [2008] NSWCA 152 in which at first instance the trial judge had declined to grant a certificate after excluding evidence and directing a verdict of not guilty. 14 Ms Kluss submitted that that decision can be factually distinguished and I agree it can but I also take the Crown’s point that having excluded evidence does not mean that I must disregard that evidence for the purpose of considering this application. 15 However the Crown’s submission that there was a strong case that offences had been committed only addresses part of the story. What had to be proved was not only that the offences charged had been committed but that they had been committed by Mr Cutmore and Mr Davis. This is where the identification evidence was necessary. Without the identification evidence the remaining evidence, the stolen property in the house where Mr Cutmore and Mr Davis were at the time the police entered to search the premises and the DNA matching Mr Davis’s on the glove found near the stolen car could not link them to anything other than the stolen car and could not prove their commission of the offence relating to the stolen car beyond reasonable doubt. Thus any reasonable prosecutor should have carefully scrutinised the identification evidence. 16 At the commencement of the voir dire on the identification evidence in this trial the Crown Prosecutor in this trial, as an officer assisting the Court, drew my attention to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61 and conceded some similarities in the identification process in that case and this. While not neglecting his duties as a Crown Prosecutor he acknowledged that the identification evidence in this trial faced some difficulties. The hypothetical reasonable prosecutor examining the identification evidence available in these proceedings at the commencement of these proceedings should have recognised the weakness in the evidence. It can be described simply. It is obvious. The descriptions given of the offenders were that one wore a red hooded jacket and the other a white T shirt. In the two sets of 12 photos shown to the witness, one man wore a red hooded jacket and one a white T shirt. They were in stark and striking contrast to the other photographs. The question is not whether it was possible that a prosecutor considered whether such evidence might withstand judicial scrutiny. The question is whether it was reasonable for the hypothetical prosecutor to commence these proceedings with evidence of that standard. In my view it was not. 17 In my view the statutory test in section 3(1)(a) for the grant of a certificate has been made out. On the evidence before me I am satisfied that no act or omission by either applicant contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings. I see no further reason why I should not exercise my discretion to grant a certificate to each Applicant. That includes that each applicant was legally aided in the proceedings. 18 I grant a certificate in the following terms. CERTIFICATE Whereas on 27 July 2009 Brendan Cutmore and Edward Davis were arraigned before me in the District Court on charges of aggravated break and enter with intent to steal, aggravated break enter and steal, attempt aggravated break enter and steal and be carried in conveyance taken without the owner’s consent, and Brendan Cutmore was arraigned on a further charge of assault, and upon being arraigned they pleaded not guilty And whereas a voir dire was then held  And whereas after the voir dire on 28 July 2009 I delivered a judgment holding that certain evidence which the Crown would seek to adduce in the trial on the charges should not be admitted And whereas on 28 July 2009 the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that no further proceedings be taken against Mr Cutmore and Mr Davis on all of the charges in the indictment Pursuant to the provisions of sections 2 and 3 of the Costs In Criminal Cases Act 1967 I certify that in my opinion 
     
      
      (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and  
       
      (b) no act or omission of Brendan Cutmore or Edward Davis contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings.  
       
      
    Dated this 29th day of July 2009.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Floyd Leslie Dowley, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his partner, Susan Knott, at Berkeley on 24 November 2007. That plea was accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of an indictment for murder. The basis of the plea is substantial impairment by abnormality of mind: s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900. He stands for sentence for that offence. I am also asked to deal with a related offence of deemed larceny of a motor vehicle on a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This arises from his taking and driving a vehicle, also at Berkeley, without the consent of its owner: s 154A(1) of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 At the time of the killing, the offender was 41 years old and Ms Knott was 44. They had been in a relationship for some years. Both of them used illicit drugs, particularly the form of amphetamine known as “ice”, and it seems that he was frequently violent towards her. In 2001 he had been diagnosed as suffering from a mental illness, being a delusional disorder of a paranoid type, and had been prescribed medication. However, some time before the killing he had ceased taking any medication.  
     
      
    3 In October 2007 they moved into a home unit at Berkeley rented by a friend of the offender, Tony Armstrong. In the morning of 24 November 2007, the offender attacked Ms Knott with a serrated edged knife. It was a savage assault. He slit her throat, causing what was described on a post mortem examination as a “complex deep incisional wound across the anterior neck, transecting both carotid and both vertebral arteries, both jugular veins, and transecting the larynx and the cervical spinal cord”. The post mortem examination also disclosed “multiple associated stab wound defects to the left posterior neck consistent with multiple perforating thrusts”, “an extensive complex stab/incised wound of the right scalp with de-scalping injury and a complex lacerated incised wound of the left occipital region”, together with blunt force injuries to the head, face, trunk and limbs consistent with “multiple blunt force contact”. Also detected were incised wounds to the left hand consistent with “defence” injuries. It was the wounds to the neck which were the direct cause of death.  
     
      
    4 During the previous night, Mr Armstrong saw the offender prepare two syringes of ice, one of which he used to inject himself and the other he took to Ms Knott, who was in their bedroom. He also took about twenty alcohol based sterilization wipes, and squeezed the alcohol out of them into a syringe. With this also he injected himself. All three of them then shared two “cones” of cannabis.  
     
      
    5 Mr Armstrong rose at about 7 o’clock the following morning, at which time the offender and Ms Knott were arguing. During the morning a number of other residents in the unit block heard their voices raised in argument. At about 7.45am Mr Armstrong left the unit for a short time to visit the residents in another unit, Mr Kevin Dutton and Ms Nicole Carfray (who is the offender’s cousin). When he returned, he heard Ms Knott screaming. He went to their bedroom, where he saw that Ms Knott was crying. She said, “Look what he has done with a knife, he held it to my throat.” Mr Armstrong saw a small scratch on the front of her neck. 
     
      
    6 Mr Armstrong walked from the bedroom to the lounge room and the offender followed him. The offender said, “Do you know how to clean up and get rid of a body?” Mr Armstrong replied, “You got to be fuckin’ joking.” The offender then winked at him, as if he had been.  
     
      
    7 Mr Armstrong left the unit again to visit another neighbour in the block. Returning to his unit a short time later, he saw the offender in the foyer area. He asked the offender whether things were “right now”, to which the offender replied, “You better go home and clean up the mess on the floor.” Mr Armstrong ran back to his unit, opened the locked front door, and saw Ms Knott lying face down in a pool of blood between the kitchen and the lounge room. He checked for her pulse but could find none. He ran to another neighbour’s unit to raise the alarm, and police were called. 
     
      
    8 In the meantime, the offender had gone to Mr Dutton’s unit. There he said, “I’ve got no more problems now.” Shortly thereafter, outside the unit, he said to Ms Carfray, “I’ve got to go clean up my mess.” She said, “What mess are you talking about?” He said, “I fixed up my problem and now I’m going to fix the next problem.”  
     
      
    9 The offender left the unit block and went to the Unanderra area, where he stole a Toyota Land Cruiser with a trailer attached. This is the offence on the s 166 certificate. In the early afternoon he drove to the home of Mr Paul McGarry at Primbee. He had known Mr McGarry for many years through their previous employment in the commercial fishing industry, but had not been to Mr McGarry’s home for about seven years.  
     
      
    10 Mr McGarry inquired about the Toyota Land Cruiser and trailer, and the offender said that he had stolen them. When Mr McGarry rebuked him for having done so, the offender said, “That’s nothing compared to something else I have done.” Mr McGarry asked, “What are you on about?” The offender slowly moved his thumb from one ear across his throat to the other ear. Mr McGarry said, “What, cut someone’s throat?” The offender said, “Yeah, the missus … I should have done this years ago.” During this conversation Mr McGarry observed that the offender had a smirk on his face, and at the time he did not take what he said seriously.  
     
      
    11 Upon his arrest the offender made further statements about Ms Knott which were both callous and bizarre. After leaving Mr McGarry’s home, he was intercepted by police driving the stolen vehicle in the Figtree area. While he was being searched he made a particularly crude observation about her, questioning her sexuality, which I do not find it necessary to recite. He was taken to Port Kembla Police Station. There an officer confirmed that he understood that he was under arrest for murder. When the officer asked him whom he had murdered, he replied, “Some bloke with tits.” Later, while in the charging dock, he was asked by the custody officer about some blood on his foot. He said, “I cut her.” When asked whose blood it was, he said that it was his own, but a little later he said, “She tried to fraud me …” Later again, he shouted, “No wonder girls are getting raped and stolen.” The custody officer said, “Who did that?” He said, “The poofs.” Asked who were the poofs, he replied, “The bitch I cut the throat of.”  
     
      
    12 In the evening the offender took part in an electronically recorded interview by detectives. The interview was relatively short, largely because he was aggressive and unco-operative. No purpose would be served by examining it in any detail. It is sufficient to say that he made no clear admission of having killed Ms Knott, and the effect of what he said was that he had little recollection of what had occurred. When asked if he knew why he had been arrested, he said, “Somebody told me I murdered somebody.” Asked if he knew anything about that, he said that he had “slow flashbacks”. He said that he remembered blood hitting the floor, but did not know when that occurred or whose blood it was. Asked if it was Susan’s blood, he said, “maybe”, but then said that he did not know who Susan was.  
     
      
    13 After this series of questions, he said, “Oh, I’m flyin’ on gas, mate, I dunno what I’m fucken saying, so it’s a waste of time me even answerin’ any questions, I’ve been that fucked on the crystal meth for the last week and a half, I dunno what I’m fucken doing.” Other answers to the detectives’ questions were unresponsive and suggestive of disordered thought.  
     
      
    14 In 2008 the offender was interviewed in custody by two well known forensic psychiatrists, Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Bruce Westmore. I shall turn to their reports shortly. To those doctors also he claimed to have little memory of the killing. In the result, it can be said that the offence appears to have been preceded by his arguing with Ms Knott, and it is clear that what he did was the product of an abnormal state of mind and, no doubt, the ingestion of ice. However, the circumstances of this ferocious attack are otherwise unexplained.  
     
      
       
      Victim impact statements 
       
      
    15 I received victim impact statements from two daughters of the deceased, Sarah Knott and Katie Cardamone. Both of them express, simply but eloquently, the effect on them of the senseless and violent death of their mother. Ms Cardamone’s statement also explains the emotional effect of this tragedy upon her son, the deceased’s grandchild. Sarah Knott read her statement to the Court. That can not have been an easy task and she was obviously, and understandably, deeply distressed. To both those ladies, to other members of Susan Knott’s family, and to all those affected by her untimely death I express my deepest sympathy.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    16 The offender has a disturbing criminal history. There are a number of entries for offences of violence, including common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. I have been supplied with statements of facts in relation to the most significant of those entries, arising from seven incidents which occurred between 2001 and 2007. It is sufficient to refer to these in summary form. 
     
      
    17 In the first incident, occurring in March 2001, the offender assaulted his mother, his estranged wife, Joanne Dowley, their infant child and his uncle. A considerable level of violence was involved, particularly directed to his mother. The second and fifth incidents, occurring in March 2001 and February 2005, involved assaults upon men who, apparently, were strangers to him at a shopping centre. There does not seem to be any rational explanation for his behaviour on any of these occasions, although at the time of the first incident he was intoxicated.  
     
      
    18 The third incident, occurring in November 2002, was bizarre. The offender went to the home of two brothers who were known to him. He accused them of having stolen his kidneys and liver while he was asleep. He seized a bow and arrow belonging to one of the brothers and fired arrows at both of them. In the fourth incident, in December 2002, he broke into his mother’s home, in breach of an apprehended violence order. The sixth and seventh incidents, in January and March 2007 respectively, were assaults by way of threatened or actual violence upon the deceased, Susan Knott. There does not seem to be any rational explanation for these assaults either.  
     
      
    19 Charges arising from the first, second and seventh incidents were dealt with in the ordinary course, resulting in a non-custodial order, a short term of imprisonment and a fine respectively. Charges arising from the other four incidents were dismissed under s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (as it was then known).  
     
      
    20 I was also supplied with police records of two complaints against the offender by his estranged wife, which she did wish to be pursued by prosecution. In the first, occurring in November 1999, he struck her after an argument. The second, in January 2001, involved an assault upon her by the offender’s sister, Ms Debbie Scerri, which he encouraged.  
     
      
    21 The offender has some earlier criminal history, in the later 1980s and sporadically through the 1990s, for offences which for the most part are considerably less serious. It is the history from 2001 which is troubling. The explanation for these later offences is to be found in his personal circumstances and, in particular, in the onset of his mental illness and his drug abuse. That material emerges from the psychiatric reports of Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore, together with the evidence of his sister, Ms Scerri. The allegation that she assaulted his wife, Joanne was not raised with her in evidence. Whatever might be the truth of that matter, I must say that I found her an impressive witness. She presented as a person who cared deeply for her brother but whose account, nevertheless, was frank and realistic.  
     
      
    22 Notwithstanding his brushes with the law before 2001, his earlier life appears to have been stable enough. One of four children, he was brought up in the Port Kembla area. He did not fare well at school and left before he turned 15. Dr Nielssen assessed his intelligence to be “in the lower part of the normal range”. Nevertheless, he was gainfully employed until the year 2000, although he did not work thereafter. 
     
      
    23 In his early 20s he married Joanne, and they had four sons. For a time the relationship was a good one. His sister said that in these earlier years he was a popular and generous person, who had many friends. Although he had used marijuana since his mid teens, he was opposed to the use of harder drugs and, indeed, tried to dissuade his younger brother from doing so.  
     
      
    24 He was affected by the death of his father from a heart attack in 1990. Ms Scerri observed him to become withdrawn and to be frequently depressed. Nevertheless, the marriage endured and he continued in employment. For a period he went with the family to Queensland where he worked as the caretaker of a farm. He appeared to enjoy his time there but, eventually, he began to express paranoid delusional thoughts in telephone conversations with Ms Scerri. He told her that he believed that people were going to kill him and his family and that, when his wife and children were sleeping in the caravan in which they were housed, he would climb a tree above the caravan to keep watch on them. The relationship with his wife was deteriorating, they fought and sometimes he treated her violently. 
     
      
    25 They separated in 2000, and his sister observed a marked deterioration in him. As she put it, he “just went downhill really bad,” was generally depressed and neglecting himself. It was at this time that he took to the abuse of ice and became dependent on it. In the ensuing years he also used heroin on occasions, but it appears that he did not become dependent on that drug. His cannabis use continued.  
     
      
    26 As I have said, it was in 2001 that he was first diagnosed as suffering from mental illness and placed on medication. This was during a period that he was in custody. In the following year, while again in custody, he was found by Dr Stephen Allnutt, another well known forensic psychiatrist, to be suffering from schizophrenia. Dr Allnutt noted a history of persecutory delusions, and he observed delusions of the same kind during his consultation with him. He recommended that the offender refrain from drug and alcohol, continue to take anti-psychotic medication, and undergo follow-up psychiatric treatment upon his release.  
     
      
    27 That was the period of custody arising from the third and fourth of the incidents of violence to which I have referred. Upon his release in early 2003 until the later part of 2005, the offender’s treatment was supervised by the Illawarra Area Health Service. During that period he attended regularly to receive medication, and it seems that he generally stayed out of trouble and, at least at times, refrained from drug abuse. That said, he accepted the regime of medication reluctantly and sometimes complained that it made him feel “like a zombie” and that it was doing nothing for him. 
     
      
    28 After that period he was to receive his medication from his general practitioner. The extent to which he did so is not clear from the material before me, but what is established is that he did not take his medication for about four months before he killed Ms Knott. In the weeks leading up to the killing, Mr Armstrong observed a change in his demeanour. He described him as becoming “more cantankerous and aggressive” towards Ms Knott and “more paranoid”, expressing fears that she was having affairs with other people. When Mr Armstrong urged him to obtain his medication, he took offence and said that it stopped “the effect of the crystal from working”. The reference to “crystal”, of course, was to crystal methamphetamine or ice. He told Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore that, while he could not remember how much of the drug he had used on the day of the offence, he had been taking four or five “shots” of 0.1 grams per day. 
     
      
    29 He has been in custody since his arrest that day, 24 November 2007. Upon his admission to prison he was found to be psychotic, giving what was described as a “disorganised and irrelevant” account of the circumstances leading to his arrest and expressing a variety of other delusional beliefs of a paranoid kind. He underwent treatment over the ensuing months, including admission to the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital. He has since been on a regime of medication, and more recently he has been undergoing drug and alcohol counselling.  
     
      
    30 After a consultation with him in June 2008, Dr Nielssen diagnosed him as suffering from schizophrenia, the alternative diagnosis being amphetamine induced psychotic illness, and substance abuse disorder. In his report the doctor expressed his conclusion that he was “probably acutely mentally ill at the time of the offence, notwithstanding the effect of any additional amphetamine taken on the day of the offence”. He saw that psychotic state as likely to have affected his perception of events, his ability to judge right from wrong, and his capacity to control his actions. He noted that the offender remained “acutely psychotic” for months after his arrest and recovered only after a period of consistent treatment by medication. During that period of psychosis he had demonstrated “abnormal irritability and aggressiveness”, but this had not been apparent since his response to treatment. 
     
      
    31 After a consultation in November 2008, Dr Westmore’s conclusions were much the same as those of Dr Nielssen. In his report the doctor expressed his finding in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        The disinhibiting effects of the drugs he consumed and his mental illness are all likely to have played a role in the offending behaviour. Because he was acutely mentally ill, I believe that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind which would have compromised him and his ability to understand that what he was doing was wrong in relation to the deceased or care, from a moral perspective, and his capacity to control his actions would also have been compromised. 
        
       
       
      In a report of March of this year, Dr Westmore expressed the opinion that the drugs which the offender had taken would have engendered “a state of disinhibition”, ice being associated with “poor judgment, impulsiveness and aggressive behaviour”. However, he concluded that the offence occurred “principally because of his mental illness which was precipitated and/or aggravated by his use of the illicit drugs”.  
       
      
    32 I should note that, in providing a history to both doctors, the offender claimed to have a memory that before the killing Ms Knott had approached him carrying a knife from the kitchen. Realistically, his counsel did not rely upon this as a matter in mitigation of sentence and I find it unnecessary to make any finding about it. Even if she had done so, it would provide no explanation, let alone justification, for the ferocity of his attack upon her.  
     
      
    33 Ms Scerri gave evidence that, during her visits to him in prison, he maintained that he had no memory of what he had done but acknowledged that it was bad and that he would have to pay for it. He also appeared to her to realise that drugs had destroyed his life and that he had to stay off them upon his release. She said that, upon his return to the community, she would do everything she could to help him.  
     
      
    34 Obviously, an important question is whether he might pose a danger to the community upon his release. Dr Westmore expressed a view about this in his more recent report, with which Dr Nielssen agreed in a further report. As one would expect, this turns upon his compliance with anti-psychotic medication and abstinence from illicit drugs. Dr Westmore put it this way: 
     
      
       
        
        The history indicates that Mr Dowley has demonstrated extremely disturbed behaviour in the context of illicit drug use and his mental illness. If at any time he returns to any form of illicit drug use or he redevelops acute symptoms of his mental illness, then his potential risk to the community, in view of his previous history, should be considered to be high. Obviously much will depend on what specific symptoms he develops but the presence of paranoid symptoms will be particularly important and relevant to the issue of future dangerousness. 
        
       
       
      Sentencing 
       
      
    35 I have not found this an easy sentencing exercise. The offence is clearly a serious one. This was a brutal killing, perpetrated by the use of a knife. I have referred to blunt force injuries observed on post mortem examination which, presumably, were inflicted at the same time. However, it is not clear how these were occasioned. The inference that the offender intended to kill Ms Knott is irresistible, and his counsel put no argument to the contrary.  
     
      
    36 That said, it is clear that the offence was to a large extent the product of acute psychosis. The opinions of both psychiatrists are supported by the very ferocity of the attack, the offender’s curious and irrational behaviour on the day of the killing up to and after his arrest, and the obvious hallmarks of mental illness observed after his entry into prison custody. While neither Dr Westmore nor Dr Nielssen in their recent reports were prepared to assign the degree of his mental impairment to a position within a notional scale, I am satisfied that it was considerable. This, of course, is relevant to the assessment of the offender’s culpability and the need for the sentence which I pass to reflect considerations of deterrence.  
     
      
    37 Nevertheless, as the Crown prosecutor pointed out in submissions, the case highlights the tension which can arise in matters of this kind between general and personal deterrence: between the leniency which mental illness might afford an offender, on the one hand, and the legitimate function of sentencing in protecting the community, on the other. He referred to the offender’s criminal history and noted, correctly, that it should have alerted him to the risk of violent behaviour if he neglected prescription medication and used illicit drugs. Moreover, the Crown prosecutor submitted, despite his compliance with a regime of medication while in custody, one could not be confident that that risk would not come home upon his release into the community. 
     
      
    38 These are arguments of substance, and I have given them careful consideration. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the offender’s culpability for the crime is significantly reduced by his abnormal mental state. I am guarded about his prospects of rehabilitation, but Ms Scerri’s evidence discloses that he has some insight into the gravity of his behaviour and the reasons for it. Between 2003 and 2005 he demonstrated a capacity to maintain a program of supervised treatment. I entertain some hope that when he is returned to the community, with his sister’s support and under appropriate supervision, he will not re-offend. Obviously, parole supervision would be directed primarily to his compliance with psychiatric treatment and abstinence from illicit drugs. He could be in no doubt that any failure in that respect would be likely to see his return to custody.  
     
      
    39 In these observations I have dealt with what I see as the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied that there are special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period, affording the offender the opportunity of release for a lengthy period under supervision and the sanction of parole. This would serve the interests of the community by fostering his rehabilitation.  
     
      
    40 Nevertheless, I am mindful of the need for the non-parole period to reflect the gravity of his crime and an appropriate measure of retribution for it. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter upon his arraignment in this Court, and had indicated his willingness to do so before he was committed for trial for murder. I shall recognise the utilitarian value of that plea by a 15 % reduction of the sentence which would otherwise have been called for.  
     
      
    41 That sentence, in my view, would be imprisonment for 13 years. The result of a 15 % reduction, in round figures, is 11 years. In association with that sentence I shall fix a non-parole period of 7 years. For the offence of deemed larceny of a motor vehicle, I shall pass a wholly concurrent sentence for a fixed term of 12 months. I shall not specify a non-parole period in respect of that sentence because it will be subsumed within the non-parole period for the manslaughter. 
     
      
    42 Floyd Leslie Dowley, for the manslaughter of Susan Knott you are sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing on 24 November 2007 and expiring on 23 November 2014, and a balance of term of 4 years, commencing on 24 November 2014 and expiring on 23 November 2018. For the offence of deemed larceny of a motor vehicle, you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months, also commencing on 24 November 2007.

   JUDGMENT1. After nine o’clock at night on 14 February 2008 James Munro was minding his own business in his home at 72 Weir Road, Warragamba. He was watching TV. He heard a voice, which I find was Michael John Christian’s voice, saying, “Get the fuck outside.” A man he did not recognise was at the side window. The lounge room that he was occupying did not have its lights on. 2. The next thing that he heard were repeated kicks or thuds on the outside of the wooden front door with somebody leaning against the front door. He tried to stop it being opened, but he was unsuccessful. There was a security screen door outside. What happened was that the front door was eventually kicked in and fell on to the lounge room floor area. Seconds later somebody sprayed a kind of irritating spray into Mr Munro’s eyes, which caused a burning sensation and temporarily blinded him. Whilst he was in that state he was attacked a number of times on the back of his neck with some sort of object. 3. Michael John Christian was charged with being one of the two persons who broke into Mr Munro’s house on that night and inflicted that assault upon him. The charge was laid under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The charge is aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence. It carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of five years. Mr Christian pleaded not guilty to the charge and came on for trial before me. The trial commenced on 12 May 2009 and concluded on 19 May 2009 with the jury finding him guilty of the offence. 4. If I did not do so at the time, I now convict Mr Christian of the offence of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence. 5. What is happening now is that I am about to sentence Mr Christian for that offence and I need to give my reasons for the sentence which I am about to impose. 6. The Court of Criminal Appeal in this State has made it clear that whenever a judicial officer is sentencing someone the most important commencement point is to assess the objective seriousness of the offence itself. Both Ms Roberts who appeared as the prosecutor in the trial and on sentence and Mr Hancock who appeared as counsel for Mr Christian at the trial and in the sentence proceedings, have addressed this issue of the objective seriousness of the offence. 7. One feature of the offence needs to be described in order to put the offence into context and also because Mr Hancock makes a submission in mitigation based upon that feature. Mr Munro, the victim of the crime, is a half-brother of Mr Christian. Mr Christian’s sister - and half-sister of Mr Munro - is a person named Melissa Christian, who also lives in Warragamba. She has a teenage son called Blake. In addition she has custody of Mr Christian’s young daughter. A couple of days before the offence there was an incident outside the house where the offence occurred between Mr Munro’s landlady’s teenage daughter and Blake, who is Melissa Christian’s son. 8. The incident resulted in Mr James Munro going outside and shoving Blake and asking him to leave. Blake stumbled backwards slightly as a result of the shove. Later on James Munro was driving through Warragamba when he was confronted by Melissa Christian who punched him a number of times. Mr Munro reported this to the police, but later indicated that he did not wish to proceed any further with his complaint. 9. Mr Hancock submits that that circumstance amounts to provocation and therefore qualifies as a mitigating feature under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He refers to the words uttered to the victim “Get the fuck outside” which were said, according to Mr Munro, by his client. He refers also to his client wanting to know what happened about Blake and his daughter, and his client having said, “You want to mess with Melissa and their sons and my daughter.” It is relevant to observe that a reason that Mr Christian’s sister is looking after his child is that that is under an arrangement with the Department of Community Services. Hence on Mr Hancock’s case the incident may have resulted in that Department looking unfavourably upon Mr Christian and thereby affecting access to his daughter. 10. As Mr Hancock submitted, the events “may provide some explanation of how it came about; the context involved some element of provocation”. On the other hand Ms Roberts argues that it was not until after the relevant time that Mr Christian heard about the events which are said to have amounted to the provocation. In any event she argues that the provocation by Mr Munro amounted to no more than shoving Blake when he went outside to get involved with the altercation between Blake and his landlady’s daughter. 11. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that what occurred, which I have described in brief terms, amounted to provocation for the offence as that expression is used as a mitigating factor in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In so finding I accept Ms Roberts’ submissions and I also regard the event as too slight in seriousness and too removed in time to amount to sufficient evidence to be satisfied that it was provocation. 12. Ms Roberts argues that I should find that the offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this kind of offending behaviour. She acknowledged that it would fall at the lower end of that mid range. She points to factors about the offending behaviour which support that conclusion. The first was that the offence involved violence. That is not to double count that factor so far as the crime is concerned; her point is that this kind of offence can vary in seriousness. One of the factors which can bring about a variation is the nature of the serious indictable offence committed by the offender. An offence of violence should be regarded as more serious, for example, than an offence of stealing. I accept that submission. 13. Another aggravating feature which I accept was that one of the offenders was armed with some kind of substance which, like pepper spray - and indeed it might have been pepper spray - brought about irritation when sprayed upon the victim’s eyes and also blinded him. In addition some kind of implement was used to assault Mr Munro whilst he was indoors and blinded by the spray. The offence was also a fairly shocking instance of this kind of crime, in that the offenders literally broke down the door of the victim’s home, despite the victim’s efforts to withhold the blows being made to the door. He was also assaulted with the implement when he was completely defenceless and temporarily blinded. I also accept that Mr Christian was the leader of the two men, based upon the evidence of Mr Munro and a neighbour. 14. Mr Hancock on the other hand highlights the nature of the actual bodily harm which was inflicted. He points to the medical evidence which found that there was some blood in one of Mr Munro’s nostrils and some tenderness over his face with some markings. He was treated with saline solution and given analgesia, and no follow-up was required. Mr Hancock also points to the fact that the offence itself was of short duration. I accept both those submissions.15. To my mind given the features described by Ms Roberts, the offence does fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but I accept her submission that it falls within the lower end of that range. 16. Ms Roberts points to other features which are aggravating and for me to take into account in sentencing Mr Christian, but are not directly connected with the objective seriousness of the offence.17. Mr Christian has a criminal record. It is not a good criminal record. In fact it is a bad criminal record because it contains one serious criminal offence, namely an armed robbery for which he was sentenced in this court in 2003 with a period of fulltime imprisonment. He also has a record for a further conviction for armed robbery for which he was sentenced in this court in 1999 to a Community Service Order. That was after an appeal from a Control Order imposed when Mr Christian was a child at the Sutherland Children’s Court. He has a conviction for possessing housebreaking implements in 2006.18. I regard this record as significant and one which requires me to take into account, so far as the protection of the community is concerned, the need to deter Mr Christian from committing further serious offences.19. In addition, the offence was committed whilst Mr Christian was on conditional liberty. Courts regard it as seriously aggravating that an offender who has been given bail or a bond in order to be at large or pursue their rehabilitation, use the opportunity instead to commit further crimes. This is such an example and in my opinion it is an aggravating feature which I need to take into account in sentencing Mr Christian.20. Mr Hancock draws my attention to aspects of his client’s personal background which are set out in a helpful presentence report prepared by a Probation and Parole officer on 16 July 2009. He had a disrupted childhood which involved him and one of his sisters being placed in State care when his mother was reportedly unable to care for her children. He was later made a ward of the State when he was two years old.21. The death of his sister, reportedly the result of a drug overdose, has made a significant impact on Mr Christian himself. He currently maintains some contact with his birth mother. He has a relationship with two children, daughters now aged three and nearly one year. Both of these children, as I have said, have been the subject of intervention by the Department of Community Services.22. Mr Christian left school when he completed his School Certificate and worked part time for some years before taking up an apprenticeship as a heavy vehicle mechanic, but did not complete it because of his arrest for other matters. He has undertaken various positions since then, usually involving manual labour and was involved in a serious car accident in 2002.23. He has serious substance abuse issues, having commenced using cannabis almost at the same time that he started his secondary schooling. He graduated to using amphetamines, but has not used them since his most recent release from custody before being arrested for this offence. Since being in custody he has not come to adverse notice. The author of the presentence report was of the view that he would benefit from an alcohol and other drug assessment and generalised counselling to support his reported grief and loss issues.24. That presentence report is supplemented by exhibit S1 tendered by Mr Hancock, a report from a clinical psychologist, Jessica Santos dated 5 July 2009. She also recommends that Mr Christian continue to address his substance abuse after he has been released into the community, because that is where he will be, as she said, most at risk. She also thought that he would benefit from psychological intervention to address his emotional disturbance and substance abuse.25. I have read a letter from his partner, Lyndall Robson, which draws my attention to her need for Mr Christian to be with her in order to pursue their custody and relationship with their two children as well as a reference from his mother, Beverley Christian. I have taken those documents into account, along with employment which he has undertaken whilst in custody.26. There was a further submission made by Mr Hancock which I have not yet referred to. His submission was that the offence involved limited planning and that that should be regarded as a mitigating factor. For the reasons advanced by Ms Roberts, I reject that submission. In order to be a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(b) I need to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. In my opinion I can hardly so find when the evidence is that the offender turned up in company and armed - either by himself or with his companion - with the two implements which I have referred to and uttered words of knowledge about Mr Munro. I reject Mr Hancock’s submission.27. Mr Hancock further submits that his client’s prospects of rehabilitation are good. He points to the employment his client has undertaken since being in custody and notes that his client has sought counselling from a prison psychologist and is making efforts to retain contact with his children. He also pointed out that his client had not re-offended between the date of the offence and the time when he was remanded in custody after being found guilty by the jury. Indeed he had obtained employment within that time.28. I need to address the question whether the standard non-parole period applies in this case. Section 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that “the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.” Subsection (3) goes on to provide that the “reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in s 21A.”29. Mr Hancock points to the provision contained in s 21A(3)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and argues that the “injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial”. I am satisfied that that submission is correct. That is consistent with the evidence of the nature of the treatment administered to Mr Munro and the fact that there was no requirement for any follow up. For that reason I propose to set a non-parole period which is shorter than the standard non-parole period.30. My attention has been drawn to statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales both as to the terms of sentence and to non-parole periods in respect of this offence and I have taken those statistics into account insofar as they can be of assistance, bearing in mind that the nature of the offending behaviour under this offence can vary greatly.31. Bearing in mind the various features and various matters which I have referred to, I regard an overall sentence of five years imprisonment as appropriate for this offence committed by Mr Christian.32. Mr Hancock submits that the standard ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence for a sentence - which is normally three quarters - should be varied in his client’s favour under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act because there are special circumstances for the balance of the term of the sentence to exceed one third of the non-parole period. He submits that those special circumstances are the need for an extended parole period to assist his client overcome his substance abuse and to develop the relationship with his partner and children. He points to the fact that his client is undergoing some psychological assistance and that he was employed before going into custody for this offence and has undertaken employment in the prison system as well as commencing medication. He would benefit, Mr Hancock says, from an extended parole period to assist that rehabilitation.33. I propose to accept that submission and to alter the ratio to some extent. I regard an appropriate non-parole period in this case as three years. I set a non-parole period for the sentence of three years from 19 May 2009 to 18 May 2012. The balance of the term will be two years from 19 May 2012 to 18 May 2014.Now this is not a matter where I can order his release on parole, because it’s more than three years. Am I right in that? Section 55 I think or am I wrong?HANCOCK: I think your Honour’s right. Unfortunately I don’t have the provision in front of me.HIS HONOUR: No, three years or less. So I don’t make an order directing his release on parole.HANCOCK: Sounds right to me your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Sorry, three things. First any factual errors or matters that need to be correct in my remarks on sentence?HANCOCK: I think there was one thing your Honour, but I think your Honour corrected it on the way through.HIS HONOUR: All right.HANCOCK: At one stage your Honour referred to Mr Christian’s landlady’s daughter being involved in a fight with Blake, but then when you next referred to it, your Honour referred to it as Mr Munro’s landlady’s daughter.HIS HONOUR: As Mr Munro’s?HANCOCK: Landlady’s daughter being involved. She wasn’t the principal party, but your Honour referred to her. I don’t think that’s a source of any--HIS HONOUR: There was some altercation between her and Blake and then the physical altercation was between Mr Munro and Blake.HANCOCK: Yes your Honour stated all those facts correctly.HIS HONOUR: Thanks Mr Hancock. Ms Roberts?ROBERTS: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: The second thins is whether the maths are correct, which I’ve pointed out.HANCOCK: Yes your Honour.ROBERTS: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay and the third thing is whether I should recommend to the Parole Authority any conditions of parole or not or do I leave it to the Parole Authority? What do you want to do?HANCOCK: The only thought I have your Honour is that it’s some years away, but if your Honour were to make recommendations then, they wouldn’t - I would say be directed towards efforts towards rehabilitation; that is accepting counselling.HIS HONOUR: Counselling and drug and alcohol.HANCOCK: Drug and alcohol assistance your Honour, yes.HIS HONOUR: What about - I was going to say the psychological report accompanying him, but once again it’s a long way away, isn't it?HANCOCK: Yes.HIS HONOUR: And I don’t have a clean copy of the psychological report. I could leave that up to you and your instructing solicitor, if you wanted to forward that to the Department of Corrective Services I could indicate that that would be appropriate if you wanted to do it and if you did, then it can be taken into account in his assessment.HANCOCK: I think the Department would probably have access through - by means of the court record in any case your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That might be right. I just don’t know the answer to that. Presumably they would have access to the presentence report, but I’m not sure about your detailed psychological report.HANCOCK: Certainly we can forward it to the Department, yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Do that. Ms Roberts?ROBERTS: Your Honour I don’t wish to be heard, thank you.34. I recommend that when the Parole Authority comes to consider Mr Christian’s parole that it give consideration to conditions which will support his efforts of rehabilitation with particular emphasis on psychological counselling and drug and alcohol rehabilitation. I indicate that I have recommended that a clean copy of exhibit S1, being the psychologist’s report of Ms Santo dated 5 July 2009, may be forwarded to the Department of Corrective Services by Mr Hancock’s instructing solicitors. Anything else? 35. Mr Christian I have got to explain this to you, but it is probably fairly straight forward. You have got five years for the reasons that I outlined. It was a serious offence, but on the other hand, in the middle of the range, but towards the lower end. I have taken into account what Mr Hancock has said regarding your prospects of rehabilitation and so instead of a non-parole period of three quarters of five years, which would be forty-five months, I’ve reduced that to three years or thirty-six months.36. You will be eligible for parole on 18 May 2012. That is when the Parole Authority may consider your eligibility. Whether you get parole or not is a matter for them and not for me. Once you get parole you are still under sentence as you know and your sentence will finally expire on 18 May 2014.37. I have recommended, as you heard, that the Parole Authority take into account, once you are released on parole, the support you will need for your continuing rehabilitation with psychological support and drug and alcohol support. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: The appellant was indicted on the charge that - 
     
      
       
        
        “On or about 30th May 1995 at a place unknown, in the State of New South Wales, [he] did murder Dorothy Ellen Davis.” 
        
       
      
    2 The trial commenced on 6 August 2007 before Kirby J and a jury. On 17 September 2007 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 8 February 2008 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 28 years commencing on 17 September 2007 with a non-parole period of 21 years.  
     
      
    3 The appellant appealed against conviction, but did not apply for leave to appeal against sentence. The grounds of appeal were - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. That the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
         
        2. That the trial miscarried by reason of the notoriety of the appellant and the issue of the appellant’s character being raised by the jury.” 
        
       
      
    4 For the reasons which follow, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    5 In 1995 Mrs Dorothy Davis lived at 9 Undine Street, Lurline Bay (“(No 9”). She had lived there for some decades. She was aged 74, widowed, and possessed of substantial assets. She managed her own financial affairs. She had two adult children, Mr Lessel Davis and Mrs Maree Dawes. Mr Davis lived close by, and saw Mrs Davis once or twice a week; Mrs Dawes was in frequent contact with her.  
     
      
    6 Mrs Davis was in reasonable health apart from some arthritis and a condition of “claudication”, starvation of muscle blood causing muscular pain on effort, which inhibited long or more strenuous walking. On the morning of 30 May 1995 her doctor told her of the onset of mature diabetes, but she was philosophical and not upset and was still planning another overseas trip. She led an active social life, and was involved with charities and her children and grandchildren. She was generous with her money, and had helped family members and occasionally friends financially. Her children described her as a “fairly soft touch” for financial assistance. 
     
      
    7 The appellant and his then wife, Ms Dallas Bromley, lived at 34 Marine Parade, Lurline Bay (“No 34”). The appellant was aged 42, and a large man. No 9 and No 34 were in the same suburban block bounded (clockwise on a plan view) by Undine Street, Marine Parade, Wilson Street and Banks Street. No 9 was a few houses away from the Banks Street corner. No 34 was on the corner of Marine Parade and Wilson Street, approximately on the diagonally opposite corner of the block from No 9. There was a fall towards Marine Parade. 
     
      
    8 No 34 could be reached from No 9 by going downhill along Undine Street and turning right into Marine Parade; there was not a through road to a vehicle turning right from Undine Street, but an access road to some houses and then pedestrian access to which I will later refer. Alternatively, No 34 could be reached from No 9 by going uphill in Undine Street for a short distance and turning left into Banks Street and left again into and downhill along Wilson Street. From No 9 to the intersection with Marine Parade was about 90 metres, and to No 34 to the right along Marine Parade was about a further 70 metres.  
     
      
    9 As its name suggests, Marine Parade ran along the coastline. On the ocean side of the roadway or pedestrian way was a grassed area with rocky outcrops running down to the sea, and a rock shelf at or above sea level. There were some drops onto the rock shelf but no steep cliffs. Sometimes fishermen fished from the rock shelf, and people walked along a coastal walk particularly on weekends. 
     
      
    10 The appellant and Ms Bromley both worked in the advertising industry. Ms Bromley had her own business in Sussex Street, Sydney. The appellant had not been in regular employment, but was employed on commission in the business of Mr Peter Grace at Crows Nest for four months from April/early May 1995.  
     
      
    11 The appellant and Ms Bromley co-owned with Ms Bromley’s parents a rural property near Goulburn known as “Hillydale”. It was 450-500 acres with a house, cattle and sheep yards, fencing and dams. Adjacent Crown land was forested, with fire trails ending at cliffs. On the property were a number of mine shafts, many of which had collapsed. It took about 2 hours 52 minutes to drive from Marine Parade to Hillydale, and about the same time to travel to Hillydale from Crows Nest where the appellant worked.  
     
      
    12 The appellant worked erratic hours, in his arrival at work and leaving work, and did not always tell Mr Grace where he was going. He would travel to Hillydale fairly regularly without telling Ms Bromley beforehand. The couple had the one vehicle, a four wheel drive, and the appellant would sometimes drive Ms Bromley home from work and sometimes telephone her to say whether or not he would do so. 
     
      
    13 Mrs Davis had been a close friend of Ms Bromley’s parents, and had known Ms Bromley since childhood and had a special affection for her. She had met the appellant through Ms Bromley.  
     
      
    14 Ms Bromley had been diagnosed with cancer in January 1994. She had undergone chemotherapy, with occasional overnight hospitalisation. She had lost “a reasonable amount” of her hair. Mrs Davis had been distressed by this illness. Ms Bromley’s treatment had been completed by August 1994, and there had been a celebratory dinner at her parents’ home which Mrs Davis attended. 
     
      
       
      Mrs Davis provides $100,000 to the appellant 
       
      
    15 In July 1994 Mrs Davis wrote a cheque in favour of the appellant for $500,000, which the appellant deposited into a bank account opened in his name on 8 July 1994. There were insufficient funds in Mrs Davis’ account. When advised of this, Mrs Davis cancelled the cheque and wrote out a further cheque in favour of the appellant for $100,000, which was deposited in the account on 12 July 1994. The appellant withdrew $90,000 in cash from the account on 20 July 1994, and the balance of $10,000 was withdrawn in various amounts over the next six months. There were no further deposits into the account. 
     
      
    16 On the Crown case, this transaction was a short-term loan and the appellant killed Mrs Davis when she required repayment and he could not pay. 
     
      
    17 The appellant and Ms Bromley had lived in a unit at 44 Marine Parade (“No 44”) until they purchased No 34 in 1994. The vendor, Ms Juliet Grimm, had been approached by the appellant or Ms Bromley in late 1993. In July 1994 she decided to live overseas, and contacted them. The price of $600,000, was agreed in July-August, the deposit of $30,000 was paid on 30 August 1994, and settlement took place on 7 October 1994. No 34 was purchased with a Westpac loan of $654,000, in Ms Bromley’s name as she was the sole income-earner, which met the balance of the purchase price and paid out a pre-existing loan. The appellant did not provide any money for the purchase. 
     
      
    18 Mrs Dawes gave evidence that about twelve months before her mother’s disappearance Mrs Davis told her that the appellant had asked her for a loan, she recalled of $300,000, to buy a house which Ms Bromley really wanted. Mrs Dawes said to her mother that it was probably alright, because Ms Bromley wanted it and had been so sick, and that it was Mrs Davis’ money to do what she wanted. A little later Mrs Davis told Mrs Dawes that the appellant had come back and said he did not need as much (she recalled $150,000, but was unsure). Much later Mrs Davis said to Mrs Dawes that she had been to the new house, which could only have been No 34, and it was very nice. 
     
      
    19 Mrs Naida Blake, a close friend of Mrs Davis, gave evidence that Mrs Davis told her she had provided money to the appellant to help buy a house, because they wanted to get Ms Bromley in the fresh air because of the cancer. In her statement Mrs Blake said “provided” and also referred to “giving”; in her oral evidence she also said “lent”. A manager at Mrs Davis’ bank (Westpac) gave evidence that, speaking to her about the $500,000 cheque for which there were insufficient funds, she told him she had lent it to a friend, short term. An internal bank document referred to Mrs Davis giving the cheque “to a friend as a personal loan (short) but she forgot she had removed the money”.  
     
      
    20 A manager at the appellant’s bank (St George) gave evidence that the appellant told him the $100,000 was going to be used for a deposit on the purchase of a property near his house, and that when the $90,000 was withdrawn the appellant told him that it was being given to the vendor. The appellant said to the manager that the vendor, a lady, was waiting outside the bank, and was the lady the appellant had been sure (or hopeful) would eventually sell her house to him and who he believed would be returning to England. 
     
      
    21 In fact the $90,000 was not used to purchase No 34; as I have said, it was purchased with bank finance.  
     
      
    22 Ms Bromley had not known of the $500,000 cheque or the $100,000 cheque. At some point in late 1994 the appellant told her about the $100,000, saying that Mrs Davis had asked for his help in withdrawing a large sum of money from one of her accounts without her children finding out. He told Ms Bromley that on Mrs Davis’ instructions he withdrew the $90,000 and gave it to her and for his trouble she gave him the remaining $10,000; he said that she asked him not to tell anyone about it. The appellant said to Ms Bromley not to say anything to Mrs Davis because she would be upset that Ms Bromley was told.  
     
      
    23 The appellant was interviewed by the police on 29 June 1995. In substance, he said that he had not spoken to Mrs Davis about a loan or about borrowing money for a deposit on a house, but that he had been asked by her to do a favour by helping her to get money without her children knowing. After the initial cheque for $500,000, he banked the $100,000 cheque and gave $90,000 back to Mrs Davis and she “left me $10,000 which was for being quiet”. In a second police interview on 15 June 1997 the appellant said that he put the money in a new account rather than his joint account with Ms Bromley so that he did not have to say anything immediately to Ms Bromley. He said that Mrs Davis was the lady waiting to receive the money when he withdrew the $90,000. 
     
      
    24 Mrs Dawes gave evidence that about a month after her mother’s disappearance the appellant came to see her, accompanied by Ms Bromley. He had telephoned to say that he had been interviewed by the police and wanted to speak to her and Mr Davis. The appellant said to Mrs Dawes that someone had told the police that he had borrowed money from Mrs Davis. He said that Mrs Davis had asked him, as a favour, to put a large sum of money in a bank account in his name and give it back “in large licks”, and not to tell Ms Bromley or the children. He said that Mrs Davis gave him the $500,000 cheque, later the $100,000 cheque, and shortly after she asked him for $90,000 cash and said he could keep the $10,000 for his trouble. He said that he had not asked for more information because it was not his business. 
     
      
    25 Ms Bromley gave evidence of being at this meeting. While Mrs Dawes had recalled the appellant being uptight, rigid, smoking nervously with hands shaking, Ms Bromley thought he was not unduly agitated or upset.  
     
      
    26 In her evidence Mrs Dawes said that her reaction to what the appellant had said was that it was nonsense, as Mrs Davis managed her own finances and could have withdrawn money at any time. Mr Davis said the same, and both were not aware of a reason for Mrs Davis wanting $100,000 or $90,000. Ms Bromley had the impression that Mrs Dawes thought the money might have been intended for her, to even up financial assistance given to Mr Davis, but Mrs Dawes said that the assistance to her brother was no secret and that Mrs Davis had given her $200,000 for a holiday house at some stage. 
     
      
    27 Mr Grace gave evidence that in mid 1995 the appellant said that a woman in the neighbourhood had gone missing and he had been at the police station to assist the police in their inquiries, and that over the following months the appellant spoke of his association with the woman. The appellant told him that she was a good friend of Ms Bromley, Aunty Dot, and that she had provided him with some money and wanted to get it back but he didn’t have the money at that time. She had threatened legal action. He had gone to her and “confronted her to effectively back off with her threats”; the appellant said he had “dealt with the matter”. There was initial mention of $10,000 “but later he mentioned that she had advanced him a large sum and he was supposed to give that, part of that – most of that – sum back and he was going to retain part of the sum but he was – it was a large amount of money”.  
     
      
    28 Mr Grace said that the appellant had little income from his work on commission. He had asked Mr Grace for an advance, and Mr Grace had given him $1,000 and arranged for the use of a petrol account. There was other evidence that the appellant had little cash resources, including analysis of bank accounts, and it is not necessary to elaborate this matter. 
     
      
    29 Mr Grace first told the police of these matters in 1997. He said that he had not told the police in July 1995 because the appellant said that the woman had gone missing before, she had had financial arguments with her family, and he was sure she would return. Also, he was in the middle of moving offices and a contentious divorce. He told the police in 1997 after a current affairs programme made him think of the significance of the matters. Mr Grace’s credibility was challenged at the trial, on the basis that in 1997 he was motivated to involve the appellant in alleged criminal conduct from ill-will over the appellant’s part in loss of a business client to a competitor, the appellant then going to work for the competitor, and in order to deter the appellant from giving evidence in litigation in Victoria conflicting with that to be given by Mr Grace. 
     
      
    30 On the Crown case the appellant had a motive to kill Mrs Davis so that he should not have to repay the money, which he could not repay. The appellant accepted on appeal that there was evidence going to motive which the jury was entitled to accept. This was a correct recognition of the force of the evidence, but the jury could also take into account in coming to their decision (if they concluded that there was the motive) the appellant’s conduct in obtaining the $100,000 on a false pretext and giving false explanations to Mrs Bromley, the police and Mrs Dawes. 
     
      
       
      Mrs Davis sets out from No 9 
       
      
    31 30 May 1995 was a Tuesday. Mr Kenneth Hulse, a builder, was working on a balcony on the side of Mrs Davis’ house at No 9. At about 1 pm, he being on the balcony and she being on the street near her parked car, she told him to the effect (see below) that she was going to visit a friend who had had cancer, and gestured to indicate that she was going to go down the hill. She was carrying her handbag. He saw her go down the road, towards the water.  
     
      
    32 I have used the words “to the effect” as a temporary generalisation. On the Crown case, the only person who conformed to what Mrs Davis said about the person she was going to visit was Ms Bromley, and Mrs Davis was setting off to walk to No 34. Precisely what was said between Mrs Davis and Mr Hulse was explored in the appellant’s submissions, and I will return to the detail. In his submissions the appellant suggested a number of reasons why Mrs Davis may not have been going to No 34, both from the exploration of what was said between Mrs Davis and Mr Hulse and because of her physical condition. 
     
      
    33 Ms Bromley was not at No 34; she was at work. There was no direct evidence that the appellant was at No 34, or that he had made an arrangement with Mrs Davis causing her to go to No 34 in the belief that Ms Bromley would be there. The appellant’s mobile phone records showed no calls to the phone of Mrs Davis’ house over the period 24-30 May 1995, but there was evidence that in 1995 landline local calls to other landline phones were not captured in the service provider’s records.  
     
      
    34 Mrs Blanche May lived at 22 Marine Parade, on the corner of Undine Street on the opposite side of the road from No 9. It was suggested in the appellant’s defence that Mrs Davis may have set off to visit her.  
     
      
    35 Mrs May was aged 74. She had had a brain tumour, for which she had had surgery in September 1994 and hospitalisation for rehabilitation in October 1994. Her hair had been shaved for the surgery. She was hospitalised from 28 April to 7 May 1995 to investigate seizures. As at 30 May 1995 she was unable to go out of the house by herself, but could move around inside. She had not had chemotherapy. She died in June 1996.  
     
      
    36 However, Mrs Davis and Mrs May were not friends, and Mrs Dawes did not know of her mother knowing Mrs May. Mrs May was not listed in Mrs Davis’ telephone directory. Mrs May’s daughter, Ms Julie May was in constant contact with her mother, and her mother had never mentioned Mrs Davis or Mrs Davis visiting. In Mrs May’s diary for 30 May 1995 she had written, “Dorothy Davis went missing – I did not know her”, and she told a police officer, when shown a photograph of Mrs Davis on 29 June 1995, that she was not a friend or acquaintance and had not seen Mrs Davis. After Mrs Davis disappeared Mrs May told a neighbour, Mrs Peacock, that she had not seen her and scarcely knew her; she told Mr Davis that she had not had any contact with his mother on the day in question and they were not friends but simply nodding acquaintances. 
     
      
    37 A number of local residents gave evidence to the effect that they did not see or hear Mrs Davis or see any happening suggesting that she was waylaid on the way to her destination. It was suggested in the appellant’s defence that a Mr Martin Meagher, who had been at the Mahon Pool on the coastal walk to Maroubra Beach around the middle of the day on 30 May 1995, could not be excluded as having had something to do with the disappearance of Mrs Davis. I will return to this also.  
     
      
       
      The phone records 
       
      
    38 Some indications of the appellant’s movements on 30 and 31 May 1995 could be found in mobile and STD phone records.  
     
      
    39 At 9.05 am on 30 May there was a 30 second call from the appellant’s mobile phone through a Chatswood tower to No 34. Ms Bromley often waited until peak hour traffic had subsided before going to work, and this was consistent with a call to Ms Bromley from the vicinity of the appellant’s workplace. There was an 8 second call from Ms Bromley’s work phone to the appellant’s mobile phone at 4.28 pm, and two minutes later a call from the appellant’s mobile phone through a tower at Mittagong to Ms Bromley’s business number for one and a half minutes. Ms Bromley did not recall the content, but it was consistent with the appellant advising her whether he was going to pick her up. There was a call at 6.27 pm from No 34 to the landline phone at Hillydale for 8 minutes and 34 seconds; Ms Bromley said that usually there would be no one at Hillydale except the appellant in the middle of the week, and he may have told her that that was where he was going to be at that time. Calls from the appellant’s mobile phone to No 34 at 8.46 pm through the Mittagong tower, 9.43 pm through a tower at Bargo and 10.16 pm through a tower at Panania were consistent with the appellant driving back from Hillydale to No 34.  
     
      
    40 On 31 May 1995 there were calls from the appellant’s mobile phone to Ms Bromley’s work phone through a tower in the Eastern Suburbs at 9.22 am, the Mittagong tower at 12.37 pm, through a Campbelltown tower at 1.29 pm and through a tower at Darling Harbour at 4.33 pm.  
     
      
    41 These calls indicated that the appellant drove to Hillydale and back on 30 May 1995, on the driving times in evidence leaving Sydney no later than about 3 pm and returning in the evening, and drove to Hillydale and back again on 31 May 1995. According to Ms Bromley, two close trips was unusual.  
     
      
       
      Mrs Davis was not seen again 
       
      
    42 Mrs Davis was not seen again after setting off following her conversation with Mr Hulse. She did not contact her family or close friends or access her bank accounts. She was in reasonable health and in good spirits, her diary had commitments for future dates, and suicide or a staged disappearance was not a realistic possibility.  
     
      
    43 Mrs Dawes telephoned Mrs Davis at about 5.30 pm on 30 May but there was no answer. Mr Davis went to No 9 on 31 May 1995, and in consultation with Mrs Dawes decided that their mother had gone out on a regular dinner engagement. He went again on 1 June, and became concerned because (for example) the paper was still on the front lawn. Enquiry from one of the dinner group established that there had not been a dinner. There were no signs that the house had been broken into; a piece of steak which had been taken out of the freezer to thaw was on the counter. Subsequent police examination of No 9 showed no missing items and nothing unusual. 
     
      
    44 After phone calls to friends and hospitals, Mrs Dawes and Mr Davis went to the police at about 1.30 pm on 1 June 1995. 
     
      
    45 The coastline in the region of the lower end of Undine Street had little by way of sheer drops. The rock shelf would have captured a body accidentally falling, at least until high tide. Extensive searches by police, surf rescue teams and dogs along the shoreline did not find Mrs Davis’ body. Canvassing in the area brought no sightings of her. 
     
      
       
      The birthday lunch is raised 
       
      
    46 I have referred to a police interview with the appellant on 29 June 1995. The appellant said that Mrs Davis was not a regular visitor but had visited No 34, that he had last seen her in October-November 1994, and that he had last spoken to her by phone about six weeks earlier; it was a social conversation, and they had discussed Ms Bromley’s health. He had visited Mrs Davis a few times, the last time in early 1994 to give her flowers in thanks for her kindness to Ms Bromley. On 30 May 1995 he was at the office, having arrived at 9am, and would have been there all day and usually left at 5 pm. 
     
      
    47 The appellant later came under greater police attention. In May-July 1997 the police searched Hillydale and surrounding forested areas. No body was found but some of the collapsed mine shafts and the cliff areas could not be examined and the forested area could not be fully searched. Further searches at Hillydale in September 2002 also did not find a body. There was no forensic evidence that Mrs Davis had been at No 34, but there was evidence that it had internal access to the garages, on the Crown case whereby the appellant could put Mrs Davis’ body in his vehicle unobserved. 
     
      
    48 The appellant was again interviewed by the police on 15 June 1997, and I have referred to the interview in relation to the cheques. In that interview the appellant said that he did not specifically recall where he was on the day of Mrs Davis’ disappearance, but he had been told by Mr Grace that Mr Grace had told the police that 30 May was his birthday and that they had been to lunch on that day. The appellant said that he did not independently recall the lunch on 30 May 1995, but he believed it had occurred because Mr Grace had told him of it. He did not remember when he started work that day or the time of the lunch. 
     
      
    49 In due course, after he was charged, the appellant gave an alibi notice to the Director of Public Prosecutions stating that on 30 May 1995 he was at work at Crows Nest and then at Mr Grace’s 40th birthday lunch at a restaurant at Crows Nest. I will return to this also. 
     
      
       
      An overview 
       
      
    50 Mrs Davis totally disappeared, and there was no real dispute that she died on or about 30 May 1995.  
     
      
    51 The principal matters in the Crown case were – 
     
      
       
        The appellant had a cogent financial motive for killing Mrs Davis, being the demand for and threat of legal action to recover the $100,000 borrowed in July 2004 on a false pretext, which the appellant had dissipated and was not in a position to repay. 
       
       
        In this respect, the appellant’s explanation for receiving the money given to Ms Bromley (and others) was inherently implausible, contrary to credible evidence and a lie.  
       
       
        On 30 May 1995 Mrs Davis set out down Undine Street to walk to visit a friend who had cancer; only visiting Ms Bromley at No 34 answered the description she gave to Mr Hulse and the way she set out.  
       
       
        Mrs Davis had not in fact visited Mrs May and her purpose would not have been to visit Mrs May. 
       
       
        In the short walk, it was highly unlikely that an unknown person attacked and abducted Mrs Davis, and it could be excluded that Mr Meagher had done so; no local resident saw or heard a commotion. 
       
       
        Misadventure such as falling onto the rock shelf or into the sea could also be excluded. 
       
       
        The appellant did not attend a birthday lunch on 30 May 1995. 
       
       
        The appellant caused Mrs Davis to go to No 34 thinking she would be visiting Ms Bromley, and there killed her and took her away in his vehicle or took her away in his vehicle and later killed her.  
       
       
        No later than 3 pm on 30 May 1995 the appellant left Sydney and drove to Hillydale, returning that night, and drove again to Hillydale the next day; this was initially for transporting and then (in daylight) for disposing of Mrs Davis’ body. 
       
       
      
    52 The appellant neither gave nor called evidence. The principal matters in the defence case were - 
     
      
       
        There was no financial or other motive for the appellant to kill Mrs Davis, and the explanation he gave to Ms Bromley for the $100,000 was the truth.  
       
       
        The evidence that Mrs Davis was demanding re-payment of the $100,000 came only from Mr Grace, who had not told the police of it when first interviewed in 1995 and when he told the police in 1997 was ill-disposed towards the appellant and should not be believed.  
       
       
        Mr Hulse’s evidence did not point only to a purpose of visiting Ms Bromley, but more likely to visiting Mrs May, and because of her arthritis and the claudication she would not have set out down Undine Street to walk to No 34. 
       
       
        There was no direct evidence that the appellant caused Mrs Davis to go to No 34 thinking she would be visiting Ms Bromley, and no direct evidence that he was at No 34 in the middle of 30 May 1995. 
       
       
        There was evidence of an alibi, the birthday lunch. 
       
       
        Mrs Davis’ body had not been found, and in particular had not been found at Hillydale. 
       
       
        An unknown person or persons could have killed Mrs Davis, and it could not be excluded that Mr Meagher was involved in her disappearance. 
       
       
        Nor could it be ruled out as a reasonable possibility that Mrs Davis had accidentally fallen onto the rock shelf and her body had been swept out to sea.  
       
       
      Ground 1: unreasonable verdict 
       
      
    53 The relevant test was not in contest. In Zaphir v R [2009] NSWCCA 124 at [75] the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Simpson and Howie JJ) said - 
     
      
       
        
        “75 As indicated above, the sole ground of the appeal is that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The test in determining such a ground remains that stated in  
        M v The Queen 
          
        [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; see also  
        Jones v The Queen  
        [1997] HCA 12; 191 CLR 439;  
        MFA v The Queen 
          
        [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606;  
        Markuleski v R 
          
        [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82. That test is simply stated as whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. In reaching that determination the appellate court must bear in mind the advantage held by the jury in its assessment of the evidence, having been able to observe the witnesses, and the manner in which they gave evidence. It must also make its own assessment of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    54 It must be borne in mind that the Crown case was a circumstantial case. 
     
      
    55 In R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; (2002) 136 A Crim R 127 Dunford J said, after citation from the judgment of Dixon CJ in Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 243 -  
     
      
       
        
        “41 It is also important to bear in mind that in considering a circumstantial evidence case, it is not the individual circumstances that need to be considered, but the combination and totality of the circumstances taken together; and the jury can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which viewed alone would support that inference:  
        Chamberlain v The Queen 
          
        (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 536.  
        
       
       
        
         
        42 There is often a tendency in cases of this nature to consider whether each individual circumstance can be separately explained away as being consistent with innocence; or to consider whether a path, however tortuous, can be found through a combination of the circumstances, which as a matter of strict logic, is capable of being reconciled with a conclusion of innocence. The correct test, however, as explained by Dixon CJ in the passages quoted above, is whether, judging the matter rationally in the light of the common experience of human affairs, the combination and totality of the facts proved are consistent with innocence.” 
        
       
      
    56 His Honour said at [44] that whether that appellant was the second person involved in the armed robbery was “essentially a question for the jury, representing, as it does, the common experience of the community … “. 
     
      
    57 Sully J at [2]-[3] agreed with these paragraphs, referring also to passages from the judgments of Dawson and McHugh JJ in Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573; they included, in the case of Dawson J, that “the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately”, and in the case of McHugh J, that “[t]he cogency of an inference of guilt is derived from the cumulative weight of circumstances, not the quality of proof of each circumstance”. 
     
      
    58 Recent High Court authority has affirmed that, in a circumstantial case, the evidence must be considered as a whole.  
     
      
    59 In R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ, with whose reasons Gleeson CJ agreed, said - 
     
      
       
        
        “46 The case against Mr Hillier was a circumstantial case. It has often been said that a jury cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances. It is of critical importance to recognise, however, that in considering a circumstantial case, all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence.” (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    60 Their Honours illustrated the proposition by the decision in Plomp v The Queen, and continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “48. Often enough, in a circumstantial case, there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. But neither at trial, nor on appeal, is a circumstantial case to be considered piecemeal. As Gibbs CJ and Mason J said in  
        Chamberlain [No 2] 
        :  
         
         
          
          ‘At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness should be believed. Again, the quality of evidence of identification may be poor, but other evidence may support its correctness; in such a case the jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness 'separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment'; they should consider the accumulation of the evidence: cf  
          Weeder v The Queen 
          .  
           
           
          Similarly, in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury should not reject one circumstance because, considered alone, no inference of guilt can be drawn from it. It is well established that the jury must consider 'the weight which is to be given to the united force of all the circumstances put together': per Lord Cairns, in  
          Belhaven and Stenton Peerage 
          , cited in  
          Reg v Van Beelen 
          ; and see  
          Thomas v The Queen 
           and cases there cited.’  
          
         
         
        And as Dixon CJ said in  
        Plomp 
        : 
         
         
          
          ‘ 
          All 
           the circumstances of the case must be weighed in judging whether there is evidence upon which a jury may reasonably be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of the crime charged. There may be many cases where it is extremely dangerous to rely heavily on the existence of a motive, where an unexplained death or disappearance of a person is not otherwise proved to be attributable to the accused; but all such considerations must be dealt with on the facts of the particular case.  
          I cannot think, however, that in a case where the prosecution is based on circumstantial evidence any part of the circumstances can be put on one side as relating to motive only and therefore not to be weighed as part of the proofs of what was done’. 
           (emphasis added)” (citations omitted 
          
         
        
       
      
    61 In R v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; (2009) 83 ALJR 243 Kiefel J, with whom Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ agreed, said at [128] that - 
     
      
       
        
        “The approach taken by [the trial judge] is consistent with what was said in  
        R v Hillier 
        , namely that a circumstantial case is not to be considered piecemeal. It is of critical importance to recognise, in considering such a case, that ""all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence."" (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    62 In R v Kaldor [2004] NSWCCA 425; (2004) 150 A Crim R 271 Dunford J said at [2] that he  
     
      
       
        
        “ … adher[ed] to the view I expressed in R v Micallef … at [44] that as a circumstantial case involves a consideration of the evidence in the light of the common experience of human affairs, it is essentially a question for the jury representing, as it does, the common experience of the community being comprised of men and women from different backgrounds, of different ages and with different experiences in life applying their collective knowledge of human affairs. That is not to say that there will not be cases of which  
        Knight v The Queen 
         (1992) 175 CLR 495 is an example (other examples are not easy to find) where an appellate court will conclude, in accordance with the principles enunciated by the High Court in  
        M v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 487 that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty; but I am satisfied that this is not such a case.” 
        
       
      
    63 Howie J also said at [86] that he - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … doubt[ed] that, with respect to a circumstantial case depending exclusively upon the jury’s ability to assess the conduct of persons by applying their commonsense and experience of life, this Court and the jury stand in an equal position as finders of fact. This is because I am concerned that the Court should pay due deference to the combined experience and commonsense of the members of the jury in a case such as the present, which was one quintessentially for a determination by ordinary citizens in the community. However, I do not need to reach any firm view upon this point, or to determine whether such a consideration is inconsistent with the principles stated by the High Court for the resolution of this type of ground of appeal, because I do not have a doubt about the guilt of the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    64 In Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179 Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreed, said [88] that the jury’s advantage in considering a case based on circumstantial evidence should be borne in mind, and took up from R v Kaldor that “the jury brings to consideration of a circumstantial case the common experience of members of the community comprising men and women from different backgrounds, of different ages and with different experiences in life, who apply to the case their collective knowledge of human affairs and their common sense”. In Halmi v R [2008] NSWCCA 259 Johnson J, with whom Campbell JA and Grove J agreed, referred at [76] to R v Kaldor and R v Chahine and repeated these words; see also BJR v R [2008] NSWCCA 43 at [97] per Latham J. 
     
      
    65 This Court must make its own assessment of the evidence. But the assessment is of the cumulative effect of the evidence, and with due regard to the common experience of human affairs and common sense brought by the jury to their determination of guilt or innocence. 
     
      
    66 The appellant said in his written submissions, which were but briefly developed in oral submissions - 
     
      
       
        
        “31. The appellant submits that, having regard to all the evidence, it was not ‘open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt’, for four reasons; firstly, even putting the alibi evidence to one side, the evidence was incapable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that Davis attended the appellant’s house on 30 May. Secondly, the prosecution was unable to eliminate a reasonable possibility that, at the time in the prosecution case the appellant was supposed to be at his house to receive Davis, he was at a lunch in the Crows Nest area with work associates, and thereafter drove directly to Hillydale. Thirdly, the impact on witnesses’ memory of the twelve-year lapse of time since the events in question was such that critical prosecution evidence in relation to these first two issues in particular was unreliable, and that unreliability impacted unfairly on the appellant. Fourthly, the pre-trial publicity that was adverse to the appellant’s character was so significant that, in a circumstantial case such as this one, its subtle effect on the minds of the jurors when drawing inferences from the evidence was such that one would have real concern that those inferences were not infected with prejudice.” 
        
       
      
    67 The fourth reason became ground 2, and I will deal with it separately. The third reason was taken up by the appellant as an adjunct to the first and second reasons, although the lapse of time should be borne in mind more generally.  
     
      
    68 The appellant’s approach rather departed from that appropriate to a circumstantial case, tending to take the two matters of setting out for No 34 and whether the appellant was at a birthday lunch in isolation, rather than as part of the circumstances as a whole from the cumulative weight of which guilt was to be found. As I have said, the Court’s assessment must be of the whole of the evidence. 
     
      
       
      (a) Setting out for No 34 
       
      
    69 The appellant said that there was no evidence of an arrangement for Mrs Davis to visit Ms Bromley or go to No 34, including that the appellant’s mobile phone records did not include a call to Mrs Davis; that there was no direct evidence or forensic evidence tending to confirm Mrs Davis’s presence at No 34; and that there was no direct evidence that the appellant had been at No 34 at any time between the phone call through the Chatswood tower at 9.05 am and the phone call through the Mittagong tower at 4.30 pm. These were valid points, but landline records for a call from No 34 to Mrs Davis’ house were not available and searches at No 34 were not undertaken proximate to Mrs Davis’ disappearance. 
     
      
    70 The appellant then submitted that Mrs Davis did not say to Mr Hulse that the intended visit, to whomever it was, had been pre-arranged, and that what she said was consistent with a spontaneous visit on Mrs Davis’ initiative. He submitted that Mrs Davis’ stated purpose did not conform to Ms Bromley being the friend she was to visit, that Mrs Davis would not have gone to No 34 by walking downhill along Undine Street, and that Mrs May better fitted as the friend to be visited.  
     
      
    71 I go first to what Mrs Davis said to Mr Hulse. I have said that Mrs Davis told him to the effect that she was going to visit a friend who had had cancer, but that generalisation received greater analysis in the submissions. 
     
      
    72 In his evidence in chief Mr Hulse said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Would you tell us what she said and what she did? 
         
        A. She was going to visit a friend that’s had – or got cancer, and she was going on walk around there because it wasn’t far. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. Do you remember anything else she said about where she was going? 
         
        A. She was going down the hill. I think – no – no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As best you can recollect, what did she say about where she was going? 
         
        A. She’s going to visit a friend that’s had cancer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That has had cancer, did she say? 
         
        A. And she had chemo, and I can’t remember anything else. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she say it was a male or a female? 
         
        A. A female friend, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who had had cancer? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And had chemo? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you, when she said that -- 
         
        A. No, I said to her something like, “Did she lose all her hair?”, and she said “Yes, she did”; that’s when she said she’d had the chemo. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she indicate to you in any way where she was going? 
         
        A. I was up on the top and she was outside; she said that she was going to walk, she didn’t need the car because it wasn’t far, and she waved like that (demonstrated), saying she was going to go down the hill. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And -- 
         
        A. And she was walking down there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you tell us which direction she indicated? 
         
        A. She indicated – if I was at house, she indicated to me that she was going to go down the hill to the right, if I was at the house looking outwards. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now, you know there’s the sea at the end of the street? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was she indicting towards the sea or away from the sea? 
         
        A. Down towards the sea -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she indicate whether -- 
         
        A. – with a wave. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry? 
         
        A. She waved to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. It’s more like a gesture to say ‘I’m going this way’, you know.” 
        
       
      
    73 In cross-examination Mr Hulse was asked whether, when he was first spoken to by a policeman, he said that he was told “that she was going to visit a friend nearby who had just got out of hospital”. He agreed that he remembered Mrs Davis using those words “or very similar to that maybe”. He said that he “wouldn’t have said that if she hadn’t told me”. A police officer later gave evidence of an entry in a police document, not in evidence, incorporating that as information provided by Mr Hulse.  
     
      
    74 Mr Hulse was also asked whether he had asked whether the person had had chemotherapy or whether Mrs Davis had first referred to chemotherapy. He was at first unsure, but came to say that “it was I who said she had the chemo”. 
     
      
    75 There was then further examination in chief. Mr Hulse was taken to a police statement made on 1 June 1995, and agreed that it recorded that he was told “she was going to visit her friend that had cancer” and recorded nothing about the friend having just come out of hospital. He was taken to a police statement made on 6 June 1995, in which his account of what he was told was to the same effect as he had said in his evidence in chief. He was taken to a record of evidence given at an inquest in 2002, in which the account was that he was told that Mrs Davis was going to visit a friend “because she’s just got, got over cancer”, he asked whether the friend had had chemotherapy and had lost her hair, and Mrs Davis “told me she’d lost her hair”. In neither the 6 June 1995 statement nor the inquest evidence did the account refer to the friend having just got out of hospital. 
     
      
    76 Mr Hulse was then asked by the Crown Prosecutor - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Hulse, do you now have any clear recollection, having had read to you the versions that you gave to the police and to the inquest, do you have any clear recollection whether or not Mrs Davis said that her friend had just got out of hospital? Do you remember now? 
         
        A. Hmm – I think she did tell me that because otherwise I wouldn’t have said it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now is it contained in any document that you’ve created? 
         
        A. It might have been slightly different terminology, though you just maybe added something. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What sort of terminology do you think?  
         
        A. Well, if you say one thing and then mean another, but it is on the same sort of lines, you know what I mean. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No, I am sorry, I don’t understand what you mean? 
         
        A. Oh. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember what the words were that Mrs Davis used? 
         
        A. I only recollect what was in the statement. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But the statement doesn’t have anything -- 
         
        A, No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. – about her saying that her friend had just got out of hospital? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she say that her friend had been in hospital at some stage? 
         
        A. Maybe that’s what it was, but I can’t recollect that now. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember now whether she said that her friend had been in hospital or had got out of hospital or just got out of hospital? Are you able to say when? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whether any of those versions are correct? 
         
        A. She had been in hospital or had got out of hospital or just got out of hospital? That’s as far as I could assume that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You assumed that? 
         
        A. Well, if she had had the chemo she must have been in hospital. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you assume that if she had chemo she must have been in hospital? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have you heard of people having chemo otherwise than in hospital? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
      ‘ 
       
        
        Q. Never heard of it? 
         
        A,. What, having it outside of hospital? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. Do you think it is possible that you have assumed that -- 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. – that’s what she meant? 
         
        A. Probably, yeah. I probably assumed that she’d been in hospital, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you assume that she had just got out of hospital? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you assume that? 
         
        A. Because she’d just got over chemo, hasn’t she, I thought that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that what you thought? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Mrs Davis say to you that she had had had [sic] chemo? 
         
        A. She must have done otherwise I wouldn’t have known. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she say to you, “My friend has had chemo” or did she say, “My friend has just had chemo”? 
         
        A. I can’t recollect which one it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You can’t remember which of these versions? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it possible that she said to you, “My friend has had had [sic] chemo”? 
         
        A. Possible, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it possible that she said, ‘My friend lost all her hair’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it possible that she said, ‘My friend has had cancer’? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    77 There was further cross-examination of Mr Hulse. He was invited to agree that a record of what he said at the time was best, which brought a form of agreement, “But if I’ve said it and it is on the forms. … That’s what I’ve put down, isn’t it?” He appeared to affirm that he would not have said he had been told the friend had just got out of hospital unless he had been told it, and to agree that he had “no reason to doubt, as you sit there now”, that he was told it, although some answers were recorded in the transcript as “Hmm” and “Uh-huh”.  
     
      
    78 The appellant submitted that the intended visit could not have been to Ms Bromley, because she had not just got out of hospital; her periods of hospitalisation had ended in August the previous year. Mrs Davis would have known of that, having attended the celebratory dinner. While Ms Bromley had lost hair, she had said in her evidence that she was not sure that Mrs Davis knew of it. At least some of Mr Hulse’s evidence, the appellant submitted, was consistent with a friend who currently had cancer, and Mrs May answered that description. Further, Mrs May’s hair had been shaved off for the surgery, she had recently been in hospital, and she could have been expected to be at home whereas Ms Bromley could have been expected to be at work. While Mrs May had not had chemotherapy, on some of Mr Hulse’s evidence he rather than Mrs Davis had first mentioned chemotherapy and Mrs Davis’ response was only that the friend had lost her hair and not that it was due to chemotherapy. 
     
      
    79 Against this, the Crown submitted, Mrs Davis and Mrs May were not friends, and at best were nodding acquaintances, and there was no evidence that Mrs Davis knew or was likely to have known of Mrs May’s state of health and particularly that she had recently been hospitalised. Their common acquaintance, Mrs Peacock, knew that Mrs May had been ill but not the nature of the illness, and did not know that she had lost her hair or at the time that she had been recently hospitalised. Mrs Davis described the person she was to visit as a friend, and even if Mr Hulse had first raised chemotherapy Mrs Davis’ response conveyed that the friend had had chemotherapy causing the loss of hair. If Mr Hulse had initially told the police that the friend had just got out of hospital, in the light of the more detailed statements he made shortly afterwards that was just a generalisation, and as he at one point in his evidence accepted an assumption. 
     
      
    80 Even as a visit to a nodding acquaintance, and even assuming knowledge of ill-health, the Crown submitted that a spontaneous visit to Mrs May was most unlikely. It was submitted that Mr Davis and Mrs Dawes said that only Ms Bromley fitted the description of a female friend who had had cancer, with chemotherapy and loss of hair. 
     
      
    81 I go then to walking to No 34.  
     
      
    82 Mr Davis and Mrs Dawes gave evidence that, because of her arthritis, Mrs Davis walked only where it was flat and did not like stairs or steep slopes, and that she did not have the breath for strenuous walking. 
     
      
    83 The appellant submitted that it was unlikely that Mrs Davis would have visited Ms Bromley by walking downhill along Undine Street and then to the right by the pedestrian access along Marine Parade. The pedestrian access was described by Ms Bromley as a grassed area, and as “some tree or other shrubby area that you sort of had to walk through”; the ground was “uneven”, and there was “a worn sort of path just because of the people that used to walk through there” (as part of the coastal walk). If Mrs Davis had walked, the appellant submitted, she would not have taken a route which required walking the uneven pedestrian access, and would have taken the easier route of Banks and Wilson Streets on the other two sides of the block. But, the appellant submitted the likelihood was that she would not have walked, but would have driven in her car, so that she would not have had the uphill walk back from No 34. The appellant pointed to Mrs Dawes’ belief that, because of Mrs Davis’s arthritis and the condition of claudication, her mother would have acted in one of these ways, a belief up to a point expressed also by Mr Davis although he (and also Mrs Peacock) thought his mother could have walked down Undine Street and around to No 34. The appellant pointed also to Ms Bromley’s evidence that, when she and the appellant were living at No 34 about 100 metres further away from No 9, Mrs Davis drove when she visited them on a couple of occasions. 
     
      
    84 The appellant submitted that walking down Undine Street to Mrs May’s house was, however, within Mrs Davis’ capacity, and was the sensible way of getting there. Mrs Davis had not in fact seen Mrs May, but the appellant suggested that a spontaneous visit could have been frustrated because the doorbell was not working – Ms Julie May said that it sometimes did not work, and Mrs May’s diary referred to a failed attempt to fix it on 1 June 1995. A security door made it difficult otherwise to attract Mrs May’s attention. 
     
      
    85 Thus, the appellant submitted, there could not be excluded as a reasonable possibility that Mrs Davis had intended to visit Mrs May as the person who had cancer and had just got out of hospital, and had set out to visit Mrs May but had been unable to attract her attention, and had been waylaid by a person or persons unknown (perhaps for her handbag); he said that strangers could be expected on the coastal walk, or perhaps fishing. Mrs Davis’ body may have been pushed onto the rock platform and taken out to sea at high tide, or put into the sea and taken out to sea, before the searches were made. 
     
      
    86 A number of points were made by the Crown in response to the submissions. The opinion of Mrs Davis’ doctor was that she would be unlikely to be able to walk two or three hundred metres up a steep hill without periods of rest, and would experience cramping sensations in the legs. The distances were greater than those in question, the steepness was unexplained, and it could be done with periods of rest. As the appellant acknowledged, this opinion was of limited value. Visiting Mrs May involved walking back up the steeper Undine Street, essentially the walk which, on the appellant’s submissions, Mrs Davis would have avoided by taking her car. Ms Bromley said that the pedestrian path was “not difficult”, its description by no means precluded careful negotiation by Mrs Davis, and there was evidence that she was “quite active” (Mr Hulse), led an active social life, did her own shopping and “endeavoured to keep as active as possible so that she took opportunities to do easy walks” (Mr Davis). The Crown submitted that, save for avoiding steep walks, Mrs Davis’ frailty should not be overstated, and that she could have intended to walk back via Wilson and Banks Streets or could have been promised a lift back by the appellant. 
     
      
    87 Further, the Crown submitted, if Mrs Davis had not been able to attract Mrs May’s attention because the doorbell was not working, she would have returned to No 9. Her journey would have been entirely within Undine Street, an unlikely scenario for a stranger to waylay her. 
     
      
    88 The jury were taken on a view at Lurline Bay, including traversing the route from No 9 downhill and to the right to No 34, the access to Mrs May’s house, and the surrounding Banks and Wilson Streets; they were also taken to Mahon Pool next mentioned The pedestrian terrain was not as it had been in 1995, there had been other changes from 1995, and the differences were explained. We were taken on a view intended to replicate in these respects the view on which the jury were taken. 
     
      
    89 It is convenient at this point to refer to Mr Meagher, who on the defence case at the trial “could not be rule[d] out as an alternative explanation”, although that was not prominent in the appellant’s submissions on appeal.  
     
      
    90 Mr Meagher had a chloroform sniffing habit. On the morning of 30 May 1995 he was at Mahon Pool, some distance from Undine Street around the point. His behaviour at the toilets caused the police to take him to Maroubra Police Station. He left the police station at “about midday”, returning by taxi to Mahon Pool where his motor bike was parked. He sniffed the rest of his chloroform and then rode to the Captain Cook Hotel, where he remained until the evening. The hotel manager, to whom he was known, said he arrived “sometime around 1 pm”, but Mr Meagher thought that he arrived at about 2 pm or 2.30 pm.  
     
      
    91 Mr Meagher was an alcoholic and had a criminal record for matters such as drunkenness and assault when affected by alcohol. Sniffing chloroform made him feel pleasant and did not make him aggressive. He said that he had never walked around Marine Parade to where No 34 was, and that he had nothing to do with the disappearance of Mrs Davis and specifically that he had not attacked her or robbed her of her handbag. 
     
      
    92 A new matter arose while Kirby J was summing-up at the conclusion of the trial.  
     
      
    93 As a result of something reported to his Honour, a tea lady, Ms Patricia Abbey, was called and gave evidence that in the tea room Mr Meagher had said that he had seen an old lady down near the beach, or in the park, around the time he was picked up by the police near the toilets. The evidence was very confused, and Ms Abbey agreed that she had “psychiatric issues” and sometimes difficulties with her memory. A “court watcher”, Mr Dennis Roberts, gave evidence that Ms Abbey had told him that Mr Meagher had said that he had been talking to Dorothy Davis in the park (he mentioning the name), who had been carrying a white handbag. Mrs Dawes gave evidence that her mother did not own a white handbag. A police officer gave evidence that Ms Abbey had told him that Mr Meagher had said he was worried that “they” might be thinking he had seen the old lady near the toilets, but had not said what the old lady’s name was94 Mr Meagher was recalled, and gave evidence to the effect that he had felt he was under suspicion, he had said to a tea lady that he was concerned and asked what was going on, he was told “If they thought it was you, you would be in handcuffs”, and that he had not told the tea lady that he had seen an old lady near Mahon Pool and had not seen an old lady there. He said, “I didn’t tell her [the tea lady] anything. I asked her what was going on.” 
     
      
       
      (b) At a birthday lunch? 
       
      
    95 On 3 July 1995 the police asked staff at Mr Grace’s business about the appellant’s movements on 30 May 1995. According to the note made on a running information sheet - 
     
      
       
        
        “[Mr Grace] informs Police that Bruce BURRELL attended work on Tuesday 30 May 1995. GRACE recalls the date because it was his birthday and BURRELL ‘gave him a hard time about his age’. GRACE, his girl-friend Julianne KEENE [sic], and BURRELL left the office about 12.30 pm on 30 May 1995 and went to The Sentosa Restaurant at 10 Clarke Street, Crows Nest for a birthday lunch for GRACE. The three of them left the restaurant about 3.30 pm that afternoon and returned to the office. GRACE recalls that Bruce BURRELL left the office between 4.30 pm and 5 pm. 
        
       
       
        
        Julianne KEENE … was spoken to and she recalls the birthday lunch for GRACE held on Tuesday 30 May 1995. She confirms that she was present at the restaurant with GRACE and BURRELL, leaving the office between 12 md and 12.30 pm and returning to the office about 3.30 pm. She recalls that BURRELL left the office about 5pm.” 
        
       
      
    96 As I have mentioned, when interviewed on 15 June 1997 the appellant said that he did not recall being at a birthday lunch for Mr Grace, but believed he had been at one because Mr Grace had said so. 
     
      
    97 The police officer who entered the information on the running sheet had no independent recollection, but said that he would have made contemporaneous notebook entries and made the entry from them and stood by “the accuracy of what was recorded”.  
     
      
    98 However, there was much other evidence in relation to the birthday lunch. 
     
      
       
        Mr Grace said that he told the police of a lunch at Crows Nest, but that he told them he was unsure of the day. He said that he offered to check, but was told not to bother. 
       
       
        Mr Grace recalled a birthday lunch, but could not recall whether it was on his birthday (which was 30 May). It might have been the next day or the day after that. He recalled Ms Julie-Anne Keane trying to arrange the lunch at the Sentosa Restaurant and wanting to include the appellant. He also said there was also a separate function for his birthday at a restaurant at Church Point. Others at the birthday lunch were Ms Keane, Mr Mat Ellis, Ms Monique Bushby and Mr Sean Buckley. (Ms Keane worked in the business and was then in a relationship with Mr Grace; Mr Ellis and Ms Bushby were employees in the business; Mr Buckley’s company was a major client of the business, the client later lost to a competitor as earlier mentioned.) The lunch was from about 1 pm to about 3.05 pm. Mr Grace said that Mr Buckley paid for the lunch using his credit card, which he (Mr Grace) at the time thought was generous. He recalled the car towing incident to which I next refer. 
       
       
        Ms Julie-Anne Slinger, formerly Keane, recalled a birthday lunch for Mr Grace at the Sentosa Restaurant but not whether it was actually on his birthday. She recalled Mr Buckley’s car being towed away from a clearway at 3 pm or 3.30 pm after the lunch and the appellant intervening to save that from happening. In her statement she had said that the appellant was not present at the lunch, but from the recollection of the car towing incident said in her oral evidence that she thought it likely that he was. She also remembered the separate birthday function at Church Point. 
       
       
        A statement of Mr Ellis was tendered, in which he said that he had attended a number of lunches, mainly at the Sentosa Restaurant, and recalled the appellant being at a few of them. He recalled a lunch for Mr Grace’s birthday, but not the date or where it was. 
       
       
        Ms Felicity Walsh, also an employee of Mr Grace’s business, was thought by Ms Slinger to have been at the Sentosa Restaurant birthday lunch. Ms Walsh recalled a birthday lunch for Mr Grace in 1995, but not at the Sentosa Restaunt; it was at a Chinese restaurant. She could not recall whether it was on Mr Grace’s birthday or another day. She thought, but was not sure, that the appellant was present. 
       
       
        A statement of Ms Melinda Sides was tendered. She worked for Mr Buckley’s company. She recalled a lunch with Mr Grace, Ms Keane, the appellant and Mr Buckley, at an Asian restaurant following a business meeting. It was not a birthday lunch. She could not recall the date. When she and Mr Buckley left, at about 4 pm, the others were still at the restaurant. 
       
       
        Mr Buckley said that he had been invited to a birthday lunch for Mr Grace, but had not attended. He had been to two lunches at which the appellant was present. One was at the Sentosa Restaurant, to discuss advertising, for which he paid on a credit card; he identified a credit card record for payment at the Sentosa Restaurant on 28 July 1995, which accorded with his recollection. Records of the Sentosa Restaurant were tendered consistent with this. There was no credit card record for 30 May 1995, and no record of payment by Mr Buckley by credit card on any other occasion. The other lunch was three or four months later at a French restaurant. When reminded, Mr Buckley recalled an incident when his car was about to be towed away and the appellant intervened, and said it could have been the day of the first lunch or another time. 
       
       
        In cross-examination Ms Slinger said that the lunch which Mr Buckley said he attended was possibly a “birthday lunch” because he had been unable to come to an earlier celebration – it was, to him, a delayed birthday lunch. 
       
      
    99 The appellant submitted that “[t]he evidence touching on the question of an alibi was strong as to the appellant having attended a birthday lunch for Grace, but it was not conclusive as to the date of that lunch”. The issue posed by the evidence was wider: was there was a birthday lunch on 30 May 1995 attended by the appellant?  
     
      
    100 In the summing-up Kirby J carefully summarised the evidence concerning the alibi, and instructed the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that “the alibi evidence” should be rejected. He referred to bearing in mind that the witnesses were giving evidence twelve years after the event, although sometimes with the aid of statements earlier made. He concluded this part of the summing up - 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, it is fundamental to the Crown case, as I said before, that Bruce Burrell was at 34 Marine Parade to receive Dorothy Davis when, as the Crown asserts, she walked to that address from her home. The Crown cannot succeed if there is a reasonable possibility that the accused was elsewhere; that is, a reasonable possibility that he was at a birthday lunch for Peter Grace during the lunch hour on 30 May 1995. 
        
       
       
        
        So the issue for you is whether, on the evidence, you are satisfied that the Crown has eliminated beyond a reasonable doubt the presence of Bruce Burrell at such a lunch on 30 May 1998.” 
        
       
      
    101 The appellant’s initial advice to the police that he would have been in the office until 5pm on 30 May 1995 was contrary to the mobile phone record suggesting that he was within the Mittagong tower’s area at 4.30 pm. He would have to have left Crows Nest no later than about 3 pm in order to be within that area. Similarly, the information in the running sheet was wrong insofar as Mr Grace and Ms Keane said that the appellant left the office at about 4.30 pm – 5 pm. While Mr Grace recalled a birthday lunch at the Sentosa Restaurant at which the appellant was present, from Mr Buckley’s evidence and the credit card record (and Mr Grace remembered Mr Buckley paying) that lunch was not his birthday lunch, but was on 28 July 1995. From the car towing incident, Ms Slinger must have been recalling the same lunch and confusing it with a birthday lunch. So the Crown submitted, and it was submitted that (with regard also to other matters in the circumstantial case) it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had not been at a birthday lunch on 30 May 1995. 
     
      
       
      (c) The passing of twelve years 
       
      
    102 The appellant submitted that, as was evident from the evidence given by Mr Hulse and the varied evidence given by a number of witnesses concerning the birthday lunch, time had affected memories on these important matters, and that unreliability of the evidence of critical witnesses through the lapse of time “impacted unfairly on the appellant” (see at [66] above). He did not greatly elaborate. The Crown submitted in response that many witnesses had given information to the police or made police statements shortly after 30 May 1995, particularly referring in the case of Mr Hulse to his statements of 1 June and 6 June 1995, and that what they had then said was available to the jury to assist in overcoming the effect of time on memories as at 2007. 
     
      
    103 Frailty of memory is part of life, and of criminal trials. The jury could not but have been aware of, and had regard to, the passage of time in coming to their satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. The passage of time, indeed, had the potential to operate to the appellant’s advantage, for example enabling the exploration of Mr Hulse’s evidence of what was said by Mrs Davis to cast doubt on its strength in the Crown case.  
     
      
    104 As no doubt the jury did, in this Court’s assessment of the evidence the passage of time is to be borne in mind, but as one matter only in coming to a decision on the question for the Court. 
     
      
    105 It is now necessary to determine, in accordance with the principles earlier outlined, whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. It should be repeated that the determination is to be made upon the whole of the evidence, considering the combination and totality of the circumstances and their cumulative weight; so, for example, the weight to be given to Mr Hulse’s evidence upon analysis such as that undertaken by the appellant, or the effect of the varied evidence of the witnesses concerning the birthday lunch, is not to be considered in isolation. Further, in the present case the jury’s experiences of life and their collective knowledge of human affairs and common sense should be particularly recognised in their assessments of witnesses giving evidence many years after the relevant events and their fact-finding in a circumstantial case. Resolving discrepancies or conflicts in the evidence and making inferences were tasks for the jury in the exercise of those qualities. 
     
      
    106 I have sought to explain the considerations exposed in the submissions for the appellant and for the Crown; in a lengthy trial there was of course evidence to which I have not specifically referred, or have referred only in summary form. The appellant submitted that the Crown case did not rise above evidence of motive, some limited evidence of opportunity, and evidence of the appellant’s movements that may have been consistent with a theory of disposal of Mrs Davis’ body. Referring also to the passage of time and the pre-trial media publicity to which I will come, he submitted that the jury was not in an advantageous position in resolving uncertainty and ambivalence in the evidence of Mr Hulse and of the witnesses concerning the birthday lunch, and that there was a significant possibility that the appellant had been wrongly convicted. 
     
      
    107 I do not agree, and in my opinion, the ground of appeal should not be upheld. Given the evidence of motive, the central issue was whether Mrs Davis had set out from No 9 to visit Ms Bromley at No 34, providing a link with the appellant on 30 May 1995 in conjunction with his trips to Hillydale. It was well open to the jury to be satisfied that Mrs Davis’ purpose was to visit Ms Bromley, not to visit Mrs May or some other purpose, and that she had not been waylaid by Mr Meagher or an unknown stranger. As to Mr Meagher, the jury was entitled to regard it as fanciful that Mrs Davis would have walked to Mahon Pool, and to take the view that it was not a reasonable possibility that Mr Meagher had otherwise done away with Mrs Davis. Further, in exclusion of the alibi it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the appellant had not been at a birthday lunch on 30 May 1995. In all these respects regard must be had to all the matters making out a circumstantial case. 
     
      
    108 In my opinion, on the evidence as a whole the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt, and on my consideration of the whole of the evidence I am not persuaded that there is a significant possibility that the appellant was wrongly convicted. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Notoriety and character 
       
      
    109 The appellant’s submissions focussed on a note received from the jury in the course of their deliberations. A fairly extensive context is necessary. 
     
      
    110 The appellant’s trial was listed to commence on 30 July 2007. By notice of motion filed on 25 July 1997 he applied for a permanent or temporary stay based on the prejudice created by media publicity. Earlier such applications had been made and refused. The application was also refused. There was no appeal at the time, and the present appeal was not on the basis that the refusal was erroneous, but the appellant relied in the appeal on material put before the Court for the purposes of the application.  
     
      
    111 The material was extensive. A sufficient description of its nature is as follows. 
     
      
    112 Ms Kerry Whelan disappeared on 6 May 1997. There was publicity surrounding her disappearance, including as to the appellant being person of interest in the police investigation and as to searches of Hillydale.  
     
      
    113 On 1 April 1999 the appellant was charged with the kidnap and murder of Ms Whelan. His trial commenced on 29 January 2001. Following certain rulings by the trial judge, the Crown filed a nolle prosequi on 17 April 2001.  
     
      
    114 In May and June 2002 sequential inquests were held into the disappearances of Mrs Davis and Ms Whelan. A newspaper article on 26 June 2002 reported that the Coroner had said that he was satisfied that there was an indictable offence and a reasonable prospect that a jury would convict a known person of that offence in relation to the disappearances of both Mrs Davis and Ms Whelan.  
     
      
    115 Media coverage during the inquests and following their conclusion referred to the appellant and suggested that he may have been the offender; indeed, in a newspaper article on 31 July 2002 it was said that he “was the likely killer of both women”. It is unnecessary to go into detail, as it may be accepted that the publicity was strongly adverse to the appellant. The appellant referred in particular, however, to a newspaper article referring to a bottle of chloroform said to have been found by police in the house at Hillydale following Ms Whelan’s disappearance. Evidence of finding the chloroform was not led at the appellant’s trial for the murder of Mrs Davis.  
     
      
    116 In September 2002 the Director of Public Prosecutions announced his decision to indict the appellant over Ms Whelan’s disappearance, and there was newspaper coverage of the announcement.  
     
      
    117 The appellant was tried on that indictment in the latter part of 2005, with a hung jury. After a re-trial, he was found guilty in mid-2006 and was sentenced in August 2006. An appeal to this Court was heard at the end of November 2006. Judgment was given in mid-March 2007. A further application was made to this Court, resulting in a further judgment later in March 2007.  
     
      
    118 All these events attracted newspaper, television and radio coverage. In particular, shortly after the conviction on 11 June 2006 a television programme referred to the charge against the appellant of murdering Mrs Davis and included excerpts of an interview of the appellant in 1997 in which he was asked about the coincidence of his knowing two women who had disappeared; this, it was suggested in the programme, was “unusual to the point of disbelief”. In a radio interview in mid-March 2007 Mr Whelan, the widower of Ms Whelan, remarked that the appellant “faces the Dorothy Davis matter after 13 years” and that “perhaps after that, after that trial, maybe then he might realise that he, he’s not going to get off and hopefully will come clean”.  
     
      
    119 The appellant submitted on appeal that there were similarities between the two disappearances, each involving a circumstantial case of a financial motive, a suggested rendezvous, an unexplained disappearance and alleged disposal at Hillydale, such that the publicity in respect of the disappearance of Ms Whelan would “resonate” as the evidence unfolded in the appellant’s trial for the murder of Mrs Davis. The jury would have been reminded of the publicity, he said, by evidence such as Mr Grace saying that he went to the police in 1997 as a result of a newspaper report of police interest in the appellant. The Crown submitted that the most recent media reportage had been four months prior to the commencement of the trial; that the most significant media publicity had been many years before, in 2002, and that media references to the disappearance of Mrs Davis in the few years before the trial had been infrequent and in passing.  
     
      
    120 The jury was empanelled on 6 August 2007. From the discussion with counsel and some remarks addressed by Kirby J to representatives of the media, it is evident that all concerned were conscious of prior publicity concerning the disappearance of Ms Whelan. That must have been so, given the recent application for a stay. 
     
      
    121 His Honour’s remarks to the jury panel in waiting included, after reference to reaching a verdict only on the evidence presented in the courtroom - 
     
      
       
        
        “What that means is that anything that anyone who is selected may have heard or read or seen on television in the past about this case or about this accused is entirely irrelevant and must not be taken into account; and, hence, any pre-trial publicity, anything that you know about this case or this accused must be put to one side and is irrelevant, as it is in every criminal trial. These instructions are given to every jury panel in waiting. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        What is ultimately needed is a jury of twelve persons aimed to bring a dispassionate mind to bear upon the issues that will be joined between the parties; that is, to bring a dispassionate mind to bear upon the evidence. By ‘dispassionate’, I mean an objective mind – not included influenced by prejudice, not influenced by bias – but able to reach an objective view on the evidence and only the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        So, if, for instance, you knew one of the witnesses, or you knew the accused or his family, or you knew the woman who is said to be deceased, Dorothy Davis, or her family, such that you might not be able to bring an objective mind to bear upon the evidence called in this trial, then you should ask to be excused. Or, if you believe, by reason of pre-trial publicity that you may have witnessed, having heard the Crown describe what the case is about, or opinions you may have formed as a result of that publicity, or what you imagine that you may know about this case or the accused, if you feel that you may thereby be prejudiced or unable to bring a dispassionate and objective mind to bear on the issue, then, again, you should ask to be excused. 
        
       
       
        
        So, I would ask you to carefully weigh up your position, your personal position, as you listen to the Crown, and ultimately if y ou believe that there is any risk that you may not be able to be completely objective and dispassionate and to put from your mind anything you may have heard or seen or read about this particular matter, if you should happen to recognise it, then you should ask to be excused.” 
        
       
      
    122 His Honour’s preliminary remarks to the jury once empanelled included the importance of not having regard to “material outside this courtroom”, and - 
     
      
       
        
        “As I say, many murder trials in this Court are given a deal of publicity – some of it sensational, much of it inaccurate, I regret to say – before the trial eventually gets to Court, but the publicity, whether in the past or as the trial proceeds, is, as I have said more than once this morning, utterly irrelevant.” 
        
       
      
    123 In the summing-up his Honour appropriately directed the jury that they should approach their task “impartially, dispassionately, calmly, objectively and reaching a result which owes nothing to prejudice or bias, reaching a decision which is not based upon sympathy, but an objective view of the evidence”. The jury was told to aim at “arriving at an objective view on the evidence”. 
     
      
    124 The jury retired to consider their verdict on Wednesday 5 September 2007. On the following Tuesday the jury was recalled for the further evidence of Mr Meagher and others and there were brief supplementary addresses and directions. 
     
      
    125 On Wednesday 12 September 2007 a note was received from the jury indicating that they could not reach a unanimous decision. After submissions from counsel, Kirby J gave a modified Black direction (Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44) inviting the jury to continue to consider the issues and seek to reach unanimity.  
     
      
    126 On Friday 14 September 2007 a note from the jury indicated that “there had been some progress in the last day”, but subsequently the foreman was sworn and said that he thought it unlikely, with further deliberation, that they would come to a unanimous decision (see Jury Act 1977, s 55F(2)(b)). His Honour then gave a majority verdict direction.  
     
      
    127 The jury retired again at 11.55 am on 14 September 2007. A little later a note was received - 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury request a copy of the transcript of your Honour’s ‘judge’s directions and comments on reasonable doubt and standard of proof’. We also foreshadow a request for your Honour to expand on these shortly thereafter.” 
        
       
      
    128 Response to the note was deferred to Monday 17 September 2007. On that morning, before the jury was recalled the deal with the note, a further note was received - 
     
      
       
        
        “Would his Honour comment upon the relationship in law between the presumption of innocence and evidence relating to motivation and character.” 
        
       
      
    129 The further note was the note on which the appellant’s submissions were focussed, although they were not confined to it. 
     
      
    130 Kirby J invited submissions on the further note. His Honour said that it was not difficult to respond “except for the last aspect”, and as to that - 
     
      
       
        
        “The inclusion of the word ‘character’, there is no evidence of character and it’s irrelevance in this trial is a difficulty. My immediate reaction – and I would be interested to hear from both counsel – is to ignore it and simply say that the Crown must prove everything beyond reasonable doubt, including motivation, and so on; that is, the loan and various other aspects.” 
        
       
      
    131 The appellant’s counsel said - 
     
      
       
        
        “YOUNG: Your Honour, I suggest you answer the question without specifically dealing with it, simply by saying that all the relevant material upon which the Crown relies was led by the Crown and that’s the basis of any decision they must reach in the trial, or words to that effect. Certainly not by specifically saying there is no evidence relating to character in this trial. 
        
       
      
    132 The Crown Prosecutor said that he “defer[red] to your Honour’s view and also Mr Young’s view. That seems to be sensible”.  
     
      
    133 Kirby J said that he would follow that course, and there was some further discussion of what he would say with a view to balance between the Crown case and the defence case. 
     
      
    134 The jury was recalled, and there were further directions in relation to both notes. Kirby J repeated and to some extent elaborated on, directions concerning onus of proof, standard of proof and circumstantial evidence, specifically “the need for the Crown to eliminate any reasonable possible alternative explanation for the facts that you find proved inconsistent with guilt”, and reviewed a deal of the evidence.  
     
      
    135 In particular, his Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Then, to refer to your note where you asked me to comment on the relationship in law between the presumption of innocence and the evidence relating to motivation and character. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, the presumption of innocence and the fact that the onus is upon the Crown is really, when you think about it, a matter of common sense. If a person were to come to you and make serious allegations against someone, say that they were beating their wife, or something or other, then you would say, ‘Well, what’s the proof? You prove it.’ And that really is what the onus is all about: the Crown has an obligation to prove it. Mr Burrell has no obligation to disprove it. He is presumed innocent, so you start with that presumption. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, in this case, the Crown has called the evidence it relies upon to prove its case. All the materials before you is material which the Crown has produced – apart from, I think, there are one or two exhibits tendered on behalf of the accused. So, it’s that material which the Crown relies upon to discharge this onus upon it to overturn the presumption of innocence. 
        
       
       
        
        So, in respect of motivation, the Crown, as a matter of law, I might say, does not have to prove that the person, who is accused of the crime, has a motive. It’s not one of the elements of murder that the person should have a motive. 
        
       
       
        
        But motive is relied upon – in this case, the alleged loan said to have been made by Dorothy Davis to Mr Burrell of $100,000, the motive is relied upon – to convince you, as one of the planks in its circumstantial case, that this was not an irrational act; this was quite a rational act on the part of Mr Burrell and this was designed to extinguish the debt. So that is one of the circumstances the Crown relies upon. But it has the onus of proving that case, just like it has the onus of proving every aspect of the case. That’s what it relies upon to overturn the presumption of innocence. Ultimately, it’s a matter for you as to whether or not it has succeeded in that endeavour.” 
        
       
      
    136 The jury again retired, and returned with their verdict later that day.  
     
      
    137 An affidavit sworn by the appellant’s trial counsel accompanied the appellant’s supplementary written submission on Ground 2. The Crown’s supplementary written submissions responded to it, from which it appears that there was no objection to the reading of the affidavit. It should be received.  
     
      
    138 Counsel said that he had interpreted the jury’s note “to be based on the jury’s presumed knowledge of the applicant’s earlier conviction and life sentence for the murder of Kerry Whelan”, and that he had not voiced that understanding because he had assumed that it was shared by the Crown Prosecutor and the judge. He said that he had been mindful that his Honour had made lengthy remarks to the jury designed to ensure that only persons able to bring a dispassionate and objective mind to bear upon the evidence should make themselves available for selection, and that specifically to refer to the earlier trial and then direct the jury effectively to disregard it “was likely to create greater prejudice to the applicant [sic] than that which he had already suffered from publicity of the earlier conviction”. 
     
      
    139 I come at last to the appellant’s submissions. He submitted that it was reasonable to assume that some or most of the jurors had been exposed to media publicity adverse to his character in relation to the charge that he murdered Mrs Davis, and also in relation to his trial and conviction for the murder of Mrs Kerry Whelan. He submitted that the jury’s note referring to character reflected that exposure and its operation in the juror’s minds, and should be seen as an acknowledgement that it was operative. He submitted that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for the jury to have put to one side “the subconscious impact of the appellant’s media profile”, particularly in a circumstantial case with poorly recalled evidence of Mrs Davis’ intentions and concerning the birthday lunch, and that there was a real and substantial risk that the adverse notoriety influenced the jury’s decision-making. Hence, he submitted, it should be found that the trial had miscarried. 
     
      
    140 The appellant submitted that it was not an impediment to the appeal in this respect that the appellant’s trial counsel had not sought a direction dealing with evidence of character, because a direction could not have cured the problem but would be likely to have aggravated it by highlighting in the jury’s minds the adverse notoriety. Alternatively, the appellant sought leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … to rely on the absence of a direction by the learned trial judge directing the jury to disregard any material of which they were aware relating to the appellant outside the trial, either by specifically referring to the appellant’s notoriety or directing the jury that character was not a relevant consideration”.  
        
       
      
    141 The appellant submitted that “the failure to respond to the issue of character raised by the jury” was such a fundamental departure from the essential requirements of the law that it went to the root of the proceedings: R v Tripodina & Morabito (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 195 per Yeldham J, Carruthers and McInerney JJ agreeing. 
     
      
    142 The Crown disputed that, in the reference to character in the further note, the jury should be taken to have had in mind adverse character of the appellant known from media publicity. The coupling of “evidence of motivation and character”, it was submitted, suggested character in connection with the matters relating to motivation, for example lying to Mrs Davis about the purpose of the loan, preying upon her affection for Ms Bromley, and representing that Mrs Davis had “laundered” the money so that her children would not know. (In his address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor had suggested that the appellant had lied to Ms Bromley, Mrs Dawes and the police about the loan and was a man who was “prepared to lie about a loan to a family friend, Dorothy Davis, both before and after she disappeared”, so that what he told the police as to his whereabouts on 30 May 1995 should not be believed.) It was submitted also that the jury may have had in mind the issue, raised in the cross-examination of Mr Grace, of Mr Grace’s motivation to fabricate his evidence that he was told of Mrs Davis demanding repayment from the appellant.  
     
      
    143 The Crown submitted that, even on the understanding professed by the appellant’s trial counsel, remedial action could and should have been requested, at the least by a reminder in strong terms of Kirby J’s references at the time the jury was empanelled to the need to bring to bear a dispassionate and unbiased mind and to confine themselves to the evidence and ignore media coverage. It was submitted that counsel had made a forensic choice at the time, and that the appellant should not now be permitted to take a different course. 
     
      
    144 The Crown further submitted that it had been accepted in many cases, and should be accepted in this case, that juries obeyed directions and confined their decision-making to the evidence in the trial as instructed, even if the charge was of an offence of some notoriety. Reference was made to The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603 per Mason CJ and Toohey J and Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [31] per McHugh J in the High Court, and to R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; (2002) 132 A Crim R 371 at [19]-[21] per Spigelman CJ, Simpson J and Blanch AJ agreeing; R v Crowther-Wilkinson [2004] NSWCCA 249 at [204]-[210] per Wood CJ at CL, Dowd and Kirby J agreeing; R v Kaddour [2005] NSWCCA 303; (2005) 156 A Crim R 11 at [152] (Hulme, Barr and Buddin JJ); R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [44]-[45] per Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL and Hall J agreeing; and Skaf v R [2008] NSWCCA 303 at [27]-[37] (McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden and Howie JJ) in this Court.  
     
      
    145 In this respect a recent summation, in the context of a stay application, is found in the judgment of Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Price JJ agreed) in R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; (2008) 72 NSWLR 258 - 
     
      
       
        
        “16 This Court has had occasion to assess adverse pre-trial publicity in a number of cases, being publicity of a character, of a duration and of an intensity which was at least equal, in many cases, to the publicity in the present case. Applications for a permanent stay have failed in the most sensational of cases: Anita Cobby, Ivan Milat, Phillip Bell, the Childers Backpacker Hostel fire, Lucy Dudko, William D’Arcy, Bruce Burrell.

        17 I have had occasion to summarise the relevant case law in the following manner, applicable to the present case, in  
        John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales  
        [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344:  
         
         
          
          ‘[103] There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions that they are given and implement them. In particular that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.’ 
          
         
         
        18 There are now numerous judicial statements as to the validity of such an approach.  
         
         
        19 Going back, for example, as Gleeson CJ said in  
        R v VPH  
        (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 March 1994, unreported) at 7:  
         
         
          
          ‘The jury will be given appropriate directions to confine their attention to the evidence that is put before them. Our entire system of the administration of criminal justice depends upon the assumption that jurors understand and comply with directions of that character.’ 
          
         
         
        20 Furthermore, as McHugh JA said in  
        Gilbert v The Queen  
        [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 425:  
         
         
          
          ‘[31] … Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.’ 
          
         
         
        21 The perspective that jurors properly perform their task, are true to their oaths and comply with a trial judge’s directions has repeatedly been applied in appellate courts over recent years. (See  
        R v Milat 
        ;  
        R v Bell 
        ;  
        Long v R 
        ;  
        R v Richards  
        [1999] NSWCCA 114; (1999) 107 A Crim R 318;  
        R v Dudko 
        ;  
        R v D’Arcy 
        ;  
        R v Burrell  
        supra.)” 
        
       
      
    146 The case of R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185 to which the Chief Justice referred was concerned with the appellant’s trial over the disappearance of Ms Whelan. As I have said, there was no appeal from the rejection of the stay application made in July 2007 in the appellant’s trial for the murder of Mrs Davis. 
     
      
    147 So far as the appellant’s submissions involved the jury’s note referring to character, the question is not identical with that in a stay application based on adverse pre-trial publicity. The substance of the appellant’s submissions in this respect was not just that the jury might be swayed from determination of guilt only on the evidence before them. It included that the note, showing interest in the relationship between the presumption of innocence and evidence relating to motivation and character, revealed that the jury did have in their minds a prejudicial view of the appellant’s character gained from his notoriety; as earlier described, it was an acknowledgement that the exposure to media publicity was operative. Perhaps not expressly, the appellant should also be taken to have relied on his trial counsel’s perception, stated in the affidavit, that the note was “based on the jury’s presumed knowledge of [the appellant’s] earlier conviction and life sentence for the murder of Kerry Whelan.” 
     
      
    148 I do not accept that view of the jury’s note. The terms of the note were not consistent with the jury going beyond the evidence. The expressed interest was in the relationship between a legal notion, the presumption of innocence, and “evidence relating to motivation and character”. Relevantly, the jury referred to evidence relating to character, not a view of character gained from media publicity. That appears to have been the way Kirby J understood it, because his Honour’s immediate reaction was that there was no evidence of character and it was an irrelevance. Counsel did not voice a different understanding.  
     
      
    149 I doubt the Crown’s submission concerned with Mr Grace’s motivation, since it is difficult to relate his motivation to the presumption of innocence, but the Crown’s first submission is a ready explanation for the jury’s enquiry. It was well within the jury’s reasoning to come to a view, from the evidence, of the appellant’s character in conjunction with his motivation. There was other evidence capable of being thought to cast light on the appellant’s character, such as Mr Grace’s evidence that the appellant expressed annoyance at the lady’s temerity in asking for her money back, and Ms Bromley saying that the appellant was a very volatile person.  
     
      
    150 In this view of the jury’s note, the rejection of the “previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice” of which the Chief Justice spoke in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; [2004] 61 NSWLR 344 at 366, part of the passage I have set out from R v Jamal, remains of significance. The jury had been told in no uncertain terms that media publicity should be put aside, and that they should come to their decision solely upon the evidence. It is not lightly to be thought that the jury disregarded these directions, and made their disregard obvious, in asking a question founded on taking account of media publicity; and as I have said, the terms of the note are against that construction of it. 
     
      
    151 So far as the appellant’s submissions were more generally that the trial miscarried because of the media publicity, it should be repeated that there was and is no appeal from the rejection of the stay application. There had been considerable media publicity, but its intensity had been well in the past. I am not persuaded that it was such that, particularly with the careful directions they were given, there was a real risk that the jury departed from their oaths and did not come to their decision only on the evidence before them. 
     
      
    152 In my opinion Kirby J dealt appropriately with the jury’s note, and I do not accept that there was a miscarriage of justice as submitted by the appellant. In relation to the submission that his Honour should have directed the jury “either by specifically referring to the appellant’s notoriety or directing the jury that character was not a relevant consideration”, if at the time the appellant’s counsel had the perception described in his affidavit he had to make a forensic choice. He could have asked for one or other of the directions, or he could have eschewed any direction lest adverse character be made more prominent. Counsel expressly did not want the jury to be told that there was no evidence relating to character. The reason given in counsel’s affidavit is clear and readily understandable, and explains why no such direction as is now suggested was then sought. The sound forensic decision should not be disregarded, and leave under r 4 should not be granted. 
     
      
       
      The result 
       
      
    153 I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    154 HOWIE J: I agree with Giles JA. 
     
      
    155 BUDDIN J: I agree with Giles JA.

   Introduction1 At about 9:30 am on Sunday 18 February, 2007, Adam Day, then aged 14, was killed in a tragic boating accident on Lake Conjola, on the South Coast of NSW. The driver of the powerboat which killed him was the offender, Lee-Ann MacIntyre. Mrs MacIntyre appears for sentence in relation to the offence of driving the boat in a dangerous manner resulting in Adam Day’s death.Indictment2 On 3 August 2009, the offender pleaded guilty to the charge that: 
     
      
       
        
        on 18 February 2007 at Lake Conjola in the State of New South Wales, she navigated a vessel namely a 5.7m Stejcraft Bahama ski boat (registered “MERCWON”) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons, whereby the vessel was involved in an impact as a result of which the death of Adam Day was occasioned. 
        
       
      
    3 The count was brought pursuant to section 52B(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 and is subject to a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.Facts4 A statement of agreed facts was tendered (Exhibit S1).5 A summary of the relevant facts is as follows:Circumstances6 At about 9 am immediately prior to the collision, Adam Day was water-skiing on a section of Lake Conjola known as Killarney Beach. The weather was clear and sunny. The water surface was calm with no wind. It was a relatively quiet day at the beach with only 6 other vessels in the area.7 After water-skiing, Adam was swimming with his sister Jessica, then aged 9 years. There are varying accounts of the exact location of where the children were swimming or, treading water. What is clear is that the children had moved into deeper water in the course of, or after, playing a game of catch.8 Both Adam and Jessica were wearing wetsuits that had distinctive markings. Adam’s wetsuit had distinctive red panels on the shoulder. Jessica’s wetsuit was blue-grey with yellow arms. She was also wearing a pink buoyancy vest. A photograph of that swimsuit was tendered showing that it was quite bright and distinctive (Exhibit S2).Manner of driving9 The offender was driving a 5.7 metre motor-boat which had a 200 horsepower engine. Her husband Ken MacIntyre was seated in the rear of the vessel watching a water-skier attached to the rear of the boat.10 The offender was travelling at a speed of between 20 and 30 knots. The boat was driven in accordance with the apparent practice of other boats in the area by travelling roughly parallel with the beach and then turning at a point where there were 4 – knot markers. Turning towards the beach at that point enabled the boat to travel in an arc thereby enabling towed skiers to coast in towards the beach. The boat then headed out towards the main body of the lake and in the direction of Adam and Jessica Day.11 The Crown contends, and the defence accepts, that the boat was being driven in a manner dangerous, but not at a dangerous speed. It is on that basis that the plea was entered. It is conceded the speed used was an appropriate speed to drop off water skiers, as any slower speed may have resulted in skiers not being able to remain on top of the water.Collision12 As the boat approached, Jessica and Adam Day raised their hands over their heads to alert the boat driver. They had been taught to do this by their parents. The boat headed directly towards the two children. Despite people on the beach – including Adam’s parents - waving and yelling to attract the driver’s attention, the boat continued on its course. The boat struck both children who were within arm’s reach of each other. 13 The victim, Adam Day, was dragged under the vessel and struck by the propeller inflicting instantly fatal head injuries. He was effectively decapitated. Jessica was struck by the starboard side of the boat but was not significantly injured.Offender’s Statements and Circumstances14 When the offender’s boat came back to the beach she said ‘What have I done. I didn’t see anyone. No-one dropped off’.15 The offender was blood tested for alcohol and none was detected. There were no mechanical nor steerage defects on the vessel. The offender had been water-skiing in Killarney Beach and had driven the boat on at least 10 occasions in the preceding 5 years.Signage16 A nearby sign – apparently a Maritime Services Board sign - near the boat ramp stated that the speed limit was 4 knots. However, that did not apparently apply to the general area where people often swam – and where Adam and Jessica Day were swimming on that morning.17 There were marker buoys in the area installed by the Maritime Services Board. Photographs depicting the location of the bouys were tendered (Exhibit S11).18 Photographs were also tendered of two dilapidated signs apparently on or near the ground near the beach area at the scene (Exhibit S10). They were apparently not Maritime Services Board signs. Those signs included the following words 
     
      
       
        
        “Boats/Jet skis leaving the shore are to give way to incoming boats. 
         
         
        Swimmers should stay close to shore line and move out of the path of incoming boats.” 
        
       
      
    19 It is unclear who put those signs in that area. Since the incident, the Day family have erected clear and unambiguous signs showing the course vessels are to follow in the area.Offender20 Mrs MacIntyre is a 48-year-old woman - at the time of the offence she was 45 years old. She has been married for 26 years and has 2 adult children, a daughter and son. She works as the Director of Nursing in a surgical unit of a large Sydney hospital. In that position, she has, and will continue to make, major contributions to the community.21 Importantly she has no prior convictions of any sort – nor, as I understand it, even any traffic convictions.Victim22 The victim, Adam Day, was aged 14 years at the time of his death. His mother Aracely Day, father Lee Day, brother Rodney Day, and sister Jessica Day, who is now aged 11 years survive him. The Day family were frequent visitors to the area, regularly water- skiing and swimming in the vicinity. They were very familiar with the area. Ms Jessica Day was swimming with the victim at the time the accident occurred. Mr and Mrs Day, Adam’s parents, saw the accident occur.Victim impact statements23 Victim impact statements were tendered from Adam’s parents Lee Wayne Day and Aracely Day, his older brother Rodney, and younger sister Jessica (Exhibit S7). They are very powerful and evocative statements. Clearly – and as would be expected - this death has had a major and continuing impact on the Day family. It is likely that the family and each of its members will continue to grieve constantly - particularly at both family events - and unexpectedly - for many years. The grief expressed in all the statements was both tangible and harrowing.24 All of the Day family, along with other members of the community who knew Adam enjoyed life a great deal and who had a great deal of promise and potential - miss him continually and constantly and find it difficult to cope in his absence.Offender’s evidence25 Mrs MacIntyre gave the Court a written statement (Exhibit S8). The statement details the offender’s continuing and ongoing feelings of remorse, shock and guilt occasioned by the incident.Mr MacIntyre26 The offender’s husband, Mr Kenneth MacIntyre gave evidence. 27 Mr MacIntyre spoke of impact on Mrs MacIntyre. He detailed the vast difference in Mrs MacIntyre and their family since the accident. Mrs MacIntyre is now incapable of running the family household as before. She does not socialise anymore and has effectively become a recluse in the home other then when at work. Mr MacIntyre stated that Mrs MacIntyre cries all the time and continually puts herself in the shoes of the Day family members, lost in their grief at having lost a son. Mr MacIntyre who has bone cancer/myeloma says the whole functioning of the family has irrevocably changed, that Mrs MacIntyre is constantly thinking of what she has done to the Day family.Mr Ken Hutt28 Mr Hutt is a family friend of the offender who has known the offender for years. Mr Hutt confirmed other aspects of the evidence particularly that Mrs MacIntyre continually blames herself for the death of Adam Day, as she is aware that she has taken a son from the Day family.Psychiatric Reports29 A medico-legal psychiatrist report was tendered from Dr Selwyn Smith dated 13 November 2008. Dr Smith says that Mrs MacIntyre has been persistently preoccupied by what has occurred and what could have been done to prevent the death of Adam Day.30 A report from Mrs MacIntyre’s treating psychiatrist Dr Marian Coffey was also tendered. Dr Coffey’s address is given as the Bankstown Community Health Centre where presumably she is able to have frequent contact with the offender who works at a nearby hospital. The report stated that the effect of the accident and its consequences on the offender have been extensive.31 The diagnosis of both psychiatrists is that Mrs MacIntyre is an emotionally fragile person who has expressed some suicidal ideation. Her mother attempted suicide when Mrs MacIntyre was 18 years. At the time, her mother was brought into the hospital where Mrs MacIntyre was then working.32 Mrs MacIntyre was reported as being continually preoccupied with the grief of the Day family, particularly of Adam’s mother. She has persistent flashbacks about the events surrounding the accident and experiences panic attacks. She cannot cope with driving near to a boat on the road. This matter has also had a significant impact on members of her own family.Diagnosis33 Dr Selwyn Smith has diagnosed Mrs MacIntyre as having a post-traumatic stress disorder with the emergence of a major depressive episode. She has become socially avoidant and withdrawn, brooding and depressed about the situation and overwhelmed with feelings of grief. 34 Dr Coffey regards her suicidal ideation as being a moderate to high risk. She is in need of ongoing psychiatric treatment. Currently she is seeing Dr Coffey for a minimum of once per week.Section 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) ActAggravating factors35 Considering the principles in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, there are no aggravating factors other than the essential elements of the charge itself.36 “Substantial harm” to the victim’s family is not an aggravating factor under section 21A as the law regards the loss of every life equally: R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [42].Mitigating factors37 In the circumstances of this case the following mitigating factors are in my view established: 
     
      
      (b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity 
       
       
      (e) the offender does not have any record of previous convictions 
       
       
      (f) the offender was a person of good character 
       
       
      (g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend 
       
       
      (h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender’s age and otherwise 
       
       
      (i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, and that the offender has accepted responsibility for her actions and acknowledged the injury caused by her actions  
       
       
      (k) the plea of guilty.  
      
    Remorse38 The offender’s remorse is evident in the plea, and also in terms of what she has told her treating psychiatrist.39 I do not think the offender’s remorse is due solely to the situation in which she finds herself but is genuine. It extends to both the victim’s family and the particular members of it. Her statement is set against her own part in life as a mother and nurse.40 At the committal proceedings held on 2 December 2008, the offender said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I just want to speak my feelings, I’ve never had an opportunity to say them. They may not be the right time and they might not come out the right way but I am going to say them anyhow. From one set of parents, Ken and I, to the Day family, I’d like to say we’re awfully sorry for the tragic accident that happened and their loss. There is not a day that goes by where I don’t think of it. I’m a mother and a nurse and I feel for these people and it is a set of tragic circumstances that changed many lives. I know they have a Court system to go through and I understand that, but from my emotional side I feel sorry for the Day family, my heart bleeds.” 
        
       
      
    41 Having observed Mrs MacIntyre during the proceedings, particularly while other witnesses were giving evidence, and having read the reports and her statement, I do not regard her remorse as either feigned or manipulated. This is not a situation where their can be any practical restitution or other demonstration of remorse. Nothing will bring Adam Day back. Nothing - other than possibly the passage of time – can assist the Day family in enduring their grief. Part of the court process is to bring an end to the inevitable harrowing tension that these kinds of issues raise. The loss of Adam Day is, and was, pre-eminent – but there are many other victims here.Rehabilitation42 This offence and the death of Adam has had a major impact on Mrs MacIntyre. It is likely to continue for some time.Plea of guilty43 Here the plea was entered on the first day of the trial although the Crown and the Court were notified that the matter would be a plea of guilty on Thursday 30 July, 2009, in other words, about two working days before the hearing.44 In those circumstances it should be classified as a late plea with the utilitarian benefit of saving the time and resources of the DPP and the Court, avoiding a jury trial otherwise estimated to last 5 to 6 days and avoiding members of the victim’s family, in particular, Jessica, the victim’s sister (now 11 years old) having to give evidence. That would have been a harrowing experience for her and her family.45 In my view, having regard to the time at which the (late) plea was entered or notified but also the utilitarian benefit and the remorse and contrition expressed on various times and occasions, the appropriate discount for the plea should be 25%. There is a measure of leniency in this approach but I consider that the courts need to be aware of the realities of persons in the position and circumstances of the offender having to come to terms with what has occurred and the realities of the court process.Comparable authorities46 The guideline judgments of R v Jurisic [1998] NSWSC 597 and R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343 apply to section 52A of the Crimes Act, namely the offence of dangerous driving, and reasonably also apply to the offence of dangerous navigation.47 The guideline judgments indicate that an assessment of the offender’s moral culpability is relevant to determining whether a custodial sentence should be imposed, as well as to determining the appropriate length of the sentence: Whyte at [214] and [229]. It is the “central inquiry with regard to the objective circumstances of the particular offence”: R v Errington (2005) 157 A Crim R 553 at [26].48 Jurisic states that, “a non-custodial sentence for an offence against s52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgement.”Momentary inattention49 A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A is almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgement: R v Pisciuneri [2007] NSWCCA 265 at [75]. The Whyte guideline provides at [214]: “A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement”. This aspect of the guideline is premised upon the fact that, since the offence may be committed where the offender has had no more than a momentary or casual lapse of attention, there must always be room for a non-custodial sentence.50 Where the offender’s driving behaviour amounts to little more than momentary inattention or misjudgment, or involves carelessness rather than deliberateness, or involves no sustained pattern of driving that could be described as dangerous, a court may be entitled to conclude that the offence falls within the exception of dangerous driving cases for which a non-custodial sentence is appropriate: R v Pyritz (1998) 29 MVR 90. However, as I understand the authorities, such a finding does not mandate a non-custodial sentence.Range of criminality51 Sentencing judges must make a clear finding of where on the continuum of criminality the moral culpability of the offender lies: R v Samadi [2006] NSWCCA 308 at [21]. Here in my view, the criminality and culpability is at the relatively low end – but there is still a degree of culpability involved in driving a vessel of that size and power in an area like that in those circumstances.52 It must be remembered that the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence is determined in large measure by consideration of offender’s the moral culpability rather than the (in this case) tragic and far reaching consequences of the offender’s conduct. The Courts have long recognised the distinction between offences of lesser moral culpability and the consequences of their conduct – R v Baker NSWCCA (unrep 26/12/92). 53 Similarly the relationship of cases of momentarily inattention and a lower level of moral culpability justifying a different approach to the determination of questions of meeting the need for public deterrence was recognised in Whyte.Relevant Authorities54 The relevant guideline judgement sets out eleven relevant aggravating features. Absent any evidence leading to a finding of inappropriate speed, the only relevant factors may be that of the number of people put at risk. There was no evidence that there were crowds of people in the area where the collisison took place. There were 6 boats in the area at the time, and some other children swimming near the boats, closer to the shore. It is also accepted that it was a relatively quiet day at the beach in terms of the number of people.Sentencing statistics55 Judicial Commission statistics show only one matter brought under this section of legislation. That individual received a suspended sentence. The circumstances of that offence and of the particular offender are unknown.56 For offences under section 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act, namely dangerous driving occasioning death – drive manner dangerous, 48% of offenders were sentenced to a period of imprisonment, 18% periodic detention, and 15% suspended sentences.57 Of the seven cases where there was only one offence, no prior convictions, a plea of guilty, and an offender aged 41-50 years, 29% received a suspended sentence and 29% received a periodic detention order.Other sentencing options58 There are a range of other available sentencing options. FineBond/ supervisionCommunity service order59 None of these options in my view are appropriate nor reflect the requirements of a sentence involving the principles of general deterrence.Suspended sentence60 The offender’s counsel urges that I consider and impose a suspended sentence. The Crown submits that a non-custodial penalty would not only not be in error, it would not be inappropriate.61 The relevant issues are whether there are exceptional circumstances as urged by the Defence and based on the circumstances of the offence and, in particular, the finding of low range culpability.62 The approach to be followed and the factors to be considered are set out in R v Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54 and R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. In my view, a sentence of imprisonment is called for – particularly the requirements of general deterrence where a death has occurred. I do not regard the circumstances of the offence as warranting a total suspension of the sentence nor do I consider that a suspended sentence would be appropriate to meet the requirements of general deterrence.Periodic detention63 Periodic detention is a form of custodial sentence albeit of not as great a severity as a full time custodial sentence. The benefit of such a sentence to the offender is also that she will be able to continue her employment and her current psychiatric treatment regime. Consideration64 I take into account the evidence, the submissions made, and the matters set out above. I also take into account my finding as to the low level of criminality involved and the mitigating factors as I have found them to be as well as the absence of any additional aggravating factors.65 This tragedy occurred on a summer Sunday morning at about 9:30 am in a popular swimming and water-skiing area. There is no issue but that the victim and his sister were in an area where they were entitled to be, where swimmers and others associated with water-skiing frequently were – and could be expected to be.66 Although that particular area of the beach is sandy, in common with all such tidal estuaries the bottom of that area of Lake Conjola could be weedy and make for some difficulties in seeing objects on the surface of the lake.67 There is no applicable speed limit in that area of the beach. In my view the circumstances of this case highlight the need for speed limits to be established for boats in that area and for those limits to be properly and prominently displayed. A nearby sign – apparently a Maritime Authorities Board sign - stated that the speed limit was 4 knots near the boat ramp. From the forensic evidence recovered, the point of impact appears to have been in the vicinity of about 41 metres out from the beach. The tendered photographs indicate the proximity to the boat ramp area.68 Here the Crown submits that the circumstances of the offence would warrant a finding that the death was caused by casual or momentary inattention, that the appropriate finding should be one of low moral culpability. I agree with that submission and think that it is properly made in these circumstances. I would take a different view had there been any evidence of drink-driving, aggressive or competitive driving or any suggestion that the driving was in the direction of clearly visible groups of people.69 Accordingly, the offender’s behaviour needs to be assessed in the light of all the prevailing circumstances as I have outlined. The offender’s plea is both appropriate and proper. The essential elements of the offence involve the death of an innocent young boy on the cusp of, and with the promise of, his manhood and his life ahead of him. The consequences for the Day family have been and will continue to be profound, ever-present and distressing. Their lives will never be the same.70 Clearly what was involved was driving in a manner which did not pay proper regard to the safety of those in the area, including the children who were entitled to be there, as were other members of the public.Offender’s Character71 Mrs MacIntryre is a person of unblemished character and service to the community as a nurse and senior nursing administrator in the hospital system and as a mother to her own children and family. Understandably and appropriately it is that aspect of her life which has led to her grief for and guilt over the Day family. Not only does she have no criminal convictions she has, as I understand it, no traffic matters. An offender’s prior driving record is to be largely ignored when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [25].72 However, the courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in these cases to avoid giving the impression that persons of good character may, by their irresponsible actions, take the lives of others and yet receive lenient treatment: R v MacIntyre (1988) 38 A Crim R 135 at 139; R v Musumeci NSWCCA (unrep 30/10/97) at [18-340]. Assessment73 I indicated during the course of submissions that I was considering the option of periodic detention. A short assessment report was prepared by the NSW Probation and Parole Service based on the tendered psychiatric reports (the medico-legal report of Dr Selwyn Smith and that of Dr Coffey of the Bankstown CHC) indicating that the offender was unsuitable for periodic detention by virtue of her psychiatric condition, in particular, her suicidal ideation and that appropriate facilities are not available for her should she attempt suicide while completing her sentence. 74 I have had regard to that report for the purposes of s 66 (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the additional report prepared 5 August and dated 6 August, 2009 (Exhibit S 12). I have also had regard to the offender’s presentation during the proceedings and the contents of the report. Mrs MacIntyre and her family have had these proceedings hanging over their heads now for 2 and ½ years. Both reports suggest long-term supervision and treatment which would be available if the option of periodic detention was exercised – including preparing Mrs MacIntyre for the inevitability of that sentence. Such a sentence would not commence for at least ten days. I do not accept that in the circumstances and the evidence that that assessment should be accepted such as to avoid the imposition of the sentence of periodic detention. To do otherwise would mean that an offender by submitting medical/psychiatric reports of the medico-legal and treating psychiatric nature submitted here could avoid the impact of a proper and appropriate sentence.75 The offender has been interviewed by the Probation and Parole Service. She has signed an undertaking to comply with the obligations of a periodic detention order.76 I am satisfied pursuant to s 66 (1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the offender is a suitable person to be the subject of a periodic detention order.77 I also consider that the offender needs to face up to the reality of what she has done and the community’s disapproval of her conduct and its consequences. Her behaviour after that option was raised with her by me in Court, while understandable, is of concern. Mrs MacIntyre needs to be aware that one of the purposes of sentencing is that of denunciation of the offence – and that, in the circumstances of what occurred, the loss of a young boy’s life, and the evidence, a sentence of full-time custody was a real option which I was considering.Special circumstances78 Given the offender’s age and contributions she will make to the community by her continued employment where she will be in constant contact with a variety of health and related professionals, the absence of any prior relevant convictions and her family circumstances, I am satisfied that there should be a finding of special circumstances such that the statutory ratio of the proportion the non-parole period bears to the head sentence should be reduced to 66.67%.License disqualification79 In all cases of dangerous driving, licence disqualification is mandatory and additional to the penalty: Road Transport (General) Act 1999, s 25. The disqualification should have “some real and manifest sting” in terms of general and specific deterrence: R v Veatufunga [2007] NSWCCA 54 at [40]. There is no similar provision in relation to boating licences. In my view there should be. I understand that the procedure to be followed is that the OIC will recommend to the Maritime Services Board that the offender’s licence be suspended. That course is not opposed by the Defence.Sentence80 In terms of transparency of sentencing, normally a sentence for an offence of this nature would be of the order of two years imprisonment. The discount of 25 % for the plea and the remorse and contrition expressed would mean a sentence of 18 months imprisonment. 81 My finding of special circumstances and the reduction of the statutory ratio would mean that the normal period of non-parole imprisonment would be 12 months imprisonment. In my view it is appropriate that that sentence be served by way of periodic detention.Orders82 The offender is convicted of the offence.83 The offender, Lee-Ann MacIntryre is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eighteen months imprisonment to be served by way of a non-parole period of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 15 August 2009, that sentence to be served by way of periodic detention.84 For those purposes the offender is to report to the Wollongong offices of the Probation and Parole Service by 8:30 am on 15 August, 2009.Licence disqualification85 I recommend that the offender be disqualified from holding a boating licence for a period of 3 years86 A copy of these remarks is to be forwarded to the General Manager of the Maritime Services Board with the recommendation that speed limits for motor boats in the Lake Conjola area and Killarney Beach in particular be established and, be prominently displayed.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Youssaf Saraya found himself owing an outlaw motorcycle gang $50,000. I will explain how that debt arose later in these remarks on sentence. In order to obtain that money he and others decided to commit a most serious offence involving firearms, threats of violence and the real possibility of death with the certainty of terror.2 The offender and three others went to a service station on 22 January 2008. There was an ATM in that service station and a security van attended for the purpose of filling up the machine with cash. There were four security guards, one stayed in the vehicle, one remained near the vehicle and the other two went into the shop. They were all, of course, armed with firearms.3 The offender was inside a motor vehicle with stolen registration plates. He and two others got out of that vehicle. They themselves all had handguns which they pointed at the security guards. Mr Chaouk dealt with the security guard near the van, whilst this accused and another unidentified co-offender went into the service station shop. They had their handguns drawn and they were pointing them in the direction of the Chubb security guards.4 Once inside the security guards were ordered onto the ground. Not surprisingly the security guards complied with these orders. The offender disarmed one guard, whilst the unidentified offender disarmed the other. They then took the bags containing the cash which had been brought into the shop and also removed some of the cash from the ATM itself. They then returned to the car where it was driven away by a fourth offender.5 Police went that evening to the home of Mr Chaouk, one of the offenders. Helpfully he had retained and ineffectively hidden a great deal of incriminating evidence including the two firearms taken by the offender and the unidentified offender inside the service station.6 The offender was arrested himself a few days later and has remained in custody since then. A total of almost $160,000 was stolen during the robbery and of that only about $40,000 has been recovered. As I mentioned the two firearms taken from the officers who were held up in the shop have also been recovered. 7 The offender has pleaded guilty to an offence of robbery with a dangerous weapon, one of the most serious offences in the criminal calendar carrying a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. 8 The offender was born in 1984. His parents are immigrants and although the offender was born in Australia he learnt English as a second language, his parents speaking Lebanese at home. He found himself bullied at school for various reasons, including his appearance, his racial background and his learning difficulties. He suffered a head injury whilst playing football and from then he has regularly had epileptic fits. 9 He commenced both drug use and criminal offending from a relatively early age. He was dealt with in the Children’s Court on many occasions and dealt within the adult courts as well, culminating in an offence involving a firearm for which he received a sentence of imprisonment.10 Whilst in prison he was befriended by members of an outlaw motorcycle gang. They were apparently impressed that the offender had failed to assist the authorities in relation to a matter which arose during the commission of the offence which put him in gaol. They treated him well and the offender joined up.11 Later on he had second thoughts and sought to leave. Resignation from an outlaw motorcycle gang is not simply a matter of ringing up or contacting the secretary and saying that you wished to have your membership cancelled. Leaving the group was considered quite seriously by his remaining members. One of the penalties was that he was required to pay a fine of $50,000. The offender says, as I mentioned at the beginning of these remarks on sentence, that that is why he became involved in this offence.12 He has now expressed the desire to reform himself. He is the only member of his family to have ever been in trouble with the police. He wishes to marry his fiancée who has a three year old child and obtain employment upon his release from custody. He wishes to continue a life without drugs. I have got no doubt that his desire is genuine but I cannot find that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. The road ahead for the offender is not going to be easy.13 The offender expresses remorse, most significantly in a letter addressed to me, which I have read. His remorse however is limited. When given the opportunity to name his two co-offenders who have not yet been identified he was prepared to tell us that one of them had died but that was the limit of the information he was prepared to provide. He expressed fears for his safety and that of his family if he said anything more.14 One of course can understand that those fears might well be genuine, but true remorse involves a willingness to accept those risks to make things better. Complete remorse involves acknowledgement of wrong doing to the extent that a remorseful person wants to make up for his wrong doing. The offender, I am satisfied, is remorseful but as I said the extent of that remorse is limited in the manner I have just indicated.15 I earlier sentenced the offender who had been identified, a Mr Chaouk. He was dealt with for this offence and on a Form 1 there appeared a number of other offences including two most serious robberies with dangerous weapons. The principles of parity are clear application but of course that does not mean that this offender gets the same sentence that I imposed on Mr Chaouk. 16 Appropriate allowance must be made for differences between the offenders. In particular, this offender is significantly older than Mr Chaouk. He has a much more extensive criminal history. He was also, and this is a significantly aggravating feature of the offender’s conduct, on parole for a firearms offence at the time he committed this offence. His plea was also entered on a later occasion. 17 On the other hand, as I had mentioned, Mr Chaouk had very serious offences on the Form 1. The offender’s offences on his Form 1 involve robbery of the two firearms. They occurred in the context of this offence and at the same time.18 The offender must be put in a position where he does not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence I impose on him with the sentence I imposed on Mr Chaouk. As the list of comparative features I have outlined earlier makes clear there are matters suggesting a longer sentence for Mr Chaouk and one matter suggesting a shorter sentence for Mr Chaouk. 19 It is appropriate that I sentence the offender to imprisonment commencing on 31 January 2008. That was the date of his arrest. Although he did serve some time in custody representing the balance of parole for the firearms offence that parole was revoked solely because of his commission of this offence. In those circumstances I exercise my discretion to date this sentence from 31 January 2008.20 I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. I am satisfied that an extended period of supervision on parole will assist his rehabilitation which will have benefit not only to the offender but also the community. The extended period of supervision on parole will help the offender deal with issues arising from his drug use.21 So the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of three years to date from 31 January 2008 and a head sentence of five and a half years. The offender will be eligible to release on parole on 30 January 2011.

      2009/4014 R v John WALSH 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 10 July 2009 John Walsh pleaded guilty to the murders of his wife and his two grandchildren and to causing grievous bodily harm to his daughter with intent to murder her. 
     
      
    2 There is a non-publication order in force in respect of the identity of the two children. It is therefore appropriate to refer to the four victims and the children’s father only by their initials. I hope no offence will be caused by that approach. 
     
      
    3 The offender was aged 69 at the time of the offences. His daughter, SW, is a serving New South Wales police officer who was then stationed at Parkes. She had been married to another police officer, DH, and they had two children together, a boy, KH and a girl, JH. At the time of the offences KH was seven and JH was five. Following the breakdown of her marriage, SW had a regular arrangement with her parents to leave the children with them overnight at Cowra while she went to work. Her parents would take the children to school in the morning and she would return in the afternoon to collect them. 
     
      
    4 On the evening of 29 June 2008, SW left the children with her parents as she had done on previous occasions. The following morning, she tried to call her mother from work a number of times, but there was no answer. She called again at around 11.00am and spoke to the offender, who told her that her mother was lying down. She left Parkes shortly after midday.  
     
      
    5 SW arrived back at her parents’ home at about 1.40pm. She went into her parents’ room and saw her mother lying on the bedroom floor with her back leaning up against the bed. She thought her mother looked pale and that her hair appeared to be darker than normal. She went to find the offender and asked him if her mother was sick. He said that she was on the floor to get comfortable as she had experienced pains in her stomach. He also said that her mother had asked to be left alone to get some rest. SW asked the offender if her mother was dead, to which he replied “No, no, don’t be stupid”. 
     
      
    6 The offender then made SW a cup of tea and invited her to come and sit down in the lounge room and have a chat. As he walked past his computer desk on the way into the lounge room he picked up a small axe. SW asked him why he had the axe. He told her that he had been using it to do some jobs around the house earlier in the day. She then noticed that the children’s school uniforms were still laid out on the lounge where they had been left the night before. She asked the offender why the uniforms were still there. He told her that the children had gone to school in “mufti”. She then went to the children’s bedroom. She saw her daughter lying on the bottom bunk, partly covered by a quilt. She thought that she looked pale. She looked for her son on the top bunk but could not see him.  
     
      
    7 While SW was in the children’s bedroom, the offender approached her from behind, still holding the axe. She became concerned and said, “What is going on? What have you done?”. The offender walked towards her and said, “No, she is sick. The doctor is coming in half an hour”. 
     
      
    8 SW then put her hand to her daughter’s face. She was cold to the touch, and SW realised that she had been dead for some time. Whilst SW had her back to the offender, he swung the axe and struck her to the head a number of times. She managed to take hold of the axe and push the offender off balance. She asked him why he was doing this and he said “I am doing this because I love you. When I am done with you lot I am going to Newcastle to kill your ex-husband. We are all better off this way. This is the way it has to be”. 
     
      
    9 After a struggle, SW was able to escape to a neighbour’s house where she contacted police. The offender left the house by car before police arrived. Following an extensive media campaign, police were contacted at 7.00pm that evening by the proprietor of a motel in Hay, who informed them that the offender had checked into the motel. The offender was arrested shortly afterwards. 
     
      
    10 SW was taken to hospital. She had three lacerations to the head that required sutures. She also had a depressed fracture of the skull, underneath which the lining of the brain was torn. That was repaired by surgery and part of her skull was replaced with titanium plates. 
     
      
    11 In a statement tendered at the sentence hearing, SW said that she could not think of any reason for her father to do what he had done. She stated that he had a loving relationship with SW’s mother and his grandchildren and had never displayed any symptoms to indicate that he was suffering from any mental illness such as could explain his actions. She did suspect that he had suffered from depression following the suicide of her brother in 2002, although it had never been diagnosed. 12 Following his arrest, the offender participated in a lengthy interview with police. He provided a curiously detailed account of the surrounding events, but declined to make any comment relating directly to the deaths of his wife and his two grandchildren or about the attack on his daughter. A month later, however, the offender was interviewed again at his own request. During the second interview, he made full admissions as to his commission of the four offences.  
     
      
    13 The offender told police that he had killed his wife by hitting her on the head about three times with a hammer shaft, stabbing her with a knife and then hitting her on the back of the head with a lump hammer. The hammer shaft is a weapon that has been owned by the offender for many years, and he described it with a measure of pride. He refers to it by the name “Fred”. After he killed JW, the offender took the weapons to the kitchen sink. He then filled the bathtub with water and woke his granddaughter, JH, telling her that she had to go to the toilet. She was half asleep so he carried her to the bath where he pushed her underwater and held her down until she drowned. He said that JH had struggled against him but not strongly and that she had kicked a little and then she went quiet. He laid her body out on the bathroom floor to let the water drain out of her pyjamas before putting her back in her bed.  
     
      
    14 The offender then woke his grandson, KH, and told him that he had to go to the toilet. KH got out of the top bunk and walked to the toilet. The offender told police he had put his weapons in place to reach them when he needed them. As KH was walking back to the bedroom, the offender struck him to the back of the head with the hammer shaft causing him to fall to the floor. The offender then got the lump hammer and hit KH again to the back of the head. He then put him in the bath to make sure that he was dead. He placed his body with JH’s body in the bottom bunk. 
     
      
    15 After killing KH, the offender drowned the family dog in the bath, wrapped him in plastic and placed him under the children’s bed. He told police that he did so because, after he left the house, there would be no one to look after the dog. 
     
      
    16 At around 4.00am the offender typed a note on his computer which stated, among other things, “Sorry that it had to end this way” and “I would like to have a go at [SW’s] ex, I may even yet…”. At some stage, he packed a bag of clothes. At around 9.00am he went to the children’s school and told staff that the children were sick and would probably not be able to attend school for a few days. He also withdrew $800 from an ATM and filled his car and two jerry cans with petrol. 
     
      
    17 The offender told police that he had packed the bag because he intended to go to Newcastle to kill SW’s ex-husband after he had killed SW. A search of his car revealed a handwritten note recording the address of SW’s ex-husband, which was in the Newcastle area.  
     
      
    18 The offender told police that he regarded his wife’s death as “a mercy killing” but that “the other two are murder”. His wife had, it appears, suffered from poor health from time to time, but there is no reliable evidence that she had grown tired of living, nor that she was in so much pain that it could be described as merciful to make such a decision on her behalf. The offender told police that his wife had sometimes wished she were dead but he added, “she never actually asked me to do it”. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender genuinely believed it was merciful to kill his wife.  
     
      
    19 The offender also attempted to explain his decision to kill his wife by reference to a concern about the cost of repairing some minor damage to his car caused by an accident a few days earlier, and his ongoing concerns about money generally. The financial situation he described was, however, not so dire as to provide any explanation for the course he took.  
     
      
    20 The offender told police that the reason he killed JH and KH was because he was concerned about what would happen to SW and the children once he had killed his wife. He knew that he would be locked up which would leave no one to help look after his daughter and her children so he decided that it was best if they were “added to the list”. He said that it was his intention, after killing SW, to travel to Newcastle to kill SW’s ex-husband, after which he had originally also intended to kill himself. 21 The admissions made by the offender to police disclose that he intended to kill each of his victims and I am satisfied of that matter beyond reasonable doubt. He first formed the intention to kill his wife the night before the offences, but had managed to dismiss it. The intention to kill SW, JH and KH was formed some time during the following day or night. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a degree of planning and premeditation of the offences, having regard to the steps taken by the offender to collect the weapons used and the filling of the bath. The offence against SW entailed more careful planning, including the visit to the children’s school and the lies told to SW on the phone and when she returned to the offender’s home.  
     
      
    22 A disturbing feature of this case is the absence of any explanation for the offences. The offender did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings. As noted by his counsel, he gave an unusually detailed account of the circumstances of each offence in his second interview with police but has been unable to give any explanation as to why he did what he did. 
     
      
    23 Four expert medical reports were tendered on the offender’s behalf but none of those sheds any light on that troubling question. There were two reports from a clinical forensic psychologist, Mr W John Taylor. In his initial report, he suggested a possible diagnosis of a depersonalisation disorder but indicated that he would need to obtain more information before stating a firm opinion as to the offender’s state of mind at the time of the offences. Following a second consultation with the offender, Mr Taylor reported that he was not able to state with any confidence that the offender was suffering from an abnormality of mind resulting in significant impairment over his control at the time of the offences. He described this as a “most troubling and disturbing case” and suggested neuro-psychological assessment as a further avenue of inquiry.  
     
      
    24 The offender’s representatives duly arranged to have the offender assessed by a neuro-psychologist, Dr Susan Pulman. She provided a report in which she concluded that there was no evidence of any decline in overall intellectual functioning as a result of dementia or any other neurological disorder.  
     
      
    25 The fourth expert report was from a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen. He gave a psychiatric diagnosis of “probable early dementia”, but that opinion was expressed before the neuro-psychological testing undertaken by Dr Pulman. Dr Nielssen expressed the following conclusion: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Walsh was described as being severely depressed after his son’s death in 2002, when he was reported to have become withdrawn and to have neglected the garden. However he did not report typical symptoms of severe depression in the period leading up to this offence, apart from insomnia the night before and his morbid account of his wife’s illness. His belief that his memory was failing may also have been associated with a form of depression, although there was evidence of some memory impairment on clinical testing. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Walsh did not report symptoms of psychotic illness at any stage that could leave open the defence of mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        Moreover, he was not thought to have an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition within the meaning of s 23A of the Crimes Act.” 
        
       
      
    26 The mental state of an offender is relevant to an assessment of the degree of objective culpability involved in the commission of an offence, even where it is not of the nature or degree to provide a defence or excuse at law: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at [55]. In the present case, however, the evidence before me does not establish any identifiable abnormality of mind that was causally related to the offences such as to reduce the offender’s culpability. Nor does it establish any mental illness relevant to sentence in accordance with the well-known principles in R v Helmsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36] per Sperling J. 
     
      
    27 The circumstances of the offences themselves are disturbing enough to suggest that the offender was not in a normal state of mind, if such a paradigm exists, but it would be speculative for me to infer the existence of an underlying condition that extensive investigation by appropriately qualified professionals has failed to detect.  
     
      
    28 The maximum penalty for each of the offences of murder is imprisonment for life. Pursuant to s19A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, a person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life. In respect of the murder of the offender’s wife, JW, there is a standard non-parole period of 20 years. In respect of the murder of the two children, JH and KH, there is a standard non-parole period of 25 years. As to the attempted murder of SW, the maximum penalty is 25 years imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 
     
      
    29 In determining the appropriate sentence for the three offences of murder, I am required first to have regard to s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
        
       
      
    30 If I am satisfied that the case falls within that section, there remains a discretion pursuant to s 21(1) of the Act to impose a lesser sentence where that is justified by the offender’s subjective circumstances: Merritt at [36]. It is necessary to give separate consideration to the exercise of that discretion. 
     
      
    31 The burden of proving that a case falls within s 61(1) rests on the Crown and the standard of such proof is beyond reasonable doubt: Merritt at [35]. The section requires the Court to consider the community interest in four objectives: retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence. The test looks to the combined effect of such of those four objectives as arise in the particular case. The fact that one or some of those objectives could be met through a lesser sentence does not mean that the Court cannot be satisfied in terms of the section. As stated by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at 50-51: 
     
      
       
        
        “The maximum penalty for murder of penal servitude for life, meaning for the term of the prisoner's natural life, is … reserved for cases falling within the worst category of cases, but it is not reserved only for those cases where the prisoner is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his life or for those cases where there is no chance of rehabilitation; the maximum may be appropriate where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met by such a punishment.” 
         
        
       
      
    32 The Crown submitted that it would be open to the Court to be satisfied in the terms of s 61 in the present case, having regard to the considerations of retribution, punishment and deterrence. In light of the offender’s age, the Crown did not contend that he would be a danger to the community upon his release and did not submit that the community interest in protection was a significant consideration in determining whether this case falls within the section. 
     
      
    33 Mr Boulten, who appeared for the offender, submitted that the Court would not be satisfied in terms of s 61(1). He submitted that the present case is very similar to the case of Merritt, where the objective criminality of the offences was regarded by the Court of Criminal Appeal as being tempered by the absence of certain features.  
     
      
    34 I accept that some of the circumstances identified in Merritt at [71] also exist in the present case. In particular, the present offences did not occur against a background of abuse or violence; they were not accompanied by the infliction of gratuitous cruelty or acts that prolonged the suffering of the children and they were not carried out for sexual gratification. 
     
      
    35 Other examples may be found where the Court has approached the question whether a case falls within s 61(1) (or within the “worst case category” on the common law test) by citing the absence of features which, if present, might have satisfied those tests. In R v Alexander [1999] NSWSC 413; (1999) 107 A Crim R 449, the offender had been sentenced to two life sentences for murdering his landlady and her three year old daughter. The sentences were reduced on appeal to a minimum term of 21 years with a balance of 8 years. In coming to the conclusion that life sentences were not warranted, Kirby J cited the fact that the killings were not sequential, or serial murders; that they were not killings for financial gain and that there was no element of torture or sexual gratification, which are recurring elements in those cases which have been characterised as especially heinous: at [34].  
     
      
    36 Each case must, however, be assessed on its own facts. Merritt is not authority for the proposition that the absence of particular features of wickedness such as sexual gratification or torture will necessarily produce the result that a life sentence is not warranted.  
     
      
    37 Indeed, in Merritt, the Court acknowledged that the murder of three children by their father in their sleep, left unexplained and unmitigated by some reason for the offences, could properly fall within the ambit of s 61(1) so as to warrant life sentences: per Wood CJ at CL at [69], with whom Tobias JA and Hidden J agreed. 
     
      
    38 Mr Boulten further submitted that it is usual in cases of “domestic killings” for determinate sentences to be imposed. He provided a collection of authorities which he submitted disclose a pattern to that effect. Mr Boulten relied particularly on the decisions of R v Velevski (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 26 September 1997, unreported) R v Alexander [1999] NSWSC 413, R v Jang [1999] NSWSC 1153 and R v De Gruchy [2000] NSWCCA 51; (2000) 110 A Crim R 271. I have given careful consideration to each of those decisions, and I accept that they are consistent with the submission put by Mr Boulten. I also note that, in Merritt, which was decided in 2004, the Court observed at [65] that the only decision in this state involving the murder by a person of his or her children where life sentences had been imposed was at first instance in that case.  
     
      
    39 In Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321; (2007) 178 A Crim R 232 at [175], however, the Court of Criminal Appeal resisted the characterisation of family or domestic killings as a discrete category of murder. I have come to the view that the comparison of other cases is ultimately unhelpful for the purpose of determining whether the present case does or does not fall within the worst class of case or the category described in s 61(1): cf Kalajzich at 51.  
     
      
    40 In my view, the murders of JH and KH stand within the worst category of case. The offender killed his young grandchildren when they had been entrusted to his care. He intended to kill them and planned their murders with grim attention. They were the second and third murders committed by him that night. Although all three murders were committed during the one night, there was a distinct interval before the murder of each child during which the offender carried out the preparation for his next killing. He killed the children knowing that he had already killed the only person who might have come to their defence that night. He knew their mother was many miles away, trusting that her children were in safe hands. He abused the children’s trust in him by coaxing them out of their beds. There was a high degree of violence in the murder of KH. The murder of JH involved a struggle, during which she must have experienced a level of terror no child should know.  
     
      
    41 The offender’s culpability is not mitigated by mental illness or any other circumstance which provides a reason for his conduct. The killings remain unexplained. The only reason stated by the offender for killing JH and KH is the baseless and arrogant assertion that his daughter would not have been able to care for them on her own. His acts were wicked in the extreme. 42 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s level of culpability in the commission of the murders of the two children is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of life sentences. 
     
      
    43 As I have already indicated, I am required nonetheless to consider whether a lesser sentence is justified by the offender’s subjective circumstances. I have regard to the fact that he has pleaded guilty to the offences. Another mitigating factor is the fact that the offender has no significant record of previous convictions. There is little material before me from which I can assess his character, except to say that he appears to have been in regular employment throughout his adult life. I accept, having regard to his age, that he would be unlikely to re-offend if released from prison. I also have regard to the fact that it will be more onerous for him to serve a term of imprisonment than it would be if he were younger: Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 507. That consideration, however, must be weighed against the objective culpability of the offender’s conduct: Holyoak at 508.  
     
      
    44 I am not satisfied that the offender is remorseful to any significant extent. I am not prepared to conclude on the strength of the evidence before me that he has accepted responsibility for his actions. Although he expressed some regret to police, he has communicated no such sentiment to SW or to the children’s father, DH, after taking their children from them. He expressed no remorse at the sentence hearing. In my view, there is little in the offender’s subjective circumstances to mitigate his extreme culpability. Accordingly, I do not think it is appropriate to impose any lesser sentence than life imprisonment for the murders of the two children.45 The murder of the offender’s wife, JW, also displayed a high level of criminality. In respect of that offence, however, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the level of culpability is so extreme as to require the imposition of a life sentence. I acknowledge, especially to JW’s daughter, SW, that it must appear to be a callous exercise to have to make such comparisons but it is a task the Court is required to undertake in order to determine the appropriate sentence according to law. 
     
      
    46 Although I do not accept that the offender genuinely believed it was merciful to kill his wife, her killing nonetheless lacks some of the worse features of the murders of the two grandchildren, in particular, their youth and vulnerability, the fact that they had been entrusted into the care of the offender and the fact that they were his second and third victims.  
     
      
    47 It is accordingly necessary to fix a determinate sentence for the murder of JW. I am required by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to set a non-parole period for the sentence, even though it will have no practical significance in the present context. I do not think that there are special circumstances for adjusting the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term in the present case. 
     
      
    48 In my view, the murder of JW was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of that kind. It involved a degree of planning and the violent use of three different weapons. The victim was in her home, but it has been held that that is not a matter of particular significance in the case of a victim and an offender who lived together: R v Thawer [2009] NSWCCA 158 at [44] per Howie J. JW, was, however, entitled to trust that she was safe from attack at the hands of the offender. Accepting, as the offender says, that she was asleep when he attacked her, she was vulnerable on that account.  
     
      
    49 I take into account the fact that the offender pleaded guilty to the offence and that it was his first offence. The Crown accepted that the pleas were entered in the Local Court at the earliest reasonable opportunity. It is accordingly appropriate to reduce the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed by 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea: s 22(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  
     
      
    50 The plea also provides a reason to depart from the standard non-parole period of 20 years, but that period remains relevant as a guide to the appropriate sentence: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [68] and [122]. 
     
      
    51 I take into account the fact that the offender committed the offences at the age of 69 and apparently had regular employment and no significant criminal history up to that point. As already indicated, I accept that he would be unlikely to re-offend if released from prison. 
     
      
    52 In respect of the attempted murder of SW, I note that the offence involved an attack at close quarters with a high level of violence and the use of an axe. The premeditation of the offence involved a series of lies and a gross abuse of trust. The offender planned the offence, and his subsequent escape, over a period of many hours. The injuries inflicted on SW were very serious but since grievous bodily harm is an element of the offence, I do not take that into account as an aggravating factor. The offender’s attack on SW was the fourth in a series of brutal criminal acts. It was committed just as SW discovered that the offender had murdered her daughter, which must have exacerbated its emotional impact.  
     
      
    53 In my view the offence against SW was well above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of that kind. On that basis, although the standard non-parole period of ten years remains relevant, I should direct more attention to the maximum penalty of 25 years as a guide to the appropriate sentence: R v Mitchell and Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 94 at [37]. I have determined what I consider to be the appropriate sentences for the murder of JW and the attempted murder of SW. Turning to the question whether those sentences should be served concurrently, I am of the view that the attempted murder of SW was an act of significant criminality that was sufficiently discrete from the offender’s earlier crimes to warrant some accumulation between the two determinate sentences.  
     
      
    54 At the sentence hearing, victim impact statements were read to the Court by DH, the father of the two children, and by their mother, SW. The law does not permit me to take the effect of death on family members of the deceased into account to increase the sentence that is to be imposed: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 87. Nonetheless, the participation of DH and SW in the sentencing proceedings affords an opportunity for the Court to acknowledge the crushing impact of these offences on them and to pay respect to their extraordinary courage.  
     
      
    55 John Walsh, please stand. For the murder of JH you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life. For the murder of KH you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life. For the offence of causing grievous bodily harm to SW with intent to murder SW, you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years commencing on 30 June 2008 and expiring on 29 June 2020 and a balance of term of 4 years. For the murder of JW, you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years commencing on 30 June 2011 and expiring on 29 June 2026 and a balance of term of 5 years.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing a young man who from an early age fell into a life of drug addiction and crime. His early life was marked by separation, disruption and abuse. He comes before me for burglaries which he committed driven by his drug addiction. They are the sorts of burglaries that significantly disturb people’s lives and the courts have made it clear that that sort of criminal behaviour must be punished.2. On the other hand, some very recent large changes have occurred in this young man’s life. He has been reunited with the family he was separated from as an infant and has been drug free for some time. 3. Hence the sentence I impose must inflict punishment - the punishment which the community expects for these crimes - but also reflect and encourage his steps towards rehabilitation. 4. The young man’s name is Justin Alexander Croese. He has been charged with and pleaded guilty to three crimes and I convict him of those three crimes. 5. The first crime is aggravated break and enter with intent committed on 4 May 2007. That is an offence against s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. I have been asked to take into account when I am sentencing him for that crime an additional offence of being carried in a stolen vehicle without the owner’s consent which is an offence against s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. I will take that into account and I sign the document known as Form 1 which is pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 6. The second crime that he has pleaded guilty to is break enter and steal. It was committed on 7 February 2007. That is an offence against s 112(1) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. 7. The third and most serious crime is an aggravated break enter and steal. The aggravation was that he was in company. It was committed on 13 February 2008. That is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. It carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. Not only that, Parliament regards that crime as so serious that it has fixed to that crime a standard non parole period of five years imprisonment. That means that Parliament expects, unless it is a certain exceptional case, that the non parole period should be five years for such a crime. I will return to the question whether this is an exceptional case or not shortly.8. I have also been asked to take into account relating to that offence three other offences on another Form 1. Those three other offences are another crime of being carried in a stolen vehicle against s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act and a crime of break enter and steal and contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act and a crime of break enter and commit malicious damage contrary to the same section of the Crimes Act. I will take those offences into account in sentencing Mr Croese for that offence and I have signed the Form 1 accordingly. The two Form 1’s are exhibits C and D respectively.9. It is important when sentencing someone to commence with an account of just what the crimes were so that an assessment can be made of just how serious an example of criminal behaviour the offender engaged in. The first crime in point of time was the second charge of break enter and steal. It was committed some time between 8.30 in the morning and 5 in the evening on Wednesday 7 February 2007. Mr Croese took himself to a house owned by some people in Billyard Avenue in Wahroonga. He went to the back of the house and opened the closed laundry door and went in. Inside he stole items of personal property amounting to in value some $10,000. A list of some of those items will give anyone an idea of how upsetting and disturbing the theft of these items would be to their owner.10. He stole an antique bracelet as well as an antique fob watch and chain. He stole a strand of cultured pearls and three pairs of dress earrings as well as a chain bracelet. He stole a gold bangle bracelet. In addition he stole a St Mary’s Hospital London nurse’s graduation pin and a sterling silver English nurse’s belt buckle. He stole a laptop computer and a digital camera, including a memory card. He stole a second digital camera and an MP3 player including the memory card.11. I turn now to describe the offence committed on 4 May 2007 which was the subject of the charge of aggravated break and enter with intent. The victim, whose house he broke into in this case, was seventy years old. She was at home at the time. She had gone to bed a little after midnight in her home in Lucinda Avenue, Wahroonga. There was somebody else staying in the house downstairs. She heard a disturbance during the night but thought it was something else. When she went downstairs in the morning on 4 May 2007 she saw that a side door was open and an internal door to the garage was open and that her car was missing. She saw that her black handbag was missing with a leather purse which contained a number of items. I note however that the offence in this case is break and enter with intent.12. The offence which I am asked to take into account related to that matter is the theft of the car owned by the seventy year old owner of the house he broke into. More precisely it was the offence of Mr Croese being carried in that stolen car. 13. I turn now to the third offence, the aggravated break enter and steal in company. That was committed on 13 February 2008. He was accompanied by another offender, Michael Tong. They went to Balmoral Avenue in Mosman. Mr Tong went to the side and one of them smashed the glass of a ground floor rear door and went inside. They stole a large number of items of property. Once again listing the property will give anyone a clear idea of how disturbing and upsetting the loss of these items either permanently or temporarily can be to any householder.14. They included a computer work station, Microsoft software, an iPod, a digital camera and memory stick, a still camera, further memory sticks. He even stole mini cassette tapes and another camera. They stole a flat panel LCD television. In fact there were four of those. They stole jewellery, including a ring and a men’s bracelet. They even stole a wedding band with an inscription “Tony love Jenny 1993”. They stole a men’s watch, in fact two men’s watches and a gold chain. They stole a white diamond engagement ring and two wedding rings as well as silver earrings. They even stole a child’s gold name bracelet and chain with a name plate and a baby’s gold adjustable bangle as well as earrings and another bangle. Mr Croese took some of the property to a loan offence in Sydney and managed to pawn several items of jewellery that evening and got nearly $500 for them. They include the gold bangle and chains and earrings and including the inscribed gold men’s ring. 15. The three offences which I take into account on the Form 1 I should briefly describe so far as that offence is concerned. One if the theft of a car which occurred on 13 February 2008 which belonged to a person. The second was a break enter and steal in Turramurra where items stolen included two laptops, a digital camera and a mobile phone. The third was a break and enter and commit malicious damage in Hornsby where Mr Croese opened an unlocked garage door and smashed the rear driver’s window of a car.16. As I say, the description of these offences leaves one in no doubt why the Court of Criminal Appeal has emphasised the importance of significant sentences being imposed upon persons who take it upon themselves to break into other people’s property and steal their valuables.17. Mr Croese pleaded guilty to these three offences. That is to his credit. It facilitates the course of justice and Mr Nathan for the prosecutor has fairly indicated that the plea was at the earliest available opportunity. I therefore propose to allow Mr Croese a discount of twenty-five per cent on the sentence which I will ultimately impose. 18. In addition I should say that I have read a confidential exhibit which was exhibit E. The contents of exhibit E are a matter which I take into account under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.19. I have read the authorities about the combined discount which judges may give to offenders who have both pleaded guilty and have the benefit of an additional discount under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In particular I have considered SZ v The Queen (2007) 168 A Crim R at 249. I have taken into account the various matters which Mr Williams who appears for Mr Croese has drawn to my attention. I regard an appropriate combined discount as being thirty-five per cent for both s 22 and s 23 matters in this case. The exhibit E I will return to the envelope and direct my associate to reseal it with tape which she will do now. It is to be opened only on the direction of a judge of this court or a judge of a higher jurisdiction. And it will be kept with the papers on the file.20. Mr Croese has been in custody, bail refused, for a number of periods related to these offences. In total those periods amount to some 245 days and I propose to commence the sentences, or at least one of the sentences, which I will impose from 5 December 2008 by way of acknowledging that period of time which he has spent in custody.21. These offences were objectively serious. The items of personal property stolen I have already said would cause significant upset to their owners and more than significant inconvenience. One only has to think for a moment of the impact upon someone of losing items such as computers and their memories and cameras and their memories, not to mention the items obviously of close important sentimental value to owners. I regard the offences as generally falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness but towards the lower end of that range. 22. I need to take into account certain aggravating features of these offences. First, so far as the third offence is concerned of aggravated break and enter and steal, it was committed whilst Mr Croese was on bail. A judicial officer had allowed him on bail to return to the community, no doubt upon a condition that he behave himself. That was after he had been charged with the first offence. Instead of behaving himself Mr Croese took it upon himself to break into a further person’s property and inflict damage to their lives which I have referred to. 23. In addition he has a criminal record. There is a previous offence of break enter and steal. However in this regard I accept Mr Williams’ submission that that offence was committed some eleven and a half years ago and when Mr Croese was a juvenile. In addition I accept his submission that the offences which appear on his criminal record could be far more and more serious given the itinerant lifestyle that he was leading.24. Before turning to matters which I take into account so far as mitigating the sentence is concerned I need to refer to some personal features which are relevant in Mr Croese’s case. Mr Williams called Mr Croese to give evidence before me. I accept the evidence which Mr Croese has given. He told the court that he was adopted as an infant and the first adoption did not work. During another adoption he suffered some abuse from his parents. His adoptive parents divorced when he was aged five. And between the ages of five and thirteen he was, as he said, going backwards and forwards between his two adoptive parents. 25. At the age of thirteen he was put out of home. He had started using drugs. The pre-sentence report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service indicates that he started using cannabis at the age of fifteen and then moved on to using cocaine, ecstasy, alcohol and methylamphetamine. When he was put out of home at around thirteen he resided on the streets of Sydney. By the age of seventeen, as he said, he was well and truly addicted to amphetamines.26. He has undertaken a drug rehabilitation course with the Salvation Army. When he was bailed in June last year he attended their course. He was there for six months and did not complete the course. He explained to me the circumstances of his leaving the course which were related to a lack of supervision when he moved from one stage of the course to another and the fact that some of the other - at least one other - person on the course was using drugs. Most significantly since he has discharged himself from that course, to which I might add he has not been accepted back, he has told me that he has not used any drugs. I accept that evidence. 27. Also most significantly since discharging himself from the drug rehabilitation course he has reconnected with his family of origin. He has met his biological mother and his biological siblings by a remarkable co-incidence through the internet. He has found that he has become very close to that family and has stayed with his biological mother who is living in Forster. He also sees his sister and her family regularly. His mother has organised for him to undertake a job. He told me that his attitude has changed completely and that he has a more positive outlook on life and is experiencing a real bond now between himself, his mother and his three sisters.28. Significantly he has said to me in evidence that he sees no excuse for his criminal behaviour. He acknowledges the impact which it has had on the victims and regrets his behaviour a lot. He acknowledges that he had no right to be in their homes and accepts responsibility for his crimes. 29. Mr Nathan cross-examined him about his departure from the drug rehabilitation course and he confirmed that they would not take him back and that he has not committed any offences since leaving the drug rehabilitation course. He also confirmed that any period in custody up till now has always been on remand. He has never been under sentence.30. In addition Mr Williams called Mr Croese’s mother, Rayleanea Angel. She said that the reunion which occurred went very well. She said that her son fits in where he always belonged and all her family love him. She found him a job in a restaurant. He also assists her with her medical condition of diabetes. He is respectful. He works with money in his employment and is implicitly trusted. He has been living with her and, to her observation, has not been involved in any drugs and chooses not to take alcohol. He sees his sister regularly. His mother says that he can have a job as soon as he is released. She acknowledges that he is very remorseful and appears to have a huge amount of support in overcoming his drug habit. And she said he will now never not have a family. 31. Mr Croese’s employment history is one of sporadic and unskilled employment over the years, obviously disrupted by his lifestyle. 32. The pre-sentence report also confirms his accepting responsibility for his actions and acknowledging their seriousness. It assesses him as unsuitable for a Community Service Order or Periodic Detention as well.33. Mr Williams tendered as an exhibit a psychological report by Mr W John Taylor dated 9 July 2009. Mr Taylor made an effort to assess the likelihood of Mr Croese re-offending. In his report over pages 9-10 Mr Taylor said that he had “formed the opinion that he has a moderate to high-moderate risk of recidivism. In reaching this opinion I have also considered the fact that he has not completed any rehabilitation program and has, up to the present time, led a rather itinerant lifestyle. His chances of rehabilitation will be substantially improved if he is able to gain support and if he is able to maintain his present motivation for change.” Mr Taylor also noted in his report that Mr Croese was not proud of what he had done and was prepared to face up to it and had no right to be in other people’s homes.34. I return now to the question of the standard non parole period which attaches to one of these offences. S 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a court is to set the standard non parole period unless it determines that there are reasons for setting one that is longer or shorter. The reasons are only those referred to in s 21A. The Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that the standard non parole period is meant to apply to an offender who has pleaded not guilty and who has been convicted after a trial. Therefore technically the standard non parole period does not apply to this case but it is nevertheless indicated by the Court of Criminal Appeal that it is a guidepost by reference to which a judge can assess how serious Parliament regards this kind of crime.35. However there are factors also in s 21A which to my mind make this case exceptional and one which is not appropriate for the imposition of the standard non parole period. I take into account for example the plentiful evidence of his remorse in accordance with s 21A(3)(i). On balance I regard his prospects of rehabilitation in accordance with s 21A(3)(h) as good. I say on balance because he does not have a good record with the Probation and Parole Service over the years and he did leave the William Booth Institute Drug Rehabilitation course. And Mr Taylor is guarded. On the other hand the circumstances which Mr Taylor referred to are present so far as his family is concerned and his reunion with his family of origin will in my opinion be a significant influence in his rehabilitation plus the fact that he has voluntarily stopped taking the drugs. I therefore do not regard the standard non parole period as applicable to this case.36. I need to take into account, so far as the purposes of sentencing are concerned, (a matter which I referred to at the commencement of these remarks) two important features in this case. One is the prevention of crime by deterring this offender and others from committing similar burglaries but the other is the promotion of the rehabilitation of Mr Croese. I should also add that the protection of the community is obviously a factor which looms large in sentencing for these sorts of offences. 37. In accordance with s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act it is clear to me that no other penalty than imprisonment is appropriate for these offences and it is not appropriate for that form of imprisonment to be served in any way other than in full time custody. I have taken into account the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission and which both legal representatives referred me to.38. Taking into account these various factors I commence by making some estimate of initial appropriate sentences for the various offences, a starting place so to speak. 39. For count 1, taking into account the Form 1, a sentence of three years would be appropriate in my opinion; for count 2, a sentence of two and a half years; and for count 3, a sentence of five years.40. The total of such sentences would be in the region of ten and a half years. That ten and a half years in my opinion would be too much as a result of the process of just adding up the individual sentences. The principle of totality means that I should let some of those sentences run together and allow some of the sentences to be served partially by themselves. In my opinion the total length of the sentences should not be ten and a half years but should be in the region of seven years.41. However I have not yet applied the discount which Mr Croese is entitled to for both his plea of guilty and the matters relevant to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As I said I regard an appropriate discount as thirty-five per cent which takes into account both those factors. A discount of thirty-five per cent on seven years produces an overall figure of some four and a half years or fifty-four months. 42. Mr Williams has argued that there are special circumstances which would justify an adjustment between the non parole period and the additional term. Normally a non parole period for a sentence is about seventy-five percent of the sentence. In this case seventy-five per cent of fifty-four months would be a period of some forty months but I take into account the matters put to me by Mr Williams - to which Mr Nathan did not take exception - that Mr Croese has never been in custody as a sentenced prisoner before. I take into account the importance of his process of rehabilitation and re-establishing his links with his family and the fact that he is relatively young. I regard an appropriate non parole period as thirty-three months in custody instead of forty months in custody. As I said I propose to back date the sentences to 5 December 2008 to take into account the period of some 245 days in custody up until today. 43. Mr Croese I’m going to sentence you now if you would stand up. I am going to sentence you first for the second count, the second offence, which is break and enter on 7 February 2007. For that offence, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I sentence you to eighteen months imprisonment to commence on 5 December 2008 and to expire on 4 June 2010. That is a fixed term. In fact if I said I am taking into account the Form 1 in respect of count 2, I withdraw that. There is no Form 1 for count 2. And count 2 is the offence I have just sentenced you to for eighteen months.44. I now turn to count 1 which is the aggravated break and enter with intent committed on 4 May 2007 and taking into account the Form 1, I sentence you to two years imprisonment. That is to commence on 5 January 2009, one month after the previous sentence and to expire on 4 January 2011. Once again that is a fixed term.45. Turning to count 3, the aggravated break and enter and steal in company committed on 13 February 2008, I fix a non parole period of two and a half years commencing on 5 March 2009 and expiring on 4 September 2011. The balance of the term will be two and a half years commencing on 5 September 2011 and expiring on 4 March 2014. 46. Have a seat Mr Croese. Mr Croese just subject to what the lawyers agreeing, your first release date is just over two years time on 4 September 2011. HIS HONOUR : Now the first thing gentlemen is whether there are any factual errors in my remarks on sentence that I should address. No, no. The second thing is the mathematics, whether the mathematics - do you want me to recite them again?Count 2, eighteen months, 05/12/08 to 04/06/10 fixed term. Count 1, two years 05/01/09 to 04/01/11 fixed term. Count 3, overall five years from 5 March 09 to 4 March 14. Non parole period two and a half years 5 March 09 to 4 September 11.WILLIAMS: Correct your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mathematics okay?WILLIAMS: Yes that’s fine.HIS HONOUR: Mr Nathan?NATHAN: Yes.HIS HONOUR: All right, and the overall sentence is more than three years so I don’t fix the non parole myself but I propose to recommend to the Parole Authority that they consider the matters referred to in the Probation and Parole report.47. I recommend that the Parole Authority when considering Mr Croese’s parole take into account the recommendations contained in the pre-sentence report, exhibit B, dated 15 July 2009, including his attendance at a drug and alcohol program in custody and following his release from custody, regular reporting and home visits, urinalysis, referral to employment or job training providers and monitoring his accommodation issues. I make those recommendations.48. Mr Croese you have heard me give my reasons. I have had to balance the seriousness of the crimes you have committed against your obvious change in the last few years but I cannot just let you off and send you out now. It is not appropriate because of the crimes you have committed. Your first date when you are eligible for release, as I said, is 4 September 2011. That is just over two years from now. Whether you are released or not depends on the Parole Authority and your obvious performance whilst you have been in custody and I have recommended that if they release you then, then they take into account what the Probation and Parole Service said about you. Do you understand that? All right. Good luck Mr Croese.

   JUDGMENT1. Mr Brassil, for the accused in this matter, has made an application that I should give a direction to the jury at the close of the Crown case - which has just closed - in accordance with Regina v Prasad (1979) 2 A Crim R 45. 2. His application is a proper one and it relies significantly upon his argument concerning the evidence of a witness named Olivera and upon the absence of evidence from two sources, namely Optus telephone records and airport surveillance records. 3. Those issues may well be factors which Mr Brassil will agitate, so far as the jury is concerned, in his final address. However, this is a case where his client, according to the Crown evidence, arrived at Sydney airport with a bag which contained up to - perhaps more than, depending upon the evidence - two kilograms of cocaine and with an explanation which clearly the Customs officers and the police regarded as having little substance. That is an available point of view about the accused’s explanation for the drugs within his bag. 4. I regard the passage from the judgment of King CJ in Regina v Pahuja (1987) 49 SASR 191 at 201 as persuasive where his Honour referred to the undoubted right of a trial judge to inform the jury of its power to bring in a verdict of not guilty at any time after the conclusion of the Crown case but said that that power “should be used sparingly and only when the judge is of the opinion that the evidence for the prosecution, although capable in law of supporting a conviction, is insufficiently cogent to justify a verdict of guilty.” In the same case Cox J (at 218) referred to the circumstances in which a Prasad direction would be given to a jury as one involving “usually some serious weakness in the Crown case that has emerged during its presentation”. 5. I have also had regard to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Reardon Michaels & Taylor (2002) 186 FLR 1 and particularly the passage in the judgment of Simpson J with whom, on that issue, Hodgson JA and Barr J agreed at 33 ([157]). 6. My assessment of the weight of the evidence against this particular accused is such that I do not regard it as appropriate in the exercise of my discretion to give the direction sought by Mr Brassil. His application is refused.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: In an earlier trial the husband, Brian Burns, has been found guilty of manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. The wife, Natalie Burns, is now on trial. The prosecution case is that the deceased was found dead in a backyard shed at the premises where the husband and wife resided. The Crown alleges that the deceased arrived at their flat for a drug deal – specifically to obtain methadone – and that criminal responsibility for the death attaches to the wife as well as to the husband.2 At the close of the case, Mr Crawford-Fish for the defence submits that there is no case to answer on the manslaughter charge. Firstly, on “unlawful and dangerous act”, he submits that the drug was, on the Crown case, handed over to an adult person apparently in possession of his faculties, who could choose to throw the drug into the garbage bin, or to consume it as he saw fit. He made a decision about it in the same way that people make decisions about the consumption of all sorts of things in their daily lives.3 He relies upon the decision in The Queen v Kennedy, House of Lords (2007) UK HL 38. In that case the House of Lords dealt with a question phrased in the following terms: 
     
      
       “When is it appropriate to find someone guilty of manslaughter where that person has been involved in the supply of a class A controlled drug which is then freely and voluntarily self-administered by the person to whom it was supplied and the administration of the drug then causes his death?” 
      
    4 In paragraph 25 of the judgment of their Lordships answered the certified question thus:  
     
      
      “In the case of a fully informed and responsible adult, never.” 
      
    5 This is a point which was not in issue in Royall v R (1991) 172 CLR 378, which is the leading Australian authority on causation in the criminal law generally.6 The logic of the House of Lords in Kennedy’s case is that the handing over or the supply of a drug to a particular person concludes a certain activity; whether it is then taken up by somebody else and ingested or injected or somehow otherwise used, the causative force of the supply is negated or cancelled out. If the person dies, the supply cannot be said to be the “cause” of the death. In a subsequent decision in the highest court of Scotland, the case of MacAngus & Kane v H.M. Advocate [2009] HCJAC 8, a broadly different position was taken from that adopted in Kennedy. The MacAngus judgment involved an extensive examination of the authorities and academic commentary. Their Honours concluded (paragraph 48) that  
     
      
      “…a deliberate decision by the victim of the reckless conduct to ingest the drug will not necessarily break the chain of causation.” 
      
    7 R v Evans (Gemma) [2009] EWCA Crim 650 is a recent decision of the English Court of Appeal tending to support the reasoning of the Scottish court in MacAngus v H.M. Advocate rather than of the House of Lords in The Queen v Kennedy.8 This issue is not without difficulty. It has been approached differently in different jurisdictions. One of the complications is that it is apparently still the law in Britain (or it was so in 2007) that the self-injection of a prohibited drug is not of itself a criminal offence. By contrast in New South Wales, under s 12 of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985, it is an offence to self-administer a prohibited drug9 There is some logic at least in the Kennedy doctrine and the argument presented by Mr Crawford-Fish. For the present purposes, I do not see that argument as a basis for me to direct a verdict for his client on this point, but it may be the basis for an argument on the facts that there has been a break in the chain of causation. Whether the jury should take the view that the deceased, David Hay, was at the relevant time a responsible adult acting voluntarily and advisedly as to the risks of the drug, will no doubt be a matter of argument between counsel in their submissions to the jury; but I am prepared to put to the jury the proposition that a break in the chain of causation on this ground could occur as a matter of fact. As was pointed out in MacAngus at paragraphs 33 and 34, juries may well be reluctant to conclude, on the facts, that a particular drug abuser who dies did indeed “freely and voluntarily” self-administer, and was “informed” as to the risks involved. As I say, this may be a matter of fact for the jury. The role of the jury in such matters is emphasised by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Styman and Taber [2004] NSWCCA 245.10 I decline the application for a directed verdict for the charge of manslaughter pressed under the head of “unlawfully dangerous act”.11 As for liability in manslaughter via the doctrine of criminally negligent omission rather than as an unlawfully dangerous act, there is again considerable doubt and difficulty with the authorities.12 It is clear that a person may be found guilty of manslaughter in New South Wales by an omission. The definition of “murder” in New South Wales and the definition of “manslaughter” in the Crimes Act make it apparent that a culpable homicide may be committed by an act or by an omission. 13 The lesson in the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke, 10, 25-37) is not automatically reflected in the law. In Donoghue and Stevenson [1932] A.C. 52, bold spirits declared the good Samaritan principle to be alive and well in the law of torts, but judges laying down the criminal law in relation to manslaughter have not been so willing to place legal liability upon those who turn their heads away and walk past on the other side of the street.14 In American jurisprudence reflecting the common law tradition, there is a contrast between what is called in many cases the “American bystander” rule - a robust formulation of the principle that no person is obliged to go out of his way to assist others - and the Good Samaritan principle. A number of states, principally Vermont, have legislated versions of the Good Samaritan principle, both in the civil law and in the criminal law. 15 In Australia, the legislature of the Northern Territory (in s 155 of the Criminal Code Act of that jurisdiction) has enacted a criminal law which establishes a broad Good Samaritan principle: 
     
      
      “Any person who, being able to provide rescue, resuscitation, medical treatment, first aid or succour of any kind to a person urgently in need of it and whose life may be endangered if it is not provided, callously fails to do so is guilty of a crime and is liable to imprisonment for 7 years. “ 
      
    16 It is not the function of criminal trial judges to be “bold spirits” and to create new areas of criminal liability. I am fully conscious of the need for restraint in this area. Let me refer to some of the relevant authorities. The leading case in New South Wales on this subject is R v Taktak, a decision of Yeldham, Carruthers and Loveday JJ., a strong criminal court. It is reported at (1988) 34 A Crim R 334. That court undertook a fairly exhaustive analysis of the relevant laws. The court cited J F Stephen’s A History of the Criminal Law of England 1883 to the effect that,  
     
      
      “By the law of this country killing by omission is in no case criminal unless the thing omitted is one which it is a legal duty to do”. 
      
    17 Stephen then set out various duties which common law cases had established. A significant aspect of what Stephen said was that: 
     
      
      “No rule exists in such cases. It is a matter of degree determined by the view the jury happens to take in each particular case”. 
      
    18 That deals with the level of the neglect, but equally, although the cases from Stephen onwards talk about duties, the heads of manslaughter by omission are nowhere absolutely defined. At p 345 of Taktak, Yeldham J says:  
     
      
      “The spectrum of legally recognised duties grounding liability for an omission is an open-ended one, given that such duties can arise from statute as well as the common law. Standard common law duties grounding liability for manslaughter by omission include that which is vested in the parent of a young and dependent child”. 
      
    19 He continues,  
     
      
      “Legally recognised duties of care can also arise in other situations.”  
      
    20 Indeed this must be so. When Stephen wrote his great history of the criminal law, the motor vehicle had not yet been invented and Conan Doyle was able to imagine Sherlock Holmes smoking opium with complete legality. 21 The court in Taktak placed some reliance on the American case of People v Beardsley, (1907) 113, North West, 1128. That was a case where a husband, while his wife was absent, had taken up with an old girlfriend and ensconced her in one of the rooms of the premises he occupied. She took drugs, she died, and he did not call assistance for her, not wanting to call attention to the circumstances. He was convicted of manslaughter, but cleared on appeal. The Michigan appellate court said,  
     
      
      “The fact that this woman was in his house created no such legal duty as exists in law and is due from a husband towards his wife”.  
      
    22 That case has been addressed in a multitude of other American cases, as well as in the Australian jurisprudence.23 In a more recent American decision, Jones v United States (1962) 308, 2d F.L.R. at 307, Beardsley was cited. The court in Jones said,  
     
      
      “There are at least four situations where the failure to act may constitute the breach of a legal duty”.  
      
    24 The fourth of those categories was the one relied upon in Taktak:  
     
      
      “Where one has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from rendering aid”. 
      
    25 The care that has to be taken in this area of the law is reflected in a detailed and careful decision of Crispin J of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in 1998: Regina v Rao, unreported judgment BC9908174.26 There the learned judge directed a verdict of not guilty in a drug death case. Notwithstanding that direction and the care which his Honour took to relate the facts to the authorities, including Taktak’s case, his Honour said this at para 143: 
     
      
      “If the Crown could establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused Mr Cinque to lapse into unconsciousness and that he was consequently placed in real danger then I would have little hesitation in finding that she had a duty of care.” 
      
    27 His Honour preceded that obiter dictum by this observation, referring to some earlier Australian decisions: 
     
      
      “I do not understand their Honours to have intended to lay down any general principle that a person who does any act which has the effect of creating any danger for another person, ipso facto acquires a duty to intervene to protect that person.” 
      
    28 R v Lawford, (1993) 69 A Crim R 115, was a decision of a strong South Australian appellate court. The leading judgment was given by his Honour Duggan J. 29 Both Crispin J in R v Rao and Duggan J in R v Lawford referred to the decision of the High Court in Phillips (1971) 45 ALJR 467, a case involving death related to the incoming tide drowning a young woman. Crispin noted this decision as follows: 
     
      
      “Their Honours held that if the accused had been responsible for the deceased having been rendered unconscious and placed in a dangerous situation as a consequence, then he had a duty to take positive action to render assistance.” 
      
    30 This reasoning finds an echo in helpful obiter dicta in the recent English Court of Appeal decision in R v Evans (Gemma) [2009] EWCA Crim 650. There, although that judgment is not binding here or precisely in point, the court said that 
     
      
      “Without her involvement in the supply of heroin, the jury was directed that there was no duty on the appellant to act even after she became aware of the serious adverse effect of the drug-taking on Carly. If on the other hand she was so involved, that fact, taken with the other undisputed facts would, and on our analysis of the relevant principles did give rise to a duty on the appellant to act. In law the judge's directions about the ingredients of gross negligence manslaughter, as applied to this case, were correct.” 
      
    31 Notwithstanding the restraint which courts exercise in this area of the law, I am satisfied that while it is necessary for me to avoid engaging in judicial legislation by asserting a general principle analogous to section 155 of the Northern Territory Criminal Code Act, nonetheless on the facts in the present case I am satisfied that I can and should state the law of New South Wales to be as follows: 
     
      
      “If a person voluntarily invites or permits potential recipients to attend his or her home for the purpose of a prohibited drug supply transaction where the drugs are to be consumed on the premises, and where such a recipient may be or become seriously affected by drugs to the point where his or her life may be endangered, the drug supplier has a duty to conduct himself toward the drug recipient without being grossly or criminally neglectful.” 
      
    32 It seems to me that such a limited proposition is correct even though the circumstances I avert to do not include the element of seclusion referred to in Taktak’s case, and which was present in the case as presented against the husband, Brian Burns.33 I decline to direct a verdict of not guilty of manslaughter on the ground of alleged grossly negligent criminal omission.

      ALL GROUNDS APPEAL 
      
    Introduction1 This is a conviction appeal by Stephen Roy Iovino.2 Stephen Roy Iovino was convicted in the Local Court, Goulburn, on 25 February 2009 of an offence of driving whilst suspended on 7 January 2009 contrary to s 25A(2)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998.3 On that day he lodged an appeal from the severity of the penalty imposed pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The appeal was listed for hearing in the sittings of the District Court at Goulburn commencing 11 May 2009. When it was mentioned to allocate a date for argument in the following two weeks Mr McGrath for the appellant informed the court that in the course of the preparation of the matter he came to the view that the appellant could not at law stand guilty of this offence and foreshadowed an application for leave to appeal from the conviction.4 Argument was heard on 20 May 2009 after the appellant’s solicitor filed written submissions and the hearing was then adjourned to 22 May 2009 for judgment. On that day however, the appellant’s solicitor advised that he wished to enlarge his submissions and the matter was adjourned to the next sittings on 27 July 2009, with the appellant excused from attending if represented.5 Leave was given for the filing of further written submissions. The court received these on Friday 31 July 2009. Thereafter the appeal was listed for further argument on 5 August 2009.6 The appellant’s appeal from the conviction was well beyond the twenty eight days specified in s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, but it was brought within the three months specified in s 13 of the Act during which the appellant may seek leave to appeal. I propose to grant leave to appeal from the conviction but will dismiss the appeal for the reasons hereunder.The Facts7 The facts are uncontroversial. On 7 January 2009 the appellant was the driver of a motor vehicle with Northern Territory registration heading south along the Hume Highway north of Goulburn. Police saw him fail to keep to the left and not keep wholly within the number 1 lane, and had him stop. When they spoke to him he produced a Northern Territory driver licence with an expiry date 11 August 2009. Inquiries by radio informed the police that the appellant’s licence was suspended in the Northern Territory from 24 January 2007 until 27 January 2009.8 The statement of facts to which he pleaded guilty in the Local Court include that he was stopped by police in Alice Springs on 17 October 2007 and told of the suspension. The appellant denies this but nothing turns upon it since he acknowledges through his solicitor that he was aware of the suspension before the police stopped him on 7 January 2009.9 Included in the material tendered by the Crown is a certificate pursuant to s 230 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 according to which the appellant does not hold a licence to drive issued in New South Wales. Also included in the material tendered by the Crown is a certificate from the Deputy Registrar of Motor Vehicles for the Northern Territory pursuant to s 119 of the Motor Vehicles Act (NT) certifying that on 7 January 2009 the appellant was suspended for a period commencing on 24 January 2007 until 27 January 2009.The Issues10 The question first raised was whether on 7 January 2009 the appellant was a person whose driver licence was suspended for the purposes of the offence created by s 25A(2) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act in light of the legislation in the Northern Territory pursuant to which the authorities there took action resulting in his status of being one taken not to be the holder of a licence to drive.11 The appellant’s solicitor’s first written submissions argued that the appellant was not a driver whose licence was suspended because of the terms of the Northern Territory legislation where the administrative decision made to suspend his licence was the preliminary step before he became an unlicensed driver in that jurisdiction. Therefore, so it was argued, when the appellant drove in New South Wales on 7 January 2009 he did so as an unlicensed driver with the consequence that he did not commit the offence with which he was charged.12 The Northern Territory legislation was not produced and no evidence led to prove its terms as promulgated at the relevant times. However, the written submissions quote the relevant provisions. The Crown has not challenged the reliability of this material.13 The analysis provided in those submissions included reference to s 25A(2) and s 25A(3A) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act as presently enacted. Those submissions were thus misconceived to the extent that they were premised upon the application of those provisions in the present form to the driving of the appellant on 7 January 2009.14 The subsequent submissions included a further analysis of the New South Wales legislation creating the offence of driving whilst suspended, bringing to account that the present legislation became operative on 9 March 2009. This notwithstanding, it was submitted that it must have always been the intention of Parliament that the offence of driving while suspended created by s 25A(2) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act, even as expressed on 7 January 2009, did not apply to a licence suspension imposed upon a fine defaulter.15 The submissions also argue that to the extent that the legislation creating this offence exposed the appellant to its operation, it was beyond the power of the New South Wales legislature and therefore inoperative.The Analysis16 The determination of this appeal turns upon the construction of the legislation in New South Wales creating the offence with which the appellant was charged. Section 25A of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act provides for offences committed by disqualified drivers or drivers whose licences are suspended or cancelled.17 On 7 January 2009 s 25A(2) provided relevantly: 
     
      
      A person whose driver licence is suspended must not:  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) drive on a road or road related area a motor vehicle of the class to which the suspended driver licence relates, or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) make an application for a driver licence during the period of suspension for a motor vehicle of the class to which the suspended driver licence relates and in respect of such an application state his or her name falsely or incorrectly or omit to mention the suspension. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence). 
      
    18 Section 25A(9) provides, 
     
      
       
      Subsections (1)–(3) apply to a person who is disqualified from holding a licence, or whose licence is suspended or cancelled, by a court in Australia or under any law in this State or another State or Territory. 
      
    19 The appellant acknowledges that his licence was suspended before 7 January 2009, but argues that under the statutory regime in the Northern Territory he was an unlicensed driver. It is said that there was no offence in the Northern Territory for driving while suspended comparable to that with which the appellant is here charged. The offence committed by a driver whose licence was suspended is driving whilst unlicensed. It will be necessary to refer to the relevant provisions.20 The Northern Territory Parliament proscribed the driving of a motor vehicle by those who do not hold a licence to do so: s 32 Traffic Act (NT). It also authorised the Registrar of Motor Vehicles to suspend the licence to drive held by a fine defaulter as defined in the Fines and Penalties (Recovery) Act (NT) if requested to do so by the Fines Recovery Unit acting pursuant to s 60 of that Act.21 When detected driving in New South Wales on 7 January 2009 the appellant was a fine defaulter in the Northern Territory whose licence to drive issued to him there was suspended. s 29A(1) of the Traffic Act (NT) provides: 
     
      
      If a person's licence to drive is suspended under this Act or another Act, the person is to be taken not to hold a licence to drive during the period of suspension. 
      
    22 Section 32(1) of the same Act provides relevantly: 
     
      
      (1) A person shall not drive a motor vehicle on a public street or public place:  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) unless that person:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (i) holds a licence;  
         
          
         
        
       
      
    23 Thus, within the Northern Territory the appellant was a fine defaulter and because his licence was suspended was taken not to hold a licence for the period of the suspension.24 The New South Wales legislation also provided for the suspension of driver licences for non-payment of fines or penalties but also for other reasons. The initial written submissions draw comparisons and contrasts between the legislative schemes in the Northern Territory and New South Wales providing for the suspension of driver licences for non-payment of fines, and developed a number of arguments drawing upon the features identified in support of the proposition that the provision under which the appellant is charged in New South Wales does not extend to the circumstances of the appellant.25 The submissions point to the fact that there are two broad bases upon which a driver licence might be suspended in New South Wales. On the one hand, a licence might be suspended for reasons other than the non-payment of outstanding fines, whilst on the other, there is debt recovery scheme involving the suspension of licence and registration to encourage compliance. The mistaken reference to the legislation as presently enacted providing for lesser penalties for persons driving while suspended as fine defaulters compared to persons driving whilst suspended for other reasons, underpinned the submissions that the New South Wales legislature could not have intended s 25A(2) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act to apply to someone in the situation of the appellant.26 In the further submissions, this proposition was maintained in respect of the legislation as it was on 7 January 2009, upon the premise that the enactment of amending legislation merely perfected the provisions to express what Parliament had always intended.27 I was invited to the Second Reading Speech introducing these amendments on 27 November 2008. Portions of the speech delivered by the Attorney General were included in the submissions. I have accessed the entire speech from Hansard. The Bill presented was the Fines Further Amendment Bill 2008, the primary purpose of which was to improve the system for administration and enforcement of court fines and penalty notices.28 The following appears in Hansard record of the Attorney’s speech: 
     
      
      Specifically, the amendments are intended to increase the recovery of court fines and penalty notices from low-income earners; divert vulnerable groups out of the fine and penalty notice system and provide them with meaningful and effective non-monetary sanctions; reduce enforcement costs by providing better-targeted fine payment and mitigation options; and reduce the incidence of secondary offending brought about by fine default. The bill makes amendments to the Fines Act 1996 and other related legislation to achieve these objectives. 
      
    29 The range of offences attracting monetary penalties was rehearsed. The Attorney noted that there were 17,000 different offences under ninety seven separate laws in New South Wales, including traffic offences, and that the main issuing agencies were police, local councils, Railcorp, and the Road and Traffic Authority.30 The system for determination of liability and for recovery of the penalties was discussed, including the time allowed to the person fined for payment and the system for the recovery of the fine that operated through the State Debt Recovery Office, which imposed a strict hierarchy of sanctions to encourage payment or to recover the money owing, including suspending driver’s licences, cancelling car registration, seizing property, garnisheeing bank accounts, issuing community service orders or even imprisonment if a person breaches a community service order.31 The Attorney discussed the lack of flexibility in the system that was particularly problematic for the homeless, and those with a mental illness or intellectual disabilities, and the findings of the New South Wales Sentencing Council regarding such people who often find it harder than the rest of us to understand or access the procedures for challenging the fine or asking for an extension of time to pay. When they do not address their fine debt, they automatically progress through the strict hierarchy of sanctions and their debt increases.32 For people who lacked income and assets, and other vulnerable groups, the enforcement system could cause additional and unintended hardship. Improvements needed to assist such people were recognised to address the problem of secondary offending, which happens when people who have had their licence or vehicle registration suspended or cancelled because of fine default continue to drive, and which can ultimately lead to imprisonment.33 Secondary offending is a particular problem for disadvantaged people without the means or organisational skills to pay a fine or penalty notice, leading inevitably to default and licence sanctions, compounding their difficulties when seeking employment or attending to day-to-day necessities.34 Driver sanctions also have a disproportionate impact on people in remote and rural areas. The Attorney said: 
     
      
      The amendments in this bill represent the Government's response to improve the legislative framework for the enforcement of court fines and penalty notices. They seek to ensure that the fine and penalty notice system works in a way that is fair, efficient, and effective for everyone. I note that the changes proposed in this bill are the most urgent changes in response to the problems highlighted in the reports. 
      
    35 The Attorney continued: 
     
      
       
      Schedule 2.3 to the bill inserts a new offence of driving while licence suspended or cancelled due to fine default. The Fines Act provides that if a court fine or penalty notice is not paid after the due date and reminder letter, the person is considered to be in default and their matter is referred to the State Debt Recovery Office where an enforcement order is made. If the amount is still not paid the person's drivers licence can be suspended. It is a criminal offence in New South Wales to drive with a suspended or cancelled licence.  
       
       
      The threat of licence sanctions is a highly effective way of encouraging prompt payment of outstanding fines and penalty notices. However, the current offence of driving while licence suspended or cancelled does not distinguish between licence suspension for unsafe driving and licence suspension for fine default. This is problematic for two reasons. First, the lack of a specific offence prevents an accurate assessment of the extent to which fine default is leading to secondary offending. Secondly, it prevents courts from imposing appropriate sanctions for this offence to reflect the lower threat to the community posed by those who have lost their licence through fine default as compared to those who have lost their licence because of unsafe driving. 
      
     
     
      
      Accordingly, the bill will amend the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 to create a specific offence of driving whilst suspended due to fine default. This will enable the Government to collect better data on the extent of secondary offending due to fine default. Importantly, it will also enable the monitoring of the reforms contained in the bill. The penalties for the new offence would still include minimum disqualification periods; however, these would be lower than those that currently apply under section 25 A (2) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 to reflect the fact that licence suspension for fine default is less serious than, for example, suspension due to driving offences. 
      
    36 These last two paragraphs, but for a few lines, were quoted in the submissions.37 When coming to the end of his speech, the Attorney said: 
     
      
      In conclusion, the proposals in this bill are based on several detailed reports into the fine and penalty notice system, research and broad-based consultation. We anticipate the reforms will increase the recovery of court fines and penalty notices from low-income earners by improving access to payment arrangements, including Centrepay; divert vulnerable groups out of the fine and penalty notice system and provide them with meaningful and effective non-monetary sanctions; reduce enforcement costs by providing better targeted fine payment and mitigation options; and reduce the incidence of secondary offending brought about by fine default. 
      
    38 The passage extracted in the appellant’s submissions is advanced in support of the proposition that the use of the word “suspended” in s 25A of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 was never intended to apply to a visiting driver whose privileges were withdrawn in New South Wales. The analysis leading to this proposition, as I have understood the submissions, is that the amendments have done no more than to perfect the legislation to make clear that this was Parliament’s intention from the inception of s 25A(2) of the Act, and that it should not apply to fine defaulters, in which case it should not apply to the appellant who was a fine default in the Northern Territory.39 I do not agree with this analysis. If the Second Reading Speech might be used to shed light on the intention of Parliament with regard to the provisions as they were on 7 January 2009, it could only be of limited assistance, for its focus is upon the amendments proposed, the mischief they are to address, and the source of the learning that has brought forth concerns that led to the introduction of the Bill. I do not believe that it could be said that the Parliament always intended the outcomes achieved with the amendment. It is apparent, in my respectful opinion, that with the benefit of the reports informing the decision to introduce the amendments written after the investigation of the difficulties faced by the disadvantaged in the community, the Government of the day saw the merit in modifying the existing scheme so that the impact of secondary offending fell more lightly upon those who found themselves to be driving while suspended, not because of an earlier unsafe driving offence, but because of fine default. 40 To the extent that the Second Reading Speech might be used to inform the court upon this question, it does not in my opinion support the submission made on behalf of the appellant.41 Without wanting to do injustice to the research undertaken and the analysis of the legislation provided in the submissions, with the adjustment made to the second iteration of that document bringing into account the legislation as it was on 7 January 2009, I am of the opinion that the construction of 25A of the New South Wales Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act advanced on behalf of the appellant is not correct.42 There can be no doubt in my opinion that giving the words used in s 25A(2) their ordinary meaning, the intention of Parliament was to create an offence of driving whilst a licence is suspended regardless of the reason for that suspension. Moreover, there can be no doubt in my opinion that giving to the words used in s 25A(9) of the Act their ordinary meaning, the intention of parliament was to create an offence of driving whilst the licence is suspended, regardless of where the suspension was suffered in the Commonwealth of Australia.43 I accept that if there were any ambiguity in the language used the construction to be given to the legislation must be that which falls in favour of the appellant, but I do not accept that there is ambiguity in this provision.44 The scheme in the Northern Territory provides for the suspension of the licence, and that during the period of the suspension the person is taken not to hold a licence. If a person drives in the Northern Territory during the period of the suspension, he or she then commits the offence of driving when not the holder of a licence to do so. However, the legislative structure does not alter the fact that the licence is suspended for a finite period. In my opinion, the nature of the offence that might be committed in the Northern Territory under that legislative scheme once a licence is suspended does not impact upon the construction to be placed on the New South Wales legislation creating the offence within this State.45 The words used in s 25A(2) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act that provide for this offence are: 
     
      
      ... a person whose licence is suspended... 
       
      
    46 and by s 25A(9) they apply: 
     
      
       
      ... a person who is disqualified from holding a licence, or whose licence is suspended or cancelled, by a court in Australia or under any law in this State or another State or Territory. 
      
    47 These provisions capture the status of the appellant when he drove in New South Wales on 7 January 2009.48 Without wanting to do injustice to the extensive submissions made on behalf of the appellant upon the final limb of his argument, reflecting extensive reading and thorough research in their development, I believe I can deal with the point raised succinctly.49 In my opinion, my conclusion regarding the construction of these provisions addresses the argument that the New South Wales Parliament has reached beyond its power to legislate extra territorially. I do not believe that it has done so.50 Although it is not necessary to decide, I am also persuaded that the appellant was at the same time an unlicensed driver in New South Wales. Section 25 of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act provides: 
     
      
      (1) A person must not, unless exempted by the regulation: 
       
       
        
        (a) drive a motor vehicle on any road or road related area without being licensed for that purpose, 
        
       
      
    51 Clause 99 of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Regulation 2008 provides relevantly: 
     
      
      (1) A visiting driver who holds: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) a current Australian driver licence or learner licence (including a New Zealand driver licence or learner licence) issued in another jurisdiction … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       that authorised him or her to drive a motor vehicle of a particular kind may drive a motor vehicle of that kind in this State, and is exempt from the requirements of the Act and this Regulation (other than this clause). 
      
     
     
      
      (4) A visiting driver ceased to be exempt under this clause from any requirements of the Act and this Regulation if any of the following happen: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) the visiting driver is suspended or disqualified from driving a motor vehicle on a road or a road related area in any part of Australia or another country. 
        
       
      
    52 The appellant would have been exempt from these provisions on 7 January 2009 but for the suspension in the Northern Territory, as a consequence of which he did not hold a current licence to drive by force of the legislation that deemed him not to hold a licence during the period of the suspension. Moreover, if he drove in New South Wales whilst he was disqualified or suspended in any other place whatsoever, including in places outside of Australia, he would have committed an offence within New South Wales the scope of which extends beyond the circumstances required for the offence with which the appellant is charged.53 However, it does not follow from the availability of another charge that he may escape from the liability, which he has attracted upon the application of s 25A(2) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act. This is not to suggest that he should have been charged with both offences. In any event, this has not arisen for argument and I therefore put the question one side.Orders54 There remains the appeal from the severity of the penalty imposed. However before I turn to that question, I make the following orders. 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal from the conviction is granted. 
       
       
      2. The appeal is dismissed. 
      
    55 I shall now turn to the appeal from the sentence imposed by the magistrate. 56 The maximum penalty to which the appellant was exposed was a fine of $3,300 or imprisonment for eighteen months or both. An automatic period of disqualification of twelve months applies on conviction: s 25A(7). Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act. The magistrate imposed a fine of $450 and court costs of seventy-three dollars and disqualified the appellant from driving for the statutory period commencing on 7 January 2009.57 I have already summarised the facts and circumstances of the offence. I accept that the manner of driving that attracted the attention of the police was not deliberate or wanton, but was the product of high wind challenging the management of the vehicle over the short period that the police saw it moving, as they described. The police officer who detected this driving told the appellant not to drive any further, according to the first set of written submissions on behalf of the appellant. This was confirmed in evidence given by the appellant today. This was perfectly reasonable in the circumstances, for upon any view the appellant was not authorised to drive in New South Wales. The first set of written submissions included the proposition that it appeared the police officer exercised powers under s 206 of Road Transport (General) Act, which provides for an order of suspension by police officers in respect of certain offences, and which may be made in respect of visiting drivers authorised to drive in New South Wales.58 It was not necessary for the police officer to resort to that provision, for as I have noted the appellant was not authorised to drive in any case. Moreover, upon my review of that provision, it does not provide for circumstances such as these.59 I accept that the appellant did not drive from the date of the offence, and that even though a stay was in operation as a result of the lodgement of this appeal, initially against sentence only, he was unable to obtain the issue of a licence in New South Wales. This was so notwithstanding that he had paid the fines owing in the Northern Territory, and the licence suspension to which he was subject there has expired. 60 The appellant gave evidence today confirming that all of the outstanding fines were paid by 17 January 2009. I am told the records of both jurisdictions were flagged against the grant of a licence in light of the proceedings with which the court is now concerned. I am told that the appellant’s impecuniosity has precluded his pursuit of a remedy in the nature of prerogative relief against the failure of the relevant agency of government to allow him his licence.61 The appellant was born on 8 August 1967. He is now forty-two years of age. He has no criminal antecedents in New South Wales other than for this offence and for an offence of drive with a middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol committed in December 2004. In South Australia however, he has been fined and disqualified for offences of driving with excess alcohol and speeding and driving dangerously. He also has convictions for larceny and was dealt with for possessing cannabis and an offensive weapon, and interfering with a motor vehicle, as a juvenile, without suffering a conviction. These offences commenced in 1984 and concluded in 1989. 62 In the Northern Territory he has convictions for driving a vehicle that was unregistered and uninsured and driving without a licence in October 2007. His most recent offence before then was in 1996 for being an unlicensed driver, and extending back to 1993 he has a record of offences of aggravated unlawful entry, stealing, using morphine, possession of cannabis, breaching bail, driving whilst disqualified, and driving whilst disqualified in another State.63 His antecedents do not justify leniency reducing what would otherwise be the appropriate penalty assessed against the objective gravity of the offending. This said, I am persuaded by his evidence today that he has gone beyond what was a turning point in his life. He has relocated to Goulburn with his partner so that she might care for her grandmother, and he is looking to start afresh and follow a course in which he will be gainfully employed, will provide for his family, and not bring himself under notice. 64 Turning to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offending and the punishment that should be imposed at this point in the proceedings, I bring to account the burden that the appellant has already faced in the loss of his licence and his evidence that he has not driven since 7 January 2009, which I accept.65 It is also appropriate in my opinion to bring to account the policy considerations that led to the reduction of the statutory period of disqualification to which persons suspended for driving for fine default have been exposed since March 2009, when the relevant legislation was amended. The disqualification that now applies to a first offence of driving whilst suspended as a result of a fine default is found in the amended s 25A(10)(a1) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act, wherein the period specified is three months in lieu of the twelve months that applied before. If there is a second or subsequent offence however, the period increases to two years and applies regardless of the reason for the suspension.66 I have already referred to that development in the law in my judgment upon the appeal from conviction. I have referred in some detail to the second reading speech delivered by the Attorney General when presenting the bill introducing those amendments. The speech was delivered in November 2008 when the policy of government was clearly to recognise the difference in culpability between those suspended as fine defaulters and those suspended for unsafe driving offences. It is appropriate in my opinion to bring to account those matters and I do so. It was submitted that the court could resort to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as the appropriate outcome in this case, and might discharge the appellant conditional upon him entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for twelve months, in light of the appellant having being denied access to his licence since 7 January 2009 and that he has refrained from driving since, for a period of a little more than seven months.67 I am of the view that there is merit in this approach and I will take that course. Before I make my final orders however I would like to add these additional comments.68 I would like to refer to the point discovered by Mr McGrath when he first pursued the application for leave to appeal from the conviction under the mistaken view that s 25A of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act in its present form applied to this matter. The resolution of this question was not necessary for the determination of the conviction appeal, for this most recent form of the legislation did not apply at the time the appellant was detected driving. Section 25A of this Act relevantly provides,  
     
      
       
      (2) A person whose driver licence is suspended (otherwise than under section 66 of the Fines Act 1996) must not:  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) drive on a road or road related area a motor vehicle of the class to which the suspended driver licence relates, or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      … 
      
     
     
      
      Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence). 
      
     
     
      
      … 
       
       
      (3A) A person whose driver licence is suspended or cancelled under section 66 of the Fines Act 1996 must not:  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) in the case of a suspended licence:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (i) drive on a road or road related area a motor vehicle of the class to which the suspended driver licence relates, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
      … 
       
       
      Maximum penalty: 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence). 
      
     
     
      
      (3B) In determining any penalty or period of disqualification to be imposed on a person for an offence under subsection (3A), a court must take into account the effect the penalty or period of disqualification will have on the person’s employment and the person’s ability to pay the outstanding fine that caused the person’s driver licence to be suspended or cancelled. 
       
       
      ... 
       
       
      (9) Subsections (1)–(3) apply to a person who is disqualified from holding a licence, or whose licence is suspended or cancelled, by a court in Australia or under any law in this State or another State or Territory. 
      
    69 Section 66 of the Fines Act provides for the suspension of a driver licence of a fine defaulter against whom the Roads and Traffic Authority is then required to take enforcement action. The section mandates that the Roads and Traffic Authority must suspend the driver licence even if the State Debt Recovery Office has granted an extension of time for the payment of the fine or allowed the fine defaulter to pay the fine by instalments after requiring the Roads and Traffic Authority to take enforcement action. I have read the entirety of s 66; no part of the section captures fine defaulters from jurisdictions within the Commonwealth of Australia beyond New South Wales. 70 The point initially argued by Mr McGrath was that on its face, this legislative scheme provided for only two classes of drivers whose licences were suspended. Those suspended under s 66 of the Fines Act and those suspended otherwise than under that provision. There was no other offence of driving whilst suspended, thus, if a motorist was suspended because of fine default in another jurisdiction within the Commonwealth of Australia, he would be dealt with as a person whose licence was suspended otherwise than under s 66 of the Fines Act (1996), and it would follow that notwithstanding that the person was a mere fine defaulter, albeit from another jurisdiction, he or she would be exposed to the more serious penalties in the form of the disqualification period. This was one of the difficulties with the earlier legislation identified in the second reading speech of the Attorney General to which I have referred. 71 It was submitted by Mr McGrath that although the retention of s 25A(9) in the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act allowed for the interstate motorists to be dealt with as a suspended driver, as if the suspension was a secondary offence to unsafe driving rather than mere fine default, this was unfair, contrary to principals of constitutional law relevant to the Commonwealth of Australia as a federation, and was discriminatory, particularly on the major interstate arterial roads connecting the major centres of the States and territories. Mr McGrath ultimately submitted that this could not have been the intention of Parliament, and that accordingly, if the appellant were detected in identical circumstances after the enactment of the amending legislation, upon its proper construction he would not be caught by any provision for driving whilst suspended in New South Wales.72 I have not conducted any more detailed research of the legislation under this scheme to test these arguments or the authorities relevant to the suggested discriminatory impact of the legislation upon fine defaulters from beyond New South Wales who might otherwise be as deserving of the moderation now available to those within New South Wales. Because it is not necessary for the decisions required of me to do so, I do not intend to comment further upon these various matters other than to observe that if Mr McGrath is correct, it would seem that there ought to be some further consideration of the legislation to address the circumstances of drivers from outside of New South Wales who are mere fine defaulters whose licences have been suspended, to fill what might well be an hiatus that has gone undetected in the amended legislation.73 I shall allow the appeal from sentence. I set aside the conviction and the fine and order for costs, and the order for disqualification. In lieu thereof, I discharge the appellant pursuant to s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, conditional upon him entering a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of twelve months from today. The conditions of the bond are that he be of good behaviour, that he appear before court if called upon to do so, that he continue to reside at [omitted]; if it is his intention to leave those premises for another domicile at any time during the currency of the bond, he is to give written notice thereof to the registrar of this court together with the particulars of the address to which he is intending to move. I will leave the papers on the court file lest there be some breach that I will have to deal with in the future.

      2008/16863001 – REGINA v S E 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
      Nature of Proceedings 
       
      The accused is indicted on a charge of murdering JE on 25 March 2008 and of wounding LE with intent to murder on that same date. Pursuant to s 132(1) of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986 the accused elected to be tried by Judge alone in relation to those charges. 
       
      
    2 Upon arraignment the accused pleaded not guilty to both charges.  
     
      
    3 The charges arise from an attack by the accused on his parents on the morning of 25 March 2008. The accused was aged 16 years and 9 months at the time. The deceased JE was the accused’s father and LE, the victim of the wound with intent to murder charge, was the accused’s mother. The accused used a 35 cm kitchen knife to inflict the injuries. 
     
      
    4 There was no dispute about the facts. By consent statements, photographs and documents prepared and written by the accused were placed before me. 
     
      
    5 The basis for the accused’s plea of not guilty is mental illness under s 38 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) or as an alternative, substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind under s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Accordingly the real issue litigated has been the mental condition of the accused at the time of the attacks. 
     
      
    6 Because of the agreement as to the facts, the trial lasted only three days. The oral evidence comprised that of LE, police officers that had attended the premises and two psychiatrists, Dr Allnutt called on behalf of the Crown, and Dr Neilssen called on behalf of the accused. 
     
      
       
      Factual Background 
       
      
    7 I find that the following facts have been established beyond a reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    8 The accused was born on 8 June 1991. He was the son of JE and LE. He was the only child of the marriage. JE had two other children from an earlier marriage. The family lived in a two-storey house in Baulkham Hills. At the time of these incidents, the accused was attending Oak Hill Catholic College in Year 11. 
     
      
    9 On normal weekdays the family routine was that LE would rise at 6am, shower and get dressed before waking the accused for school. The bedrooms were located in the upper storey of the house. She would then go downstairs and make things ready for the day including getting breakfast for JE and the accused. At 6.30am she would make sure that the accused was up and ready for school. At about 7.15am she would drive the accused to his bus stop where he would catch a bus to school. LE would continue to her place of work. 
     
      
    10 So far as his parents were concerned, the accused appeared to be performing well at high school. He had done well academically in Years 7 and 8, but in Year 9 his grades dropped to an average of B’s and C’s. In Year 10 his performance improved and he did well in the School Certificate examinations. 
     
      
    11 Statements by his classmates make it clear that he was something of a loner and had no close friends, either male or female. Some of them described him as being “different” and “weird”. From about Year 9 the accused changed his appearance by growing his hair longer and parting it in the middle. He often used to talk about death, killing and violence. In Year 9 the accused started calling himself “Nine (9)”. He had written this on his knuckles and on his school bag and would on occasions talk about himself in the third person referring to himself as “Nine (9)”. This number was apparently associated with the concepts of finality and judgment. 
     
      
    12 During Years 8 and 9 the accused underwent some bullying at school. That bullying did not take the form of physical abuse but was restricted to name-calling. The name-calling was directed at the accused’s size (he is of small build), his hairstyle and the fact that he called himself “Nine (9)”. There was a rumour amongst the students during Year 10 that the accused had prepared a “Kill List”. This list was based on the movie “Kill Bill” where the lead character had a “Kill List” for people who had treated her badly and whom she wished to punish. The accused was teased by other students about his “Kill List”. 
     
      
    13 The accused was very interested in heavy metal music. His favourite band was “Slipknot”. The lyrics of this group focus on death and hopelessness. This disturbed his parents, particularly his mother, who found the lyrics very depressing and dark. Similar observations were made by his fellow students. They said that not only did he speak frequently about death and violence but that he enjoyed playing violent computer games which involved different ways of killing people. His fellow students said that he loved movies with death and violence in them. 
     
      
    14 To adults the accused appeared quiet and withdrawn. This was the observation of family members when he attended family gatherings with his parents. He did not display any aggression on these occasions and often played with his younger relatives.  
     
      
    15 Neither of his parents disciplined the accused by physically punishing him. If the accused did something wrong, it was dealt with by a loss of privilege or through negotiation. 
     
      
    16 LE recalled an occasion in late 2007 when the accused had been given an assignment from school for Religious Studies. The assignment related to stem cell research and the moral issues attached to this type of research. When LE was discussing the assignment with the accused, she disclosed to him that she had previously had a miscarriage. She and the accused talked about the miscarriage at length. At the conclusion of the discussion LE thought that the accused understood what had happened and had no difficulty in dealing with it. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    17 In the two years leading up to these incidents, the relationship between the accused and JE had broken down. JE would frequently speak roughly and aggressively to him. JE never used physical violence. On one occasion when JE heard the accused use the word “f –“ in front of LE, he said to the accused “Don’t you ever swear and say f – again or I will knock the f - ing head off you”. The way JE spoke to the accused troubled LE and led to arguments between them about that subject. LE thought that there had been an improvement in the relationship between the accused and JE in the early months of 2008.  
     
      
    18 On the day before the attack, LE found two bibles torn up in a waste paper bin when she was cleaning the accused’s room. When she asked why he had ripped up the bibles, the accused responded “I don’t need them any more”. LE described the accused as then having a “total shutdown” and refusing to communicate further. LE told the accused that if he would not talk to her, he would have to tell a psychologist what happened and then the psychologist would tell her. 
     
      
    19 The attack took place on the morning of Tuesday 25 March 2008. This was the Tuesday following the Easter holiday period. It was a day on which the accused would normally have attended school. 
     
      
    20 On this morning LE woke the accused at 6.15am. She told him that she would be back at 6.30am to get him up for school. At about 6.30am the accused came into the kitchen in his school uniform. At the time LE was making his lunch for school. The accused asked if Bella was in the house (Bella was the family cat). LE said she did not know and went to a window to look out. 
     
      
    21 As LE pulled back the curtain she saw reflected in the glass the accused approaching her from behind holding a knife in his hand. The accused stabbed LE on a number of occasions and she screamed. The accused kept mumbling the word “afterlife” as he was attacking LE. LE continued to scream. Subsequent medical examination showed that she had been stabbed five times. She suffered a stab wound to the left side of her head and neck, to the left side of the chest at the back, to the front of the chest, to the right side of the stomach and to the front of her left thigh. 
     
      
    22 Her screams caused JE to come downstairs from their bedroom. He was wearing only a shirt at the time. The accused then attacked JE with the knife. LE, who was lying on the kitchen floor, did not see the attack but she heard JE pleading with the accused to put down the knife. Subsequent medical examination showed that JE had received three stab wounds. He had been stabbed on the right side of the neck, in the chest and in the stomach. It was the stab wound to the chest which caused death. 
     
      
    23 LE said that the voice of the accused was not his normal voice. She said “He was different, he was different, I just know that he acted different, he sounded different. He was strange. I don’t know, I don’t understand.” In her evidence at trial LE said about this occasion: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You also said that his voice appeared different? 
         
        A. Yes it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did it appear different? 
         
        A. It was very deep. It shocked me because it was really throaty and really, really deep and I couldn’t understand how such a deep voice could come out of him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You had never heard anything like that from S before? 
         
        A. Never, never. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You also said in your taped interview that he acted different? Obviously stabbing someone is a very different thing to do but that is not what you meant, was it? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was he doing that was different from the S you had known up to that point? 
         
        A. It just wasn’t him. He was, oh, I don’t know. It wasn’t him. When he came down he was, he just asked me about Bella and then he changed. I don’t know, I don’t know. It just, it wasn’t him.” (T.50.4) 
        
       
      
    24 Somehow LE gained access to a mobile phone. She was able to dial OOO and advise what was happening. At some point, which is not clear, the accused knocked the mobile phone out of LE’s hand. LE said to the accused that if he wished to get away he should go to school. This apparently caused the accused to go upstairs to change his shirt which was covered in blood. 
     
      
    25 The police arrived at about the same time as the accused came downstairs after changing his shirt. They arrived at 7.09am. An ambulance was present but its personnel did not try to enter the premises until given clearance by the police. 
     
      
    26 Senior Constable Evans saw the accused bent over behind the front door. He identified himself as a police officer and asked what was going on. The following exchange then took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “ACCUSED: Oh f…, what do you want? 
         
        EVANS: Mate I’m just seeing if everything’s all right. 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: No everything’s not all right f… off. 
         
        EVANS: Hey bloke what’s happening, I can’t really hear you very well can you open up the door for me? 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: I can’t it’s locked. 
         
        EVANS: Mate is there any way you can come out and see me, I just want to make sure you’re Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        ACCUSED: Hang on I’ll come out through the garage”. 
        
       
      
    27 Shortly thereafter the accused emerged from the garage. He was wearing a school uniform consisting of a short-sleeved light blue shirt with the school logo on it, grey long pants and black leather shoes. The accused walked towards police officers, who were standing in front of the house. When police officers grabbed him by either arm, the accused became violent and resisted but then calmed down and sat on the ground as directed. After he sat down, the following conversation took place between him and Senior Constable Evans: 
     
      
       
        
        “EVANS: So what’s happened mate? 
         
        ACCUSED: I’ve just murdered my parents. 
        
       
       
        
        EVANS: What’s your name? 
         
        ACCUSED: Why is that important?  
        
       
       
        
        EVANS: Mate I just want to know who you are.” 
        
       
      
    28 While the accused was in that position he was asked where the knife was. He identified his school bag from which police removed a kitchen knife, approximately 35 cm in length, with a 23 cm blade. The knife appeared to have been washed. It came from a knife block in the kitchen. 
     
      
    29 The evidence of the police officers who were at the premises when the accused was arrested was that he had been very angry when he learned of their presence and when he was physically restrained. The evidence of Senior Constable Evans was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. It is then that you asked him what happened and he told you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That he murdered his parents? 
         
        A. (Witness nodded) 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How was his voice at that stage? 
         
        A. One of quite, quite surprising. I asked him, “What happened this morning?” He, its almost, his demeanour, he shrugged it off “just murdered my parents”. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Calm, quiet? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As if nothing out of the ordinary had happened? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, yeah, he was quite compliant at the house after that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That continued after you told him he was under arrest? 
         
        A. Well, when I said that, I said “You’re under arrest for what happened this morning” he made a remark, which I, was quite surprising, just said “Jesus Christ”, like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. One of mild annoyance? 
         
        A. Yeah, quite an inconvenience.” (T.42.14) 
        
       
      
    30 After the accused was taken into custody, police examined the contents of his school bag and removed a number of documents which had been prepared by him. Some of these documents had been prepared on his computer and others were handwritten. The computer-generated documents appear to predate the handwritten ones. The computer generated documents had headings such as “Oneself with Satanism (10th Feb 2008)”, “Will”, “5455” and “Contenplation”. Behind the “5455” document there was a diagram of the human skull and an anatomical depiction of the human neck. Apparently the numbers “5455” on a digital telephone spell the word K-I-L-L. 
     
      
    31 The “5455” document lists as “people to kill’ the accused’s parents, two school friends A and M, and himself. The document sets out in some detail how the accused planned to kill those persons and lastly take his own life. 
     
      
    32 The document “Oneself with Satanism (10th Feb 2008)” contains a somewhat rambling statement of the accused’s belief system. It seeks to explain why he had rejected God and why he had embraced Satanism. The accused appears to blame God for his mother’s miscarriage and the loss to him of a brother. The accused appears to believe that if he committed suicide he would go to his own “Heretic Afterlife” which he would control. He sets out the reasons for killing another schoolboy, M, so that he could capture that boy’s soul and they could spend time together in his special afterlife. It is of significance that M was a mere acquaintance at school and not a close friend. 
     
      
    33 The document entitled “Will” sets out directions for the accused’s funeral, specifically that he was not to be buried as a Christian. 
     
      
    34 The document “Contenplation” sets out why the accused decided to abandon his plan to kill the other schoolboy, A. The document sets out reasons why the plan proposed in document “5455” would not work.  
     
      
    35 The handwritten document headed “Do Note” contains further musings about why it was important to kill M. That document concludes with the word “DONE”. The other handwritten document entitled “CHEMISTRY” refers to the documents entitled “Oneself with Satanism” and “5455”. It contains further musings about the accused’s personal beliefs and why M and others have to be killed so that those beliefs can be brought to fruition in the accused’s special afterlife. Implicit in this document and the earlier documents is the accused’s belief that by being in control of his own afterlife he has overcome the problems normally associated with suicide.  
     
      
    36 I have concluded that it was the accused’s intention on 25 March 2008 to leave the family home, go to school and kill M and then kill himself so as to make a reality of the plans and theories contained in these documents. It seems clear that the accused intended these documents to be found in his school bag after he had committed suicide. 
     
      
    37 The police also took possession of the accused’s mobile phone. They subsequently discovered a voice recording in an audio file on that phone. It was entitled “Thoughts of Inner”. The audio file refers to document “5455” and explains that he had intended to kill JE on 20 March but was forced to change his plans because JE got up earlier than usual and the accused felt “orthodox”. The audio file is remarkable for the rage and hatred which the accused apparently felt for JE. 
     
      
    38 The police also found a considerable quantity of documents in the bottom drawer of the bedside cabinet in the accused’s bedroom. Included in these documents was an exercise book which appears to contain entries made between 2006 and the end of 2007. While the entries are not in chronological order and particularly coherent, they demonstrate the development of the accused’s belief system, in particular his rejection of God and his increasing interest in Satanism. The other documents found in that drawer include illustrations of persons being violently stabbed and many references to the concept of death being a ticket to freedom. One document seems to be a song or a poem with the heading “My Regards – My Suicide Note”. 
     
      
    39 Even to the layperson, these writings and musings by the accused show bizarre and disordered patterns of thought. This is particularly so of those documents found in the accused’s schoolbag which were created by him in the weeks leading up to the attack. 
     
      
       
      Psychiatric/psychological evidence 
       
      
    40 The Court had the assistance of psychiatric and psychological evidence. The Crown relied upon a report of Dr Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, dated 29 May 2009. Doctor Allnutt gave evidence in the trial. The accused relied upon two reports of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 16 September 2008 and 6 March 2009. Doctor Nielssen gave evidence. The accused also relied upon two reports from Peter Champion, consulting clinical psychologist, dated 23 September and 7 December 2008. Mr Champion did not give evidence. 
     
      
    41 Mr Champion interviewed the accused on 2 September 2008 for three hours and on 10 November 2008 for two and a half hours. He took a history of the accused hearing voices on a number of occasions, sometimes the voices were external and sometimes the voices were internal. The accused told Mr Champion how over a period of time he transitioned from Christianity through a period as a “heretic” and unorthodox believer to his current stage of being a Satanist. He confirmed his intentions on the day of the attack to kill the school boy, M, and then kill himself with a view to M becoming his “brother” in the afterlife to replace the child who was lost when his mother had her miscarriage. He told Mr Champion that he had difficulties in coping with the idea that he had a sibling who was not carried to term and that this had troubled him a great deal. 
     
      
    42 Mr Champion concluded that the accused had an excessive interest in violence in the form of movies and computer games. The accused told him that the sort of attacks with which he had been charged could be justified in the right circumstances. The accused told Mr Champion about his love of heavy/thrash/death “metal” music from groups such as Slipknot. The accused said that he felt the philosophies in the music resonated with him. 
     
      
    43 Mr Champion set out his conclusions as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the basis of the account elicited from the accused on the two occasions I saw him, I think it likely that the accused was in fact substantially impaired by an abnormality of the mind (hallucinations and delusional thought inter alia being reported) which impacted on his ability to understand events, to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and to control himself, were substantially impaired by an abnormality of the mind arising from an underlying condition (in all likelihood psychosis).  
        
       
       
        
        I have been asked if the accused was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the alleged offences within the meaning of the McNaughten Rules. If I can assume the accuracy of the accused’s report which suggested the presence of hallucinations and delusions at or about the time of the alleged offences, noting also the contents of the various documents and materials seized by the police; and if I can assume the accuracy of the account of the incidents which led to him being charged insofar as the alleged offences were planned as part of a process to take himself (and another) into the afterlife to live with Satan or potentially to be some form of God, such that while accepting by societal standards (that is standards other than his own) that his actions were wrong, he still felt them justified; then I think this raises the defence of mental illness as one which needs to be considered …” 
        
       
       
      It was Mr Champion’s belief that the accused’s presentation was consistent with him suffering from an early stage of psychosis in the form of schizophrenia.  
       
      
    44 Doctor Nielssen took a similar history from the accused as that recorded by Mr Champion. The accused said that he had become very depressed because of the constant bullying by his father. When asked if he thought Satan was involved in the assault on his parents the accused said “He had an influence on me … I felt suicidal … He really twisted my mind … it was like the goat was there … destructive animal trying to get at me.” The accused told Dr Nielssen that by killing M he believed that they would be “brothers” in the afterlife. 
     
      
    45 In his report Dr Nielssen expressed his conclusion as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, the accused committed the offences during a brief psychotic episode in which he held the delusional belief that he was compelled to follow Satan and that the main person on his “kill list”, a person he saw on the bus to school but whom he hardly knew, would be his brother in the afterlife.  
        
       
       
        
        Hence I believe the accused has the defence of mental illness open to him to the charges of the murder of his father and the attempted murder of his mother. He has a disease of the mind in the form of an emerging schizophrenic illness resulting in a defect of reason in the form of bizarre religiose belief. At the time of the offences his delusional belief deprived him of the awareness that his actions were morally wrong. Moreover, the disorganised thinking and gross disturbance of emotional regulation that accompanies acute psychosis prevented him from reasoning with sense and composure about the consequences of his actions.” 
        
       
      
    46 In his evidence at trial, Dr Nielssen said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Has your view got stronger as you have been provided with more details, more documents?  
         
        A. Yes, it is clear in the opinion, the evolving opinion, in the two reports I think all of us have had difficulty, including Professor Greenberg, extracting the rationale for Mr E's behaviour, but as additional corroborative materials become available and with the benefit of then taking that back to Mr E and asking him about it, it has become clear that he is affected by these fixed delusional beliefs.  
         
         
        Q. Would you agree those fixed delusional beliefs meant he was unable to appreciate the moral wrongness of what he was doing so far as his father or mother were concerned?  
         
        A. Yes, that's my opinion, yes.” (T.74.1) 
        
       
      
    47 Under cross-examination Dr Nielssen said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. He knew it was legally wrong and he knew other people would think it was wrong?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Yet you are still of the view that he himself did not know it was wrong?  
         
        A. Yes, from his standpoint with his belief system operating within the way he viewed the world he didn't believe it was wrong, according to his view of the world. “ (T.76.28) 
         
        
       
      
    48 Doctor Allnutt saw the accused on 27 April and 18 May 2009. He complained about his father to Dr Allnutt as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “His father was in the accused’s view, overly emotional, unreasonably resisting him doing things his way, pushed things on him and if he did not do them his father would threaten to physically assault him. He suppressed his own thoughts and feelings about this and “bottled them up inside”;” 
        
       
      
    49 The accused described to Dr Allnutt how he felt on the day of the attack as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the day of the alleged offence he woke up, he went downstairs after getting dressed; he had many thoughts about what would happen in the “afterlife”; he also had thoughts about the transition from this life to another afterlife; he had thoughts about what he was going to do when he left the house; his plan was to go to school as usual, get off the bus with M, take him to a secluded place and kill himself and M (by cutting his veins in his neck and himself and when they died their blood would mix and he and M would then go to his afterlife); at the time he said he felt certain that this would happen.” 
        
       
      
    50 Doctor Allnutt thought that there were reasonable grounds to conclude that the accused suffered from a psychotic illness. Doctor Allnutt’s conclusion on this issue was: 
     
      
       
        
        “His state of mind at the material time of the alleged offence was consistent with psychosis which is a mental condition that manifests as a defective reasoning process; psychosis interferes with a person’s ability to make rational appraisals of their environment because it interferes with their ability to identify an error in their judgment and correct this and as a consequence individuals with psychosis could manifest with a “defect of reason” and “substantial impairment” in mental reasoning.” 
        
       
      
    51 The conclusion arrived at by Dr Allnutt in his report was expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Overall, however, on balance, I am of the view that he was impaired in his capacity to judge right from wrong and he would have been compromised in his capacity to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense or composure.” 
        
       
      
    52 In his evidence at trial Dr Allnutt was asked to explain what he meant by that conclusion. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What do you mean by compromise there? 
         
        A. What I mean is that, there was an impairment in that ability to some degree. I used the broad term and I meant by that compromised in broad terms. I chose my words there. I used the word impairment when I dealt, impaired when I dealt with capacity to judge right from wrong because that is the word that is used in the legal definition of substantial impairment, and right from wrong is the wording that the, that the text of that, the definition of substantial impairment utilises and I was referring to impairment in capacity to judge right from wrong there.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        And I used the word compromise because I was trying to illustrate a different defence, that is the insanity defence. For me, part of the difficulty in this case is the degree of incapacity so I used a broad term that there was a problem in his capacity and I put it in broadly, there was some problem. The degree, I've left open.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you do that?  
         
        A. When I wrote the report I was struggling with coming to some conclusion about the degree of incapacity. Whether he was compromised to some degree or incapable of reasoning, which is the test for insanity.  
         
         
        For me the difficulty with this case is, for me in my assessment of this case, my difficulty is putting him in one box or the other. That is, that he was so compromised that he was incapable of reasoning about the matter of wrongfulness versus that he wasn't so compromised that he was incapable but he was impaired or substantially impaired in his capacity to judge right from wrong. 
         
         
        ….” (T.55.44) 
        
       
      
    53 Under cross-examination Dr Allnutt said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. His attempts at the time to rationalise or subsequently, we also have his musings beforehand, so his rationalisation for what he was doing at the time, both pre and after, were linked to his psychosis, do you accept that?  
         
        A. I would say I accept that on this basis that I think that his perception of his father's abuse is out of keeping with what is described. So he has an irrational, he has interpreted that irrationally and in an exaggerated manner which caused him extreme anger and on that basis I would say that, that probably had something to do, had a lot to do with his psychosis, so on that basis I would agree, yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the same if you went so far as to say had a lot to do with his psychosis. That illness meant he was not reasoning about the wrongness of his actions in the way that ordinary people would?  
         
        A. Look, on balance if I was asked to fall on one side of the fence or other I would fall on the side of the incapable of reasoning about the matter of wrongfulness.  
         
         
        Q. Therefore incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his actions on balance?  
         
        A. On balance, correct.” (T.63.43) 
        
       
      
    54 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had an intention to kill JE and that JE died as a result of a wound inflicted during the attack upon him and that subject to issues concerning mental responsibility, the culpability of the accused for the crime of murder has been established. Similarly, I am satisfied to the necessary standard that the accused had an intention to kill LE when he wounded her and that subject to the issue of mental responsibility, the culpability of the accused for the crime of attempted murder of LE, has been established. I note that these matters were expressly conceded by senior counsel for the accused. 
     
      
    55 As previously indicated the real issue before the Court is whether the accused was suffering from mental illness, as that term is understood in s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 when the attacks occurred. 
     
      
    56 The onus borne by the accused on this issue is stated in The King v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 184 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the jury turned from the consideration of the question whether the things which constitute the crime were done to the question whether the man who did them was criminally responsible for his actions or was not, because of unsoundness of mind at the moment, it is necessary for the accused’s person to make out positively, upon a balance of probability, that he was not criminally responsible, and that he was not of such a mental condition at that time as to be criminally responsible. He has not got to remove all doubt from your minds. He, or rather his counsel, has merely to make appear to you as more probable on the whole that that was the state of his mind at the time he did the things charged, than otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    57 The classic statement of principle is contained in R v McNaughten [1843] 8 E. R. 718 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “To establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as to not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.” 
        
       
      
    58 What that statement of principle makes clear is that the relevant time at which the accused’s state of mind is to be assessed is at the time of the attacks. That is not to say, however, that his actions before and after cannot be considered to determine his state of mind at the relevant time. Not surprisingly, the accused has been able to offer little useful evidence as to what he was thinking at that time but his writings and statements shortly before and his statements to the psychiatrists and psychologist afterwards are important to assess his state of mind at the relevant time. In this case they provide the best evidence of that state of mind. 
     
      
    59 The McNaughten statement of principle requires that at the time of committing the act, the accused was labouring under a defect of reason from a disease of the mind. The evidence on that issue is all one way. The psychiatrists and the psychologist have concluded that at the time of the attacks the accused was suffering from a form of psychosis, probably schizophrenia. As defined by Dr Allnutt, such a psychosis clearly satisfies the requirement for the defect of reason being due to a disease of the mind. 
     
      
    60 In this case it is not suggested, on behalf of the accused, that he did not know the nature and quality of the acts he was doing. It is accepted that he intended to kill his parents and that he understood what this involved. 
     
      
    61 The issue in this case is whether, on the balance of probabilities, the accused has established that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. 
     
      
    62 This concept was explained on a number of occasions in Porter as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other head is of quite a different character, namely, that his disease or disorder or disturbance of mind was of such a character that he was unable to appreciate that the act he was doing was wrong. It is supposed that he knew he was killing, knew how he was killing and knew why he was killing but that he was quite incapable of appreciating the wrongness of the act. … You are dealing with a very different thing – with the understanding. It does mean that the functions of the understanding are through some cause, whether understandable or not, thrown into derangement or disorder. Then I have used the expression “know”, “knew that what he was doing was wrong”. We are dealing with one particular thing, the act of killing, the act of killing at a particular time a particular individual. We are not dealing with right or wrong in the abstract. The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people would make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by “wrong”? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people … In conclusion I go back to what I consider the main question of the case and it is whether you are of the opinion that at the stage of [attacking his parents] the man whom you are trying had such a mental disorder or diseased intelligence at that moment that he was disabled from knowing that it was a wrong act to commit in the sense that ordinary reasonable men understand right and wrong and that he was disabled from considering with some degree of composure and reason what he was doing and its wrongness.” (P 189-190) 
        
       
      
    63 I have concluded that the accused has established, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time when he attacked his parents, he had such a mental disorder or diseased intelligence that he was disabled from knowing that it was a wrong act to commit in the sense that ordinary reasonable persons understand right and wrong. 
     
      
    64 It is true that the accused knew that what he was doing was against the law. This, however, is not decisive. As the psychiatrists and the psychologist pointed out in their reports, despite that knowledge the accused apparently disassociated himself from what normal people would regard as rightness and wrongness and considered that his actions were justified. 
     
      
    65 The evidence of the psychiatrists and the psychologist support this proposition. Whereas Dr Allnutt was somewhat equivocal in his report, in his evidence at trial he reached the conclusion which I have set out at [54]. In answer to a question which I put to him concerning the audio file on the accused’s mobile telephone, Dr Allnutt said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The rage raised questions for me is this, was that rage that of a young man angry with his parents or was that somebody who was angry because for delusional reasons and the intent, the intent arises out of both emotions. So it never really altered my view substantially. I still sat in the same position after listening to the tape.  
         
         
        What I did get was a strong sense of, I did feel he felt strongly justified, but it didn't solve the question for me entirely but on balance I would fall on the side that I have just described. “ (T.64.32) 
        
       
       
      Conclusion and orders 
       
      
    66 What I have to decide as the tribunal of fact is whether the contribution of the accused’s delusions and disordered patterns of thought, sourced from his underlying psychotic condition, is such that his capacity at the time of the attack to judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to exercise control was so substantially impaired as to warrant a verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. I am satisfied that the accused was so impaired in his capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong. Accordingly he must be found not guilty of the offences with which he has been charged by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
    67 As was pointed out in submissions, a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness means only that legally the accused is not to blame for his actions nor to be punished for his actions. It does not mean, however, that the accused’s present detention ends. Section 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 provides that the Court can order that the accused be detained unless released by due process of law. That due process means that the accused will come under the direct supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. The accused cannot be released conditionally or otherwise until that Tribunal headed by a judge or former judge of this Court allows. The Tribunal will only allow it when and if it is satisfied that neither the accused nor the community are in any way at risk. That is the course which I propose to follow. 
     
      
    68 In conclusion, I wish to extend the sympathy of the Court to the relatives of the victims, particularly the accused’s mother. The events of the morning of 25 March 2008 were tragic and entirely unexpected. Outwardly the accused was no different to many boys of his age and background. The signs of his developing psychosis were simply not obvious. No one, his school, the church, or particularly the accused’s mother, should hold themselves responsible for what occurred. 
     
      
    69 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      In relation to both counts 1 and 2 on the indictment. 
       
       
      (1) I find that the accused is not guilty by reason of mental illness. In accordance with s 39 of the  
      Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 
       1990 I order that SE, formerly referred to in this judgment as the accused, be detained at the Frank Baxter Juvenile Justice Centre. 
       
       
      (2) I direct that the Registrar of this Court notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of this order (s 39(3)  
      Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) 
        
      Act 
       1990).

    3 JOHNSON J: By application filed on 19 May 2009, the Applicant, Lesley Phillis Edwards, seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Taylor at the Sydney District Court on 6 October 2006. In addition, the Applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Hosking SC at that Court on 18 December 2008. 
     
      
       
      The Sentencing Decisions 
       
      
    4 The two sentencing decisions are interrelated. His Honour Judge Taylor sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of 15 months following her plea of guilty to a charge of stealing from the person under s.94 Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is 14 years’ imprisonment. His Honour suspended the sentence under s.12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 upon the Applicant entering into a good behaviour bond for 15 months.  
     
      
    5 The Applicant breached the good behaviour bond by the commission of further offences and a failure to maintain contact with the Probation and Parole Service. She was called up for breach of the bond and, on 18 December 2008, his Honour Judge Hosking SC directed the Applicant to serve the sentence imposed by Judge Taylor, which was backdated to 20 August 2008. The Applicant is eligible for release on parole on 19 November 2009. 
     
      
       
      Extension of Time 
       
      
    6 The application for extension of time was filed some two years and seven months after sentence was imposed on 6 October 2006. The principal challenge on this application relates to that sentence. 
     
      
    7 The Crown opposes an extension of time to challenge the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Taylor.  
     
      
    8 The Court has a discretion with respect to extension of time under s.10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In exercising that discretion, the Court has regard to the prospects of success on the application for leave to appeal itself: R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [30]ff. The Court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed, especially if the delay is considerable: R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA 201 at [17]. 
     
      
    9 In R v Graham (2004) 62 NSWLR 252 at 258-259 [29], this Court observed that it was understandable that application for leave to appeal against sentence would be made out of time where the sentencing Court had proceeded originally by way of suspended sentence. It was said that the “full implication of such a sentence might not have come home to such a person until faced with the reality of gaol” and that this was so despite the fact that the sentencing judge, at the time of suspending the sentence, is required to inform the offender of the consequences of a breach. Notwithstanding the delay in giving notice in that case, an extension of time was granted to seek leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    10 I agree that this practical reality exists where sentence is suspended and a bond entered. The offender does not face an immediate custodial sentence. Where conditional liberty is breached thereafter by commission of further offences, or non-compliance with a condition of a bond, imprisonment then results and the offender may then consider whether there is some basis for challenging the original sentence. Recognition of this practical reality, however, does not mean that this Court should freely accept a type of two-stage approach, where an appeal will be accepted readily long after imposition of the original sentence.  
     
      
    11 Nor should this Court encourage a view that an offender’s legal representative may take a minimalist position at the original sentencing hearing, saying no more than is required to obtain a suspended sentence. It is the duty of counsel appearing for an offender at a sentencing hearing to assist the Court by making relevant submissions at that time on issues of fact and law. A sentencing court is entitled to expect assistance from counsel, in discharge of counsel’s duty to the court and the client, with respect to relevant issues, including the facts to be found on sentence, the objective seriousness of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the offender, the capacity of the offence to be dealt with summarily in the Local Court and the length of any sentence of imprisonment which may be imposed but suspended. The public interest is served by counsel discharging his or her duty to the Court and the client: Giannarelli v Wraith [1988] 165 CLR 543 at 555-556. 
     
      
    12 This duty applies equally when counsel urges the Court to proceed by way of suspended sentence and bond. It is not appropriate to approach the original sentencing hearing upon the basis that, if things do not work out and the offender breaches the bond, then arguments may be ventilated, for the first time on appeal to this Court, long after the original sentencing hearing, asserting error on the part of the sentencing Judge. This Court must be careful lest it be thought that a two-staged approach to sentence on the part of offenders and their counsel will be accepted, whereby possible appeal points may be held in reserve, only to be activated if the offender breaches the conditional liberty obtained at the urging of the offender at the original sentencing hearing. The Court’s approach in R v Graham should not be taken as a sign that this Court will readily grant an extension of time to appeal in a case such as this. It will depend upon the merits and justice of the case. 
     
      
    13 The principle of finality of litigation is relevant on an application such as this. Although it may be, as here, that the Crown cannot point to any actual prejudice because of the delay in bringing the application, there is a public interest in avoidance of delay, and the finality of litigation, in the area of sentencing as with litigation generally. In many cases, the prospect of sentence being reopened long after the event may impact adversely upon victims of crime. 
     
      
    14 A further aspect is also relevant. It will usually be the case that an applicant for an extension of time has been sentenced for other offences since the original sentence was suspended. As in this case, further offences may have been committed which constituted breaches of the bond and which led to imposition of the sentence originally suspended. Thus, the application will proceed before this Court in circumstances where, if error is demonstrated, it will be necessary to consider whether some lesser sentence should be fixed when the applicant is already serving another sentence. 
     
      
    15 It has been observed, in another context, that there is nothing more likely to bring suspended sentences into disrepute than the failure of courts to act where there has been a clear breach of the conditions of the bond by which the offender avoided being sent to prison: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Cooke (2007) 168 A Crim R 379 at 386-387 [23]. Although the Courts are conscious of the seriousness of a suspended sentence, it has been observed that the public, victims and even offenders may not view a suspended sentence as a true punishment: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] 202 CLR 321 at 346-347 [80].  
     
      
    16 If this Court is required to resentence an offender in a case such as this where another sentence of imprisonment is being served, it would be necessary to consider issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality. In R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at 164-165 [18], this Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A sentencing court must, however, take care when applying the totality principle. Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending:  
        R v Knight 
         (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at [112]. For similar reasons in a case such as the present where an offender who is already serving other sentences comes to be sentenced for additional offences, the impression must not be given that no, or little, penalty is imposed for the additional offences.” 
        
       
      
    17 Similar considerations arise in a case where an offender is to be resentenced by this Court for the original offence where sentence had been suspended, but this conditional liberty was breached by commission of further offences for which another sentence of imprisonment is being served. Public confidence in the administration of justice, including confidence in the use of suspended sentences, must be kept squarely in mind if that point is reached by this Court. 
     
      
    18 None of these factors constitute a barrier to this Court intervening where the justice of the case warrants that course. However, in determining whether an extension of time ought be granted, this Court should be alive to factors such as these, as well as the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Facts of Offence 
       
      
    19 The following recital of the facts is drawn from the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Taylor of 6 October 2006. 
     
      
    20 At about 6.45 pm on 3 February 2005, the victim (an adult male) was in the ATM room attached to the Commonwealth Bank in Crown Street, Surry Hills, withdrawing the sum of $200.00 from the machine. At this time, the Applicant (then aged 32 years) walked into the ATM room with her three-year old son. After withdrawing $200.00 cash from the machine, the victim turned to leave the room and the Applicant said “Look at my boy, isn’t he beautiful?” When the victim turned to look at the boy, the Applicant grabbed the money from his hand. The Applicant squeezed the victim’s hand whilst doing this, causing him pain. The victim said “That’s my money, you can’t take it” to which the Applicant said “It’s my money”. An altercation developed and the Applicant yelled out “help” to people outside the Bank. The victim and the Applicant walked into the street and the Applicant called out “call the police, call the police”. An off-duty police officer walking along Crown Street saw the Applicant leave the Bank, and he stopped her with police attending shortly thereafter. The Applicant told police that the victim had tried to grab her son. However, police were able to observe CCTV footage from the Bank and observed the victim withdraw the money from the ATM and the subsequent altercation.  
     
      
       
      The 2006 Sentencing Decision 
       
      
    21 The Applicant pleaded guilty to the charge of stealing from the person in the Local Court on 7 March 2006 and was committed for sentence in the District Court. 
     
      
    22 During the course of sentencing submissions, the Applicant’s legal representative acknowledged that a custodial sentence was appropriate, but asked his Honour to suspend the sentence. The Crown representative accepted that the s.12 option was available, but submitted that stringent conditions were appropriate.  
     
      
    23 His Honour accepted these submissions and imposed the suspended sentence referred to earlier. In his remarks on sentence, his Honour Judge Taylor accepted that the Applicant’s subjective circumstances were “very strong”. As at October 2006, she had seven children (aged from 15 years to 18 months) and she was pregnant again at that time. She had a history of drug abuse and dependence dating back 15 years.  
     
      
    24 His Honour had regard to a pre-sentence report of the Probation and Parole Service and a report from Mr Taylor, psychologist. Both reports referred to the Applicant’s developmental disability, immaturity and limited ability for reflection and impulse control. The author of the pre-sentence report assessed the Applicant as being unsuitable for any community-based sentencing options due to the severity of her drug dependence and unstable emotional state. 
     
      
    25 The Applicant was engaged in the MERIT (Magistrates Early Release Into Treatment) program through the Local Court. His Honour referred to a report from the MERIT program which he described as “encouraging”. 
     
      
    26 The Applicant had a number of prior convictions for dishonesty offences since 1991, including an offence of stealing from the person in 1998. Non-custodial sentences had been imposed for all offences committed before 2005. 
     
      
    27 In the course of his remarks on sentence, his Honour Judge Taylor said (ROS4-5): 
     
      
       
        
        “There are some obvious socio legal issues that I have discussed with the offender’s solicitor in court. The s 12 bond is a sentencing option that if there were a further offence then she is very much liable to have it revoked. It has been said many times over a long period of time in this particular court that one of the difficulties with bonds is that they can set people up to fail. I think that the motivation the offender has for rehabilitation, the program that she is already in and additional support from the Probation and Parole Service offer a good prospect of rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        She has prior matters but not for some time. There are some personal factors in the reports relating to intelligence and other matters that I am not going to recite in open court.” 
          
        
       
      
    28 After imposing sentence, his Honour explained the effect of the suspended sentence and said to the Applicant that her solicitor would speak to her as well about the effect of the sentence (ROS6). 
     
      
       
      Events Since 6 October 2006  
       
      
    29 Regrettably, subsequent events demonstrate that the Applicant took little advantage of the leniency involved in the suspended sentence. On 8 May 2007, the Applicant was fined in the Local Court for refusing to comply with a direction. 
     
      
    30 On 17 May 2007, his Honour Judge Solomon directed “No action on breach” when the Applicant was reported for the conviction on 8 May 2007. 
     
      
    31 On 5 November 2007, the Honourable Justice Blanch direction “No action on breach” when the Applicant failed to report and maintain contact with the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    32 On 27 December 2007, the Applicant committed offences of larceny and fraudulently obtaining property and failing to appear in accordance with a bail undertaking. On 23 January 2008, she committed a further offence of stealing from the person.  
     
      
    33 On 26 July 2008, the Applicant committed the offence of possession of a prescribed restricted substance.  
     
      
    34 The Applicant has been in continuous custody since 8 August 2008, following her arrest that day on further charges of shoplifting and destroying property. 
     
      
    35 On 20 August 2008, the Applicant was sentenced in the Downing Centre Local Court to five months’ imprisonment for stealing from the person. An appeal against severity of this sentence was dismissed in the Sydney District Court on 7 October 2008.  
     
      
    36 On 23 October 2008, the Applicant was sentenced in the Central Local Court to three months’ imprisonment for shoplifting, and placed on a two-year bond for destroying property and fined for possession of a prescribed restrictive substance. An appeal against severity of these sentences was dismissed in the Sydney District Court on 19 November 2008.  
     
      
    37 On 20 November 2008, the Applicant was called up for breach of the s.12 bond forming part of the suspended sentence. On 18 December 2008, his Honour Judge Hosking SC revoked the bond and directed that the Applicant serve the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Taylor to commence on 20 August 2008. 
     
      
    38 On 14 January 2009, the Applicant was sentenced in the Downing Centre Local Court to concurrent terms of imprisonment for six months for offences of fraudulent appropriation and failing to appear in accordance with her bail undertaking. These sentences were reduced on appeal to the Sydney District Court on 19 March 2009 to concurrent sentences of four months’ imprisonment with those sentences to expire on 13 May 2009. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    39 For the purpose of determining whether an extension of time ought be granted, I propose to consider the merits of the grounds of appeal advanced with respect to the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Taylor. The Court was assisted by detailed submissions of Ms Beckett, counsel for the Applicant, and Ms Gouda for the Crown. 
     
      
    40 Ground 1 asserts that his Honour erred by taking into account factual matters that constituted a more serious offence. Complaint is made concerning his Honour’s finding, arising from the Applicant’s squeezing of the victim’s hand, that this “was an offence where violence was offered during the stealing” (ROS2). Complaint is made that this finding was impermissible on sentence for stealing from the person as opposed to robbery, applying the principles in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389. I note that no such argument was advanced before his Honour Judge Taylor, nor was any objection taken to that part of the statement of facts that recorded these actions by the Applicant. 
     
      
    41 I am not persuaded that there is merit in this ground. Both robbery and stealing from a person are offences under s.94 Crimes Act 1900 carrying the same maximum penalty. An offence of stealing from a person usually involves a personal confrontation and the potential for personal conflict and force or fear, particularly if the victim endeavours to stop the theft: R v Delk (1999) 46 NSWLR 340 at 343 [15]. Stealing from the person is a variant of robbery rather than a variant of larceny: R v Delk at 345 [29]. Not every offence of stealing from the person is less serious than robbery, with such an assessment depending upon the particular facts of the case: R v Hua [2002] NSWCCA 384 at [19]. In my view, nothing said in R v Young [2003] NSWCCA 276 or R v Hooper [2004] NSWCCA 10 requires a conclusion that the observation of the sentencing Judge in this case involved a breach of the principles in The Queen v De Simoni.  
     
      
    42 Under the first ground, the Applicant also complains that his Honour was effectively referring to the principle in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 (concerning armed robbery offences) when his Honour said “This offence except in exceptional circumstances carries a custodial penalty” (ROS2). There is no substance in this complaint. His Honour did not refer to R v Henry, nor had that decision been referred to in submissions before him. In my view, his Honour’s comment is unremarkable, especially when an offence of stealing from the person is being dealt with on indictment. There is no substance in the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    43 Ground 2 asserts that the learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to give proper or sufficient consideration to the Applicant’s mental condition, and to the principles relating to that factor so far as it was relevant to the sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    44 No submission was made to the sentencing Judge by reference to authorities such as R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. Substantial weight was given to the Applicant’s subjective case by the sentencing Judge. His Honour was alive to the evidence concerning the Applicant’s mental condition and referred, amongst other things, to the psychological report of Mr Taylor. As mentioned earlier (at [24]), the reports referred to the Applicant’s developmental disability, immaturity and limited ability for reflection and impulse control, together with her history of drug dependence and her unstable emotional state. 
     
      
    45 Ms Beckett submitted that the evidence concerning the Applicant disclosed a lower level of intelligence and a propensity to act spontaneously with poor planning and limited insight. His Honour was alive to these matters at the time of passing sentence. The Applicant informed Mr Taylor that her motive for committing this offence was a desire to obtain money for methadone and to see her children. As mentioned later (at [52]-[53]), there were features of this offence which rendered it objectively serious. It has not been demonstrated that his Honour failed to give proper or sufficient weight to the Applicant’s mental condition in passing sentence. There is no substance in the second ground. 
     
      
    46 Ground 3 asserts that the sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account that the offence was capable of summary disposal. 
     
      
    47 No submission was advanced in the District Court urging the sentencing Judge to have regard to this factor on sentence. In any event, as decisions of this Court have made clear, there is no fixed rule when such an argument is advanced, nor is this a factor which operates universally to reduce sentence: R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29]. The bare theoretical possibility of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court does not suffice: Wise v R [2006] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304 at [31]. 
     
      
    48 The Applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence on 7 March 2006. The Crown had elected to proceed with this offence of stealing from the person on indictment. This was not surprising, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the Applicant’s criminal history, which included a number of dishonesty offences, including a prior conviction for stealing from the person.49 The Applicant’s s.94 offence cannot be regarded as one which was truly a Local Court offence being prosecuted in the District Court: R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349; R v Gent (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at 48 [90]. Where the Director of Public Prosecutions has elected to prosecute a matter on indictment, it would require a very clear case of inappropriate prosecution of an offence on indictment for an argument to be available in mitigation resulting from a lost opportunity for summary disposal of that offence: R v Gent at 47 [86]. This is not such a case. There is no substance in the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
    50 Ground 4 asserts that the overall sentence and non-parole period imposed were manifestly excessive. The real question is whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. 
     
      
    51 It has been observed that a suspended sentence is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [32]. No argument was advanced here that his Honour did not apply the stages for determining a suspended sentence referred to in R v Zamagias at [23]ff. 
     
      
    52 The maximum penalty for an offence of stealing from the person is imprisonment for 14 years. A sentence of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of 15 months is not, in my view, an unreasonable one for the offence committed by the Applicant. The offence was aggravated by the Applicant’s use of her own child as a decoy to assist the commission of the offence, and the patently false and serious allegation made to police that the victim had tried to grab her son.  
     
      
    53 Ms Beckett submitted that this aspect went more to lack of contrition. I do not agree. I accept that care must be taken in considering whether post-offence events may be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the crime itself. However, the circumstances of an offence are not neatly marked out by two lines, one at the technical beginning and the other at the technical end of the crime: Director of Public Prosecutions v England [1999] 2 VR 258 at 263 [18]. Common sense and moral sense extend the circumstances of an offence which may be considered for an assessment of the objective seriousness of a crime, to events which precede and follow the technical limits of the crime. In imposing sentence for a crime, a judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime, and are properly to be regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61]. In my view, a false allegation made to police against the victim very soon after the commission of the offence itself is capable of constituting an aggravating feature of the crime itself. The Applicant used her three-year old son to facilitate the commission of the offence and then made a false allegation against the victim in an attempt to fend off arrest and prosecution. This was no minor or technical offence of stealing from the person.  
     
      
    54 His Honour accepted that the Applicant’s subjective circumstances were “very strong” . However, the Applicant had a criminal history which did not assist her. Efforts at social intervention had been tried by way of rehabilitation with mixed success. 
     
      
    55 I have regard to Ms Beckett’s submissions by reference to the period of imprisonment before discount in this case, and sentencing statistics for this offence, although caution must be exercised in use of statistical material: R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at 739. 
     
      
    56 The Applicant was extended leniency by way of a suspended sentence, a course taken by the sentencing Judge at the request of the legal representatives of both the Applicant and the Crown.  
     
      
    57 It has not been demonstrated that the sentence of imprisonment imposed by his Honour was unreasonable or plainly unjust so as to be manifestly excessive. There is no merit in the fourth ground of appeal. 
     
      
    58 Ground 3A asserts that the sentencing Judge was not informed of, and therefore erred in failing to take into account, 17 days of pre-sentence custody in setting the appropriate sentence. The period of time relied upon by the Applicant in this respect is the period from 15 November 2005 to 1 December 2005.  
     
      
    59 Counsel for the Applicant submitted that this Court should intervene because of suggested error on the part of the sentencing Judge in failing to give the Applicant the benefit of this period of pre-sentence custody. I do not accept this submission. The Applicant was bail refused in the period 15 November 2005 to 1 December 2005 in relation to a number of offences, only one of which gives rise to the present proceedings. There was no obligation on the part of the sentencing Judge to give the Applicant automatic credit for time spent in custody which was not wholly referable to the offence for which she was to be sentenced: R v Finney [2002] NSWCCA 533 at [48]-[50]; Huntingdon v R [2007] NSWCCA 196 at [26]. There is no merit in Ground 3A. 
     
      
    60 Even if there was some merit in one or more of the grounds of appeal, I am entirely unpersuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    61 In these circumstances, there being no substance in the Applicant’s grounds, I would refuse an extension of time for the purpose of the Applicant seeking leave to appeal with respect to the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Taylor on 6 October 2006. 
     
      
       
      Application for Leave to Appeal with Respect to Sentence Imposed on 18 December 2008 
       
      
    62 The Applicant does not require an extension of time to seek leave to appeal from the decision of his Honour Judge Hosking SC on 18 December 2008. 63 There are two grounds of appeal with respect to the sentence imposed on that day. The first ground asserts that his Honour failed to correctly account for 12 days of additional pre-sentence custody so that the sentence ought to have commenced on 8 August 2008, and not 20 August 2008. The Applicant was in custody, bail refused on other matters, from 8 August 2008.64 In oral argument, Ms Beckett pointed as well to a period of eight days between 17 and 24 September 2007 when the Applicant was in custody, bail refused, as a result of call up for breach of the bond. 
     
      
    65 Ms Beckett acknowledged that his Honour had no power to revisit the term of the sentence and the non-parole period set by his Honour Judge Taylor: Rickard v R [2007] NSWCCA 332 at [18]-[27]. The only complaint raised about this sentence concerns the commencement date.  
     
      
    66 In my view, there is no merit in this ground of appeal. The Applicant was apprehended on 8 August 2008 for offences of shoplifting and destroying property. Her incarceration on 8 August 2008 resulted from her arrest for offences committed that day. There was no obligation on the sentencing Judge to date the sentence from 8 August 2008: R v Finney; Huntingdon v R. With respect to the eight-day period between 17 and 24 September 2007, I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated by way of the failure to refer to this period or to take it into account. The Applicant had no automatic entitlement to credit for this period. 
     
      
    67 The second ground advanced with respect to the orders of 18 December 2008 repeats the argument advanced as Ground 3A concerning the 17 days of pre-sentence custody in 2005. For reasons already expressed (at [59]), there is no substance in this argument and it ought be rejected. 
     
      
    68 In any event, it should be observed that the combination of custodial orders and sentences affecting the Applicant indicate that his Honour’s decision to backdate the present sentence to 20 August 2008 operated heavily in the Applicant’s favour. As a result of sentences imposed for other matters, the Applicant is to serve a non-parole period of just over six months (14 May 2009 to 19 November 2009) which is solely referable to the present offence. No error has been demonstrated with respect to the order made on 18 December 2008. No lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    69 Given the view which I have formed concerning the merits of the proposed appeal, I would refuse leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on 18 December 2008: Ta v R [2009] NSWCCA 196 at [36]. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    70 There may be circumstances where this Court extends time to intervene with respect to an old sentencing decision because of particular features of the case. The present application does not fall into this category.  
     
      
    71 The Applicant was granted conditional liberty by his Honour Judge Taylor, as requested by her lawyer, and she breached that trust in a number of respects thereafter. I have kept in mind the Applicant’s difficult personal circumstances, which have no doubt led to a range of rehabilitative sentencing options being used in her case. The Applicant’s offences have posed challenges for sentencing courts. 
     
      
    72 Nevertheless, in my view, the implementation of the original sentencing order does not give rise to any injustice with respect to this Applicant. Because of sentences imposed upon her for offences committed whilst subject to conditional liberty, only part of the sentence of two years’ imprisonment imposed for a serious offence of stealing from the person will be served as imprisonment solely referable to that offence. The considerations referred to at [15] to [18] above have application to this case. 
     
      
    73 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence imposed in the Sydney District Court on 6 October 2006 refused; 
       
       
      (b) leave to appeal against sentence imposed in the Sydney District Court on 18 December 2008 refused.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      There is a non-publication order in relation to (a) the present place of residence and the approved place of residence of the defendant under the conditions of the extended supervision order made by the Court and (b) any material that would tend to identify the person with whom the defendant intends to reside as permitted under the conditions of the extended supervision order and (c) the name by which the defendant was known when on witness protection. The non-publication order does not apply to any officer of the Department of Justice and Attorney General and the NSW Police Force insofar as the disclosure is reasonably necessary in implementing the extended supervision order nor to the defendant and the person with whom he proposes to reside. 
       
       
       Introduction 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The defendant is notorious as a sexual offender who for many years was involved with other similar offenders and dishonest police in living a lifestyle that centred on the moral corruption and sexual degradation of under-aged males. He gained significant publicity when he gave evidence before the Royal Commission into Police Corruption (“the Wood Royal Commission”). He was released from prison on 12 May 2009 having served 12 years imprisonment for a large number of serious sexual assault offences against young males. He had a number of victims and they were as young as 13 years. The offences were committed over various periods of time between 1971 and 1988. 
     
      
    2 The defendant has completed his sentences and would be free to resume a normal life in the community apart from these proceedings that seek an order from the Court imposing restrictions upon his liberty in order to safeguard the community against further offending by the defendant of a similar kind. The proceedings require the Court, in effect, to make a prediction as to the likelihood of the defendant re-offending over the next five years by committing further serious sexual offences against young males. 
     
      
    3 There is presently in place an interim order made by this Court that imposes a number of restrictions upon the defendant including as to his place of residence, his supervision and treatment, his ingestion of alcohol and drugs, his use of the Internet and his associates. This order expires on 11 August 2009 and cannot be renewed. 
     
      
    4 By summons filed on 15 April 2009 the State of New South Wales (‘the State”) seeks an order pursuant to s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (“the Act”) that for a period of 5 years the defendant be subject to extended supervision. The Court may make such an order if satisfied to the necessary degree that the defendant is likely to commit a serious sex offence in the future. 
     
      
    5 The issues before the Court was whether an order should be made, and, if so, what the residential condition of that order should be. The defendant’s submission was that the evidence was insufficient for the Court to reach the necessary satisfaction as to the likelihood of the commission of a serious sexual offence in the next five years. Alternatively the defendant argued that, if an order were to be made, the defendant should be permitted to reside at his residence of choice (the “country property”). 
     
      
       
        
        The legislation 
        
       
      
    6 The objects of the Act are provided in s 3 which states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community. 
         
         
        (2) Another object of this Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation. 
         
        
       
      
    7 A ""serious sex offence"" is defined in s 5(1) of the Act as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a “ 
        serious sex offence 
        ” means any of the following offences:  
         
          
           
          (a) an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 where:  
           
            
            (i) in the case of an offence against an adult or a child, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more, and  
             
            (ii) in the case of an offence against an adult, the offence is committed in circumstances of aggravation (within the meaning of the provision under which the offence arises),  
            
           
           
          (a1) an offence under section 61K or 66EA of the Crimes Act 1900,  
           
           
          (b) an offence under section 38, 111, 112 or 113 of the Crimes Act 1900 that has been committed with intent to commit an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900, where the offence intended to be committed is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more,  
          
         
         
        and includes:  
         
          
           
          (c) an offence committed elsewhere than in New South Wales that, if committed in New South Wales, would be a serious sex offence for the purposes of this Act, and  
           
           
          (d) any other offence that, at the time it was committed, was a serious sex offence for the purposes of this Act.  
          
         
        
       
      
    8 Section 7 of the Act provides for a preliminary hearing as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        7 Pre-trial procedures  
         
        (1) An application for an extended supervision order must be served on the sex offender concerned within 2 business days after the application is filed in the Supreme Court or within such further time as the Supreme Court may allow. 
         
         
        (2) The State of New South Wales must disclose to the offender such documents, reports and other information as are relevant to the proceedings on the application (whether or not intended to be tendered in evidence):  
         
         
          
          (a) in the case of anything that is available when the application is made, as soon as practicable after the application is made, and  
           
           
          (b) in the case of anything that subsequently becomes available, as soon as practicable after it becomes available.  
          
         
         
        (3) A preliminary hearing into the application is to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after the application is filed in the Supreme Court or within such further time as the Supreme Court may allow. 
         
         
        (4) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must make orders:  
         
          
           
          (a) appointing:  
           
            
            (i) 2 qualified psychiatrists, or  
             
            (ii) 2 registered psychologists, or  
             
            (iii) 1 qualified psychiatrist and 1 registered psychologist, or  
             
            (iv) 2 qualified psychiatrists and 2 registered psychologists, to conduct separate psychiatric or psychological examinations (as the case requires) of the offender and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations, and  
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (b) directing the offender to attend those examinations.  
          
         
         
        (5) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is not satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must dismiss the application. 
         
        
       
      
    9 In the present matter Price J heard the preliminary hearing. On 30 April 2009 his Honour determined that there should be a hearing of the present application, and as a consequence made an interim supervision order. He further ordered that two psychiatrists examine the defendant and furnish reports to the Court. 
     
      
    10 Section 9 of the Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        9 Determination of application for extended supervision order  
         
        (1) The Supreme Court may determine an application for an extended supervision order:  
         
          
           
          (a) by making an extended supervision order, or  
           
           
          (b) by dismissing the application.  
          
         
         
        (2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 
         
         
        (3) In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:  
         
          
           
          (a) the safety of the community,  
           
           
          (b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7(4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,  
           
           
          (c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,  
           
           
          (d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence,  
           
           
          (e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,  
           
           
          (f) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,  
           
           
          (g) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,  
           
           
          (h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,  
           
           
          (i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature.  
          
         
        
       
      
    11 The order commences on the day that it is made and may be for a period not exceeding 5 years: see s 10 of the Act. 
     
      
    12 The conditions that can be attached to such an order are set out, but not limited to the type of directions, specified in s 11 of the Act. They are directions requiring the offender to do or not to do any of the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) to permit any corrective services officer to visit the offender at the offender’s residential address at any time and, for that purpose, to enter the premises at that address, or  
         
         
        (b) to make periodic reports to a corrective services officer, or  
         
         
        (c) to notify a corrective services officer of any change in his or her address, or  
         
         
        (d) to participate in treatment and rehabilitation programs, or  
         
         
        (e) to wear electronic monitoring equipment, or  
         
         
        (ea) to reside at an address approved by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, or  
         
         
        (f) not to reside in or resort to specified locations or classes of locations, or  
         
         
        (g) not to associate or make contact with specified persons or classes of persons, or  
         
         
        (h) not to engage in specified conduct or classes of conduct, or  
         
         
        (i) not to engage in specified employment or classes of employment, or  
         
         
        (j) not to change his or her name.  
        
       
      
    13 The Court can vary or revoke an order that is made and can at the expiration of the order make a second or subsequent order. 
     
      
       
        
        The s 9(2) test 
        
       
      
    14 The meaning of s 9(2) of the Act, that is insofar as it specifies the precondition for the Court making an extended supervision order, is not without some controversy. The issue is the meaning of the phrase “satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence”. 
     
      
    15 In the Attorney General (NSW) v Winters [2007] NSWSC 1071; 176 A Crim R 249 McClellan CJ at CL, having referred to numerous decisions in which the word “likely” had been considered and the policy behind the Act, stated (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [50]  
        When construing legislation a court must be careful to apply the words of the legislature without imposing an impermissible gloss  
        Khoury v Government Insurance Office (NSW) 
         (1984) 165 CLR 622 at 638 and  
        Victims Compensation Fund Corporation v Brown & Ors 
         (2003) 201 ALR 260 at [33]. However, where the word used by the Parliament has shades of meaning which may alter its impact it is important to identify the meaning which was intended. As the authorities show the meaning of the word ""likely"" can vary significantly depending on its context. However, having regard to the purpose and effect of the legislation, notwithstanding my tentative view in  
        Gallagher 
        , in my judgment, in the Act, ""likely"" means ""more likely than not"" and it is that test which must be applied in ss 9 and 17.  
        For relevant purposes the court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that it is more likely than not that the offender will commit a further serious sex offence. 
         It follows that the defendant's argument that the chance of reoffending must be significantly higher than 50% must also be rejected. 
         
        
       
      
    16 The construction of s 17(3) of the Act was considered by the Court of Appeal in Tillman v Attorney General (NSW) [2007] NSWCA 327; 70 NSWLR 448; 178 A Crim R 133. Section 17 is concerned with the making of a “continued detention order” but the test to be applied by the Court before making such an order is the same as in s 9(2) in respect of an extended supervision order. The Court considered the appropriateness of the interpretation placed on the words in the section by McClellan CJ at CL in Winters in the light of the decision of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in TSL v Secretary to the Department of Justice (2006) 14 VR 109. In that case the Court held in relation to somewhat similar legislation in Victoria that the word “likely” should be construed as meaning ""probable"" in the sense of ""a high degree of probability"", but not necessarily involving a degree of probability of more than 50 percent. 
     
      
    17 The majority of the Court in Tillman, Giles and Ipp JJA, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [88]  
        In our view, there is much to be said for the view expressed by McClellan CJ at CL in  
        Winters 
        , namely, that ""likely"" is used in the section as meaning more probable than not. On the other hand, it is a respectable view that the legislature recognised the infringement of personal liberty by requiring satisfaction to a high degree of probability, so that it would be wrong to impose in the shade of meaning adopted for ""likely"" a further strict requirement of likelihood in the sense of more probable than not. There is ambiguity in the word ""likely"", and if unconstrained we would tend towards his Honour's view. Nevertheless, the view expressed in  
        TSL 
         is reasonably open and we are not persuaded that it is clearly wrong. In the light of what has emanated from the High Court in regard to the respect that an intermediate appellate court of one Australian jurisdiction should give to a decision of an intermediate appellate court of another Australian jurisdiction on issues that are substantially the same, we would follow and adopt the approach of Callaway AP in  
        TSL. 
         
         
        [89]  
        Accordingly, we would hold that the word ""likely"" in ss 17(2) and (3) denotes a degree of probability at the upper end of the scale, but not necessarily exceeding 50%……………… 
        
       
      
    18 And later: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [92]  
        The difference between likelihood in the sense of a high probability but not necessarily more probable than not, and likelihood as something more probable than not, may not be great. Expressed as percentages, which is incorrect because it suggests a mathematical precision which is unattainable and is an unhelpful approach, transition from 49% to 51% is not the key to application of ss 17(2) and (3). 
        
       
      
    19 The third member in Tillman, Mason P, dissented from the majority on this issue and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [7]  
        The universal requirement to construe words in context becomes even more pressing for chameleon-like words such as ""likely"". Dictionaries and decisions of the High Court inform us that this word may sometimes mean ""probable"" in the sense of more probable than not (see the review by McClellan CJ at CL in  
        Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Winters 
         [2007] NSWSC 1071 at [33]-[47]). 
         
         
        [8]  
        Here one is dealing with a predictive inquiry referable to the particular offender that implicitly addresses the time frame within which the Court's order can operate. Is reoffending within this time frame likely unless detention or at least supervision is ordered? The likelihood of a single reoffending of the requisite nature will suffice to engage the various powers. 
         
         
        [9]  
        This understanding of the individualised nature of the inquiry indicates to me that the Court is required to address a cascading set of predictions. At each step the ultimate question is whether or not the Court is highly satisfied that a single event of reoffending is likely. 
         
         
        [10]  
        To my mind this suggests a preferred meaning for ""likely"" of more probable that not. 
         
        
       
      
    20 In Cornwall v Attorney General (NSW) [2007] NSWCA 374 the Court of Appeal followed the majority view in Tillman. 
     
      
    21 It should be noted that although the majority in Tillman favoured the interpretation given to “likely” by McClellan CJ at CL in Winters they felt constrained by reasons of comity to follow TSL. However, that decision has been reconsidered by the Victorian Court of Appeal in RJE V Secretary To The Department Of Justice, Attorney-General For Victoria And Victorian Human Rights & Equal Opportunity Commission [2008] VSCA 265. 
     
      
    22 In RJE Maxwell P and Weinberg JA in a joint judgment rejected the interpretation adopted in TSL. It is unnecessary for present purposes to detail the arguments that persuaded their Honours that the decision in TSL, so far as it concerned the meaning of the word “likely” in the relevant legislation, was clearly wrong. They referred to the issue of comity so far as the decision in Tillman was concerned and stated (footnotes not included): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [50]  
        Comity between intermediate appellate courts is a matter of great importance, as the High Court recently restated in  
        Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd 
        . 
        6  
        Tillman 
         and  
        Cornwall v Attorney General for New South Wales 
         having now been decided as they were, it would be facile to construe the Monitoring Act as if it were unique to Victoria and the problem of its construction were of merely parochial concern. 
         
         
        [51]  
        As against that, however, as Mason P pointed out in his dissent in  
        Tillman 
        , the decisions presently under review do not concern Commonwealth law or any uniform national scheme of legislation of the kind under consideration in  
        Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd 
         nor do they deal with any question of property, commercial law or tort law having national significance. If we may respectfully say so, therefore, there is much to be said for the view of Mason P that: 
         
         
          
          ... [T]he judge of an intermediate appellate court determining an appeal remains bound by the judicial oath to do justice according to law. In a proper case, that duty will require departure from non-binding precedents if the judge discerns that legal principles of higher authority require such departure. Each individual judge is obliged to pursue justice, not prudence, even though it may turn out that his or her views do not obtain the assent of appellate colleagues or are overturned upon appeal to the High Court. 
          
         
         
        [52]  
        We would add that the question of comity on issues of interpretation under State law was recently addressed by the High Court in  
        Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority 
        . The Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ) cited with approval the following statement by McHugh J in  
        Marshall v Director-General, Department of Transport 
         
         
          
          But that does not mean that the courts of Queensland, when construing the legislation of that State, should slavishly follow judicial decisions of the courts of another jurisdiction in respect of similar or even identical legislation. The duty of courts, when construing legislation, is to give effect to the purpose of the legislation. The primary guide to understanding that purpose is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of the legislation. Judicial decisions on similar or identical legislation in other jurisdictions are guides to, but cannot control, the meaning of legislation in the court's jurisdiction. Judicial decisions are not substitutes for the text of legislation although, by reason of the doctrine of precedent and the hierarchical nature of our court system, particular courts may be bound to apply the decision of a particular court as to the meaning of legislation. 
          
         
         
        [53]  
        We have already concluded that we should not follow the decision in  
        TSL 
         on the meaning of the word 'likely'. Given that the majority judgment in  
        Tillman 
         was itself based on the decision in  
        TSL 
        , and was contrary to the expressed preference of all three judges in that case, we likewise decline to follow  
        Tillman 
        . We conclude, therefore, that on ordinary principles of interpretation the meaning of the word 'likely' in s 11(1) of the Monitoring Act is 'more likely than not'. 
         
        
       
      
    23 The third member of the Court in RJE, Nettle JA, preferred the construction of “likely” as being “at least more likely than not” but for comity reasons, thought that the Court should follow the majority in Tillman. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [104] ……. 
          
        Tillman 
         and  
        Cornwall 
         having now been decided as they were, it would be facile to construe the Act as if it were unique to Victoria and the problem of its construction were of merely parochial concern. Given that Victoria and New South Wales have each enacted legislation in similar terms, and that the New South Wales Court of Appeal has in comity twice followed the interpretation attributed by this court to one of the essential provisions of the legislation, I consider that we should not depart from that interpretation without a compelling reason to do so. Since the President's and Weinberg JA's criticisms of  
        TSL 
         were in one way or another all considered in  
        Tillman 
        , I am not persuaded that they are a compelling reason to do so. 
         
        
       
      
    24 The situation is then that the majority in Tillman, although preferring the construction of the word “likely” given by McClellan CJ at CL in Winters, followed the interpretation taken in TSL for reasons of comity, yet that interpretation has now been rejected by the Court of Appeal of Victoria in favour of the construction applied in Winters. In light of this history it is highly unlikely, so it seems to me, that the Court of Appeal in this State would continue to follow the majority in Tillman.  
     
      
    25 One of the articles tendered by the defendant in these proceedings was by criminologist David Biles entitled “Sentence and Release Options for High-risk Sexual Offenders” in the Australia Journal of Forensic Sciences 2006 Vol 1 No 38. This contained a review of legislation in Australia, and including the Act with which these proceedings are concerned, in order to advise the ACT government. The article states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………. It is suggested that the level of probabilities that would justify intervention should be no less than ""more likely than not"" or (the less precise but more demanding) ""high level of probability"", and it is suggested that type of expertise required which include at least one psychiatrist and one psychologist, both with extensive experience in treating sex offenders, making an assessment independently of each other. 
        
       
      
    26 I consider myself bound to follow Tillman and Cornwall. The parties before me agreed that I was. Yet if I apply the test in Tillman, I believe that I will be overturned on appeal. The State argues that on either interpretation of the word “likely” I should make the order. The defendant submits that I could not be satisfied of the likelihood of further offending on whatever meaning I apply. 
     
      
    27 Whatever interpretation of the word “likely” is to be given to the section, he seems to me that the prediction is concerned with the period in respect of which the Court can make an order, that is a period of 5 years. Although the State submitted that the prediction was not so confined, I cannot see how the section otherwise operates. That seems to have been the view of the section that Mason P took in Tillman. 
     
      
       
        
        The evidence 
        
       
      The defendant’s criminal record 
      
    28 The defendant has a criminal record that dates from 1962 but matters before 1989 can be disregarded as being irrelevant to the present proceedings. In 1989 he was sentenced in the Parramatta District Court for offences of supply and conspiracy to supply prohibited drugs. On each offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence from 31 March 1989. 
     
      
    29 These offences involved a police officer and a person who also became notorious for his sexual offences against young males, Robert Joseph (Dolly) Dunne. The defendant was aged 41 at the time of the offences. The drug at the centre of the charges was amphetamine belonging to an associate of Dunne who had been arrested by police. The arresting police were unaware of the existence of the drug that was then supplied by the defendant and his co-offenders. The defendant was sentenced on the basis that he was to give evidence against the police officer. In respect of those sentencing proceedings a report was obtained from a psychiatrist, Dr Dent. I shall refer to his reports on the defendant later. 
     
      
    30 In December 1991 the defendant was sentenced for a number of sexual assault offences in Victoria. The offences were committed between March and June 1973 on a male aged 13 to 14 years at the time of the offences. The defendant was aged 24. He met the boy through the boy’s sister. The offences were acts of indecency and anal intercourse. The defendant had fled Victoria and there was a warrant in existence in that State for his arrest. Prior to sentencing the defendant had given evidence of police corruption in New South Wales and had been placed on witness protection. 
     
      
    31 In sentencing the defendant, Justice Byrne stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offences to which you pleaded guilty are very serious and indicated a breach of trust towards your victim. You had obtained the confidence of his father and, as a result, were given an opportunity to act as a teacher for him and as an older friend. In these circumstances, and to that extent, you breached his father's confidence in you and you also took advantage of your victim. According to him, he is still emotionally affected by your conduct. 
         
         
        ……………….. 
         
         
        The offences to which you had pleaded guilty are serious. Your conduct indicates a breach of trust. The father of your victim allowed you to see his son and believed that a friendly and innocent relationship existed between you. 
         
         
        What you did to the boy, when your ages were so different, constituted serious misconduct on your part. In normal circumstances such conduct would warrant a lengthy custodial sentence. 
        
       
      
    32 The effective sentence imposed upon the defendant was 2½ years with a non-parole period of 15 months. 
     
      
    33 In 1998 Judge Shillington in the District Court sentenced the defendant for 24 sexual offences. There were three male victims. The first was aged 14 years when the offences began and 19 when they ceased. In respect of that complainant there was one charge of indecent assault and 8 charges of buggery said to have been representative of “some hundreds” of sexual acts against that victim. These offences were committed between March 1974 and August 1978. In respect of this victim the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The first victim was introduced to you by another and you and he lived together at Rose Bay, Collaroy and Manly. The victim's parents had separated and he was having family problems, not attending school and running away. You became a friend of the family and took the boy away on holidays. You further discouraged the boy from seeing his family and that relationship between you and he extended between the ages of 14 and 19 years of age. 
        
       
      
    34 The second complainant was aged 13. In respect of him here were charges of sexual intercourse without consent of a person under age of 16, homosexual intercourse and indecent assaults. In the sexual assault offences the child was plied with alcohol and asleep when the defendant committed the offences, including digital penetration of his anus. These offences were committed over the period 1986 to 1988. In respect of this victim the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        You met the second victim at Blackheath and he was then 13 years of age. You met him outside a hotel. He was invited in for chips and drinks. His parents had separated when the boy was two years of age. In mid 1986, acts of sexual abuse commenced between you and him. He commenced to stay overnight at your premises and later moved in with his father. As a result of that, which was encouraged by you, you obtained greater access to the boy. In 1987 he ran away from home and lived with you between July 1987 and March of 1989. The boy himself suffers from deafness, having but 20% of normal hearing. Alcohol and marijuana were used by you to obtain your desires. The boy, as I have said, was between the age of 13 and 15 during the periods of these offences. 
        
       
      
    35 The third complainant was aged 14 or 15. There were 7 offences committed against him of chiefly sexual intercourse and indecent assaults. One offence involved digit penetration of the complainant’s anus. These were representative of over a thousand similar offences committed between January and July 1988. The Judge said about this victim: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The third victim was a friend of the second boy. He was invited to your home at Helensburgh and the offences numbered 18 to 22 in the list of charges on the indictment, were committed whilst he was intoxicated by alcohol and marijuana. He has no personal recollection of what happened. As I have said, the last two offences occurred and comprised masturbation and penetration of his anus by your finger. 
        
       
      
    36 As to the effects of the offences on the victims the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        One has to look at the effect of these offences upon the boys. I refer to the boys’ statements. The first in his statement says that his present situation is that he is greatly affected in his relationship with women. He finds it difficult to show affection. He has bad relations with his father who condoned your conduct with the boy. He has serious physical problems consequent upon numerous acts of anal intercourse. He has problems in relating to young children. 
         
         
        The second boy, his present state of mind is that he feels ashamed of his conduct. He says at the time of these events he had no one to turn to. His parents were alienated and he felt separated and scared of you. He had thoughts of suicide and also had thoughts that he wished to kill you. He said he described his feelings about himself as ""I feel like a piece of shit"". He was given marijuana and alcohol and he is now, according to his estimates, an alcoholic. 
         
         
        A third boy, as I have said, met you through the second victim. To obtain your desires, he was given alcohol and marijuana. He said that when you assaulted him he had no prior sexual experience. He felt angry at himself and at you for what had happened. 
        
       
      
    37 The Judge said the following about the offences for which he was sentencing the defendant: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It may be said that with respect to the first boy, you took advantage of the situation between him and his parents and that was also the situation in respect of the second. 
         
         
        These offences committed against these three complainants indicate sexual abuse of young boys. They were committed during their early to late teens. The boys came from dysfunctional homes with limited supervision and separated parents. Alcohol and drugs were used on occasions and were used to induce compliance [with] your wishes. 
         
         
        The complainants’ statements indicate they have suffered psychologically and in one case physically in a permanent way. It will be hard to exaggerate potential ill-effects on young impressionable boys of this type of physical abuse. Certainly in the case of the first and second boys, I am satisfied that their lives have been profoundly changed and degraded by your conduct. 
         
         
        Your counsel, Mr Molomby, made a number of detailed submissions which I feel I should deal with not in an exhaustive fashion but in general terms. It is your claim that these relationships were, as he describes them, monogamous in contrast to haphazard promiscuous conduct. It is somewhat difficult to reconcile that with your statement when you were interviewed on the Current Affair program in November of 1993. This is a program which I will refer to later. You are asked by Mike Munro on that occasion, "" So how many young boys do you think passed through your life and the lives of other pederasts during those years that you are protected by the police?"" and your answer was, ""200 to 300"". It is also to be noted that the offences with regard to the third boy occurred when you, as I understand it, were in what is described as a monogamous relationship with the second. But in the event it is hard to see, if this was the true situation, how it assists you. 
         
         
        ……………. 
         
         
        It is further your claim that you had the implicit consent of the parents to what was taking place. In my view, this only makes the matter worse; the fact that you took advantage of lax parental control and lack of interest on the part of the parents. It is further suggested that they, the complainants themselves, have revised their view of the relationship with you. It is suggested they were willing parties at the time of these events, but it is to be noted that these were boys, certainly in respect of the first and second, from a dysfunctional family. You provided them with accommodation, you provided them with money and certainly in one case gave them alcohol and drugs. You flattered the boys and treated them as equals. That is evident from the BBQ video which I was invited to look at. 
         
         
        Whatever these complainants’ attitudes might have been at the time, and I do not accept that they were willing participants, there is no doubt that their present attitude what happened to them in the present psychological and physical state are quite different and certainly quite genuine. 
         
        
       
      
    38 Judge Shillington sentenced the defendant to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years and it was from this sentence that he was released in May of this year. It is obvious that the defendant was not granted parole. 
     
      
    39 An appeal against the severity of this sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed on 21 July 1998. Sully J delivered the principal judgment of the Court and stated:  
     
      
       
        
         
        The applicant did not make any secret of the fact that the twenty-four particular matters charged against him, and to which he pleaded and stood for sentence, were manifestations of a lifestyle in which he had regularly indulged a period of years before 1989. It is necessary to bear carefully in mind, of course, that the applicant is not to be punished for offences for which he has not been tried, and of which he has not been convicted. By the same token, it is proper to take account of the fact, and it is undoubtedly admitted fact, that none of the particular twenty-four matters of present concern can be seen as isolated aberrant acts, but rather as representative of the pre-1989 lifestyle of the applicant. 
         
         
        It must surely go without saying that the offences of the character that I have described are, on their objective facts, of the most serious imaginable kind. 
         
        
       
      
    40 In a reference to the part of the sentencing remarks concerned with the nature of the relationship of the defendant with the victims, Sully J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I take the reference in the submission to “monogamous relationships” to posit that the applicant pursued a number of discrete, individual relationships rather than a wide-ranging promiscuous paedophilic lifestyle. As to that, I think, for my own part, that it is sufficient to say that it cannot possibly be correct to suppose that it is somehow less reprehensible for an adult to debauch young boys in separate and successive, rather than in separate and concurrent, relationships. I do not think that there is any advantage to the present applicant from the point.  
        
       
      
    41 In proposing that the appeal be dismissed, Sully J stated 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is not necessary, I think, to dilate any further and I have earlier done upon the details of conduct of the applicant. But it is, I think, worth stressing, yet again, that such behaviour constituted a course of appalling sexual abuse on vulnerable young boys over a lengthy period of time. It cannot be disputed, it seems to me, that public opinion,- and I mean by that reasonable, intelligent and properly informed public opinion, - would find utterly abhorrent that course of conduct, and would think that any significant interference with the practical effect of the sentences imposed in the Court below was not conducive to the maintenance of proper level of public confidence in the administration of justice according to law. 
         
        
       
      
    42 On 13 October 1999 Blanch CJ sentenced the defendant in the District Court for three counts of buggery. Two offences were committed between June and September 1971 upon a complainant who was aged 15 at the time. The other offence was committed between March 1972 and March 1973 upon a complainant aged 14 years. The defendant asked the court to take into account five offences on a Form 1. Blanch CJ noted that the offences were of a similar kind to those dealt with by Judge Shillington. His Honour concluded that it was appropriate in the circumstances to impose a fixed term sentence of 4 years to date from the date the sentence was imposed. The sentences were thus served concurrently with the sentences imposed by Judge Shillington. 
     
      
       
      Psychiatric and psychological evidence 
      
    43 There was a deal of material placed before the Court by way of reports by psychiatrists and psychologists. A number of these witnesses were cross-examined on behalf of the defendant. Ultimately there was a uniformity of opinion that the defendant fell into a group of persons who were at high risk of further offending but there was disagreement as to what could be said about the risk of the defendant himself committing a further serious sexual offence. 
     
      
       
      Dr Dent 
      
    44 Dr Dent prepared a report dated 17 July 1989 for the sentencing proceedings before Judge Court for the drug offences. The defendant told the psychiatrist that he had been “easily manipulated” by Dunn and that the police officer involved had a “powerful grip on him through aspects of his [the defendant’s] sexual preference”. According to the report the defendant told the psychiatrist: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …….. that he was very afraid of losing Dunn as a friend, he told Dunn that he didn't believe Dunn had the right to put him in this situation, that he (your client) had a lot to lose. 
         
         
        Indeed, he had moved to Helensburgh to get away from the powerful manipulation of Churchill and other aspects round his life, your client told me he had found a new meaning in life in Helensburgh with his business going well and also having the responsibility of a 15 and a half to 16 year old male who had been his ward for two years, the son of a friend of your client. 
         
        
       
      
    45 In order to explain to the psychiatrist how he came to be “entrapped” by police in committing the drug offences, he told Dr Dent the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …….. he belonged to a ""very harassed group who share mutual interests and affections"", saying that his was ""a group one feels safe in"", stating that because of the harassment (indicating it had to do with his sexual preference) then these people ""tend therefore to have a strong sense of mutual support and identity"". 
         
         
        He said many of his acquaintances have left him and the group over the years, ""the core group of mutual support and affection became smaller and tighter"", hence the potential loss of risk of friendship from such a small group brings with it a greater threat of sense of emotional loss, a sense that it's important to belong to the group and to maintain a sense of loyalty to that group to avoid such loss. 
        
       
      
    46 Later Dr Dent wrote (the underlining is the author’s): 
     
      
       
        
         
        What is also apparent from his background, is that there was affection given on condition that he obeyed the family's norms and attitudes, if he did not do so he would often have a guilty reaction. Indeed the point from this is that if he did not conform then he was deprived of affection and often threatened with this, it being of considerable importance to note his separation from the family as [an] uncontrollable child when 15. 
         
         
        That is,  
        it has been very important to him not to lose affection again 
        , I think it also explains why he has a ward aged 15 years, Raphael, and why he has spent so much of his time in his work running under-18 discos. One refers to his background again in this area of not wishing to lose, one can understand why he would have such a strong emotional involvement in that situation with Dunn and others where he would agree to cooperate against his normal judgment and social competence rather than risk losing affection and support, having had such a painful loss of affection in his early life. 
        
       
      
    47 The ""ward"" referred to in these parts of the report was in fact one of the defendant’s victims of sexual abuse. Of course up until this time the defendant had been involved with Dunn and others in the repeated sexual abuse of under-aged males using alcohol and drugs to undermine any resistance by the victims and protected by corrupt police. However, Dr Dent wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He has not abused drugs, his use of alcohol has been social only, he has not really abused alcohol though one notes the abuse of alcohol in the weeks leading up to the events. There is no use of any other illicit drugs except occasional use of marijuana from time to time in the past. 
        
       
      
    48 Dr Dent made a further report on the defendant dated 15 January 1992. The report commences: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Fisk has been obliged to face a plea in Melbourne I believe on the 20th of January as a result of alleged offences when aged 24 years, that is in the very early seventies the circumstances involved a homosexual relationship with a 14 year old youth. Mr Fisk informs me that this was a mutual sexual and emotional friendship which lasted some six months. 
         
         
        I further understand he has never been charged with these offences or any similar offences in 1973 or since that time. 
         
         
        I am also aware that the emotional and psychological effects of all those circumstances in 1973 regarding the then 14 year old youth and his welfare prompted Mr Fisk at that time to contact the family on two occasions. 
         
         
        I understand this took place first in 1974 when he spoke to the boy and affirmed that he was well and believed that the events were best forgotten. 
         
         
        I understand he also contacted the family some 10 years later when he spoke to the father at some length regarding the boy who had then reached adulthood of course, was informed that the young man was now well adjusted, about to marry and to join the army. 
         
        
       
      
    49 This account should be compared with what Judge Byrne stated in his sentencing remarks as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I also heard from your victim of these counts, who is now 32 years of age. He was born on 6 April 1959. He said that for the first four to five years after these incidents he felt dirty, humiliated and angry. He said he still feels hurt and suffers flashbacks from what happened in the past. Before me, he appeared emotional and was unable to control his emotions - I have only briefly set out the facts of this case. 
        
       
       
      I have already set out from the sentencing remarks the facts as recounted by the Judge and the way he viewed the offending. It is inconsistent with the account given to Dr Dent by the defendant. 
       
       
      Mr Joblin 
      
    50 A psychologist, Ian Joblin prepared a report dated 6 December 1991 for use in the Victorian sentencing proceedings. The report contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The defendant] reported that when he was at school boarding in the Christian College, he became aware of his attraction towards males of a similar age. It seems that he was fixated at that level of sexuality. For a time after he left school he had considerable conflict in accepting his homosexuality, versus any heterosexuality. He had had relationships with females but they were not as gratifying as relationships with other young men. It is interesting to note at this time he apparently auditioned with the Australian Opera and was looking forward to a career as a professional tenor, but because of his confusion in relation to his sexuality he felt he could not continue. In his late adolescence and early 20s he began to accept his sexuality. When he left Melbourne after being charged with these offences he found other homosexual men of a similar orientation in relation to their partners and (the defendant) from that point has settled into accepting that he is a homosexual and that his partners of preference are youths. I am of the opinion that it is inappropriate to label this man as a paedophile. Indeed by definition he does not come into that category, even in relation to these offences. 
         
         
        Paedophilia, by definition, involves special sexual fantasies with pre-pubertal children being the persistently preferred or exclusive method of achieving sexual excitement. I have discussed this matter at length with [the defendant] and he denies ever having any type of sexual fantasies or any type of sexual behaviour with such young children. I feel it is more appropriate to label this man as a hebephile (Hebe being the Greek goddess of youth). It seems that a group of men, many of whom are professionals in New South Wales had been involved with relationships with adolescent youths for some time and [the defendant], being a member of this group, feels totally at one and reconciled in his sexuality. 
         
        
       
       
      CUBIT Treatment report 
      
    51 The defendant was involved in the CUBIT treatment programme for sexual offenders in custody from 13 September 2006 to 21 September 2007. There was in evidence a treatment report dated 19 October 2007. As to his overall participation in the programme the report states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Upon entry into the CUBIT programme, Mr Fisk appeared unmotivated to address his offending behaviour. He appeared dismissive of treatment and was disengaged in group processes, arguing that his attitudes and ""lifestyle"" were not problematic, rather ""this society has different views"". As treatment progressed Mr Fisk appeared to shift from this position and he reported that he was motivated to discuss his offending and make changes that would positively impact on his life and his ability to remain offence free. Despite this shift, Mr Fisk's participation in treatment overall was varied. At times, Mr Fisk was able to make insightful connections in his own and other’s patterns of behaviour. He participated well in group, was receptive to feedback and demonstrated an ability to provide supportive and constructive feedback to other group members. At other times, Mr Fisk seemed to engage in a number of tactics to avoid addressing issues in a comprehensive manner. For example, he would be defensive and resistant towards feedback, collude with other group members, make self focused remarks, engage in secrecy and avoid discussion of issues. Additionally Mr Fisk occasionally behaved aggressively towards group members, using sarcasm and belittling or patronising comments to cause harm. Mr Fisk also engaged in labelling and appeared to present himself as superior to those around him. 
        
       
      
    52 However, the report is generally favourable and the defendant successfully completed the programme. Under the heading “Life Time Patterns” the following is stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        During his time in treatment Mr Fisk developed a comprehensive understanding of his patterns of thinking and behaviour that negatively impacted on his life and his relationship with others. At times, Mr Fisk appeared to make a concerted effort to address these treatment issues and demonstrated some change in a number of target areas e.g., challenging distorted attitudes toward children and sex, and developing a healthy view of himself and his sexuality. However, Mr Fisk still demonstrated some difficulty developing and maintaining intimacy in relationships and he often reverted to old patterns of coping when he was experiencing feelings of vulnerability, worthlessness and rejection (e.g., dismissing feedback and blaming others for his problems). Additionally, Mr Fisk appeared to maintain some distorted and stereotypical attitudes towards homosexuality and homosexual relationships and he continued to use poor coping strategies (e.g., self-deprecating humour) to deal with others’ inappropriate remarks towards him. Mr Fisk would benefit from continued support in developing his coping strategies, improving his relationships, and implementing changes in his behaviour on a daily basis. 
        
       
      
    53 Early in his treatment the defendant demonstrated absence of empathy for the victims of his sexual offending behaviour, reporting that they had consented to the abuse and that he “romanticised the abuse as loving and intimate sexual relationships"". He also suggested that the victims had not been harmed and disclosed the abuse for their financial gain. However as treatment continued he was able to develop ""a rudimentary understanding of victim issues both for victims of sexual abuse in general and the victims of his offences”. The authors of the report thought the defendant would benefit from ongoing support in developing his empathy skills. 
     
      
    54 Under the heading of “Sexual self-regulation” the following is reported: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Early in treatment Mr Fisk acknowledged ongoing deviant sexual fantasies about adolescent males and a tendency to sexualise young adults. He reported that he believed this was a habit and did not appear concerned about this behaviour. Mr Fisk was provided with feedback about the risk of engaging deviant sexual fantasies and was provided with cognitive-behavioural intervention strategies should he care to utilise them. As over the course of treatment Mr Fisk appeared to gain some insight into the risks associated with engaging in deviant sexual fantasies and he made some comments towards the end of treatment, highlighting his tendency to choose to watch certain television programmes (e.g., late-night SBS movies). Mr Fisk appeared ambivalent about this issue and may benefit from further discussion about this in maintenance groups. 
        
       
      
    55 Under the heading "" Acute dynamic risk factors"" the following is stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Fisk may be considered at imminent risk of reoffending when severe emotional disturbance is evident as this may impair his judgment and impact on his self-control. Historically, Mr Fisk has reacted to severe emotional stress by engaging in avoidant coping strategies such as ruminating, isolating himself, abusing drugs and alcohol and gambling. He has also engaged in aggressive behaviour towards others when experiencing stress or under the influence of alcohol and he indicated that he sometimes used sex as a means of coping when stressed. Mr Fisk has been diagnosed with depression in the past and is currently prescribed medication to manage these symptoms. Any of these behaviours or indicators that he is experiencing emotional stress would indicate to others an increasing risk of recidivism. 
         
         
        Additionally, loss of social supports through termination of relationships or perceive rejection may also be signs [of] Mr Fisk's increasing risk of reoffending. Similarly expressions of hostility, angry ruminations or general defiance and recklessness may also indicate an increasing risk, as would associating with pro-criminal others or seeking out child victims. 
         
         
        In order for Mr Fisk to effectively manage his risk of recidivism he will need to continue to address the dynamic risk factors outlined above and maintain the changes that he has made whilst in CUBIT. The custody-based maintenance group may afford him an opportunity to explore these issues and practice implementing his self management plans. Further, any changes noted in the aforementioned dynamic factors should alert Mr Fisk, his support network, and other professionals to his immediate increased risk of sexual recidivism and the need for immediate intervention. 
        
       
      
    56 The report concluded with the following recommendation: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Based on Mr Fisk's progress and outstanding treatment issues, it is recommended that he participate in a substantial period of custody-based maintenance in MSPC, Long Bay Correctional Centre. This will afford him the opportunity to address outstanding issues and offer him support in making further changes. It is envisaged that Mr Fisk would also benefit from community-based maintenance to assist reintegration into the community. If community-based maintenance is not available to Mr Fisk in his planned place of residence, it is recommended that he access a psychologist in his area with experience in working with individuals who have committed sexual offences. Mr Fisk may also find contact with a support group for homosexual men useful and he should access support groups for gambling, drug and alcohol abuse, and relationship counselling on a needs basis. 
        
       
       
      Mr Sheehan 
      
    57 Mr Sheehan is a psychologist employed with the Department of Corrective Services (“the Department) as Senior Specialist Psychologist, Serious Sex Offenders Review Group. He prepared a Risk Assessment Report dated 31 March 2009. This was based upon interviews with the defendant on 19 and 24 March 2009 and 14 April 2009. 
     
      
    58 In his affidavit of 21 April 2009 he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Having regard to both actuarial assessment using the STATIC-99 and dynamic risk assessment, I access Mr Fisk as presenting a high risk of sexually re-offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders. I refer to this assessment in my report at page 20. 
        
       
       
        
      Overall Risk 
      
    59 In his report at page 20 under the heading “Overall Risk” Mr Sheehan wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The management of one's risk involves improving their level of functioning in the afore-mentioned dynamic risk areas. As individuals address and become more skilled at managing dynamic risk factors their ability to manage their overall risk improves. 
         
         
        Mr Fisk is undergoing a process of change. He has changed his position in order to agree to participate in CUBIT, during which he also demonstrated some ability to engage in analysis and change of elements of his beliefs and behaviours. He generated a list of risk factors and interventions to address those risk factors. Mr Fisk's ability to live by this plan outside of the CUBIT therapeutic community has been inconsistent and he has regressed in some areas. On balance, the totality of evidence suggests that Mr Fisk remains in the high risk category of sexual offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders. 
        
       
       
        
      Conclusions and recommendations 
      
    60 Later in his report under the heading ""Conclusions and Recommendations"" he wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Fisk's risk of sexually reoffending is estimated to be in the high-risk category relative to other men who have sexually offended. He has been afforded participation in an appropriate intensity of psychological intervention that is specific to offence-related behaviours and he has generated what appears to be a realistic and insightful plan for addressing the factors associated with risk. At this stage, there remains an obvious discrepancy between his behaviour plans and his actual behaviour. Given the high valency risk factor that Mr Fisk's only sectional interest is towards males of adolescent physical appearance, he would have to work consistently and comprehensively to manage all aspects of risk before confidence could be had in his ability to independently manage his risk over time. Ongoing supervision may assist Mr Fisk by forcing that he does not engage in high risk behaviours at times when his own self-management is inadequate. Mr Fisk would benefit from ongoing therapeutic assistance to generalise treatment gains and alternative coping strategies, should he be amenable to such intervention. Assessment of suitability for antilibidinal medications may also be a prudent step in adding a physiological dimension to risk management. 
         
         
        In the event that Mr Fisk receives an extended supervision order, it is likely that he would be supervised by the Community Compliance Group. In terms of accommodation, my understanding is that Mr Fisk has been approved for the Community Offender Support Program (COSP) centre. The COSP is a residential facility operated by the Department of Corrective Services, designed to facilitate the temporary accommodation needs of offenders released from custody whilst subject supervision. The COSP can offer Mr Fisk a comprehensive level of support and supervision, assisting him to organise the logistic details required by offenders when they returned to community life. 
         
         
        It is recommended that any management plan be designed to be minimally restrictive, but rather to be supportive of and to encourage the establishment of a balanced and responsible lifestyle as reflected in Mr Fisk's Self Management Plan. The level of restriction and autonomy afforded to Mr Fisk should remain dynamic, reflecting changes in his own ability to manage his risk behaviour as evidenced by his behaviour over time. The Community Maintenance Program as offered in the Department of Corrective Services Sex Offender Programmes would be available to provide Mr Fisk with ongoing therapeutic assistance. 
         
        
       
       
        
      Static-99 
      
    61 In the body of his report Mr Sheehan refers to what he refers to as “static risk factors”. This risk of reoffending was assessed using an actuarial risk assessment, the Static-99. This assessment is described by Mr Sheehan as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……….. the Static-99 consists of 10 items and produces estimates of future risk based on a number of risk factors present in any one individual. The risk factors included in the assessment are the presence of prior sexual offences, having committed a current non-sexual violence offence, having a history of non-sexual violent offence, the number of previous sentencing dates, age less than 25 years old, having male victims, having never lived with a lover for two continuous years, having a history of non-contact sexual offences, having unrelated victims, and having stranger victims. This actuarial tool has moderate predictive accuracy. 
         
         
        The recidivism estimates provided by the Static-99 are group estimates based upon reconvictions and were derived from groups of individuals with these characteristics. As such, these estimates do not directly correspond to the recidivism risk of an individual offender. The offender's risk may be higher or lower than the probabilities estimated in the Static-99 depending on the other risk factors not measured by this instrument 
        
       
      
    62 As a result of the use of this assessment, the defendant was placed in the ""high risk category relative to other adult male sexual offenders"". Mr Sheehan wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Fisk scored an 8 on this instrument. Any score of 6 or over is within the high range. In the updated normative sample, the group sharing Mr Fisk’s characteristics, the rate of sexual recidivism ranged between 22.3 to 38.2 percent over five years, and between 30.8 to 48.5 percent over 10 years. The rate of violent recidivism for scores of ""8"" in the new sample ranged between 43.4 to 56.6 percent over five years, and between 55.1 to 62.9 percent over 10 years. 
         
        
       
       
      In cross–examination Mr Sheehan accepted that recidivism for the purpose of this assessment included reconviction of any type of sexual offending whether serious or not. 
       
       
        
      Relevance of age 
      
    63 Mr Sheehan commented on the relevance of the age of the defendant, who was 61 years at the date of the hearing. He wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Research into the effect of age on sexual recidivism is a relatively new and developing area. A number of studies suggest that for extra-familial child molesters the high-risk period is from the late 20s to the mid-40s, followed by a decline thereafter (Craig, 2008). Factors that may contribute to this decline include a reduction in sexual drive with age, increased self control, and fewer opportunities for developing relationships with children (Hanson, 2002). This reasoning implies that it is not age itself, but age related issues of lifestyle and physiological changes that may contribute to any proposed reduction in risk. The evidence from current research is limited to the extent that it is not possible to make any unqualified empirically-based statements about the influence of age-at-release on the risk of sexual reoffending for high-risk offenders at age-of-release 60 years or older, particularly when attempting to apply statistical trends to an individual (Doren, 2006). 
         
         
        Mr Fisk has reached the age of 60 years. In my opinion, I would be willing to consider an age-related adjustment of risk with Mr Fisk contingent on his sexual behaviour and general lifestyle as observed in the community after his release over a stable period of time. 
        
       
       
        
      Dynamic risk factors 
      
    64 Mr Sheehan referred to ""dynamic risk factors"" being those factors that are related to sexual recidivism and amenable to change. In his affidavit he states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Dynamic risk factors as those that relate to the offender's current psychological state and life circumstances. They can be considered ""live risk"" and can change over time and are therefore subject to intervention. 
        
       
      
    65 In his report Mr Sheehan wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………. dynamic risk factors provide specific information about the risk of the particular individual being assessed. Although actuarial assessment provides information about how similar a given individual is to a group of offenders who did reoffend, it does not provide any indications about whether the individual will be in the group of men who will reoffend or the group of men who will not reoffend. A greater number and severity of dynamic risk factors can indicate heightened active risk in that individual and would indicate the requirement for increased intensity in supervision and management. 
        
       
      
    66 The dynamic risk factors considered by Mr Sheehan were intimacy deficits, social influences, distorted attitudes, general self-regulation and sexual self-regulation. He points out that these factors were addressed within the CUBIT program. 
     
      
    67 In relation to ""social influences"" Mr Sheehan wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In contrast to his post release plan during CUBIT, Mr Fisk no longer plans to reside in Tasmania. He plans to reside in NSW whilst subject to supervision, and then relocate to Thailand in the long term. Whilst in NSW, Mr Fisk will have access to family and friends. From his description, his family and a few friends who have remained supportive over his years in prison, could be described as positive influences in that they are not known to have criminal histories and do not condone his offending. He explained that those who do consume alcohol are aware of his intention to abstain and have committed to support him in this regard. Should Mr Fisk focus on developing the social contacts after his release, he may build a social network associated with a more prosocial and law-abiding theme than his previous antisocial network. 
        
       
      
    68 In relation to ""sexual self-regulation"" Dr Sheehan wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In my experience, many offenders who offend against young persons are also capable of sexual attraction towards adults. This allows them to focus their sexual energies towards cultivating peer-aged sexual relationship should they choose to desist from sexual offending. In many cases this becomes a goal of treatment during and beyond psychotherapy. The problem with Mr Fisk's narrow bandwidth of sexual interest, is that it leaves him little scope for adaptive sexual expression. The strategy described by Mr Fisk is to either abstain from all sexual contact or to seek young-adult partners who have an immature physical appearance. 
         
         
        ………… 
         
         
        During interview, Mr Fisk described historical and recent situations when he declined the opportunity to have sexual contact with young males, both in prison and the community. From his description, there are times when he has a strong resolve in this regard. He has also described a recent platonic relationship with a youthful inmate in prison. He stated that although he felt confident that it was within his power to seduce this person, he fought the desire, reminding himself that he ""should not corrupt"" this person's innocence. He also reasoned that he believed he could not match such young person in sexual stamina. His description of this encounter gave some insight into the process by which Mr Fisk has traditionally become sexually involved with his partners. He described quickly developing an intense idealised infatuation with this person, ""I adored him, still do"". Maintaining the platonic boundaries caused inner turmoil for Mr Fisk. The inmate in question has since left custody and Mr Fisk inquired whether he might be permitted to have contact with him after release. This example may indicate that Mr Fisk has developed some internal resistance to engaging in sexual encounters that are not in his or others’ best interests. This may be protective, but it also points to Mr Fisk's ongoing vulnerability to developing potent romantic and idealised sexual attractions to young males (albeit of a legal age). 
        
       
       
        
      Post release requirements 
      
    69 In his affidavit Mr Sheehan addressed the need for supervision and support of the defendant when released from custody and stated  
     
      
       
        
         
        42. In my view when Mr Fisk is released from custody, supervisory conditions and monitoring would increase the likelihood of Mr Fisk being able successfully to manage his risk of sexual recidivism. Conversely, in my view supervisory conditions and monitoring would decrease the risk of Mr Fisk recidivating 
         
         
        43. Without intending to be exhaustive, recommended conditions would include conditions requiring Mr Fisk to accept ongoing psychological therapy (in terms of the community-based maintenance programme, discussed below), anti-libidinal medication if prescribed, as well as conditions providing for the support, monitoring and supervision of Mr Fisk. 
         
         
        …….. 
         
         
        45. It would also be recommended that, at least in the initial stages of any supervision period, Mr Fisk remains abstinent from alcohol. It would also be recommended that he not use illicit drugs. Both alcohol and illicit drugs are known as disinhibitors of inappropriate behaviour and can affect judgment, [and] as such, are problematic in the case of Mr Fisk. 
         
         
        ………. 
         
         
        55. In my view it would be important for Mr Fisk to continue to receive ongoing therapeutic assistance through the Forensic Psychology Services maintenance programme in order to assist him in managing his risk of re-offending and protect the community. 
        
       
       
        
      Cross-examination 
      
    70 In cross-examination, Mr Sheehan accepted that the defendant had been using an anti-depressant medication for at least 12 years and that he had reported low libido. However, he though that diminished libido was not uncommon for offenders who are under stress, for example while going to court or while undertaking treatment. He accepted that the defendant might be less likely to be aroused now than when he was offending. 
     
      
    71 He was taken to studies concerned with the rate of recidivism over age and agreed that generally they showed a decline in re-offending with an increase in age in the oldest aged groups. However he was not prepared on the present learning to make an actuarial assessment of reoffending according to the age of the defendant. He stood by what he had written in his report and that has been quoted above. He did accept that persons who have been subject to a treatment programme are statistically less likely to reoffend. 
     
      
    72 He was asked about the defendant’s plans to live in the country and he thought that this had the potential to be beneficial in the long term. He accepted that living in that situation would “represent less of a risk scenario than the lifestyle he was living in the 80’s”. 
     
      
       
      Dr Samuels 
      
    73 Dr Samuels was one of the two Court appointed psychiatrists. He made a report dated 13 May 2009. Amongst the material he considered was the affidavit of Mr Sheehan and his risk assessment report. 
     
      
       
        
        Offending behaviour 
        
       
      
    74 In his report Dr Samuels took a history from the defendant including an account of the time that he was living with another notorious sex offender, Phillip Bell, at Whale Beach. He said that at the time money was no object and they could do what they could not do at home. Dr Samuels went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He went on to say that the adolescent boys were ""part of our lives"". There was ""integration with the boys, we took them everywhere"". He went on to say, “There was no pressure, it just happened, it became a normality"". 
        
       
       
      And later: 
       
        
         
        He made an interesting comment about Philip Bell, saying that he became very angry with Philip Bell because he felt that he ""destroyed his boys"". He gave the example that Philip Bell took one of ""his boys"" to Switzerland to finish his education (with the boy's parents’ permission). He said the boy then returned to Australia and was put into Sydney Grammar and shortly after that died of a heroin overdose. He went on to say that Philip Bell tried some sort of ""Pygmalion act"" with this young man. 
         
         
        At this point I asked him if he thought any of his sexual encounters with the ""boys"" had had adverse consequences. It was clear that he found this very difficult to answer but eventually said, ""Yes, yes, yes"". I asked him to expand on this and all he could really tell me was that these encounters might have ""led to confusion about their sexual identity"". 
         
         
        He told me that he was ""never out of control with my sexuality"". He expanded on this by saying that he had never ""lunged at anybody"". He told me that all his sexual offending was planned. He said the biggest thrill was in ""grooming"". He said the sexual part had a short life. 
        
       
       
        
      Medical history 
      
    75 Under the heading ""Past Medical History"" Dr Samuels wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He denies any medical problems although he thinks that he has emphysema because of his heavy smoking. 
        
       
       
        
      Sexual offending treatments 
      
    76 Under the heading ""History of Sexual Offending Treatment"" Dr Samuels wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He tells me that he has completed the CUBIT programme and the maintenance programme and he feels he has benefited. He said after the events in 1989 he made a decision never to ""reoffend with a young person again"". He acknowledged that at the time these offences were happening he saw it as part of a ""lifestyle"". He did not see any particular adverse consequences to the young man involved. He said, ""I thought it was a normality of life"". 
         
         
        He told me that he was put on Androcur by Dr Olaf Neilssen. He said that he volunteered for this treatment because he wanted to feel what it was like. He said the combination of cyproterone acetate and his SSRI antidepressant Zoloft made him ""feel drained"" with ""no sexuality at all"". He said he was not able to get an erection. He said he felt ""no spark"". For these reasons he ceased the treatment and he does not feel there is any need for him to be on such treatment at this time. 
        
       
       
        
      Dynamic risk factors 
      
    77 Dr Samuels was asked to assess the defendant's risk of re-offending. He noted the Static-99 score and its interpretation in percentage terms. He then went on to consider the defendant’s dynamic risk factors. In his evidence he indicated that these were “a checklist of most of the factors that are known to be associated with sexual offending”. He described it as a “structured assessment”; the more risk factors the greater the risk. He stated in his report: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In terms of social influences, Mr Fisk made it clear that he has severed all contact with the group of people who supported what he describes as his ""lifestyle"". He states that his involvement with the police and the Woods Royal Commission has also ousted him from this group. He made it clear that he will not be mixing with anyone who has had involvement in such activities and I would see this as being positive. 
         
         
        I do believe that he still has some distorted attitudes and some intellectualisations and rationalisations about his previous offending behaviour and at some level still feels that his actions were justified and not particularly damaging. This raises some concerns. 
        
       
      
    78 Later he wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In terms of substance abuse, he acknowledges that in the past he did his alcohol to cope and abused marijuana. He states he has no desire to use the alcohol or marijuana. He says he has not used any substances for 12 years and he does not see himself as being at risk. He says if he was feeling at risk he would know how to access supports in the community. 
         
         
        Victim access I would see has been a significant issue and despite what Mr Fisk said, if he were placed unsupervised in a situation in which he had access to a young male in the age range with the physical characteristics that attract him I would have some concerns that he would not be able to exert the level of control that he states he has 
        
       
      
    79 Further he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Fisk certainly presents as being a charming and articulate man who has a history of possible conduct disturbance in childhood and apart from his sexual offending, some adult antisocial behaviour. There certainly are strong suggestions from his presentation that he may have some antisocial personality traits. He presents very well and he will have the capacity to convince family members, friends and some professionals that things are going well and this in fact may not be the case. He has been in custody for 12 years and has not had the opportunity to offend sexually or perhaps to use substances and it is only when he is back in the wider community that he will be subjected to these temptations and seem to me quite likely that he is underestimating his level of risk. 
        
       
       
        
      Risk of reoffending 
      
    80 Dr Samuels was asked to state his overall opinion as to his assessment of the defendant's level of risk of reoffending. He wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He has a substantial and longstanding history of sexual offending against a circumscribed group of young adolescent males. Infrastructure that supported his offending behaviour has been largely disbanded and many of the other protagonists are no longer alive. Mr Fisk has been involved in a number of events that may have changed some of his views relation to these issues. He has also spent 12 years in custody and has been through a treatment programme. His case is somewhat notorious and he will be subject to greater scrutiny in the community. He states he has found religion and has the ability to self regulate his sexual thoughts and feelings. He states that he is no longer reliant on alcohol and marijuana which may have been a factor in his offending in the past. He has however been in custody for the last 12 years and has not had the opportunity to access victims or to use substances. 
         
         
        Despite going to a program of therapy there are still some suggestions from his presentation that he has a level of denial about the consequences of his offending behaviour. He sees “hebephilic” behaviour as being somewhat different from ""paedophilic"" behaviour. I also get the impression that he sees his role in these events as perhaps being less significant than the parts played by others. 
         
         
        He does have some personality strengths and he does seem to have some genuine support in the community and is not without intellectual resources. 
         
         
        He has a high actuarial risk profile and although the Static-99 reflects a cohort of offenders and does not really give any information about individual offenders, I would see his score as being in keeping with his overall presentation. 
         
         
        Using a structured risk approach, the RSVP, a number of risk factors are highlighted which include chronic sexual violence, psychological coercion,………….., attitudes condoning sexual violence, problems with stress and coping, sexual abuse as a child, substance misuse, depression and anxiety, problems with intimacy, employment difficulties, non-sexual criminality, problems with treatment and supervision. 
         
         
        Therefore taking all these factors into account I think there is ""a sufficiently substantial probability"" that in the absence of appropriate supervision in the context of his support structures failing, mood instability, substance misuse and opportunity, he could commit a further serious sexual offence. 
         
         
        I have not particularly addressed the other static risk factor of age because this is a controversial entity and Mr Fisk continues to present as a fairly fit, healthy looking man. 
         
         
        As I have already noted, Mr Fisk is not keen to take anti-libidinal medication. I certainly would see the taking of such medication as being a highly protective factor and one that would substantially lower his risk of offending. 
        
       
      
    81 Later in his report Dr Samuels stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As I have already outlined, Mr Fisk sees his offending behaviour over 20 years or so as being part of ""a lifestyle"" which was perpetuated and maintained by the circle of friends that he was involved with. He sees this network as having now disbanded through the Woods Royal commission, the deaths of the various participants and exposure of the corruption in the NSW police force. He sees himself to some extent as having championed the Woods Royal Commission and being responsible in some way for its outcomes. He sees himself as being a pariah within the community of offenders and perhaps in the gay community as well. He indicated that he has changed in his thinking and simply states that he will not engage in sexual relationship with underage males and he believes he has enough supports and structures in place to prevent this happening. I continue to be left with the feeling that he employs a lot of intellectualisation, rationalisation and minimisation strategies in terms of his thinking. This was clearly a very well entrenched pattern of behaviour. He states that he enjoyed ""grooming"" can mean more than having sexual relationships with them. 
         
         
        I am left with some concerns that even in the context of the dissolution of his offending network and his increasing age, post release he could slip back into a very well entrenched pattern of behaviour which was not only part and parcel of his ""lifestyle"" but his identity as well. 
        
       
       
        
      Cross-examination 
      
    82 In cross-examination he was asked about the statement in his report that the defendant had “some personality strengths”. He was asked what the strengths were to which he referred. He answered: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He does have some interpersonal skills. He certainly has some social skills. He appears to have a capacity to get along with people. He obviously has maintained a relationship with [ ]. He presented in a very pleasant manner. When I challenged him in the course of my interview, even when I asked him questions that were reasonably confronting, he didn't seem to get perturbed or rattled by those questions. He obviously is intelligent. He has a record in the past of doing quite well in the various enterprises that he undertook. So that's really what I meant. 
        
       
      
    83 He was asked whether these were positive factors in terms of determining whether the defendant was likely to commit a further serious sex offence and he replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……… one of the problems about when you do any kind of risk assessment and you put all these factors in the mix, every factor has an upside and downside, and as much as interpersonal strengths like a good social skills, being articulate, having some charm, etc, etc, can be a positive attribute, it can equally be a negative attribute……. sex offenders who are particularly articulate, glib, charming, can appear to do very well in therapy, get on well with people who are running therapy groups, and it can itself be a risk factor. So the short answer is yes and no. 
        
       
       
        
      Relevance of age 
      
    84 He was asked about the effect of aging and accepted that aging does have a deleterious effect on sexual functioning, sexual arousal and sexual performance. But he was not prepared to make any general statements about the effects of aging on the risk of re-offending. Although he accepted that there was a correlation between age and reoffending, he thought that there were too many factors involved to be able to make any actuarial prediction about it. He said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        So in general terms I think we can say that ageing seems to be a factor that reduces risk, but how to scientifically apply that in terms of any actuarial measure we don't know, and certainly can be incorporated into clinical judgments. And then I think you have to move to the next factor which is if you know, if you have somebody who is older, and very medically unwell, immobile or in a wheelchair, those are all factors that you would think would reduce risk intuitively. If you have somebody who is in their 60s and fairly fit and healthy, one could say yes, it's likely that sexual functioning would be reduced compared to how they were when they were forty, but exactly how you put that into the mix is more difficult to determine from a scientific perspective.  
        
       
      
    85 Dr Samuels accepted as a general proposition that people mature and personally factors become less prominent with age and self-control increases. He was not so sure that opportunities to re-offend diminish with age.  
     
      
       
        
        The effect of treatment 
        
       
      
    86 He believed that the effect of treatment on recidivism was “modestly positive” but there was not a great difference between offenders who were treated and those who were not. In relation to the effect of treatment he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …………… I think the issue that probably separates our high risk offenders from the rest is actually that identification because once you have identified someone who is a high risk offender a whole lot of variables come into play and yes, they may have been through a cognitive behavioural programme and I am sure it doesn't do any harm. The question is whether it does any real good and whether it has any sustained effect. But I think when you are identified as a high risk offender there are a lot of interventions that are put in place and any and all and probably the cumulative effect of all of those interventions does make a difference and reduce the likelihood of offending, but it is hard to say that because you went through CUBIT you wouldn’t reoffend. It is a factor. 
        
       
      
    87 As to the fact that the defendant was apparently doing well in his current programme, Dr Samuels stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……… Mr Fisk is the kind of patient who will appear to do well in these sort of group programmes because he is articulate, he is personable, he gets on well with people and he will do well with the group process………some people really struggle with CUBIT because they have such poor social skills, they have low IQ, they don't know what is expected of them. People particularly with antisocial type personality features can do extremely well in these groups and make people believe that they really understand and know and have reformed their ways and understand, have victim empathy and know what to do in the context of relapse prevention, the but that may actually be a risk factor in itself because there is a false sense that they are doing very well. 
        
       
       
        
      Static-99 
      
    88 In relation to assessment tools such as the Static-99 Dr Samuels said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …… the problem with Static-99, and all of these measures, is they do not talk of Mr Fisk. They talk about a cohort of offenders, and its very difficult to make out a basis on an individual prediction, what it does show is that the risk, even though over 15 years it doesn't go away, that some people offend very late in the piece and, you know, we can take away all of these sophisticated measures and actuarial tools, it really comes down to one thing: that past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour. We can get very scientific about it but we know that Mr Fisk, before he was convicted, probably perpetrated many, many offences, and that's why he scores a higher score on the actuarial tool, because it's based on the past. It is difficult to predict the future. 
        
       
      
    89 When questioned about the value of Static-99 as a predictor of defendant’s risk of reoffending, Dr Samuels said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I do think that the most pertinent issue in terms of Mr Fisk's previous offending behaviour is the number of offences committed. The nature of the offences, I do think the minimisation of the offences is important. I think there's some protective factors, as I've said, he's been through CUBIT, he has had some support in the community, there may be health factors which are relevant. We don't really know at this point, but on balance I believe that without appropriate supervision, and the other issue is that Mr Fisk, I think there are other risk factors in terms of his - he is an articulate, presentable, educated man who has the ability to get on with people. I believe that without some form of supervision there is a high chance of him finding a potential victim, grooming the victim and getting involved in some kind of sexual activity with a victim who may be at a disadvantage…….. I think there is a high chance, based on his previous behaviour……… I would put it as being more likely than not, as over 50 percent. 
        
       
      
    90 The following questions and answers occurred in cross examination: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. .……… I'm saying that you your opinion, that he has a sufficiently substantial probability of committing a further serious sex offence if he is not supervised depends on your belief that either his support structures will fail or he will misuse a substance which I assume is alcohol or drugs and have the opportunity to do so? 
         
         
        A. You are right. I mean that's the point, isn't it. That's why we do risk assessment. Again, I'm not a crystal ball gazer, I can't predict risk. We assess risk, and the reason why we assess risk is to put structures in place to manage the risk, and I'm saying that I've identified a risk and that risk that may or may not eventuate. It may eventuate in four years, it may only eventuate in five years. 
         
         
        Q. Or never eventuate? 
         
         
        A. Or will never eventuate, that's right, but the chances, the way of ameliorating the risks that you've identified is to put a risk management strategy in place, and I think it would be foolhardy not to put a risk management structure in place. 
         
        
       
       
      Dr Ellis 
      
    91 Dr Ellis was the other Court appointed psychiatrist who reported on the defendant. His report is dated 20 May 2009 and was based on a consideration of a large amount of material including the affidavit and report of Mr Sheehan and a two-hour interview with the defendant. 
     
      
       
        
        Medical history 
        
       
      
    92 Under the heading “Medical History” Dr Ellis reported: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He has elevated cholesterol and takes medication for this. He believes that he had been diagnosed with emphysema and this is the cause of his breathlessness. He has been diagnosed with sleep apnoea and has been given a continuous positive airway pressure machine to use at night, however he does not avail himself of this. He is unaware if he has high blood pressure and does not have diabetes. 
         
         
        He has a history of surgical repair for a hernia. He is being investigated for a testicular mass. 
         
         
        There is no history of epilepsy, no serious loss of consciousness or cranial infection. There is no history of cerebrovascular disease of cardiovascular disease. 
         
         
        He has no known allergies. 
        
       
       
        
      Offending conduct 
      
    93 Under the heading “Account Of Offending Behaviour"" Dr Ellis wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He gives an account of the offences consistent with that described in the fact sheets and victim statements. He reports that the victims to him represented some form of emotional security and he believes that he needed them in order to remain emotionally stable. He admits to sexual arousal to the young male victims. He reports that over time the ""sexual thing"" faded for him. He can see that others would view this differently and admits that he sought out encounters with vulnerable young men in order to seek sexual gratification. He reports that he saw himself caring for these young males during adolescence and that this was a heavy burden of responsibility that he would not wish to repeat. 
         
         
        Of note in the offences there is similarity between the offences over a number of years. Of note is the use of simultaneous enticements such as boats, motorcycles and lifestyle to encourage young males in sexual activity as well as threats of violence and actual violence in order to secure complicity. Also of note is the use of alcohol and cannabis in order to intoxicate young males and the co-opting and coercion of parental complicity. 
         
         
        Since completing the CUBIT programme Mr Fisk identifies that he is better able to empathise with others and no longer sees sex with young boys as a ""divine right"" that he is entitled to. He reports that he feels less entitled about most areas of his life now. He reports he no longer believes it is acceptable to have sexual romantic relationships with adolescent males. He reports that he used the excuse that they were pubescent to make it acceptable to him. He reports that the kind of activity that he engaged in can significantly damage other people psychologically. 
        
       
       
        
      Risk of reoffending 
      
    94 Under the heading ""Re: Risk of Commission of Further Sexual Offence"" Dr Ellis wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        With current risk assessment technologies in behavioural science it is not possible to determine whether an individual person will reoffend with a sexual offence. Actuarial measures such as the Static-99 are able to allocate individuals with particulars characteristics to risk groups, and those groups have been identified as possessing greater or lesser numbers of persons within the group has reoffending. This particular scale has been replicated in different populations in Europe, Western Australia and North America. The difficulty with the use of this sort of instrument is that it does not discriminate between those in the particular risk group who do reoffend than those who do not. There are 10 items on the scale, scored according to a manual. Corrective Services reports rate Mr Fisk as 8 on the scale placing him in the ""high risk"" group. 
         
         
        I am in agreement with a total score obtained by Corrective Services filed reports. Scores above 6 on this scale are considered high risk…………… 
         
         
        ………….. 
         
         
        Clinical considerations in regard to risk of reoffending include sexual deviance, personality factors, substance dependence and access to criminal networks and resources. 
         
         
        Deviant sexual arousal is consistently identified as a risk factor for sexual reoffence. Mr Fisk reports a history of sexual arousal to stimuli directly linked to offending behaviour. He would meet diagnostic criteria for paraphilia. This has likely been attenuated by age, physical poor health and use of SSRI medication. It would be advisable that he continue with medication in the order to attenuate any deviant arousal he experiences. 
         
         
        Antisocial personality orientation is another factor consistently identified with sexual reoffence. He is diagnosed with the personality disorder with predominantly narcissistic and borderline traits……………….. there is therefore need to continually address personality function as part of the ongoing treatment process, which can occur from group and individual interventions, as well as attenuate overtime. 
         
         
        Substance abuse disorders unless consistently related to sexual reoffending, however appear to be related in this case insofar as disinhibiting behaviour in both Mr Fisk and his victims. He will require ongoing monitoring of substance use and assistance in maintaining abstinence. Ongoing substance use impairs the potential impact of therapeutic interventions. Whilst abstinent from a significant period in prison, he has not undertaken substance use treatment programs, despite previous heavy use. This may indicate poor insight into previous use. He was not able to articulate strategies to avoid use other than to say that substance use is not a problem for him now. 
         
         
        Mr Fisk's offending relied to some extent on connection with criminal networks and access to material goods in order to attract victims and coopt the complicity of parents. If he no longer has access to these resources his ability to perpetrate similar offences would be more limited. 
         
         
        His age has been suggested as an ameliorating factor in regards to recidivism. The research in this area is limited. Studies available show very low rates of reoffending in persons over 60 in general, however absolute numbers are low in the way these findings can be generalised is limited. Specific factors in his case related to age had been noted in terms of deviant arousal and personality function. 
         
         
        Overall in considering actuarial and clinical parameters Mr Fisk would be considered in a group of persons at high risk of sexual re-offence. It is a matter for the courts to determine if this is structured clinical appraisal meets the legal threshold of ""likely"" as defined in the available case law. 
         
        
       
      
    95 In relation to the medication that the defendant has taken or presently does take, Dr Ellis reported: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In regard to SSRI medication (sertraline) Mr Fisk describes that he has lowered libido although not completely gone as when taking cyproterone. He does not experience erections in the morning. He reports that he masturbates about once a fortnight and experiences painful masturbation and testicular pain possibly due to a hydrocele (testicular lump) which requires further investigation. 
        
       
       
        
      Post release conditions 
      
    96 Under the heading ""Re: Proposed Conditions if Released on Extended Supervision"" Dr Ellis wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……… my clinical recommendations are that he should attend on a group based sex offender treatment group, have regular psychiatric review and medication for depression and/or antilibidinal medication as he consents to. Assessment should be undertaken for suitability for individual psychological interventions aimed at mood management and personality function. He should attend on substance use education and counselling, and take anticraving medication as agreed to by him and his doctors. He should undergo regular and random drug testing and breathalyser examinations. He should engage a GP and allow communication between his GP, psychiatrist and therapists. 
        
       
       
        
      Cross-examination 
      
    97 During cross-examination Dr Ellis was asked whether he was able to say if it were more probable than not that the defendant would commit a further serious sexual offence within the next five years. He answered: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I think that for a psychiatrist or any other scientist to reliably predict human behaviour is beyond the scope of the science that is available. What we are looking at is what is called a dichotomous variorum where you have got one outcome or another outcome. We can predict with reasonable certainty how many persons in a group will offend in a particular timeframe. Predicting whether an individual falls into one variable or another is beyond the scope of what I could predict, but I could determine which group of persons fit into and the percentage chance or the number of people in that group which would reoffend…………. and in this case, the updated references for the Static-99 indicate that the group that Mr Fisk falls into have a re-offending rate between 22 percent and 38 per cent but that data has not been subject to the full peer review that the old data for the Static-99 was, so there are still questions about that data that are yet to be answered. So I think that probably the only correct answer from the scientific point of view that I could give you is that, no, I can't really predict which way or the other. I can come at it by another version look at a group of people with similar characteristics and see how many of them would re-offend within a particular timeframe. 
        
       
       
        
      Relevance of age 
      
    98 He was asked why he was of the opinion that the defendant's age attenuated his sexual deviance risk factor. He replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I think in your previous cross examination you identified some evidence in a scientific literature that there’s fairly low documented cases of persons over the age of 60 re-offending in a sexual manner and there's a number of theories as to why that is. One is that there is a decrease in the general levels of sexual arousal. One is that there is a decrease in impulsivity and better regulation of emotional states as people get older and there may be some learning effects as people get older. So there's biological factors, there’s factors within a person's psychological make-up and there are socially learnt factors that contribute order postulated to contribute to that observation that the rate of sexual recidivist offending in older people is very low………… 
        
       
       
      Dr Ellis also thought that the defendant’s personality disorder may have decreased in intensity over time. 
       
       
       
       
        
      Relevance of treatment 
      
    99 He was asked about the relevance of the fact that the defendant had been involved in CUBIT and on a maintenance programme. Dr Ellis answered: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ….. what the evidence shows is that people who complete a sex offender treatment programme like CUBIT have lower rates of offending than people who don't. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is the treatment that is the important variable in the difference between the two. It could well be that it is the type of person that completes the program and that's what, although literature has, there are a number of meta analyses showing that there is a difference between the treated group and the untreated group, a large criticism in the literature is that it doesn't, untreated group includes a lot of people who may well have risk factors different to the treated group and the sort of example is that if I had a treatment to prevent heart attacks but never gave that treatment to smokers and diabetics I would show very low rate of heart attacks in the treatment group. So having completed the treatment programme is a marker of being a lower risk. Whether it actually reduces the risk from what was already existent I think is the big question. 
        
       
       
      Ms Youssef 
      
    100 A report was tendered on behalf of the defendant from Carollyne Youssef, a forensic psychologist who works with the Department. The report was dated 24 July 2009 and concerned the maintenance programme in which the defendant had been participating since 17 June 2009. The purpose of the programme is set out in the report as being “to promote the successful generalisation of skills learned in treatment to the community by providing follow-up sexual offender services to offenders who have completed a sex offender treatment program (i.e. CUBIT)”. The programme involves group sessions of two hours duration led by a psychologist employed by the Department. 
     
      
    101 The defendant had been attending the group on a weekly basis and had not missed any sessions. At the time of the making of the report he had participated in five sessions. The report states that the defendant ""participates and engages well in group and appears forthcoming with information”. He had indicated that he was finding the group useful in ""supporting him and providing him with coping strategies as well as reinforcing the knowledge and skills learned in CUBIT"". 
     
      
    102 The report contains the following two paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Fisk has also discussed issues pertaining to his inappropriate sexual interest in young males and this is an issue being addressed in group, as this is deemed an important issue for the purpose of maintenance. Mr Fisk appears to be attempting to appropriately manage these feelings and thoughts. In addition, Mr Fisk has mentioned concerns regarding his residence at the Community Offender Support Program (COSP) Centre. Given the purpose of maintenance however, the focus is redirected to Mr Fisk's coping strategies in dealing with such stressful states. Mr Fisk was also advised to report some of his concerns to the COSP psychologist. Although Mr Fisk reported that his sleep has been disrupted (due to noise) and reported a strong desire to reside at the [ ] property, he reported that he is managing his stress by using a variety of coping strategies (i.e. relaxation, positive thinking, talking to others). He also did not report a risk of harm to himself or to others. 
         
         
        In summary, Mr Fisk has expressed feeling ""stressed"" and ""frustrated"" about being in the COSP, however he appears to be managing these stressors well and appeared receptive to feedback and advice from others. He has indicated that he is future-focused and is going to work towards his goals. I have not performed any specific assessments to assess potential issues such as anxiety and/or depression for Mr Fisk as I did not deem this to be necessary given that he appeared to be managing the stressors appropriately. Further to this, as stated above, my role as the maintenance psychologist is to maintain treatment gains, by helping the men generalise the skills learned in custody to the community and support reintegration into the community, with a particular focus on issues related to risk of sexual reoffending. This is the focus of the maintenance groups, bearing in mind that it is a two hour group with 10-12 men at any one time. 
         
        
       
       
      Future Residence 
      
    103 There was a considerable amount of evidence concerning the present residence of the defendant under the conditions of the interim supervision order and his future residence if the Court were satisfied that it should make an extended supervision order. 
     
      
    104 The defendant is currently residing in premises under the control of the Community Compliance Group (“the CCG”) of the Department. He has resided there since his release in May under the conditions specified in the interim supervision order. 
     
      
    105 The CCG is responsible for monitoring the compliance of persons who are subject to community-based orders, such as orders made under the Act and certain parolees, and assists in the case management of such persons. Officers in the group conduct compliance checks of these persons including visual and electronic surveillance, unscheduled attendances and random drug and alcohol testing. They are also involved in case management. 
     
      
    106 The State submits that the defendant’s residence should remain effectively under the control of the Department by making it subject to approval by a Departmental officer, such as a parole officer or an officer of the CCG. This is on the basis that the community can only be sufficiently protected by both the further rehabilitation of the defendant through the ready availability of treatment programmes and control of the defendant by the opportunity to monitor the defendant’s behaviour wherever and whenever the Departmental officers think it appropriate. 
     
      
    107 The defendant is presently housed at a COSP centre. This is a type of halfway house where persons are required to reside while under some form of conditional liberty, such as bail, probation or parole. It is designed to provide accommodation for 3 to 6 months before other accommodation that is considered suitable to the particular offender can be provided. 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Rowan 
        
       
      
    108 The person in charge of the centre on a day-to-day basis is Gavin Rowan. He gave evidence in these proceedings. In his first affidavit dated 4 May 2009 he expressed the opinion that, subject to any developments, the defendant would reside at the COSP centre for a period of about 6 months. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I would regard it as very important that, were he to be released on a supervision order, Mr Fisk reside at the COSP in the initial stages of his reintegration into the community in order to try to assist with a structured transition from life in custody to life in the community. It should be noted, however, that COSP centres are not operated by prison officers and there would be no physical restraints to prevent Mr Fisk from leaving the COSP centre if he decided to do so. 
        
       
      
    109 Mr Rowan opposed the defendant residing at the country property because he was concerned that the property was too far away to permit appropriate supervision of the defendant by the CCG, was too distant from available treatment options, that the property was isolated and that having regard to its access road there would be difficulties in accessing the property in wet weather. 
     
      
    110 This Rowan stated in this affidavit: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I expect that the CCG will conduct a comprehensive review after about six months. This will involve discussions with the various officers responsible for his day to day supervision and electronic monitoring (if that is ordered), with Mr Fisk’s treating psychologist in the community based maintenance programme, and any other relevant treating therapists. The purpose of this review will be to determine how Mr Fisk has responded to treatment and is compliance with existing supervision arrangements, and identifying any additional risk factors. 
        
       
      
    111 In his affidavit dated 1 July 2009 Mr Rowan set out the difficulties he envisaged in the nearest CCG centre to the property where the defendant proposes to reside being able sufficiently to monitor and supervise the defendant due to present numbers of staff at that centre. He believed that the earliest date by which adequate staffing could be achieved at this centre would be September of this year. Further the additional staff would require training for between 2-3 months after commencing employment. Mr Rowan believed that, if the defendant were permitted to reside at the country property, he would be a ""considerable drain"" on the resources of the available CCG centre and would divert staff from supervision and monitoring of other offenders and programmes for which they are responsible. 
     
      
    112 I am prepared to accept his evidence and I do not underestimate the impact of the defendant’s residence at the country property. But it is only one of the factors to be considered in determining what condition, if any, is to be made, upon the place of residence of the defendant. There are in my view countervailing considerations that favour the defendant residing at his preferred location that I will consider shortly. 
     
      
       
      Ms Williams 
      
    113 Some investigation has been made of the appropriateness of the defendant’s preferred residence and Darelle Williams gave evidence of it. She has visited the property and formed concerns about its suitability for the proper monitoring of the defendant’s behaviour. She believed that access to the property would hinder unannounced spot checks upon the defendant. She was also of the opinion that the closest CCG centre did not presently have the capacity to supervise and monitor the defendant if he resided at those premises. 
     
      
    114 Ms Williams had attended the property on one occasion and spoke with the owner, the person with whom the defendant wishes to reside. Following this inspection of the property she remained of the view that it was unsuitable. However, the evidence is that the defendant can be subject to electronic monitoring on the property and he has been permitted to go there on some weekends since his release from prison. 
     
      
       
        
        The property owner 
        
       
      
    115 I received evidence from the owner of the property where the defendant would propose to live if he were permitted to do so. She is an apparently responsible person who is aware of the defendant’s criminal history although not of its detail. She has read parts of the report of Dr Ellis. She will not charge the defendant rent but he will assist her in tasks on the property. She is prepared to physically assist the defendant fulfil the requirements of any conditions imposed upon him which would require him to leave the property to attend treatment programmes and the like at least until the defendant obtains his driving licence. She has undertaken to report any breaches of the conditions of an order. She does not believe that there will be any difficulty for officers of the Department accessing the property. There is both a landline and mobile phone reception on the property. 
     
      
       
      The Defendant  
      
    116 The defendant gave evidence before me. He is presently aged 61. He made an affidavit dated 3 June 2009. That affidavit contains the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
         
        3. I have no intention of committing any further sexual offence. I no longer desire to mix with sex offenders. I no longer have any desire to mix with, associate with or have sex with adolescent males. 
         
         
        4. I no longer believe it is acceptable to have sexual or romantic relationships with adolescent boys. I no longer believe it is acceptable to groom adolescent males for such relationships. 
        
       
      
    117 The balance of the affidavit is in effect a commentary by the defendant upon the likely conditions of a supervision order most of which he would be prepared to comply with. He notes that he is taking an anti-depressant drug. Although he voluntarily took an anti-libidinal medication for a period, under medical supervision, he believed that it resulted in exaggerated feelings of depression and hopelessness. He also stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I have had a testicular problem for many years. I only have one testicle. My left testicle is inflamed and I often experience significant pain. That is another reason why I have a low libido. I experience significant pain upon arousal. 
        
       
       
        
      Electric monitoring 
      
    118 In respect of conditions in relation to the wearing of electronic monitoring equipment the defendant indicated he was willing to comply with these conditions if they were imposed but asked that they be imposed for the minimum possible period and for no longer than 12 months. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The reasons I do not agree with the imposition of these conditions are as follows. Firstly I have worn the electronic anklet bracelet and a monitor since I left jail on 12 May 2009. I find that the electronic bracelet is uncomfortable to wear, particularly when I am sleeping and I try to turnover. Secondly, the electronic monitoring equipment often malfunctions. The signal on the equipment sometimes states ""current location not identified"" because the equipment cannot receive the proper signal. The malfunctions occur when I am in shopping centres malls (sic), or certain buildings. Thirdly, wearing the electronic monitoring equipment makes me feel like I am still in jail. I feel harnessed to the equipment. I feel that the authorities do not trust me. It diminishes my self esteem. 
         
        
       
       
        
      Future residence 
      
    119 In relation to a condition requiring him to reside at an address approved by officers of the Department the defendant stated that he ""strongly desire(s)” to reside at his preferred place of residence. In relation to his present accommodation he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In my opinion, residing at those premises hinders my ability to adapt back into the community. I am living with other men who have committed sexual offences. A number of residents continue to have a sexual interest in adolescent men, which I do not share. It is unhealthy being around such people. I have previously decided that I do not want to associate with other sex offenders and yet I am now required to do so. I do not have a friendship with any of the people with whom I live. There are a number of mentally ill residents whom I find intimidating. I was told by a fellow resident ""to watch my back"". I am unable to isolate myself from those persons. I was better able to isolate myself when I was in jail. Also, I am unable to relax and there is continuous noise. 
         
        
       
       
      He stated that since being at this residence his mental health has declined, he felt anxious and has lost weight. He claims it interfered with his sleeping patterns and he suffers from fatigue 
       
      
    120 Further he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I found it demoralising, demeaning, we're treated like children by the staff, we're not trusted at all. Medication is dispensed to us through a shatterproof window, where the staff spend a great deal of the day. And the tension in general is very high. 
        
       
       
      In cross-examination he said that he saw COSP “as an extension of prison”. 
       
       
        
      Alcohol and drugs 
      
    121 In relation to a condition requiring that the defendant not consume alcohol or illicit drugs, the defendant stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I agree not to consume illicit drugs or abuse prescription medication however I wish to be able to have a glass or two of wine with a meal occasionally without drinking to excess. I undertake not to become intoxicated. 
        
       
      
    122 In evidence he said that he has not consumed alcohol or illicit drugs since being in custody. He said he had no longer any desire to drink alcohol notwithstanding what he had said in his affidavit about wishing to drink with a meal. He was asked about this in cross-examination as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. In your affidavit, you said that you wished to be able to have a glass or two of wine with a meal occasionally, without drinking to excess? 
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. But you now tell, you told his Honour this morning that you won't do that?  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. What occurred, between the time you swore the affidavit on 3 June 2009 and today, to change your mind about whether it would be a good idea to drink a couple of glasses of wine?  
         
        A. Having a couple of glasses of wine, to be civilized over dinner, is not enough reason as to why I should have it.  
         
         
        HIS HONOUR 
         
         
        Q. What you are being asked is, how did you change your mind? Why did you come to a different view now than you apparently did when you made your affidavit?  
         
        A. Yes, your Honour. I don't want you to think that I have an alcohol problem. I am not alcohol reliant.  
         
         
        Q. So this is something that you decided might influence me?  
         
        A. Mm mm. I can well go without alcohol, your Honour. I have not craved for it, ever. It was binge drinking and it was the society I was involved with.  
         
        
       
       
      He said that he did not believe that he had a problem with alcohol and this is the reason he has chosen not to undertake any counselling about it at COSP. 
       
       
        
      Medical condition 
      
    123 He gave oral evidence about his medical condition. He has sciatica pain in his left leg that is treated with painkillers. He suffers from emphysema that leaves him short of breath when doing physical work. He also has testicular pain particularly when he is aroused such that he has to lie down. He stated that he was “very rarely” aroused and it might be once a month when he is watching a movie or reminiscing on past sexual experiences. Because of his difficulties sleeping at the COSP establishment he was taking a very mild sedative. 
     
      
    124 He was questioned in cross-examination about his failure to mention to Dr Samuels that he suffered from testicular pain. He said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Your Honour, one thing I noticed about the interview with Dr Samuels, and I don't think he wanted to be there, I mean it was - it was conducted in such a way that I was not forthcoming with a lot of things because he didn't ask me a lot of questions. 
        
       
      
    125 I do not believe this answer. Although it was put to Dr Samuels in cross-examination that he had interviewed the defendant for a very short period and hence did not obtain all the information he might have, it was never suggested that in some way he was not interested in interviewing the defendant or did so under sufferance. Such a suggestion would have been nonsense. I believe that the defendant was attempting to use this implicit criticism made of Dr Samuels in cross-examination to his advantage in answering this question. 
     
      
       
        
        Cross-examination 
        
       
      
    126 He was cross-examined about a statement he allegedly made to Mr Rowan that he had been advised that he only needed to go for maintenance sessions once a month because he was doing so well. He denied that he had suggested that attendance at the sessions was to be reduced because he was doing well but because of where he was intending to live. 
     
      
    127 I do not believe this answer. I do not accept that Mr Rowan would have been mistaken in this regard. 
     
      
    128 He was asked about whether he had told Ms Youseff that the person he hoped to live with worked with victims of sexual abuse. He did not deny saying that although he sought to explain it on the basis that he was mistaken. The following questions and answers were given: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. So it wasn't the case that you suggested to a CCG officer that [ ] worked with victims of sexual abuse in the hope that it might give them some confidence that her supervision of you would be over and above what one would expect of a layperson?  
         
        A. It could be seen that way, yes.  
         
         
        Q. And I suggest to you that that's why you said that to the CCG officer?  
         
        A. I may have. I can't recall what the intention was then.  
         
        
       
      
    129 He was asked about his evidence that he became sexually aroused when watching movies. The questions and answers were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. And what sort of movies are they?  
         
        A. Normally SBS movies.  
         
         
        Q. And what is depicted on the movies which tends to make you sexually aroused?  
         
        A. I might add here - before I answer that, if I may - it is never any excessive arousal, it is a partial arousal. I'm not--  
         
         
        Q. Sorry, I don't understand the distinction?  
         
        A. There is a distinction.  
         
         
        Q. What do you mean by a ""partial arousal""?  
         
        A. It is maybe habit forming. It is a flippant arousal, I don't know what you like to call it. It is not a passionate arousal, which I knew in my youth. It is - how can I say it - it is of no real meaning to me now. I just do it. A habit, maybe.  
         
         
        Q. When you answered his Honour's question saying you became sexually aroused when watching a movie, did you mean by that that you have an erection when you watch a movie?  
         
        A. No, no. I didn't mean that at all.  
         
         
        Q. What do you mean by sexual arousal when watching a movie?  
         
        A. It was not so much physical, it was mental arousal, the appreciation of the beauty. I'm not one hundred percent sure, but it certainly wasn't sexual.  
         
         
        Q. Are there any physical manifestations of what you mean by sexual arousal, say, when you are watching a movie?  
         
        A. Yes, there is the artistic form of the individual.  
         
         
        Q. Sorry, I meant physical manifestations in you as distinct from the object of your viewing?  
         
        A. No, it's more of the mind.  
         
         
        Q. Do you ever get an erection when you are sexually aroused?  
         
        A. Occasionally, but seldom, because it leads to pain. 
         
        
       
      
    130 He was asked about his views as to the effects of his offences on the victims. He said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I believe that they would have been profound, the effects would have been profound, would certainly have confused their sexuality and with some effects that are felt now, adverse effects. 
        
       
      
    131 He was asked when he came to this opinion and he stated in 1989 when he moved away from his former associates and went “out of Sydney with a young friend of mine”. He then admitted that this “young friend” was the person he had described as a “ward”, but was in reality one of his victims. He was referred to a letter he had written in late 2000 to a person at the Victims Compensation Tribunal. The letter is full of abuse towards both the Tribunal and the complainants. For example it refers to the payment of “blood money” to the “falsely aggrieved”. He described them as “low lives” and that he had no choice but to plead guilty because it was impossible to get a fair trial. He said that notwithstanding that he believed great harm had been done to the victims his “bitterness and anger at the monetary aspect of this is what motivated me to write this letter”. 
     
      
    132 The following questions and answers followed: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. It goes a little further than that, doesn't it? I mean, it is not a letter just simply sounding off about the awarding of compensation, it goes deeper than that?  
         
        A. Yes, your Honour it goes deeper than that, it goes to the solicitation by the police.  
         
         
        Q. No, more than that?  
         
        A. And I applied to a level of who was a victim and who was not a victim in life, that's what I had looked at at the time and how I felt the money could have been better spent with my own victims in Cambodia, which I haven't mentioned yet.  
         
         
        Q. This is part of Buddhist belief is it, this letter?  
         
        A. I was looking at belief, in a worldly situation, who are victims and who are not victims.  
         
         
        Q. Well, that doesn't come across here, does it?  
         
        A. Mm.  
         
         
        Q. Where is that?  
         
        A. I thought I put something in here with that, sorry your Honour.  
         
         
        Q. It is here about you going into your Buddhist monastic life in Asia.  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Where is there anything in this letter that indicates that what you were concerned about is the fact these people have been paid, rather than the poor Cambodians?  
         
        A. My concern was, the money could have been better spent elsewhere.  
         
         
        Q. Where is that in this letter?  
         
        A. I thought I put it in there, I obviously didn't.  
         
         
        Q. You read the letter, don't let me lead you into accepting statements that are not correct. You read the letter.  
         
        A. Alright, your Honour (defendant appeared to read letter). No, you are right, I didn't put it in there.  
         
        
       
      
    133 This evidence was clearly to my mind untrue.  
     
      
       
        
        State’s Submissions 
        
       
      The making of an order 
      
    134 The State relied upon the opinion of Dr Samuels that there was a high risk of the defendant re-offending if unsupervised and that he was prepared to state the risk as being greater than 50 percent. It was his opinion that the best predictor of future conduct was past behaviour. The State noted that Dr Samuels had been appointed as one of the Court’s independent experts and submitted that there was no reason to diminish the validity of his opinion simply because he happened to have given opinions in other cases that the particular person had a high risk of re-offending. 
     
      
    135 The State referred to Dr Ellis’ evidence that the defendant was in a group of persons at high risk of re-offending, even though he was not prepared to make an assessment of the likelihood of the risk. It was submitted that his evidence was of limited value to the Court. 
     
      
    136 It was noted that the Static-99 had limitations as a predictor in that: (a) it relates to groups rather than individuals; (b) does not adequately differentiate between the number of offences committed; (c) it purports to measure the chance of re-convictions rather than offending acts; (d) it covers sexual offences generally without discriminating between their seriousness; (e) It covers a range of deviant behaviour including rape and incest as well as paedophilia; and (f) it has modest predictive power. It was submitted that there was little weight to be given to the percentage of re-offending in five years determined under the instrument, 22.8 per cent to 38.2 per cent. It was submitted that it should be treated as simply one of the factors to be considered by the Court. 
     
      
    137 The State pointed to the fact that, although studies had shown a negative correlation between age and risk of re-offending, the effect of age on sexual recidivism is unclear. Neither Dr Ellis nor Mr Sheehan were prepared to make an actuarial allowance or adjustment for age. However Dr Samuels was prepared to consider it as a factor. 
     
      
    138 It was submitted that the Court should have little regard to the health of the defendant as indicative of a lower risk of re-offending as they were of little relevance. The State points to the fact that in the defendant’s case it was not so much the sexual acts from which he derived the most pleasure, but it was the grooming of the victims and his state of health would not inhibit this behaviour. 
     
      
    139 The State submitted that the fact that the defendant had undergone treatment should be treated with some caution particularly insofar as it relies upon victim empathy as an indicator of changed attitude, and referred to the evidence relating to the letter written in 2000 to the Victims Compensation Tribunal. 
     
      
    140 The State argued that the Court would not accept the defendant as a credible witness in light of his evidence given in these proceedings. 
     
      
     
     
      
       
      Place of residence 
      
    141 The State submits that the residence of the defendant should be under the control of the Department for the period of the order. It points to the fact that this has been the condition imposed in other supervision orders. It argues that it is the only suitable way to properly monitor and control the defendant and ensure the safety of the public. 
     
      
    142 In effect it argues that the country property is too remote and does not sufficiently provide for the principal objective of the act that is the protection of the public through supervision. It points to the fact that Dr Ellis’ preference for the country property is as a treating psychiatrist for the benefit of the defendant but this Court has a wider concern which may or may not intersect with what is best for the defendant or his preference. It is submitted that the property is too distant for the defendant to be able to attend the maintenance program. 
     
      
    143 The State submits that the defendant’s complaints about the COSP accommodation are really matters of his comfort and should be given little weight having regard to the importance of that residence for controlling him even if it should pose a risk, albeit a slight one, of interference with his rehabilitation for a short period. This is particularly so having regard to the fact that the defendant had been in custody for the last 12 years. 
     
      
    144 The State relies upon the evidence of Mr Rowan and Ms Williams as to the lack of available staff at the CCG centre nearest the country property and that the residence of the defendant at that property would divert those present staff members from their function in regard to other offenders. 
     
      
    145 It reminded the Court of what Mason P said in Winters v Attorney General (NSW) (2008) 182 A Crim R 107 at [123] that the availability of resources is a matter to be taken into consideration in determining whether to make an order for continuing detention. His honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Act does not state that the Government must fund any and every condition of an extended supervision order devised with a view to provision of adequate supervision. Courts should not make orders knowing that they are likely to be futile. 
        
       
      
    146 The State is concerned that the location of the country property may provide the opportunity to the defendant to come into contact with young males because it is relatively close to a place that is a popular holiday destination. 
     
      
    147 It is submitted that the owner of the property is an unsuitable person to supervise the defendant. There will be periods when he will be alone at the property. It is argued that the owner has insufficient knowledge of the way that the defendant has offended and, therefore, cannot be sufficiently aware of suspicious conduct. Although she acknowledged that he has been manipulative in the past and has lied, she believes that this is not now the situation and that he will not reoffend. It is put that, because of her reliance upon the defendant if he lives with her, the Court could not accept her undertaking to report any breaches, as she would not be dispassionate or independent. Reference was made to the comments of the Full Court of the Family Court in B and B (1993) FLC 92-357 made in relation to supervision of access. 
     
      
    148 It was submitted that the Court could not be satisfied that the high risk of the defendant reoffending could be adequately managed if the defendant was permitted to reside at the country property. 
     
      
       
        
        The defendant’s submissions 
        
       
      The making of an order 
      
    149 The defendant tendered a number of journal articles in relation to the prediction of the risk of re-offending. These were discussed with the experts during cross-examination and the subject of submissions on behalf of the defendant. 
     
      
    150 The defendant submits that the Court could not be satisfied on any test of the likelihood of further reoffending by the defendant. He relies upon the opinion of Dr Ellis that risk assessment does not allow such a prediction and Dr Samuels’ evidence of the difficulties in nominating when any reoffending might occur. He refers to the very modest predictive power of Static-99. 
     
      
    151 It was argued that the Court should accept and act upon the evidence of Dr Ellis because of his expertise in the area and yet he was unable to conclude that there was sufficient probability that the defendant would commit a relevant offence in the next five years. He relied upon the evidence set out in [93] above that he thought prediction of human behaviour was beyond the scope of present science. 
     
      
    152 In support of the stance taken by Dr Ellis the defendant relied upon an article by Smallbone and Ransley entitled “Legal and Psychological Controversies in Preventive Incapacitation of Sexual Offenders” (2005) 28(1) UNSWLJ 299. The authors considered the limits on reliable predictions of reoffending in relation to “preventative incapacitation pollicies” such as behind the Act under which the current proceedings have been brought. They state: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……….Recent sexual offender recidivism and risk prediction research indicates that: 
         
        
       
      
    · average sexual recidivism rates are lower than is popularly assumed; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    · sexual offenders are a very heterogeneous population, within which wide variations in recidivism patterns have been observed; and 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    · current risk prediction methods are associated with high rates of force-positive and false-negative predictions. 
     
      
    153 The authors considered the criteria for the making of orders in relation to legislation in Queensland similar to the Act and the high threshold set by those provisions before an order could be made. They stated that by setting such a high threshold the legislation: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …….. may inadvertently rely on the ability of professionals to provide advice that is currently beyond the level of knowledge and expertise. Actuarial risk prediction scales may contribute important information to psychological and psychiatric risk assessments, but the limitations must be better understood by courts, and more openly acknowledged. 
        
       
      
    154 In the article by Biles to which I earlier referred, the author states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Two issues of central relevance in this study are the overall probability of sex offenders reoffending and the evidence of the effectiveness of sex offender treatment. In general serious sex offenders have a relatively low probability of re-offending, perhaps around 15 per cent, but the challenge is to identify which ones are likely to re-offender and which are not. As far as the effectiveness of sex offender treatment is concerned, there are still some debate among experts as to what if anything works……… 
        
       
      
    155 In relation to the Static-99 score, the defendant submitted that it should be adjusted downwards because of the defendant’s age and the fact that he has been taking anti-depressant medication for at least 12 years. There should also be factored into any assessment of risk the defendant’s decreased libido and his medical condition because he presents with a less significant risk of reoffending than persons younger than he. 
     
      
    156 The defendant relies upon studies of the correlation of age and reoffending so that there is a dramatic reduction in risk in the oldest categories of offenders into which the defendant falls. 
     
      
    157 Assessments of the defendant by Dr Ellis indicate that two of the clinical features of the defendant’s reoffending, his paraphilia and his personality disorder are attenuated by his age and physical condition. There has been a decrease in his impulsive unregulated behaviour. 
     
      
    158 The defendant argues that his involvement in CUBIT and the maintenance programme diminishes his risk of reoffending. Further his criminal networks, or the “infrastructure” that was present at the time of his offending no longer exists. This was seen as of significance by each of Dr Ellis, Dr Samuels, and Mr Sheehan. As well his reliance upon alcohol and drugs that was a part of the lifestyle that surrounded the offending no longer exists and the defendant recognises their significance. He has abstained for the last 12 years while in custody. 
     
      
    159 It is submitted that the evidence of Dr Samuels was not reliable. First his prediction was inconsistent with the unreliability generally predicting human behaviour that he acknowledged. Secondly, his prediction was predicated on certain events even though there was no empirical evidence to support their relevance and he lacked knowledge of the facts relevant to those events. Thirdly, he underestimated the significance of the defendant’s age. Fourthly, he misunderstood the empirical evidence of reoffending. Fifthly, it was submitted that his opinion was “driven by a genuine and real concern that the defendant should not (sic) be supervised”. 
     
      
       
      Future Residence 
      
    160 It was submitted that a condition vesting “unfettered discretion” in the Department to determine the defendant’s future residence was inappropriate, “because the [the State] has failed in this case to establish that [officers of the Department] can exercise their discretion responsibly either in the interests of protecting the community or encouraging the defendant to undertake rehabilitation”. 
     
      
    161 It was submitted that COSP was not a suitable place for the defendant because he has found suitable accommodation and work on the country property and, therefore, the stated purpose of COSP to assist “offenders who are unable to attain or maintain suitable accommodation and/or access to community support services and programs” does not apply to him. 
     
      
    162 It was pointed out that Mr Rowan had taken no steps to find the defendant alternative accommodation as at the date of the hearing. It was argued that there is no need for COSP to find the defendant work because he is on a disability pension and the owner of the property will provide him with useful work that he is prepared to perform. There is no need for the CCG to maintain the defendant’s compliance with medication and he otherwise has complied with prison regulations. There has been no relapse into alcohol or drugs notwithstanding that it has been available to him at the COSP centre. Electric monitoring is available from the property. The defendant will attend for treatment as required. 
     
      
    163 The defendant tended records maintained by the Department as “incident details” and “case note reports” relating to behaviour of residents at the COSP centre where the defendant had been residing since his release. These relate to relatively minor incidents that had occurred involving abuse and allegations of assaults both on other residents and members of staff. The defendant relied upon these to demonstrate the unsuitability of COSP in circumstances where the defendant had other accommodation at which he could reside and which would be more conducive to his rehabilitation free from anxiety-provoking behaviour by other residents. It was not submitted that the defendant was at any particular risk to his person while residing at COSP. 
     
      
       
        
        Decision  
        
       
      Principles 
      
    164 In Cornwall the Court of Appeal stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [18]  
        It is a fundamental principle of criminal law that a person convicted of a crime must be given punishment appropriate to that crime and no more:  
        Veen v R 
         (1979) 143 CLR 458;  
        Veen v R (No 2) 
         (1988) 164 CLR 465. Another fundamental principle of criminal law is that, subject to the possibility of appeal, the appropriate punishment is determined once and for all when the person is sentenced for the crime: this is one aspect of a wider principle requiring finality in litigation. Of course, the sentence may, for example by leaving open the possibility for parole, allow for some variation in how it operates, depending on future circumstances. But the appropriateness of the sentence itself cannot later be challenged. 
         
         
        [19]  
        Thus if, in addition to appropriate punishment for crimes they have committed, persons are to have their liberty further restricted because of what they might do in the future, this requires justification outside the ordinary principles of criminal law, and outside the ordinary principle that interference with liberty is generally restricted to interference that is deserved by reason of actual criminal conduct. In passing the Act, the New South Wales legislature has determined that, for the protection of the public, there should in specific cases be restrictions of liberty on that basis. In the second reading speech when the Bill for the Act was before the New South Wales parliament, the Honourable Tony Kelly, Minister for Justice, said this: 
         
          
           
          One particular concern, that is dealt with by this scheme, relates to a handful of high-risk, hard-core offenders who have not made any attempt to rehabilitate whilst in prison. These offenders make up a very small percentage of the prison population, yet their behaviour poses a very real threat to the public. These concerns are compounded where the offender never qualifies for parole and is released at the end of their sentence totally unsupervised. 
           
          The proposed legislation will address this problem by allowing this small group of high-risk offenders to be placed on extended supervision, or, in only the very worst cases, kept in custody. 
           
           
          The Department of Corrective Services has advised that only a small number of offenders would fall into this very high-risk category. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    165 I suppose that “a small number of offenders” referred to by the Minister is relative especially if the Department had in mind all the sexual offenders in the State. But there is becoming a significant jurisprudence in this area of the law because of the number of applications being made to this Court. I was given two folders of decisions by judges of this Court or the Court of Appeal determining applications under the Act. 
     
      
    166 This is notwithstanding that the courts appreciate the difficulty in making predictions of human behaviour, particularly where such predictions impact adversely upon the liberty of an individual. In, Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575 at 622-4 Kirby J wrote (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [123] 
         The appellant points out that the sentences of imprisonment imposed on him in 1989 have been served in their entirety. Nevertheless, pursuant to orders made under the Act, the appellant has remained a prisoner, incarcerated in the Townsville Correctional Centre after the date of the expiry of his sentences. This has occurred without allegation, still less proof, of any further offence by him, or breach of the law. He complains that, effectively, his judicial punishment has been extended by orders made under the Act, a supervening law: 
         
         
          
          because opinions have been formed, probably on material which would not be admissible in a legal proceeding and on a standard other than beyond reasonable doubt, that [he] will commit a serious sexual offence as defined if released from custody, or at least unsupervised custody, after completing [his] sentenced terms of imprisonment. 
          
         
         
        [124] Experts in law, psychology and criminology have long recognised the unreliability of predictions of criminal dangerousness. In a recent comment, Professor Kate Warner remarked: 
         
         
          
          [A]n obstacle to preventive detention is the difficulty of prediction. Psychiatrists notoriously overpredict. Predictions of dangerousness have been shown to have only a one-third to 50% success rate. While actuarial predictions have been shown to be better than clinical predictions — an interesting point as psychiatric or clinical predictions are central to continuing detention orders — neither are accurate. 
          
         
         
        [125] Judges of this Court have referred to such unreliability. Even with the procedures and criteria adopted, the Act ultimately deprives people such as the appellant of personal liberty, a most fundamental human right, on a prediction of dangerousness, based largely on the opinions of psychiatrists which can only be, at best, an educated or informed ""guess""……….. 
         
        
       
      
    167 However Parliament has determined that this Court should attempt to make such a prediction even if on the probabilities to a sufficiently high degree. And, if it does make such a prediction, it should make orders either depriving a person of liberty or restricting a person’s liberty to a very substantial degree for the protection of the public. 
     
      
    168 The terms of the Act require the Court to make the determination of the probability of re-offending even though aided by such expert evidence as is available. In RJE the majority of the Victorian Court of Appeal believed that judges lacked the expertise to make such a determination. They stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [16]  
        Predicting whether a particular person will commit a criminal offence in the future is notoriously difficult. The Monitoring Act recognises that the prediction of future dangerousness, if it is to be attempted at all, is a matter for expert opinion. As the report in the present case illustrates, the making of such a prediction in a particular case requires expertise in observation and assessment of those who commit offences of the particular type, and a detailed knowledge of the types of factors, both personal and environmental, which increase or reduce the risk of further offending. The necessary expertise combines the ability to make a qualitative assessment of an individual and the ability to utilise the available quantitative risk assessment instruments. 
         
         
        [17]  
        One thing is clear. Judges, including experienced criminal judges, have no such expertise. Neither the conduct of criminal trials nor the sentencing of offenders requires judges to have, or equips them with, the ability to assess the likelihood that an offender will re-offend. We express this view fully recognising that a sentencing judge has to consider the need for specific deterrence and the prospects for rehabilitation; that bail decisions often involve predictive considerations; and that assessing dangerousness is the basis of decisions under the Crimes (Mental Impairment and Unfitness to be Tried) Act 1997 (Vic) to impose or vary supervision orders in respect of persons found not guilty of criminal offending by reason of mental impairment. 
         
        
       
      
    169 With respect I believe this view underestimates the ability of experienced judges to make predictions about future offending based not only upon the expertise of others, such as psychologists, probation officers, and psychologists but also the judge’s own expertise developed through the experience of human behaviour derived from sitting in the criminal jurisdiction. As their Honour’s acknowledge, the criminal courts frequently and routinely make decisions about future offending, sometimes with the result that a person will be deprived of liberty, in bail and sentencing decisions. Expertise as a witness is derived not only from learning and study but also experience in a particular area of practice. I see no reason why it should be different for the expertise of a judge in determining facts of a particular kind. 
     
      
    170 In any event, with due humility and not unaware of the difficulty and unreliability of the task at hand, I have to make the decision as best I can even in the face of the view of the majority in RJE as to my lack of expertise and the opinion of Dr Ellis that science lacks the ability to make a prediction of the kind that the Act requires. Although I have the utmost respect for the view of Dr Ellis, I cannot be bound by it so as to hold that, simply because science lacks that ability, the Court must similarly lack it. If it were so it is difficult to see any case in which the Court could carry out Parliament’s will even though I should accept that it was aware of the unreliability of the prediction of future dangerousness. 
     
      
       
      Risk of reoffending 
      
    171 Unaided by scientific or expert opinion I would be of the opinion that in some, if not many cases, the best predictor of future conduct is past conduct. That is chiefly how such findings are made in bail and sentencing hearings. Of course due allowance has to be made for a variety of factors including the nature and extent of the past behaviour, its proximity to the decision about future conduct, changes in circumstances of the offender and whether there is evidence that suggests reformation of the person or a lack of prospects of reform. 
     
      
    172 Dr Samuels stated that “the past is the best predictor of the future” when commenting upon the likelihood of the defendant using alcohol when he was under stress. 
     
      
       
       
        
        Section 9(3)(h) The defendant’s record 
        
       
      
    173 It is unnecessary to examine the defendant’s criminal record since 1989 again in any detail. The outstanding feature of it is that it related to sexual offences committed over a period of almost two decades against exclusively under-aged males involving a variety of sexual acts including penetration of the victims with acts of violence. The acts of sexual abuse were estimated as up to a thousand. They were planned offences in which the defendant enticed the chosen victims by the use of alcohol and drugs and objects that would be attractive to male youths, such as cars and boats. At times he insinuated himself into the family of the victims to get close to his prey and betrayed their trust in him which he had built up just for that purpose. The offences were not simply part of the lifestyle he was living with other sexual predators they were an essential aspect of his identity. He admitted to psychiatrists that it was not so much the sexual acts that gave his fulfilment but rather the grooming of the young men to submit to his sexual abuse. The targets of his criminal conduct were often vulnerable youths from disadvantaged backgrounds. A very significant part of the defendant’s offences was his manipulation of his victims and their families. 
     
      
    174 I find it difficult to dismiss from my mind when considering all the psychiatric and psychological evidence, the fact that the defendant’s sexual offending was integral to his personality and identity for a very significant period of his life and was attended by a seemingly entrenched belief system as to the appropriateness of this type of behaviour. I believe that in the circumstances of this particular case the defendant’s criminal history of offending is a very highly significant factor in any prediction of future re-offending. 
     
      
    175 It was considered relevant by Dr Ellis that the defendant’s sexual interest has been almost exclusively in under-age males. 
     
      
       
       
        
        Section 9(3)(d) Static-99 
        
       
      
    176 I do not find this a very reliable tool for the prediction of future re-offending. This was the view adopted by both parties although that unreliability was seen as having different consequences. 
     
      
    177 The defendant stressed, first the low risk of the defendant re-offending by application of the tool, 22.3 percent to 38.2 percent for reoffending in the next 5 years but secondly notes the fact that the risk of reoffending using the tool relates to reoffending of any sexual offences however trivial and thirdly argues that it is indiscriminate when it comes to the age of the offender; the test scores only whether the person is under the age of 25 years, yet studies suggest that the risk of reoffending declines with advancing age. Fourthly the defendant points out the lack of power of the tool to predict; it is not much more successful than chance. The defendant in effect argues that these deficiencies in the tool indicate that the risk of the defendant committing a further serious sexual offence are markedly less than the indicated by the application of Static-99. 
     
      
    178 I have already referred to the State’s reasons in support of its submission that the tool is of limited utility. 
     
      
    179 Although I am required to take it into account I do not believe that it is a very helpful tool, at least in this case and having regard to the nature and extent of the defendant’s offending in the past. It is but one of the factors that I take into account but one having little weight in this particular case. 
     
      
       
        
        Section 9(3)(i) Age of the defendant  
        
       
      
    180 I have little doubt that as a general proposition the likelihood of re-offending diminishes with age. There are many reasons for this as discussed by the experts who gave evidence before me. However I believe that the defendant has been overly critical of the attitude of the experts on this issue. While they accept it as a relevant factor, they were not prepared on current knowledge to use it to make an actuarial reduction in the risk of re-offending even though there is some support for such a reduction in the literature. 
     
      
    181 I accept that it is a relevant factor that the defendant is aged 61 and hence falls into a range of persons where, in general, the risk of re-offending is reduced. But the difficulty is applying that general proposition to the particular individual. I believe that this was the view expressed by the experts. The cause of a reduction in the risk of reoffending may be due to a variety of factors any one or more of which may be present in any particular case to a different degree or might be absent in a particular individual. 
     
      
    182 One of the reasons for the correlation between advancing age and reduced risk of reoffending may be a decline in libido due to age. The difficulty is in knowing what effect, if any, age has on a person’s libido in a particular case. Here one has only the statements of the defendant as to his reduced libido, and I give them no credit for reasons I shall give shortly. 
     
      
    183 Another factor may be that opportunities for re-offending decline with age. This is particularly so in cases of intra-familial offending, as in incest-type cases, or rape, where advanced age takes away the ability to commit the crime. But the defendant’s offending did not necessarily require any significant physically exertion on his part and was not dependent upon the presence of available victims. He was a predator who used his charm and other social skills to engage with the persons to whom he was sexually attracted. He has not lost those attributes whatever might be his medical condition. 
     
      
    184 I do accept that the “infrastructure” surrounding his offending has ceased to exist. That infrastructure was part of his offending in that it allowed him to offend more safely because of the lack of police interference and he received both moral and material support in carrying out his offending behaviour by his friendship with other offenders who are now dead. But the infrastructure was not essential to his offending and I believe its absence has less significance in this case. I do not believe that the fact that by reason of his evidence at the Wood Royal Commission that his opportunity for offending has been particularly diminished. 
     
      
    185 Age also may lead to self-control and a lack of impulsivity but a significant part of the defendant’s offending was not derived from a lack of his ability to control himself in a given set of circumstances. He chose the circumstances of his offending by grooming suitable victims and insinuating himself into situations where he could make unsupervised contact with his victims. 
     
      
    186 True it is that Dr Ellis thought that the defendant’s personality traits that contributed to his offending might have attenuated with age. Testing of the defendant indicates that there may be a decrease in impulsive and unregulated behaviour. But in my opinion that has little to do with the nature of the defendant’s offending in the past and does not significantly indicate a lack of offending in the future. 
     
      
       
        
        Section 9(3)(i) The defendant’s physical condition 
        
       
      
    187 To the extent that an assessment of the defendant’s current physical state depends upon self-reporting, I do not accept it. His back problems seem to me to be of little relevance, seeing that it is reliably controlled by an analgesic and on its face would not affect his capacity to reoffend given the nature of his offending in the past. 
     
      
    188 Nor would his emphysema. It is relieved by medication and apparently will not interfere with him carrying out physical activities on the country property. I accept that his use of anti-depressant medication may reduce his arousal but I do not have any objective evidence of the degree to which it alone suppresses arousal in his case. Each of the experts thought that the defendant should take antilibidinal medication but he is not prepared to do so. 
     
      
    189 The defendant’s testicular problem is an old one and would have been present to some degree at the time of his offending. I do not accept that it causes him such pain that it interferes with him obtaining an erection or sexual gratification. If it were as significant as he states, I do not understand why he would not have mentioned that fact to Dr Samuels at some stage during their interview. The defendant appeared to me to be inconsistent in giving accounts as to his present level of arousal. He told Dr Ellis that he masturbated about once a fortnight despite saying that it was painful. The evidence of the defendant before me was that he was aroused once a month when watching movies or in relation to past experiences but the pain reduced the length of his arousal. His evidence as to his sexual arousal was designed in my opinion to suggest that he no longer became physically aroused by such stimuli and certainly not to the extent of masturbation. 
     
      
       
        
        Section 9(3)(e) Treatment or rehabilitation programmes 
        
       
      
    190 The defendant voluntarily entered into the CUBIT programme and the maintenance programme with some apparent measure of success. I accept that involvement in such programmes may diminish the risk of re-offending generally speaking. However treatment effectiveness in reducing sexual re-offending is open to some question, see Craig et al “Treatment and Sexual Offence Recidivism”, 2003 Trauma, Violence & Abuse Vol 4 No 1. 
     
      
    191 Mr Sheehan noted that the course seemed “arduous” for the defendant because of the time he took to complete it. He stated that “it may be because treatment sought to challenge an entrenched belief structure and coping style upheld by Mr Fisk for many years”. 
     
      
    192 The defendant is in my view highly manipulative. This opinion is based largely upon the nature of his past offending but even the owner of the country premises accepted that this was so, even though she thought, for reasons that I did not understand, that it was no longer the case, at least so far as she was aware. There was nothing in his evidence in these proceedings or in the accounts of his treatment to suggest that this was no longer a present trait of his personality. I believe he attempted to manipulate me in his evidence. He admitted so much in relation to his future use of alcohol. 
     
      
    193 Dr Samuels noted that a person such as the defendant, being articulate, glib, intelligent, and charming was easily able to lead persons who conduct treatment programmes or therapy groups to believe erroneously that he is performing well. The defendant’s personality in this regard could be a risk factor. I appreciate that this is somewhat of a “no win” situation for the defendant: if he appears not to be succeeding that counts against him, but if does seem to be successful that is only because he is manipulating the therapist. But I cannot help but be sceptical of the assertion by the defendant that he has changed his attitude to the offending and his victims. 
     
      
    194 I do not believe that he has any true victim empathy, a factor seen as highly significant in cognitive behavioural therapy such as the defendant has been exposed to. I have earlier referred to the letter written by the defendant to the Victim’s Compensation Tribunal in 2000 supposedly after he had reached a decision to give up his offending because of his understanding of its effects on his victims. I have also noted my opinion that his evidence in explanation of that letter was untrue. 
     
      
    195 He had difficulty in showing any empathy for his victims to Dr Samuels and could only say, after some hesitation, that it might have “led to confusion about their sexual identity”. Dr Samuels believed that the defendant still had some “distorted attitudes in relation to his sexual offending behaviour and his victims”. He also has “some intellectualisations and rationalisations about his previous offending behaviour and at some level still feels that his actions were justified and not particularly damaging” and that these raised concerns. 
     
      
    196 Senior counsel who appeared for the defendant conceded that there would be doubts about his client’s insight into his conduct or its effect upon his victims, but argued that one insight he would have is that further offending would result in harm to him by further punishment. But his offending behaviour has been such a part of his character and identity that I believe there is a substantial risk he may be unable to resist falling into the pattern of behaviour without monitoring and compulsory treatment programmes. 
     
      
       
        
        Section 9(3)(b) Reports from Court appointed experts 
        
       
      
    197 Dr Samuels was criticised by the defendant in that his prediction was based upon “the absence of appropriate supervision and in the context of his support structures failing, mood instability, substance misuse and opportunity”. It was submitted that there was no evidence that these preconditions to a return to re-offending were likely to occur or that there is any empirical studies indicating that these were factors leading to re-offending. 
     
      
    198 I do not believe that this criticism is justified. There is in my view a real risk of any one or more of these circumstances occurring. 
     
      
    199 There is a real question to my mind about the defendant’s commitment to alcohol abstention or at least his ability to abstain from alcohol. Even accepting that he has abstained from alcohol and drugs over the past 12 years, he has refused to engage in counselling in that regard notwithstanding that it has been available to him and he has had ample opportunity at least while at COSP to take advantage of it. This is because he believes that alcohol is no longer a problem. This is an example of his lack of insight and his unpreparedness to address risk attendant behaviour when it does not suit him. 
     
      
    200 Dr Ellis thought that the defendant needed monitoring of substance use and assistance in maintaining abstinence. He noted that he had not undertaken treatment programmes notwithstanding his previous heavy use. He wrote, “[the defendant] was not able to articulate strategies to avoid use other than to say that substance use is not a problem for him now”. 
     
      
    201 Mr Sheehan was concerned that the defendant might find “abstinence more challenging when faced with contextual situations traditionally associated with drinking 
     
      
    202 The defendant’s evidence in these proceedings on this topic showed how fluid his views are about his future use of alcohol and how willing he was to take a stance that he thought might be advantageous to him. 
     
      
    203 There is little evidence before the Court as to the defendant’s support structures in the community if he were not reliant on COSP. Apart from the owner of the property who is prepared to allow him to reside there and assist him in fulfilling his obligations, the only evidence is that he has friends in the community and a brother who has some interest in his welfare. If something were to occur to take away the support for him by the owner of the property or the availability of that residence, it is difficult to see how the defendant would cope after his extended period in custody. Dr Samuels believed that in that case there was a risk “that he could psychologically decompensate and become very depressed and anxious which might increase the likelihood of his reoffending”. 
     
      
       
        
        Section 9(3)(c) Other reports 
        
       
      
    204 The opinion of Dr Samuels as to the risk of the defendant further offending seem to me to be supported by Mr Sheehan although he does not purport to quantify the risk. Because the defendant’s only sexual interest is toward males who would fall into a group of potential victims to his reoffending, Mr Sheehan believed the defendant “would have to work consistently and comprehensively to manage all aspects of risk before confidence could be had in his ability to independently manage his risk over time”. 
     
      
    205 Like the other experts Mr Sheehan thought that antilibidinal medication would be “a prudent step in adding a physiological dimension to risk management”. However the defendant is resistant to taking such medication notwithstanding that, according to him, he is no longer significantly sexually aroused by images of young males as, for example, seen on movies. Yet the purpose of the medication in preventing arousal was one of the effects that he found unacceptable. 
     
      
       
        
        Conclusion 
        
       
      
    206 I am persuaded to a high degree of probability that the defendant is likely to commit a further serious sexual offence if he is not kept under supervision. I would reach that conclusion even if the word “likely” meant more probable than not. As the law stands in this State it is unnecessary for me to reach that level of persuasion. Therefore I intend to make an order for the extended supervision of the defendant. 
     
      
    207 The only significant dispute as to the conditions if an order were to be made is that of residence. I believe that the defendant should be placed under the control of the Department in that regard for the next 9 months but, thereafter, he should, if he wishes to do so and it is available to him, be able to reside on the country property. 
     
      
    208 In my opinion the defendant should be closely monitored and supervised for a period of 9 months from his release, that is further 6 months from today. I believe that the evidence supporting that condition is overwhelming. It seems to me that it is a necessary part of his reintegration into the community after a lengthy period in custody and gives him the chance to be involved in necessary treatment programmes as and when required. I am far from satisfied that in such a period the defendant’s prospects of rehabilitation will be deleteriously affected by remaining in COSP or some other accommodation chosen by the Department. It also means that the defendant can go to the country property after the Christmas holidays. 
     
      
    209 However, after a further period of close supervision and continued treatment the defendant’s risk of reoffending should have attenuated to some degree. I believe it is a proper balance between the benefits of further close supervision and monitoring initially both for the safety of the public and the defendant’s welfare on the one hand and a chance for the defendant to be in an environment more conducive to his rehabilitation on the other. 
     
      
    210 That period of time will give the Department the opportunity of organising its recourses to be able to monitor and supervise the defendant at the country property. I am far from satisfied that this cannot be achieved in a further period of 6 months. There was a dispute in the evidence as to how long it took to get from the property to relevant places and I am not convinced that adequate treatment and supervision cannot be achieved at that property. A deadline seems to me to be no bad thing in that regard. But if it truly cannot be achieved or if after the defendant moves to the country property his treatment is being significantly interfered with, or adequate monitoring and supervision cannot be provided, or if real risks of further offending arise, then the matter can be dealt with by an application brought by the State to vary the condition at relatively short notice. 
     
      
    211 I am concerned that the onus should be on the State to seek a variation by positive evidence that the residence at the country property is not appropriate. Although I am satisfied it is not appropriate at the present time and will not be over the next 6 months, I am not persuaded that it should be denied to the defendant after that period of time. 
     
      
    212 I believe that ultimately it is in the interest of the defendant and hence the public generally that he be able to go to the country property. I consider that overall he will have less opportunity to re-offend there than he will have in the greater metropolitan of Sydney even with more intensive monitoring and supervision. 
     
      
    213 As to the period of the order the State submitted it should be 5 years. The defendant submits it should be no more than 12 months relying upon the evidence of Dr Samuels. I believe that it should be for a further period of 3 years once the defendant has moved from the residence controlled by the Department. I believed that the risk is sufficiently highly probable for that period. Within that period the defendant can seek a variation or revocation of the order and should have the onus. Thereafter the State can seek a further order and should have the onus to show that it is required for the protection of the public. 
     
      
       
        
        Non-publication order 
        
       
      
    214 The parties have agreed that, if I make an order sought by the plaintiff, I should make an order preventing publication of certain information: the current and future residences of the defendant, a name used by him while on witness protection and the name of the person providing alternative accommodation to that provided by the Department. 
     
      
    215 I recognise the very limited use that the Court should make of its power to prevent publication of material because of the fundamental requirement of our system of justice that hearings be open and evidence be available for circulation to the public generally. However, there is no doubt that in a truly exceptional case and where “it is really necessary to secure the proper administration of justice in the proceedings before it” the Court can make such an order: see John Fairfax Publications v District Court of NSW (2004) 61 NSWLR 344. The order should be clear in its terms and do no more than is necessary to achieve the due administration of justice. 
     
      
    216 These proceedings were brought by the State for the purpose of placing the defendant’s liberty in the community under conditions including where he could reside. The purpose of these proceedings according to the Act under which they were brought is both the protection of the public and the rehabilitation of the offender. Of course these two purposes are not inconsistent. One means of protecting the public from an individual is to rehabilitate him. 
     
      
    217 In order to achieve the rehabilitation of the defendant it is necessary in my view to restrict the persons who know where he is to reside. While I understand that members of the public would reasonably have an interest in knowing that information in what they consider to be the protection of adolescent males in the community generally or certain individuals in particular, the protection of those persons is placed in the hands of officers of the Department and the police and secured by restrictions upon the defendant’s conduct including restrictions upon where he might go in the area in which he is residing. That purpose of the Act is adequately maintained by the restrictions imposed upon the defendant including his place of residence. 
     
      
    218 In my opinion the order made by the Court as sought by the State would be frustrated in its objective if the public at large were made aware of the residence of the defendant or any material that might disclose that location. The owner of the property where the defendant seeks to reside, once he has been permitted to do so, has indicated in uncontested evidence that, were the residence revealed publicly and hence her sense of security and privacy be unreasonably invaded, she would be unable to provide the accommodation to the defendant. In my opinion the provision of that accommodation on the evidence presently before me is an integral part of the eventual rehabilitation of the defendant. Clearly the place where the defendant will reside in the short term under the management of the Department should not be disclosed otherwise the Department may be unable to provide the defendant with the accommodation and resources that it believes essential for the proper management and supervision of the defendant and hence the reason for the making of the order. 
     
      
    219 I order that there be no publication of (a) the present place of residence of the defendant (b) the approved place of future residence of the defendant while under the conditions of the extended supervision order made by the Court and (c) any material that would tend to identify the person with whom the defendant intends to reside as permitted under the conditions of the extended supervision order and (d) the name by which the defendant was known when on witness protection The non-publication order does not apply to any officer of the Department of Justice and Attorney General and the NSW Police Force insofar as the disclosure is reasonably necessary in implementing the extended supervision order nor to the defendant and the person with whom he proposes to reside. 
     
      
       
        
      Order 
      
    220 Pursuant to section 9(1)(a) of the Act I order that the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order to operate for a period of 3 years 6 months from 11 August 2009 and pursuant to section 11 of the Act, direct that, for the period of the extended supervision order, the defendant comply with the following conditions.

    1 BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J and with his Honour's reasons. 
     
      
    2 RS HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J and with his Honour's reasons. Although that agreement extends to what has been said concerning the need for leave to appeal, I find it difficult to conceive of circumstances where leave would be refused in a case where there is any significant argument that, in the words of s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, ""the verdict of the jury ... is unreasonable, or cannot be supported (or) ... there was a miscarriage of justice..."". 
     
      
    3 JOHNSON J: The Appellants, Simon Rasic, Johnny Lee Vella and Damien Charles Vella, each appeal against conviction on 22 October 2007, following trial by jury on a charge of robbery in company under s.97(1) Crimes Act 1900. In addition, the Appellants, Johnny Lee Vella and Damien Charles Vella, each appeal against conviction on three counts of obtaining a valuable thing by deception under s.178BA(1) Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    4 With respect to the matters which proceeded to trial and conviction by a jury, Williams DCJ imposed the following sentences on 5 February 2008: 
     
      
       
      (a) Simon Rasic - robbery in company under s.97(1)  
      Crimes Act 1900 
       (maximum penalty 20 years’ imprisonment) - imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 27 November 2007 and expiring on 26 May 2009 with a balance of term of 12 months commencing on 27 May 2009 and expiring on 26 May 2010; 
       
       
      (b) Johnny Lee Vella: 
       
       
        
        (i) robbery in company - imprisonment by way of non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 27 August 2007 and expiring on 26 February 2009 with a balance of term of 12 months commencing on 27 February 2009 and expiring on 26 February 2010; 
         
         
        (ii) obtain valuable thing by deception under s.178BA(1)  
        Crimes Act 1900 
         (maximum penalty five years’ imprisonment) - on each count, imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months to date from 27 February 2007 and to expire on 26 February 2008; 
        
       
       
      (c) Damien Charles Vella: 
       
       
        
        (i) robbery in company - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 27 August 2007 and expiring on 26 February 2009 with a balance of term of 12 months commencing on 27 February 2009 and expiring on 26 February 2010; 
         
         
        (ii) obtain valuable thing by deception (three counts) - on each count, imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months to date from 27 February 2007 and to expire on 26 February 2008. 
        
       
      
    5 In addition, the Appellant, Simon Rasic, was sentenced with respect to three counts of obtaining a valuable thing by deception under s.178BA(1) Crimes Act 1900 to which he had pleaded guilty. On each of the three counts, he was sentenced to imprisonment by way of a fixed term of nine months to commence on 27 May 2007 and to expire on 26 February 2008.  
     
      
    6 Each Appellant seeks to challenge his conviction on the matters which proceeded to trial. No appeal is brought with respect to sentence. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    7 The three Appellants were represented at trial by Mr Nicholson QC, who appeared for each of them on the present appeal. On 24 April 2009, identical grounds of appeal were filed with respect to each Appellant in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      1. The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence at the trial. 
       
       
      2. The trial miscarried by reason of the conduct of the Prosecutor. 
       
       
      3. The summing up lacked fairness and balance. 
       
       
      4. The summing up was confusing and failed to adequately marshal the trial evidence and arguments relied upon for the Defence. 
       
       
      5. The trial Judge erred in failing to put adequately the Defence case to the jury. 
       
       
      6. The trial Judge misdirected the jury concerning the onus of proof in Count 1. 
       
      
    8 On 24 April 2009, three sets of written submissions prepared by Mr Nicholson QC were filed in the Registry, one set for each Appellant. The written submissions extended to 44 pages, 46 pages and 47 pages respectively. The vast bulk of the written submissions appeared to be electronically generated copies of near-identical submissions, with limited variations. The Court (and the Crown) were confronted with 137 pages of submissions, and the task of attempting to discern the differences as between the three documents.  
     
      
    9 At the commencement of the appeal on 22 July 2009, this issue was raised with Mr Nicholson QC, who could provide no satisfactory explanation for the undue repetition of submissions in the three documents with the accompanying challenge of, in effect, spotting the differences between the documents. It is true that there are three Appellants, and submissions filed in support of each appeal ought state the arguments advanced in that respect. That said, the practice adopted in the present appeals is to be strongly discouraged. The obligation of counsel appearing in this Court on a conviction appeal is to set out arguments, in a manner which assists the Court in the determination of the appeal in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 19 of Practice Note SC CCA 1 (V2). This Court is not assisted by wholesale electronic repetition of submissions in different documents. In the circumstances of these appeals, the sensible and appropriate course was to produce a single document addressing the identical grounds of appeal, with specific reference to aspects which related solely to a particular Appellant. As the same counsel appeared for each Appellant, this course should have been adopted. 
     
      
    10 The Crown produced a single set of written submissions addressing the grounds of appeal, containing arguments advanced with respect to them. The Crown submissions demonstrated the common sense of a single document addressing the grounds of appeal in this case. 
     
      
    11 Having grappled with the lengthy and repetitive written submissions filed for the Appellants, the Court was informed by Mr Nicholson QC, at the commencement of the hearing on 22 July 2009, that the first ground of appeal only was being pressed. A combination of the late notification of this development and the lengthy and repetitive submissions proffered in support of the appeals did not assist the Court, and the effective use of judicial time, in preparation for the hearing of the appeals. 
     
      
    12 It is clear that the ground now relied upon does not involve “a question of law alone”. As a result, the Appellants must be treated as applicants for leave to appeal against conviction: s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The fact that a ground which involves a mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law alone is beyond argument: Williams v The Queen [1986] HCA 88; 161 CLR 278 at 287 (Gibbs CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ agreeing) and 301-302 (Mason and Brennan JJ). The failure of offenders seeking to challenge convictions on such grounds, without seeking leave to appeal, has been the subject of remarks by this Court on a number of occasions: see, for example, Krishna v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 318; 178 A Crim R 220 at [2]; Yacoub v R [2008] NSWCCA 164 at [2]; Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 322 at [44] and at [68]-[71]; Carlton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 244 at [10]-[12]. The statutory requirement of leave to appeal should not be treated as a mere formality. There will be circumstances in which leave will be refused. Where such circumstances arise, counsel should not assume that the Court will accept inadvertence as a reason for neither seeking leave nor being in a position to address any relevant issue. In the present case, no point having been taken, it is appropriate that there be a grant of leave to appeal in each case. 
     
      
       
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    13 On the afternoon of 28 June 2006, the three Appellants were drinking at the Wallacia Hotel. At that time, George Psaroudis was present at the hotel servicing pool tables and the jukebox. At one point during the afternoon, Mr Psaroudis left the hotel through a side exit door, apparently to obtain something from his vehicle parked in the hotel car park. Almost immediately, Mr Rasic followed, then Johnny Vella and then Damien Vella left the hotel by the same door. Events inside the hotel, including the departure of the four men through the door, were captured on CCTV camera.  
     
      
    14 Upon leaving the hotel, Mr Psaroudis was struck from behind and he fell to the ground. He was kicked while he was on the ground and was robbed of his wallet during the attack. 
     
      
    15 Silvia Radakovic was working with Mr Psaroudis at the hotel on that day. She came out of the hotel door and saw the attack upon Mr Psaroudis taking place. She went to assist, then ran back inside the hotel, to get help, and then went back outside carrying a barstool. Shortly after she exited, the bar stool was thrown back through the door and Ms Radakovic followed soon after.  
     
      
    16 The Appellants came back into the hotel briefly to pick up some personal belongings and then left.  
     
      
    17 Contained in Mr Psaroudis’ wallet was an American Express Platinum card in his name. Soon after the attack on Mr Psaroudis at the Wallacia Hotel, his American Express card was used to make three purchases at the MCA motorcycle shop at Liverpool. The card was used to purchase a high-performance Harley Davidson motorcycle engine worth $17,500.00. Minutes later, the card was used to purchase a further Harley Davidson engine, together with a frame and swing arm for a total sum of $14,100.00. Soon after, the card was used for a third transaction as payment of $7,800.00 for a range of motorcycle parts. Events inside the MCA motorcycle shop at Liverpool, on the afternoon of 28 June 2006, were captured on CCTV.  
     
      
    18 It was admitted, at trial, that Mr Rasic had used Mr Psaroudis’ American Express card on these three occasions that day, and that the other Appellants had assisted Mr Rasic to carry from the shop the motorcycle parts and components purchased in the three transactions in question. 
     
      
    19 The Crown case involved a range of evidence, including the CCTV footage and evidence of Mr Psaroudis and Ms Radakovic, together with other witnesses outside the hotel who observed the attack upon Mr Psaroudis, and evidence of use of the American Express card, for the purpose of substantial purchases in which the three Appellants were directly involved.  
     
      
       
      The Defence Cases at Trial 
       
      
    20 Each of the Appellants gave evidence before the jury. Put shortly, it was the case of the Appellants at trial that they observed other persons attacking Mr Psaroudis outside the hotel, and that the Appellants intervened in an attempt to rescue Mr Psaroudis. The Appellants said that they did not remain at the hotel because each became aware that the police were being called, and that Ms Radakovic was likely to assert that the Appellants were the attackers.  
     
      
    21 Mr Rasic stated that he located Mr Psaroudis’ wallet on the ground outside the hotel and picked it up. Having located the American Express card in it, he decided to use it to make purchases at the MCA motorcycle shop at Liverpool. It was the evidence of Mr Rasic and the other Appellants that Mr Rasic did not tell the others that he was using the credit card of Mr Psaroudis for this purpose. Mr Johnny Vella and Mr Damien Vella both stated that, although they assisted Mr Rasic to carry the motorcycle components and parts out of the shop to a vehicle, they were unaware that Mr Rasic had used an American Express card belonging to someone else to make the purchases.  
     
      
    22 In addition to their own direct evidence denying involvement in the offences (apart from admissions by Mr Rasic of his guilt for the credit card offences), senior counsel for the Appellants at trial relied upon a range of suggested inconsistencies and other parts of evidence of Crown witnesses in support of the defence hypothesis that other men (who had escaped) were the attackers and that the Appellants had intervened to assist Mr Psaroudis. 
     
      
    23 In these various ways, it was submitted at trial for the Appellants that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the Appellants had robbed Mr Psaroudis nor that the Appellants, Johnny Vella and Damien Vella, were criminally involved in the use of the credit card at the Liverpool motorcycle shop. 
     
      
       
      The Appeal 
       
      
    24 The Appellants contend that the verdicts of the jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. No other ground of appeal was pressed, although Mr Nicholson QC contended that aspects of the conduct of the Crown Prosecutor, which were challenged in Ground 2, served to explain how the jury came to convict the Appellants on the matters that went to trial although, the Appellants contend, it was not open to the jury to do so. This submission does not activate the second ground of appeal. The sole question to be considered and determined by this Court is whether the Appellants have made good the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    25 Where it is contended that a verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, the question which this Court must ask itself is whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each Appellant in this case was guilty: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at 614-615 [25], 623 [55]-[57]. This Court’s function under s.6(1) is to be “performed within a legal system that accords special respect and legitimacy to jury verdicts deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of the accused in serious criminal trials”: MFA v The Queen at 624 [59]. The jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, including each of the Appellants: M v the Queen at 493. 
     
      
    26 In MFA v The Queen, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ said at 623 [56] (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “The majority in  
        M 
         pointed out that ‘ 
        [i] 
        n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced’. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred  
        [at 494] 
        : 
         
         
          
          ‘If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility 
           that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    27 In their conclusion, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in MFA v The Queen at 634 [96] (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “There are, it is true, some aspects of the evidence that are less than wholly satisfactory. But that is not uncommon in most trials. Experience suggests that juries, properly instructed on the law (as they were in this case), are usually well able to evaluate conflicts and imperfections of evidence. In the end, the appellate court must ask itself whether it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred authorising and requiring its intervention.” 
        
       
      
    28 The Crown case against the Appellants here involved a combination of direct evidence of observations of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a number of events, including the CCTV footage depicting the Appellants following Mr Psaroudis out the hotel door together with the criminal use, not long after the attack upon Mr Psaroudis, of his credit card where Mr Rasic was directly involved in making the transactions, and the other Appellants were present with him assisting in the removal from the shop of the substantial and expensive items which had been purchased. Although the Crown case could not be described as a circumstantial case, it involved, in a number of respects, reliance upon inferences to be drawn from a combination of circumstances. 
     
      
    29 Where verdicts are challenged upon the basis that they are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48] (Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ); The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 83 ALJR 243 at 267 [128] (Kiefel J, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ agreeing); applied in Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [59]-[61] (Giles JA, Howie and Buddin JJ agreeing). These authorities concerned circumstantial Crown cases. However, a similar approach is appropriate in this case. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury, and not just parts of it. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events.  
     
      
    30 This Court has emphasised the fact that a jury brings to consideration of a circumstantial case the common experience of members of the community who apply their collective knowledge of human affairs and their common sense: R v Kaldor [2004] NSWCCA 425; 150 A Crim R 271 at 272-273 [2], 293-294 [86]; Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179 at [88]; BJR v R [2008] NSWCCA 43; 185 A Crim R 360 at 380 [97]. After citing these authorities, Giles JA (Howie and Buddin JJ agreeing) said in Burrell v R at [65]: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court must make its own assessment of the evidence. But the assessment is of the cumulative effect of the evidence, and with due regard to the common experience of human affairs and common sense brought by the jury to their determination of guilt or innocence.” 
        
       
      
    31 This Court should take a similar approach in assessing the evidence and determining the present appeals. 
     
      
       
      Evidence Adduced at the Trial 
       
      
    32 The real issue joined at trial was whether the Appellants attacked Mr Psaroudis or whether they were interveners seeking to rescue him from his attackers. The evidence to which consideration will be given is that which bears upon this issue.  
     
      
    33 George Psaroudis described his movements at the Wallacia Hotel following his arrival, with Ms Radakovic, in the middle of the afternoon. After performing certain tasks inside the hotel, he walked outside and was hit on the back of the head. He did not see who struck him and his whole body went down onto the ground face first. He was being kicked in the head and the back. He was not able to see people around at the time he was being kicked. The attack occurred when he was about 10 metres from his vehicle, and up against a blue Holden or Ford. He remembered Ms Radakovic getting him up against the car. Although he did not lose consciousness, he said his head was spinning. Ms Radakovic was crying and carrying on, and an ambulance arrived and then the police. 
     
      
    34 Mr Psaroudis had his brown leather wallet with him in his back pocket on that day. It contained $1,400.00 in cash, credit cards (including an American Express Platinum card) and his driver’s licence. Mr Psaroudis said his wallet was gone after the attack and he did not know what had happened to it. He never saw the wallet again. 
     
      
    35 Ambulance officers treated Mr Psaroudis at the scene and he declined their suggestion that he go to hospital. The police arrived and spoke to him and a police officer took some photographs of him which became exhibits at the trial. He remained at the hotel for about an hour and then went home. He rang up American Express and told them he had been robbed and to cancel the credit card. They told him that it had been used already to make purchases at a motorcycle shop that afternoon. 
     
      
    36 In cross-examination, Mr Psaroudis agreed that Ms Radakovic was “freaking out” at the time she lifted him up and that she was running around making a lot of noise. He had asked Ms Radakovic to attempt to locate the wallet and she did so without success. 
     
      
    37 In examination-in-chief, Silvia Radakovic said she observed “a few guys” a couple of metres away from Mr Psaroudis and herself inside the hotel. There were “about four, three” of them and she thought they were having a beer (T26). Mr Psaroudis left the hotel as she was counting money inside the hotel. Ms Radakovic said that she saw that Mr Psaroudis “was getting bashed outside” and she ran outside to have a look. The Crown asked (T28.1): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What was the first thing you saw when you went outside? 
         
        A. George getting bashed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who was he being bashed by? 
         
        A. Four guys, couple of guys, three or four guys. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And had you seen those three or four guys earlier that day? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whereabouts had you seen them? 
         
        A. I saw them bashing George outside. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But had you seen them earlier that day before they were bashing George? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    38 Ms Radakovic said that Mr Psaroudis was near his car “getting kicked”. She was asked (T29.23): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What position was George in when he was being kicked? 
         
        A. Just on the ground with his head on the ground. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said before there were three or four men? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were they all kicking him? 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    39 Ms Radakovic said that Mr Psaroudis had his hands over his head “trying to like protect his head” (T29.43). The Crown asked Ms Radakovic (T29.45): 
     
      
       
        
        “What did you do when you saw these three or four men kicking George? 
         
        A. Well I ran in to get some help, ran back into the pub to get some help. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who did you run to, or where did you run to try and get help? 
         
        A. Well back in the hotel. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you speak to anyone in the hotel? 
         
        A. I was just yelling, it was all, all happened so fast, I was just yelling and ‘Someone’s getting bashed, come, someone help’ you know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did anyone come to help? 
         
        A. Not really. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do next then? 
         
        A. Panicking, running around freaking out, I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What do you remember happening next? 
         
        A. Well then they went, I guess they ran off. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see them run off? 
         
        A. No I was just, I went to George trying to help George, making sure he’s all right.” 
        
       
      
    40 Ms Radakovic observed that Mr Psaroudis was hurt. She was asked by the Crown (T30.30): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You said before that you went into the pub to ask for help, did you yourself try and get any help for George? 
         
        A. Yeah I was just trying to get someone to come out and help, stop the - stop what was going on, just trying to get someone’s attention. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you remember whether you did manage to get anyone to come out and help? 
         
        A. Well yeah eventually like people came back out, you know.” 
        
       
      
    41 It is noteworthy that the account of Ms Radakovic to this point does not leave itself open to a construction that what she observed was two groups of persons, attackers and rescuers, involved in an incident surrounding Mr Psaroudis. Rather, the events described by Ms Radakovic indicate a group of men, all of whom were attacking and kicking Mr Psaroudis who lay face down on the ground. 
     
      
    42 The Crown was granted leave to cross-examine Ms Radakovic under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 by reference to her statement to police made on 4 July 2006. She was asked by the Crown (T37.46): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you have a memory of now what you actually saw? 
         
        A. Yeah, I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is it that you saw? 
         
        A. Well what it says in the statement. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well maybe I’ll take you directly to your statement, did you say this in your statement: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘That as George left the room I saw the males who were at the table get up immediately and follow George out the door’? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that in your statement? 
         
        A. Well must’ve happened that way. I don’t know. I was - I was, I don’t know exactly how it happened but if I said that well that’s how it - must’ve happened.” 
        
       
      
    43 Ms Radakovic agreed that her statement to police had said “I got up and walked to the door and went outside. When I got outside I saw George lying on the ground and the men were kicking him whilst he was on the ground” (T38). She agreed that her statement said “I walked back towards the door and I saw that the men were still kicking George on the ground. I grabbed a metal bar stool and walked backed outside”. She said she picked up the metal bar stool “to make some noise so someone could hear me because no one was really listening to me just so they can help like, I can get some attention” (T39.32).  
     
      
    44 The CCTV footage of events inside the hotel was played to Ms Radakovic during her evidence-in-chief (T40ff). The DVD was stopped from time to time, and the Crown asked Ms Radakovic questions concerning images depicted on it, including the following (T42.6): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You’ve disappeared on the closed-circuit footage there outside the door. Do you remember the first thing you saw as you got outside the door? 
         
        A. Just George on the floor. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On the floor, what do you mean? 
         
        A. Like just on the floor and just four guys like kicking into him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was the surface he was on, what was it made out of? 
         
        A. The, just the asphalt, the tar. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Asphalt, okay. 
        
       
       
        
        DVD PLAYED TO COURT 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you see yourself run back inside the hotel? 
         
        A. Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What were you doing at that stage when you run back inside the hotel? 
         
        A. Trying to get someone to, get someone’s attention to come and help George, just stop what was going on. 
        
       
       
        
        DVD PLAYED TO COURT 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you see yourself there picking up a bar stool? 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    45 In cross-examination by senior counsel for the Appellants, Ms Radakovic said that, when she was first at the door, she wasn’t sure how many people were outside with Mr Psaroudis. It could have been three or four, but she could not say exactly, conceding that there may have been five people (T48-49). Ms Radakovic thought that she did see a number of men walk away from the blue car from that group, and walk towards the rear of the hotel towards the general car park (T51). She was asked in cross-examination (T52.5): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you were looking outside the hotel from inside the hotel, did you see a number of attackers of George Psaroudis walk away from the blue car in the direction of the car park at the rear of the hotel? 
         
        A. I think - yeah, I think one - one - one or two. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is it possible you saw one walk in that direction. 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then another two walk in that direction. 
         
        A. It’s possible, yes.” 
        
       
      
    46 Senior counsel for the Appellants did not put to Ms Radakovic in cross-examination that what she observed outside were a group of attackers and a group of rescuers involved in the incident with Mr Psaroudis. Further, the Appellants testified that they had departed the hotel and not waited for the police because, when the Appellants re-entered the hotel, Ms Radakovic had said she was going to call the police and accuse them of wrongdoing in the altercation with Mr Psaroudis. On the defence scenario, Ms Radakovic had mistakenly taken the Appellants for attackers and not rescuers. 
     
      
    47 Mr Nicholson QC disagreed with a question from the Bench during the hearing of the appeals that, having regard to the evidence of Ms Radakovic and the nature of the defence cases, a direct challenge was required during cross-examination, going beyond the question of whether there were two, three, four or five persons involved and, in particular, whether there were two groups of persons comprising attackers and rescuers (T11, 22 July 2009). As mentioned earlier, this was the critical issue upon which issue was joined between the Crown and the Appellants at trial.  
     
      
    48 With respect, it is difficult to understand why this proposition was not put to Ms Radakovic during cross-examination: Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67, R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 689-691. Whatever reason there may have been for senior counsel not to put such a proposition directly to Ms Radakovic, the end result is that the failure to cross-examine in such a way does not assist the Appellants on appeal to this Court, upon a ground that the verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence where reliance is sought to be placed upon selected aspects only of the evidence of Ms Radakovic. This is especially so given that Mr Nicholson QC contends that the evidence of Ms Radakovic was critical to the Crown case, and that an analysis of her evidence assists the Appellants’ contention that their convictions ought be quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    49 George Elliot was the owner of the Wallacia Hotel in June 2006. He described events at the hotel during the afternoon of 28 June 2006. He said that one of a group of men got up and walked out the door, and he was asked by the Crown (T66.14): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What happened when he got up? 
         
        A. He was gone for only a very brief time then one of the others  
        [sic] 
         guys got up, then the other guy got up and they all walked out. I thought it was a bit weird actually.” 
        
       
      
    50 He said that Ms Radakovic, “the girl with the pool table guy”, was “in a bit of a frenzy calling out” (T66.44). Mr Elliot said that the “fourth guy” (who was present with the Appellants) was “standing in the way of the door” (T66.53). The appropriate inference is that the “fourth guy” was Matthew Waldron, an associate of the Appellants.  
     
      
    51 Mr Elliot observed a group of people near a car. He “only briefly caught a very quick glimpse” and thought he saw “maybe five or six people around this car” (T67.28).  
     
      
    52 The Crown was granted leave under s.38 to cross-examine Mr Elliot, by reference to his police statement made on 5 July 2006. He agreed that he had told the police in his statement (T77-79): 
     
      
       
        
        “I got to the door and opened the right-hand folding door and looked outside. I saw a group of males in a scrum up against a blue Falcon. The males I saw in the fight were the males I was seated with a short time earlier at the tall table near the sports room. The three males had backed off George, and the female was yelling at the males. The males left in the direction of the back car park.” 
        
       
      
    53 Mr Elliot agreed that there was nothing in his police statement about seeing the other five or six males outside the hotel (T78-79). 54 The CCTV footage was then shown to Mr Elliot and he was asked questions, from time to time, as the DVD was played. At the point where the CCTV showed the second man heading towards the door, Mr Elliot was asked by the Crown (T82.8): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. The second man now is heading towards the door. Do you remember seeing that on that particular day? 
         
        A. I do remember that because I remember - that’s when I first thought it’s a bit unusual, they’re all getting up and leaving. Just leaving. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Had anything been said? 
         
        A. Not a word. Nothing at all. 
        
       
       
        
        TAPE PLAYED 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The third man who was standing, or sort of sitting, standing beside you, is now heading towards the door. Do you remember that occurring on that particular -- 
         
        A. Yes. As I say, that’s when I just thought it was weird you know, just getting up and walking away. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say anything to you? 
         
        A. Not a word. Nobody said anything.” 
        
       
      
    55 During a short cross-examination, Mr Elliott agreed that he presumed there had been some sort of fight or scuffle at the time he was interviewed by police and had made his statement, and that he did not actually see a fight, he “just saw a lot of commotion and a lot of yelling” (T90.42).  
     
      
    56 Susan Kay Bock was the owner of a take-away shop at Park Road, Wallacia, directly beside the Wallacia Hotel. At about 3.30 pm on 28 June 2006, she heard her mother, who was out the back putting rubbish in the bin, call out that someone was getting bashed. Ms Bock ran straight out the back of the property looking towards the Wallacia Hotel, and saw “three men hitting into another gentleman” on the floor. They were yelling and the men were punching the man and one was kicking him (T92). Ms Bock was under 20 metres away when this was happening.  
     
      
    57 Whilst the attack on the man was underway, Ms Bock observed a lady come out of the door of the hotel with a bar stool in her hand. She was screaming at the men to stop and to get away and she was pushed back into the hotel (T93). It was one of the three men who was attacking the man on the ground who pushed the lady back into the hotel, and the men continued to hit the man on the ground (T93). 
     
      
    58 Ms Bock said that she was “pretty confident” that the three men were all wearing flannelette shirts with jeans and were heavy set, with two of them having longish hair and one wearing a baseball cap (T93). She observed the men walk towards the back of the car park with two of them going around to the rear of the hotel and the one with the baseball cap entering a four-wheel drive vehicle and driving off (T93).  
     
      
    59 Ms Bock was cross-examined on a number of topics, with some emphasis being given to her description of the three men observed by her and their movements after the attack. However, it was not put to her that there were two groups of men involved in an altercation around Mr Psaroudis, being several attackers and three rescuers (in the form of the Appellants).  
     
      
    60 The evidence of Ms Bock assisted the Crown case in that, on her account, there were only three men in the vicinity of Mr Psaroudis, this being consistent with the Crown case that these were the three Appellants and that there were no other men who had attacked Mr Psaroudis. The evidence of Ms Bock did not assist the Crown case in certain respects, in particular her description of the clothing of the men and her description of their movements after the attack. I will return to these issues later in the judgment. 
     
      
    61 Daniela Galgoczy was working at a real estate agency in Park Road, Wallacia on 28 June 2006. She was in a bathroom at the back of the office, which had a small window which looked towards the side of the hotel. She heard a lot of “skurfuffle” and moaning and a lady saying “leave him alone, leave him alone” (T105.36). She went outside and saw someone was injured. The lady she had heard earlier was speaking on a phone. She saw three persons walking away from the incident towards the back of the hotel (T105-106). A few minutes later, perhaps five or 10 minutes later, she recognised one of the three men walking past and get into a Toyota Landcruiser which he drove away. She subsequently told police the registration number of the vehicle (T107-108). 
     
      
    62 In cross-examination, Ms Galgoczy said she had not seen anyone punch or kick the person on the ground (T111). She said that the Landcruiser was parked in the bottle shop driveway area. She and Ms Bock were outside on a grassed area adjacent to the real estate office, when she saw the person walk toward the Toyota Landcruiser and drive off. He walked from the beer garden area adjacent to the car park of the hotel (T114-115).  
     
      
    63 Although a number of other witnesses were called in the Crown case, their evidence does not bear directly upon the arguments advanced in support of the present appeals, and it is not necessary to refer further to that evidence. 
     
      
    64 Each of the Appellants gave evidence. Simon Rasic said that he had observed two suspicious-looking men outside the hotel door, as Mr Psaroudis walked through it, and that he decided to walk out because of that (T181). When he got outside, he saw the two men kicking in to Mr Psaroudis. He said he grabbed the man closest to him and pulled him off and pushed him away from Mr Psaroudis. There was a blue car parked nearby. Mr Rasic said that he saw Johnny Vella and Damien Vella near Mr Psaroudis after the altercation, with Johnny Vella wrestling with the other man. Mr Rasic said Damien Vella was not physically involved in the incident and the two men with whom he and Johnny Vella had grappled walked off towards the rear of the car park (T184). 
     
      
    65 Mr Rasic said that he re-entered the hotel, picked up his belongings on the table and then left the hotel. He walked past those present to the car park. He looked down in front of him and saw a brown wallet, which he picked up. It was not his wallet and he put it in his pocket. He was on his own when this occurred (T186).  
     
      
    66 Mr Rasic said that, when he re-entered the hotel after assisting Mr Psaroudis, Ms Radakovic was screaming and yelling at Damien Vella that she was calling the police and she was swearing (T187). Mr Rasic returned to the white Toyota vehicle in which Johnny and Damien Vella and Mr Rasic had travelled to the hotel that day. Johnny and Damien Vella were already in the vehicle. Mr Rasic jumped in the rear passenger seat and they drove straight to Narellan, where they stopped and had a pizza at a pizza shop on Camden Valley Way. At that time, Mr Rasic asked Johnny Vella whether he could drive him to Liverpool to the MCA motorcycle shop as he wished to make some purchases (T187-188).  
     
      
    67 Mr Rasic purchased items on three occasions at the MCA shop using the American Express card. He said that he did not know whose card it was, but he knew the name on the card was not his, and he signed the invoices attempting to use the name on the card. Mr Rasic stated that at no stage did he give the card to Johnny or Damien Vella, nor did he show the card to either of them (T188). The items purchased were placed in the white Toyota in which they had travelled, and Johnny and Damien Vella and Mr Rasic then drove to Mr Rasic’s house where they unloaded all of the parts in his shed (T190).  
     
      
    68 Mr Rasic denied striking or kicking Mr Psaroudis. He said he threw the wallet in the bin at the pizza shop at Camden Valley Way, having taken the American Express card and the cash from it. He said he placed the American Express card in the rubbish bin at his home. He said that he did not see Johnny Vella or Damien Vella physically come into contact with Mr Psaroudis at the Wallacia Hotel (T190-191).  
     
      
    69 Under cross-examination, Mr Rasic agreed that he was having a drink with the other Appellants and a friend, Matthew Waldron, at the Wallacia Hotel that day and that Mr Waldron had been a friend of his for about 15 years (T193). Mr Waldron was not called as a witness at the trial by the Crown or defence. 
     
      
    70 Mr Rasic said it was a complete coincidence that he got up to leave the hotel at the same time as Mr Psaroudis, and that he did not have concerns that these men were going to do anything to Mr Psaroudis, merely that they were acting suspiciously (T196). Mr Rasic said that he called Johnny Vella to come with him, but did not say anything to Damien Vella (T197-198). He said the two men outside commenced to hit and then kick Mr Psaroudis, and Mr Rasic then became involved to help Mr Psaroudis (T198-199). Mr Rasic said he went back into the hotel to get his belongings, and Ms Radakovic was telling Damien Vella that she was going to call the police (T199-200). Mr Rasic was asked in cross-examination (T201.13): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you have any thoughts of staying to give a description of the two men who attacked George Psaroudis? 
         
        A. Yeah, we thought about that but the lady that was standing said she would call the police and I thought she was blaming us for what had happened so I thought we had better leave, you know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you had done nothing wrong though? 
         
        A. I know, but I thought it was best to leave. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You actually helped this man from being bashed or worse? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And Johnny Vella too had saved him from being bashed? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You had no concerns about what you had done on that afternoon to tell the authorities about what had happened? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You but  
        [sic]  
        left anyway? 
         
        A. That’s correct.” 
        
       
      
    71 The cross-examination then turned to the wallet (T201.37): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Whereabouts was the wallet when you saw it? 
         
        A. Just outside the double doors. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How close was George Psaroudis to where the wallet was that you picked up? 
         
        A. From the double doors to where he was sitting it was probably about three metres away. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You just picked it up? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you look inside it? 
         
        A. No. Not until I got in the car. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there any reason you didn’t look inside it at that time? 
         
        A. No, I thought it was the blokes that jumped George, I thought it was their wallet so I just picked it up and put it straight into my pocket. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You thought it was those two men, one of their wallets? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t think it could have been George Psaroudis’ wallet? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you care? 
         
        A. Sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you care whose wallet it was? 
         
        A. No, not really. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You got into the car, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you open up the wallet then? 
         
        A. When we were driving, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you see inside? 
         
        A. I just opened it up and took a sum of money out of it, a credit card and folded it back up and put it in my pocket.” 
        
       
      
    72 Mr Rasic said that he did not see Mr Waldron do anything wrong at the hotel (T210). Mr Rasic said that he had not planned to go to the MCA motorcycle shop until he discovered the wallet containing the cash and credit card (T210). He asked Johnny Vella and Damien Vella to pick out some parts for him in the motorcycle shop (T211). Although it had been a spur of the moment decision to go to the motorcycle shop, Mr Rasic said that Johnny Vella and Damien Vella did not express any surprise to him when he was making substantial and expensive purchases (T213). 
     
      
    73 Mr Rasic could provide no explanation as to why he did not hand the wallet to Mr Elliot, whom he knew to be the manager of the hotel, nor why he did not wait to give it to police (T227). Nor could he provide any reason as to why he did not check that the wallet belonged to Mr Psaroudis (T227).  
     
      
    74 The Appellant, Johnny Lee Vella, gave evidence. He said that he was called by Mr Rasic so he stood up and walked towards the door, and he saw two men outside hitting a man on the ground (T232). He walked over and there was pushing and shoving between himself and one of the men. He denied kicking or punching Mr Psaroudis at any stage. His cousin, Damien Vella, was behind him (T234-235). 
     
      
    75 Under cross-examination, Johnny Vella said that he thought it best that they leave the hotel after the incident, because he knew that Ms Radakovic was “a bit hysterical” (T250.21). He was asked (T251.38): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You didn’t want to wait around and tell the police about what you had observed? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t want to help the police catch these two men? 
         
        A. I thought it’s best we just go, that’s all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t want to take the glory for doing something so heroic? 
         
        A. I didn’t think it was glory, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you think it was heroic what you did? 
         
        A. No, I was just helping a bloke out; that’s all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Wouldn’t it have also been helpful to hang around and tell the police the details of what these men looked like? 
         
        A. I wasn’t sure if the police were coming at all.” 
        
       
      
    76 Johnny Vella said that the three Appellants went to a pizza shop, and discussion turned to a visit to a motorcycle shop so that Mr Rasic could search for some parts. Johnny Vella thought Mr Rasic owned a tattoo parlour for a job (T255). Johnny Vella agreed he was wearing a baseball cap on this day (T256.7). He said that he was a little bit surprised that Mr Rasic, having gone to the motorcycle shop to buy some spare parts, was buying an engine and that Mr Rasic explained he had got “a new credit card” (T262). 
     
      
    77 Damien Charles Vella gave evidence. He agreed that the CCTV images depicted Mr Rasic leaving the hotel soon after Mr Psaroudis, with Johnny Vella following soon after again (T269). Damien Vella said that as soon as Johnny Vella got up and walked out the doors, he saw there was a “bit of a scuffle just outside the doors” (T269.28). He said that Mr Rasic and Johnny Vella were trying to break two men away from Mr Psaroudis, and then Ms Radakovic came out and was “pretty hysterical and swearing and carrying on and saying … she was going to call the cops” (T270.35). He said he had no knowledge that Mr Rasic possessed an American Express card which had not been issued to him. He helped carry the various items from the motorcycle shop to the vehicle and to unload the material in Mr Rasic’s shed, but he denied having knowledge of Mr Rasic carrying out fraudulent transactions to obtain these items (T274).  
     
      
    78 In cross-examination, Damien Vella said he had seen two suspicious people about 10 minutes before the Appellants walked outside (T279). He thought they were suspicious because they were not coming inside the hotel and they “just kept looking inside and walking side to side” (T280.48). Damien Vella said he did not raise any concerns with his friends about these suspicious persons (T280-281). He did not observe Matthew Waldron do anything wrong or illegal that afternoon (T286). Damien Vella said that Ms Radakovic was swearing and saying she was going to call the police. He was asked (T289.1): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did that concern you? 
         
        A. Well, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You had done nothing wrong? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Simon hadn’t done anything wrong? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Johnny hadn’t done anything wrong? 
         
        A. Well, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The two of them had done something particularly helpful, correct? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Good Samaritans? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was your concern then? 
         
        A. Concern? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was your concern? 
         
        A. Well, it seemed like we were getting blamed for something we didn’t do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you think that it would be a good idea to hang around and clear up the mess? 
         
        A. Not the way she going on, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What, the best thing to do was just to get out of there as quickly as possible, is that right? 
         
        A. The way she was going on, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you say anything back to her at that time? 
         
        A. I don’t recall, I think I was swearing back at her too, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you didn’t say, ‘Look, we helped you, we didn’t do anything wrong’? 
         
        A. Yeah, along those lines, I probably did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At the same time while you were swearing at her? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You knew her co-worker had just been bashed and was on the ground injured, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you though  
        [sic]  
        claim she was blaming you and you were angry about that, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you swore at her? 
         
        A. As I recall, yes.” 
        
       
      
    79 Damien Vella said he was a bit surprised when Mr Rasic purchased the first engine at the motorcycle shop (T295.36). He was a “little bit” surprised when Mr Rasic purchased a second engine (T296.33).  
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    80 Mr Nicholson QC submitted that the verdicts against each Appellant were unreasonable. As he did before the jury, he emphasised variations between the accounts of the witnesses on matters of observation and detail, in particular Ms Radakovic, Mr Elliot, Ms Bock and Ms Galgoczy. He submitted that significant doubts surrounded the guilt of the Appellants on the robbery count, flowing from the conflicting accounts from witnesses concerning the number of people involved in the attack upon Mr Psaroudis, their appearance (including clothing and footwear) and the direction of departure of the attackers after cessation of the attack upon Mr Psaroudis. He submitted that the evidence pointed to Mr Waldron as being one of the assailants upon Mr Psaroudis, but not any of the Appellants. 
     
      
    81 Mr Nicholson QC submitted that the evidence of Ms Bock and Ms Galgoczy pointed to the attackers departing from the hotel. He submitted that it was not consistent with the CCTV footage which demonstrated that two of the Appellants had returned inside the hotel after the attack upon Mr Psaroudis. Reliance was placed upon parts of the evidence of Ms Radakovic and Mr Elliot which suggested that more than three persons were involved in the incident with Mr Psaroudis.  
     
      
    82 All of this, Mr Nicholson QC submitted, was such that substantial doubt existed that any of the Appellants had attacked Mr Psaroudis, and thus the verdicts on the robbery counts were unreasonable and ought be quashed. As the Crown case had been conducted upon the basis that the credit card offences against Johnny Vella and Damien Vella had as a necessary foundation their guilt of the robbery charge, Mr Nicholson QC submitted that substantial doubt existed concerning their guilt on these charges as well, so that the convictions ought be quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    83 The Crown submitted that the CCTV footage was important evidence implicating each of the three Appellants and that the evidence of Ms Radakovic, Mr Elliot, Ms Bock and Ms Galgoczy, when taken with the CCTV footage, was most damaging to each of the Appellants. 
     
      
    84 Further, the Crown submitted that the defence case with respect to each Appellant was inherently implausible. The jury had available to it all relevant evidence, including the evidence of the Appellants, and after giving due consideration to the arguments advanced, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of each Appellant. The Crown submitted that the first ground of appeal ought be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    85 For the purpose of determining this ground of appeal, an assessment has been made of the totality of evidence led at the trial. The hotel CCTV footage was played in Court during the hearing of the appeal and has been viewed again since then. The CCTV footage (Exhibit B) depicted Mr Psaroudis leaving the hotel and Mr Rasic following about two seconds later, followed about three seconds after by Johnny Vella and then Damien Vella some five seconds after his cousin. 
     
      
    86 The evidence before the jury came from several principal sources:  
     
      
       
      (a) the CCTV footage depicting the movements of the Appellants out the hotel door immediately after Mr Psaroudis had left the premises; 
       
       
      (b) the evidence of Mr Psaroudis himself that he was set upon soon after walking out the door and attacked by persons who punched and then kicked him when he was on the ground - his wallet was in his rear pocket before the attack, but was not there when the attack had ceased; 
       
       
      (c) the evidence of Ms Radakovic which, although containing some variations, stated that the three men who had been drinking in the hotel, and who had walked out after Mr Psaroudis, had attacked him - she called for help - her evidence did not give the impression that there were two groups of men, attackers and rescuers, involved in the incident with Mr Psaroudis and this proposition was not put to her in cross-examination - she formed the view that the Appellants were the attackers, and proposed that the police be called and so informed; 
       
       
      (d) the evidence of Ms Bock, who observed three men punching and kicking Mr Psaroudis outside the hotel - although her description of the clothing of the men and the direction of their movement after the attack may not have fitted perfectly with the Crown case, such variations may be expected when a lay witness observes a sudden violent incident such as this - significantly, she did not say that more than three men were involved, and she did not describe a scene where there were two groups of men, attackers and rescuers, and no such scenario was put to her in cross-examination; 
       
       
      (e) the evidence of Ms Galgoczy, who observed three men after the incident with Mr Psaroudis - importantly again, there was no suggestion from her that there were two groups of men, attackers and rescuers, involved in the incident with Mr Psaroudis - once again, although her description of the clothing of the men, and their movements after the incident, may not have fitted entirely with the Crown case, such variations are not unexpected when a lay witness observes part of an incident such as this; 
       
       
      (f) the evidence of Mr Elliot, despite some fluctuations as to the number of men observed, included the statement that three males were involved in a fight with Mr Psaroudis, being males who had been in the hotel shortly before - any possible variation as to numbers again may be explained by his observation of a sudden and unexpected event; 
       
       
      (g) the explanation of each Appellant for not remaining at the scene, whilst police were called, was plainly damaging to each of them - it was open to the jury to regard the sudden departure of the three Appellants, in the face of the police being called and Ms Radakovic asserting that the Appellants were the attackers, as being inconsistent with the actions of innocent men. 
       
      
    87 Further: 
     
      
       
      (a) it was open to the jury to regard Mr Rasic’s account of coincidentally finding the wallet on the ground and taking it away as being implausible - this conclusion was all the more compelling given the criminal use, shortly thereafter, of the American Express card to purchase a very substantial amount of motorcycle equipment and parts - it was open to the jury to conclude that the three Appellants had attacked Mr Psaroudis for the purpose of robbing him; 
       
       
      (b) it was open to the jury to conclude that the three men observed as attackers by Ms Bock and Ms Galgoczy were the three Appellants, a conclusion which was consistent with the accounts of Ms Radakovic and Mr Elliot; 
       
       
      (c) it was open to the jury to have regard to what was done with the contents of Mr Psaroudis’ wallet, soon after the attack upon him, for the purpose of forming a view as to the role, knowledge and intent of the three Appellants in the attack upon Mr Psaroudis - Mr Rasic, Johnny Vella and Damien Vella all travelled to the MCA motorcycle shop at Liverpool, where Mr Rasic used the card to purchase substantial quantities of motorcycle equipment which were removed from the shop and taken to Mr Rasic’s home with the assistance of the other Appellants - the jury were entitled to have regard to these acts of the three Appellants to shed light upon the role and state of mind of the Appellants at the time of the attack upon Mr Psaroudis, and the role and state of mind of Johnny Vella and Damien Vella at the time of the credit card offences committed soon after at Liverpool. 
       
      
    88 It was clearly open to the jury to regard the accounts given in evidence by each Appellant concerning events at the Wallacia Hotel, as implausible. Plainly, the jury rejected the account of each Appellant that each sought to rescue Mr Psaroudis, rather than attack him. In light of the events recorded on CCTV camera, taken with the acts described by Mr Psaroudis, Ms Radakovic, Ms Bock and Ms Galgoczy, it was open to the jury to conclude that the three Appellants acted as robbers, and not rescuers. 
     
      
    89 To the extent that Mr Nicholson QC submitted that the evidence depicted Mr Waldron as an assailant, it should be observed that Mr Rasic and Damien Vella said that Mr Waldron did nothing wrong at the hotel (see [72] and [78] above). Despite this evidence, the jury may well have thought, from the CCTV footage, that Mr Waldron appeared to stand guard at the door inside the hotel after the three Appellants had followed Mr Psaroudis outside. The images depicted on the CCTV footage did not assist defence arguments concerning the alleged role of Mr Waldron.  
     
      
    90 Senior counsel for the Appellants stressed the evidence of Ms Bock and Ms Galgoczy that, some time after the attack, one of the assailants drove away in a Toyota Landcruiser. He submitted that this was Mr Waldron. The CCTV footage depicted Mr Waldron remaining in the hotel apparently standing guard, at a time when Mr Psaroudis was under attack. This posed a further difficulty for the defence argument that Mr Waldron was an assailant. The appropriate conclusion is that the jury may have accepted that Mr Waldron drove away in the Toyota Landcruiser, but that Ms Bock and Ms Galgoczy were mistaken in the view that this person was one of the assailants.  
     
      
    91 This Court must make its own assessment of the evidence. The assessment is of the cumulative effect of the evidence, and with due regard to the common experience of human affairs and common sense brought by the jury to their determination of guilt of innocence of each Appellant (see [30] above).92 I am well satisfied that it was open to the jury to convict each of the Appellants on each of the counts under challenge in the present appeal. It is true that some aspects of the evidence involved conflicts and imperfections. But that is not uncommon in trials (see [27] above) and, in particular, where witnesses observe a sudden and violent incident involving a number of persons. Variations in the particulars of the accounts given by witnesses with respect to clothing, the number of persons involved and other secondary aspects, including the later movement of persons, are to be expected in such a case.  
     
      
    93 The jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing each of the Crown witnesses give evidence together with each of the Appellants. As explained above (at [86]), there were features of the Crown case against each Appellant which were, in my view, compelling. The accumulation of evidence rendered the Crown case a strong one. The evidence of each Appellant was implausible on critical issues. The jury were entitled to have regard to their common experience of human affairs and common sense in reaching verdicts with respect to each Appellant (see [30] above).  
     
      
    94 Having undertaken the assessment required by law, it has not been demonstrated that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted in this case. To the contrary, in my view, there was a strong Crown case implicating each of the Appellants in the joint criminal enterprise of robbing Mr Psaroudis. There was a strong Crown case implicating Johnny Vella and Damien Vella in the criminal use of the American Express card by Mr Rasic, for the purpose of obtaining substantial and valuable motorcycle parts. 
     
      
    95 Upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of each Appellant of the offences for which they were convicted after trial. It has not been demonstrated that any of the verdicts of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. The first ground of appeal ought be rejected with respect to each Appellant. 
     
      
    96 In these circumstances, the secondary assistance which each Appellant seeks to obtain from Ground 2 does not arise. The verdicts of the jury were reasonable and were supported by the evidence. The conduct of the Crown Prosecutor at trial, about which I express no criticism, did not lead to verdicts which were otherwise not open to the jury. Rather, the verdicts were a consequence of the jury accepting a strong Crown case with respect to each of the Appellants. 
     
      
    97 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) grant each Appellant leave to appeal against his convictions; 
       
      
    (b) dismiss the appeal of Simon Rasic; 
     
      
       
      (c) dismiss the appeal of Johnny Lee Vella; 
       
       
      (d) dismiss the appeal of Damien Charles Vella.

   THE LAND AND ENVIRONMENT COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESPRESTON CJ 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    18 AUGUST 200950039 OF 2008DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE v JOHN RAEJUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: John Rae has pleaded guilty to a charge of clearing native vegetation, contrary to s 12(1) of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (“the Act”), on his farming property, “Argrey” near Quambone, in the Coonamble local government area, New South Wales between 1 August and 30 September 2007. Mr Rae is now to be sentenced for the offence.Facts of the offence2 Mr Rae bought the property in June 2007 for $2,240.000. The property is approximately 3,300 hectares. It has been used for grazing and cropping for at least the last 30 years. Nevertheless, at the time of the offence, the property had a number of wooded areas. The trees were mostly Poplar Box (Eucalyptus populnea) and Belah (Casuarina cristata), which had been there for many decades. In August and September 2007, Mr Rae and one of his employees undertook a clearing program on the property. Clearing was undertaken using a Caterpillar D7 dozer and a Komatsu dozer. The trees, which were uprooted, were pushed over using the blade of the bulldozer. A considerable number of trees were knocked down in twelve distinct areas on the property. Some areas were almost completely cleared while in other areas the clearing was more selective. The areas which were either partially or completely cleared covered an area of approximately 215 hectares. Of this area, approximately 155 hectares were cleared to an extent of over 95%, that is to say, that only 5% of the trees that were formerly there remained after the clearing.  
     
      
    3 The trees which were killed included Eucalyptus populnea subspecies Bimbil (Poplar box or Bimbil box); Geijera parviflora (Wilga); Casuarina cristata (Belah); Capparis mitchellii (Wild orange or Native orange) and Eucalyptus largiflorens (Black Box). These species are native to New South Wales. Most of the trees that were cleared were mature trees, some of them were in excess of 17 metres in height and had trunks with a diameter of more than 40cm at breast height.4 In pleading guilty to the offence, Mr Rae has admitted the essential elements of the offence, namely: 
     
      
      (a) clearing occurred on the property;  
       
      (b) the clearing was of “native vegetation” as defined in the Act; 
       
      (c) the clearing was not done in accordance with any development consent granted in accordance with the Act; 
       
      (d) the clearing was not done in accordance with any property vegetation plan approved under the Act; and 
       
      (e) Mr Rae carried out or was legally responsible for the carrying out of the clearing. 
       
      
    5 The clearing was reported to the Department of Environment and Climate Change in November 2007 to persons in the area. Officers of the Department investigated the clearing and prepared evidence. Officers attempted to contact Mr Rae for many months but he did not return their calls.6 In June 2008, Mr Rae voluntarily submitted to an interview under caution with officers of the Department. In the course of the interview Mr Rae admitted that he had knocked down trees on the property; that he knew that he needed consent before clearing the trees but decided to go ahead without seeking consent in case he was not successful in obtaining consent and would be prevented from clearing in the future; and that he cleared the trees to improve the property to make it more viable and increase its capital value.Purposes of sentencing7 Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that the purposes of imposing a sentence on an offender include: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence; 
         
         
        (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,  
         
        … 
         
         
        (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
        
       
       
        
        (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.” 
        
       
      
    8 The sentence of the court is a public denunciation of the conduct of the offender. The sentence must ensure that the offender is held accountable for his or her actions and is adequately punished or given his just deserts. The sentence must deter the offender from committing similar offences in the future.9 Most importantly, the sentence of the court needs to operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar offences by persons who might be tempted to do so by the prospect that, if they are caught, only light punishment will be imposed: R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 597. The purpose of general deterrence is particularly relevant when imposing a sentence for offences of clearing of native vegetation contrary to law: see Cameron v Eurobodalla Shire Council  (2006) 146 LGERA 349 at [59], [71]-[80]; Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [103]-[106]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Taylor  [2007] NSWLEC 530 at [31]-[33]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Wilton [2008] NSWLEC 297 at [77]; Climate Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4; (2009) 165 LGERA 256 at [81]-[88]; and Pittwater Council v Scahill [2009] NSWLEC 12; (2009) 165 LGERA 289 at [45]; Lamattina & Anor v Gould [2009] SASC 130 (15 May 2009) at [73] and Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina [2009] FCA 753 (17 July 2009) at [47].10 In the last mentioned case, Mansfield J stated at [47]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is appropriate that the penalty be fixed in an amount which is likely to have a strong deterrent effect on the public and to demonstrate to the public and those whose business interests are conducted on land on which there is native vegetation that such conduct is seriously regarded by the community, as expressed in the legislation. The amount of the pecuniary penalty needs to demonstrate that such conduct will not be tolerated by the court.” 
        
       
      
    11 The clearing of native vegetation from land is invariably undertaken for the purpose of commercial gain. On land used or proposed to be used for purposes of urban or rural residential development, clearing of native vegetation might be intended to remove a perceived impediment, enable an attribute of the land to be realised or better realised (such as views), lessen costs of development or increase density, yield or profits, with the expectation of a concomitant increase in the capital value of the land. Examples where sentencing courts have noted that clearing was undertaken for commercial gain include: Director General of National Parks and Wildlife v Wilkinson & Anor; Director General of Department of Land and Water Conservation v Wilkinson [2002] NSWLEC 171 at [92]; Cameron v Eurobodalla Shire Council (2006) 146 LGERA 349 at [70]; Gittany v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [141] Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [246], [247].12 On land used or proposed to be used for purposes of agriculture, clearing of native vegetation might be intended to increase the grazing productivity (such as increasing pasture and stocking rate), change from a financially lower yielding to a financially higher yielding agricultural use (such as from grazing to cropping) or facilitate more practical and cost effective operations, including of machinery and equipment, also with the expectation of an increase in the capital value of the land. Sentencing courts have repeatedly noted that offenders have cleared native vegetation for commercial gain: see, as examples, Piva v Brinkworth (1992) 59 SASR 92 at 96; Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No. 3) [2004] FCA 1317; (2004) 136 LGERA 89 at [65] and see also [47], [48], [59] and [61]; Director-General Department of Environment and Climate Change v Wilton [2008] NSWLEC 297 at [51], [76]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4; (2009) 165 LGERA 256 at [78]; Lamattina & Anor v Gould [2009] SASC 130 at [3], [17] and [19]; Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina [2009] FCA 753 at [39] and [68].13 The very high maximum penalties fixed by parliaments for offences of clearing native vegetation contrary to law are, to a significant extent, intended to act as a deterrent, a countervailing disincentive to the economic incentives to clear native vegetation illegally. The penalties imposed by sentencing courts for offences of clearing native vegetation need to be of such magnitude or nature as to make the financial cost to an offender outweigh the likely commercial gain by offending. In this way, the sentence of the court changes the economic calculus of the offender and also of other owners, occupiers and developers of land on which native vegetation occurs who might be tempted to clear illegally by the prospect that only light punishment will be imposed by the courts. Compliance with the law becomes cheaper than offending. Crime becomes economically irrational. 
     
      
    Objective gravity of the offence14 In determining the objective gravity of the offence, the circumstances of the offence in this case to which the Court may have regard include: the nature of the offence; the maximum penalty for the offence; the harm caused to the environment by commission of the offence; the state of mind of the offender for committing the offences; the offender’s reason for committing the offences; the foreseeable risk of harm to the environment by commission of the offence; the practical measures to avoid harm to the environment; and the offender’s control over the causes of harm to the environment.Nature of the offence15 The objective seriousness of an environmental offence is illuminated by the nature of the statutory provision, contravention of which constitutes the offence and its place in the statutory scheme: Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd  [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [51]-[[71], [168]-[169]. A proper understanding of the purpose of creating an offence is assisted by consideration of the objects of the statute: Environment Protection Authority v Le Dome Pty Ltd  (2002) 125 LGERA 121 at 132 [80]; Environment Protection Authority v Coe Drilling Australia Pty Ltd [2005] NSWLEC 719 at [132]. A fundamental consideration with particular relevance to environmental offences, is the degree by which, having regard to the maximum penalties by the statute in question, the offender’s conduct would offend against the legislative objective expressed in the statutory offence: R v Peel [1971] 1 NSWLR 247 at 262; Garrett v Williams [2006] NSWLEC 785; (2006) 160 LGERA 115 at [89] and Garrett v Freeman (No. 5); Garrett v Port Macquarie Hastings Council; Carter v Port Macquarie Hastings Council [2009] NSWLEC 1 at [52]; (2009) 164 LGERA 287.16 The objects of the Act are stated in s 3 to be: 
     
      
       
        
        “The objects of this Act are: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (a) to provide for, encourage and promote the management of native vegetation on a regional basis in the social, economic and environmental interests of the State, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) to prevent broadscale clearing unless it improves or maintains environmental outcomes, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) to protect native vegetation of high conservation value having regard to its contribution to such matters as water quality, biodiversity, or the prevention of salinity or land degradation, and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) to improve the condition of existing native vegetation, particularly where it has high conservation value, and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) to encourage the revegetation of land, and the rehabilitation of land, with appropriate native vegetation, 
        
        
         
        in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.” 
        
       
      
    17 One of the principal means by which these objects are achieved is by the Act prohibiting clearing of native vegetation, but enabling a person to be relieved of the prohibition by applying for and obtaining consent from the regulatory authority. The application for consent involves undertaking an environmental impact assessment of the clearing for which consent is sought. The statutory provisions requiring prior environmental impact assessment and consent are linchpins of the Act. An offence against such provisions thwarts the attainment of the objects of the Act, including ecologically sustainable development. The discussion in Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [65]-[71], [168], [169], although concerning the regulatory scheme under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, is equally apposite to the Native Vegetation Act 2003.18 There is a need for the upholding of the regulatory system under the Act. The system depends on persons, first, taking steps to ascertain when consent is required to clear native vegetation, secondly, making application in the appropriate form and manner (including environmental impact assessment) and obtaining any consent so required before undertaking the clearing and, thirdly, complying with the terms and conditions of the consent in undertaking the clearing. Sentencing courts have emphasised the need to uphold the integrity of the regulatory system relating to native vegetation and fauna: see Cameron v Eurobodalla Shire Council (2006) 146 LGERA 349, 355-356 at [72]-[77]; Garrett v Freeman (No. 5) [2009] NSWLEC 1 at [68]; (2009) 164 LGERA 287; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Wilton [2008] NSWLEC 297 at [77]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4; (2009) 165 LGERA 256 at [76]; Pittwater Council v Scahill [2009] NSWLEC 12; (2009) 165 LGERA 289 at 299 [46]. 19 Offences which undermine the integrity of the regulatory system are objectively serious. Use of the criminal law ensures the credibility of the regulatory system.20 The actions of Mr Rae in clearing native vegetation on the property without first applying for and obtaining consent under the Act offend against the legislative objective expressed in the statutory offence and also thwart the attainment of the objects of the Act. As found below, the native vegetation cleared had significant conservation status and contributed to biodiversity, the effects of clearing were similar to those caused by broadscale clearing and there has been a high degree of environmental harm caused. The actions of Mr Rae and their consequences run counter to the objects of the Act and are also not in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, for reasons analogous to those given in Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [67]-[71], [169]-[171].Maximum penalty21 At the time of the commission of the offence the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament was 10,000 penalty units or $1,100,000 and a further daily penalty of 1,000 penalty units or $110,000: see s 12(2) of the Act which refers to s 126(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.22 These high maximum penalties reflect the seriousness with which Parliament views the offence of clearing of native vegetation contrary to s 12(1) of the Act.Harm to the environment23 The clearing constituting the offence affected an area of approximately 215 hectares. Of this, 155 hectares were cleared to an extent that only 5% of the trees that were formerly there remain.24 The prosecutor read affidavit evidence from Mr Darren Shelly, a terrestrial ecologist employed by the Department of Environment and Climate Change, on the environmental harm caused by the offence. He was not required for cross-examination by the defendant. 25 Mr Shelly stated that, prior to the clearing, about 75% of the property had been cleared of vegetation leaving only the occasional isolated tree. In the remaining 25% of the property, portions of relatively intact woody vegetation occurred in patches and small remnants. All of the areas of clearing undertaken by or on behalf of Mr Rae were located in these woody remnants. The largest remnants have been significantly reduced in size, in most cases to small patches that are no longer vegetatively connected. Several large remnants have been completely removed leaving only isolated trees.26 Mr Shelly identifies the vegetation in the cleared areas to comprise two types of woodlands, the majority being Poplar Box (Eucalyptus populnea) woodlands and the remainder Belah (Casuarina cristata) woodlands. Both of these types of woodlands fall within categories of vegetation communities assessed as having significant conservation status. The Poplar Box woodlands fall within the broad vegetation type of Box woodlands that is listed as most threatened in the Darling Riverina Plains Interim Biogeographical Regionalisation of Australia (IBRA) Region, the region in which the property is located.27 At State level, the Poplar Box woodland closely corresponds to the Eucalyptus populnea-Eucalyptus mitchellii-Geijera parviflora community on the north west plains, which has a V1 status (Risk code V = vulnerable: likely to become endangered within a few decades if action is not taken to rectify the decline of the association and protect and manage the area. Conservation code 1 = not conserved or if so only miniscule areas are located in reserves). The Belah woodland closely corresponds to the Causarina cristata-Heterodendron oleifolium (Rosewood) community on the slopes and plains, which has a V2 conservation status (Risk code V= vulnerable: likely to become endangered within a few decades if action is not taken to rectify the decline of the association and protect and manage areas. Conservation code 2= inadequately conserved, either because only relatively small areas are located in reserves or major parts of its geographical range remains unprotected).28 At the regional level of plant communities of the NSW western plains, the vegetation in the Poplar Box woodland cleared on the property conforms most closely to the vegetation community description of “Poplar Box grassy/shrubby woodland on alluvial clay-loam soils mainly in the temperate (hot summer) climate zone of central NSW (wheatbelt)”. This vegetation community has been assessed as endangered ie. facing a very high risk of becoming extinct in the near term due to a 70%-90% reduction in extent and/or range. The community has been mostly cleared for crops and grazing and few patches remain in good condition. It is listed that 0.02% of the original distribution is currently reserved. The vegetation in the Belah woodland cleared corresponds to “Belah woodland on alluvial plains in central-north NSW”. This vegetation community has been assessed as endangered ie. facing a very high risk of becoming extinct in the near term due to a 70%-90% reduction in extent and/or range. Most of this community has been cleared for grazing or cropping. It is listed that 0.11% of the original distribution is currently reserved. 29 Mr Shelly further assesses the environmental harm caused by the clearing by reference to a number of parameters. These impacts are summarised in his conclusion as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The vegetation cleared on ‘Argrey’ was vegetation native to the state of New South Wales and in existence prior to 1990. In my opinion, the clearing of approximately 215 hectares of open woodland/woodland forming several intact remnants within a moderately fragmented local region, has caused a moderate degree of environmental harm to the immediate district but a high degree of harm to native vegetation on the subject property. 
        
       
       
        
        The clearing has had the following adverse impacts: 
        
       
       
        
        ·  
        The clearing has increased vegetation fragmentation in the area. This will have major implications in the viability of populations of a number of plant and animal species likely to be present. 
        
       
       
        
        ·  
        Connectivity in the locality and region has been further reduced. 
        
       
       
        
        ·  
        Vegetation communities not adequately represented in conservation reserves have been removed. 
        
       
       
        
        ·  
        Native vegetation important for the maintenance of biodiversity on a local and regional scale has been lost. 
        
       
       
        
        ·  
        A significant area of known habitat for eleven species of threatened fauna and one species of threatened flora has been removed, thereby placing local populations at possible risk of extinction.” 
        
       
      
    30 In relation to loss of biodiversity, Mr Shelly observed the clearing has resulted in the almost total removal of woody vegetation (apart from isolated trees) from ten of the twelve separate areas that were previously of woodland or open woodland tree density and the thinning of the other two areas. Therefore, most of the tree species and all of the understorey and shrub species have been removed. Based on the species list for the Coonamble/Walgett District for similar vegetation types, clearing of all woody vegetation would result in the loss of 31 flora species (16 tree species, 9 shrub species and 6 mistletoe (vines) for Poplar Box open woodland/woodlands and 10 flora species (7 tree/understorey and 3 shrub species) for Poplar Box/Wilga woodlands. This represents a reduction in flora species richness of 23% for Poplar Box open woodland/woodlands and 19% for Poplar Box/Wilga woodlands vegetation communities.31 As far as fauna is concerned, Mr Shelly opined that the conversion of the vegetation structure from open woodland/woodlands dominated by Poplar Box and/or Wilga and Belah to either an open grassland/forbland with isolated trees or to be a rotational cultivation paddock with isolated trees in the future, has the potential to lead to a reduction of vertebrate fauna species richness of between 40% for Poplar Box open woodlands/woodlands (from 108 vertebrate fauna species to 66 species for grassland/forbland/cultivation woodland) and 41% for Poplar Box/Wilga woodlands (from 110 vertebrate fauna species to 66 species for grassland/forbland/cultivation). The reduction may in fact be greater because 36 of the 66 species (55%) recorded utilising grassland/forbland/cultivation with scattered trees require woody vegetation for roosting and/or nesting and so would be negatively impacted upon by the clearing of such a large area of woodland.32 Mr Shelly also gives some broad estimates of the number of individuals of birds, reptiles and frogs that could potentially have been lost by the clearing: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “To put the potential decrease of biodiversity from the loss of the subject vegetation into perspective, Bennett (1993) estimated that for every 100 hectares of woodland that is cleared, between 1,000-2,000 birds permanently lost their habitat. Ehmann and Cogger (1985) conservatively estimated a mean density of 250 reptiles and frogs per hectare throughout native vegetation in Australia. The majority of the above species would have been killed directly or indirectly (via displacement) by the clearing of the subject vegetation. From these admittedly very broad estimates, the loss of approximately 215 hectares of native woodland could lead to the eventual loss of 2,150-4,300 birds and 53,750 reptiles and frogs.” 
        
       
      
    33 In relation to threatened species, the eleven species of threatened fauna are: 
     
      
      Barking Owl ( 
      Ninox connivens 
      ) 
       
      Painted Honeyeater ( 
      Grantiella picta 
      ) 
       
      Black-chinned Honeyeater ( 
      Melithreptus gularis gularis 
      ) 
       
      Superb Parrot ( 
      Polytelis swainsonii 
      ) 
       
      Glossy Black Cockatoo ( 
      Calyptorhynchus lathami 
      ) 
       
      Bush Stone-culew ( 
      Burhinus grallarius 
      ) 
       
      Hooded Robin ( 
      Melanodryas cucullata cucullata 
      ) 
       
      Diamond Firetail ( 
      Stagonopleura guttata 
      ) 
       
      Grey-crowned Babbler ( 
      Pomatostomus temporalis temporalis) 
       
      Yellow-bellied Sheathtail-bat ( 
      Saccolaimus flaviventris 
      ) 
       
      Little Pied Bat ( 
      Chalinolobus picatus 
      ) 
       
       
      and the one species of threatened flora is: 
       
       
      Shrub Sida ( 
      Sida rohlenae 
      ). 
      
    34 Mr Shelly expanded on the impact of the clearing on threatened fauna in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to threatened fauna, the clearing would have had the greatest effect on species with limited mobility, species dependent upon the tree canopy cover provided by woodland and those likely to have had breeding habitat within the subject land. In my opinion, these species would include the Little Pied Bat, Yellow-bellied Sheathtail Bat, Barking Owl, Diamond Firetail, Grey-crowned Babbler and Hooded Robin. In addition, the loss of patches of Belah from across the property will have significantly reduced the prime food source for the Glossy Black Cockatoo as it is known to feed almost exclusively on Belah cones on the western plains. 
        
       
       
        
        It is my opinion that the clearing of native vegetation on the land in question has had the following effect on population of the eleven threatened fauna species listed previously, with particular impacts on the seven species listed above: 
        
       
       
        
        ·  
        removed a significant area of known habitat, and 
        
        
        ·  
        removed habitat for threatened species inadequately represented in conservation reserves in the region, and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ·  
        being an activity which is recognised as a Key Threatening Process under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW Scientific Committee 2001). 
         
         
        The clearing has removed some remnants of native vegetation and significantly reduced the size of several others in a district that is moderately fragmented by development, thus significantly reducing the ‘stepping stone’ value of remaining habitat for wildlife to traverse the local region. In addition, it is my opinion that the overall extent of the remnants on the property prior to clearing would have been large enough to support breeding populations of most threatened species if they were present as they were close enough to be used by highly mobile species as the one territory. The clearing would have had a negative effect on local threatened species populations as it caused further removal and fragmentation of their habitat. I consider that the magnitude of this effect would have been sufficient to be considered a likely significant impact under the seven-part test”. 
        
       
      
    35 Mr Rae contested that the number of trees cleared was as high as had been suggested by the prosecutor. He gave oral evidence endeavouring to estimate the number of trees he and his employee might have cleared and their proximity to one another. The defendant’s submission was that the clearing was selective and not broadscale, and hence of lesser environmental impact.36 However, such evidence and submissions do not provide an effective rebuttal to Mr Shelly’s evidence of the extent and significance of environmental harm caused by the clearing. This evidence is not dependent on a simple count of the number of trees. 37 The significance of the number of trees removed needs to be evaluated in the context of the vegetation type in which the trees occur. The vegetation types of woodland and open woodland, by definition, have lower average densities (numbers) of trees per hectare than forest vegetation types, and hence will have greater space between trees. Hence, removal of a particular number of trees over a given area will have materially different effects if the vegetation type is a woodland or open woodland than a forest; it may result in the total or almost total clearance of the land in a woodland or open woodland but only partial clearance in a forest.38 The significance of the number of trees needs also to be evaluated by reference to the trees involved - their species, nature, age, ecological attributes, biological interactions and contribution to ecosystem functioning amongst other features – and the consequences caused by their removal. Mr Shelly’s evidence is that the areas cleared were woodlands with relatively intact woody vegetation. The clearing resulted in the almost total removal of woody vegetation (apart from isolated trees) from ten of the twelve areas that were previously of woodland or open woodland tree density. 155 hectares were cleared to an extent that only 5% of the trees that were formerly there remained. The clearing increased fragmentation, reduced vegetative connectivity and removed inadequately conserved vegetation communities, native vegetation important for maintenance of biodiversity and habitat of threatened species. Taking account of all of these factors, the effect of the clearance was similar to that of broadscale clearing, an outcome which the Act was intended to prevent (see s 3(b) of the Act).39 I note a similar submission was made to, but rejected by, the court in Lamattina & Anor v Gould [2009] SASC 130 at [65]-[69].40 I find the commission of the offence caused actual environmental harm of high seriousness. Such harm can be considered to be substantial and an aggravating factor in terms of s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).41 Remediation for the environmental harm may be able to be achieved, to some degree, by Mr Rae carrying out remedial work pursuant to a direction dated 18 May 2009, issued by the Department under s 38 of the Act, which Mr Rae has accepted (as advised by Mr Rae’s solicitor, by letter to the Court dated 22 June 2009 enclosing the direction, which have been marked as an exhibit). The remedial works include fencing eight remediation areas for the purpose of excluding stock; removing stock from the fenced remediation areas; removing exotic species, commercial crops or non-native plant species from the remediation areas; and planting specified native species (Eucalyptus populnea, Casuarina cristata and Geijera parviflora) in the remediation areas. Mr Rae is also required to undertake monitoring, recording and reporting to the Department of Environment and Climate Change.State of mind of the offender42 The offence against s 12(1) of the Act is a strict liability offence and mens rea is not an element of the offence. Nevertheless, the state of mind of an offender at the time of the offence can have an effect of increasing the seriousness of the offence. A strict liability offence that is committed intentionally, negligently or recklessly will be objectively more serious than one not so committed: Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [123]; Garrett v Freeman (No. 5) [2009] NSWLEC 1; (2009) 164 LGERA 287 at [68], [356]; Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4; (2009) 165 LGERA 256 at [75]; Pittwater Council v Scahill [2009] NSWLEC 12; (2009) 165 LGERA 289 at [69]. 43 A large measure of premeditation will make an offence more serious than if it is committed on the spur of the moment: Morabito v The Queen (1992) 62 A Crim R 82 at 86; Dempsey v The Queen [2002] QCA 45; (2002) 127 A Crim R 113.44 Here, Mr Rae knew that the Native Vegetation Act applied to the property and that he needed to make application for, and to obtain consent under the Act to clear the native vegetation on the property. Mr Rae owned other properties in the area, including a property known as “Kirkwood”. Mr Rae had applied for and obtained consent under the Act to clear native vegetation on “Kirkwood”. He had also applied for consent to clear native vegetation on other land but had been refused. Mr Rae said he was concerned that if he made application to clear native vegetation on “Argrey” but was refused consent, then he would never be able to clear the native vegetation on the property. He wanted to clear the native vegetation to improve its farming capacity and hence the value of the property. The presence of the trees meant it had very low value for grazing. Clearing would open the land and improve its grazing and farming potential. 45 Mr Rae, therefore, made a deliberate decision to clear the native vegetation, without applying for and obtaining consent, in the knowledge that to do so was illegal. He hoped he would not be caught. Mr Rae said, that he realised from the time that the trees he had cleared were on the ground there was going to be a problem. He said that he wanted to get rid of the evidence by burning the trees. However, he had heard that he could not do so because there was a fire ban. Ultimately, he was caught because two neighbours reported him to the Department of Environment and Climate Change. 46 Mr Rae’s conduct in clearing the native vegetation was premeditated and intentionally carried out with knowledge of its illegality. This increases the objective seriousness of the offence.Reasons for committing the offence47 The criminality involved in the commission of offences is to be measured not only by the seriousness of what occurred but also by reference to the reasons for its occurrence: Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 157 at 366; Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [237]; Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [140] and Garrett v Williams [2006] NSWLEC 785; (2006) 160 LGERA 115 at [120].48 The carrying out of an offence to make a profit or to save incurring an expense, or to avoid the cost of obtaining and implementing a statutory permission such as a development consent or environmental protection licence, increases the seriousness of the crime. Offenders should not profit from crime: Garrett v Williams [2006] NSWLEC 785; (2006) 160 LGERA 115 at [121].49 In this case, Mr Rae was the owner and occupier of the property. Mr Rae perceived the native vegetation on the property to be a real impediment to his agricultural business. He deliberately decided to clear the native vegetation to improve the agricultural productivity and profits from the property and to improve its capital value. Such reasons for committing the offence increase its objective seriousness: Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242; (2006) 145 LGERA 189 at [141]; Bentley BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34; (2006) 145 LGERA 234 at [238], [246]-[247], Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4; (2009) 165 LGERA 256 at [78] and Pittwater Council v Scahill [2009] NSWLEC 12; (2009) LGERA 289 at [82]. Foreseeability and risk of harm50 Having regard to the nature and extent of the clearing, and the native vegetation cleared, a reasonable person would foresee the risk of harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence. The extent of foreseeability of harm is a relevant objective circumstance of the offence: Camilleri’s Stockfeeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at 700.51 Indeed, it is reasonable to infer that Mr Rae in fact foresaw the risk that clearing of native vegetation on the property was likely to cause harm to the environment. Mr Rae’s decision not to apply for consent was based on his concern that if he did so the Department of Environment and Climate Change might refuse consent, because the clearing of native vegetation on the land would cause unacceptable harm to the environment, and if that occurred he would then be unable to clear the native vegetation on the property in the future.Practical measures to prevent risk of harm52 Mr Rae could and should have refrained from clearing the native vegetation on the property unless and until development consent had been obtained authorising the clearing. That was the law, as Mr Rae well knew.Control over causes53 Mr Rae carried out and directed his employee to carry out the clearing of native vegetation on the property and therefore had control over the causes of harm to the environment. Conclusion on objective circumstances54 Having regard to the nature of the offence; the high maximum penalty; the high degree of harm to the environment; the pre-meditated and intentional commission of the offence with knowledge of its illegality; the commission of the offence to increase the profit and capital value to the offender; the foreseeability of risk of harm to the environment by reason of commission of the offence; the existence of practical measures to avoid that risk of harm; the control over the causes of harm to the environment, the offence should be considered to be of medium objective gravity.Subjective circumstances of the defendant55 Within the limits set by the objective gravity of the offence, the Court may take into account the favourable factors personal to the offender. Lack of prior criminality56 Mr Rae does not have any prior convictions for any environmental offences: s 21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.Prior good character of offender57 There is evidence that Mr Rae has otherwise been of good character: s 21A(3)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Two character references were tendered, one by Mr Richard Gemmell, a rural property specialist with Elders in Dubbo and Mr Ross Hubbard, the managing director of a farm equipment business, Claas NVI Harvest Centre. Mr Gemmell states that Mr Rae is “a very valuable, trustworthy and highly respected member of the Coonamble and broader community” who has been involved in many local organisations including the Coonamble Wool Co-Operative, the Agricultural Show Society and other local farming organisations. Mr Hubbard states that Mr Rae is “an honest and hardworking rural farming leader in his field”, with a love of the land and “a strong desire to see all aspects of agriculture prosper in the future”. Plea of guilty58 Mr Rae has pleaded guilty to the offence, a fact that the court is required to take into account: s 21A(3)(k) and s 22(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, in determining the extent of any discount that should be given for a plea of guilty, the court is required to consider when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty: see s 22(1)(b).59 In this case, the first return of the summons was on 8 August 2008. The prosecutor was directed to file and serve all outstanding affidavits by 19 September 2008 and the matter was listed for plea or mention on 3 October 2008. On 3 October 2008, the Court made orders, by consent of the prosecutor and the defendant, extending the time for the prosecutor to file and serve all further evidence to 17 October 2008 and listing the matter for further mention on 31 October 2008. On 31 October 2008, the defendant’s solicitor indicated that a plea of guilty was anticipated but because of the defendant being in Coonamble, a longer time was needed for consultation. The Court granted the extra time and adjourned the matter to 28 November 2008 before the List Judge. The defendant entered a plea of guilty on 28 November 2008. 60 The prosecutor submits that as a result of the delay in the defendant entering a plea of guilty of some 16 weeks, between the first return of the summons on 8 August 2008 to 28 November 2008, the defendant should not be afforded the full discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. The defendant submits that part of the reason for the delay was that there were discussions between the prosecutor and defendant concerning particulars of the charge, namely the precise area alleged to be cleared.61 The issue of delay in entering a plea of guilty and its effect on the utilitarian value of the plea to the criminal justice system has been canvassed in the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [154]-[160], judgments in the last year or so of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Sullivan v R;  Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296 at [16]-[17] and R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32] and in recent judgments of this Court, by Biscoe J in Gosford City Council v Australian Panel Products Pty Ltd [2009] NSWLEC 77 at [94]-[101] and Lloyd J in Environment Protection Authority v Werris Creek Coal Pty Ltd; Environment Protection Authority v Holley [2009] NSWLEC 124 at [76]-[89].62 These cases emphasise that the timing of the plea is a critical factor; a plea entered at the earliest possible opportunity has more significant utilitarian benefit, and should attract a higher discount, than a plea entered at a later stage. Section 22(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  requires the sentencing court to take into account not only the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty but also “when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty”. Notwithstanding statements by the High Court in cases such as Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; (2002) 209 CLR 339 placing a lesser importance on the timing of the plea, sentencing courts in New South Wales are required to give full force and effect to s 22 in accordance with its terms and to follow R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383: see R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142; (2002) 54 NSWLR 300 at [68]. 63 In this case, the defendant did not enter a plea of guilty for 16 weeks after the first return of the summons and did not indicate an intention to plead guilty for 12 weeks afterwards. The fact that the prosecutor had not filed and served all of the evidence upon which it wished to rely, including on sentence, is not a justification by itself for an offender to delay indicating an intention to enter or entering a plea of guilty. As noted in the cases referred to above, if an offender chooses to wait to see what is all of the evidence the prosecutor is going to rely on before deciding whether to plead guilty or not, the utilitarian value of the plea is reduced. Generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if a plea is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32(8)]. Hence, in this case, the desire of the defendant to negotiate particulars of the charge relating to area cleared, in order to obtain a legitimate forensic advantage, may be understandable but it still delayed the plea for many months and reduced the utilitarian value of the plea to the criminal justice system.64 In these circumstances, the discount to be afforded for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty should not be the maximum of 25%, but rather should be 20%.Contrition and remorse65 Mr Rae gave evidence orally in court. He expressed his regret for his conduct. He admitted that he had done the wrong thing, that it was very foolish. He assured the Court that “certainly won’t do it again”. Mr Rae said that he has “gone through hell over this” and it was affecting him. Mr Rae accepted that he should take action to rectify, to some extent, the harm caused by his clearing of native vegetation on the property. He has accepted the obligation to carry out the remedial work the subject of the direction under s 38 of the Act. The consequence of carrying out this work will be that areas will be rehabilitated and excluded from agricultural production. There will be a material cost to Mr Rae associated with carrying out the remedial work and having land excluded from agricultural production.66 I find that Mr Rae is remorseful for his actions, has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged the environmental harm caused by his actions and will carry out remedial work to make partial reparation for such harm: s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. These factors make it less likely that Mr Rae will re-offend in the future: s 21A(3)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.Assistance to authorities67 After the clearing was reported to the Department of Environment and Climate Change, and officers had investigated the clearing, the Department endeavoured to contact Mr Rae. For a period of time Mr Rae did not respond to their calls. However in June 2008, Mr Rae did voluntarily agree to participate in an interview and made full and frank admissions in the interview. Mr Rae has co-operated since then, including by agreeing to statements of facts and evidence. Payment of prosector’s costs68 Mr Rae has agreed to pay the prosecutor’s costs of the proceedings, as agreed or assessed.Consistency in sentencing69 A relevant consideration in sentencing is the ascertainment of a general pattern of sentencing by criminal courts for offences such as the offence under consideration. The task of a sentencing court is to pursue the ideal of even-handedness in the manner of sentencing: R v Oliver  (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177; R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 107. 70 However, care must be taken in the task of achieving consistency. There is always a difficulty in attempting to compare the penalty in one case with a penalty in another case because of the wide divergence of facts and circumstances: Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 357 at 365. Each case is different but one case does not demonstrate the limits of a sentencing court’s discretion: R v Stahl [1999] NSWCCA 160 at [10]; Cabonne Shire Council v Environment Protection Authority (2001) 115 LGERA 304 at 312; Environment Protection Authority v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246 at [79].71 To assist in ascertaining the pattern of sentencing for an offence and achieving consistency in sentencing, reference may be made to the sentencing statistics in the Judicial Information Research System (JIRS) maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. This system was extended in 2008 to include sentences for environmental offences. The system records sentences imposed by reference to the particular offence, a range of objective circumstances of the offence and subjective circumstances of the offender, and allows direct access to the reasons for judgment.72 Sentencing statistics are a useful tool, but are not an end in themselves. Discriminating care must be exercised when using sentencing statistics. First, sentencing statistics do not determine what is the range or the permissible range of sentences for the case at hand. They only record, as an historical fact, a general pattern of sentencing at that particular point of time: R v Lawson (1997) 142 FLR 323 at 324. 73 Secondly, sentencing statistics do not define or set the upper limit of the range for a crime; the upper limit of the sentence is in fact the maximum set by Parliament. As Grove J noted in R v Hayes [2001] NSWCCA 410 at [15],  
     
      
       
        
        “If the upper limit of the statistical range is treated as reserved for the worst case or the worst offenders then persistent selection of sentences for others within that range will inevitably reduce the upper figure.” 
        
       
       
      This would be contrary to Parliament’s intention as expressed in the maximum penalty.  
      
    74 Thirdly, it is not the Court’s function to sentence at the median range of sentences handed down over a period of time: R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [116]. The median is a useful statistical measure to understand the distribution of sentences, but it is not a sentencing outcome to be pursued. Notwithstanding the advent of computerised sentencing statistics, the sentencing court still needs “to look with discriminating care at the particular circumstances, objective and subjective, particular to each individual case”: R v Shorten, unreported 10 September 1997 NSWCCA, Sully J.75 Fourthly, discrimination is also required when looking at the sentences that shape the statistics and the range. If the early sentences imposed for an offence are wrong (are too low or too high), they may have influenced subsequent sentences. As Hulme J, with whom Bell J and Shaw JJ agreed said in R v Derbas [2003] NSWCCA 44 at [33]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[Statistics] tend to be self perpetuating, in that as soon as the first few cases suggest a particular figure or range, other judges are urged and there is a tendency to follow that figure or range. If that early figure or range is wrong, the fact that is later often followed does not make it right.” 
        
       
      
    76 With these cautionary remarks in mind, I turn to consider the sentencing statistics provided on the JIRS sentencing database for offences of clearing native vegetation contrary to law. 77 For the offence against s 12(1) of the Native Vegetation Act 2003, the offence in the present case, there has been only one case to date, that of Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Hudson [2009] NSWLEC 4; (2009) 165 LGERA 256. The principal defendant was fined $400,000 and ordered to pay the prosecutor’s costs. The objective gravity of the offence was high: the area of land cleared of native vegetation was large, some 486 hectares; the offence was committed deliberately and after the defendant had been told expressly by an officer of the relevant regulatory authority that native trees must be retained on the land; the offence was committed to make the land more available for agriculture and hence for commercial gain; the harm to the environment caused by the offence was substantial; and there was a need for both individual deterrence (to prevent the defendant from re-offending) and general deterrence (to send a message that provisions designed to further environmental interests of the State will be fully enforced). There were no mitigating factors: there was no plea of guilty; no assistance to the investigating or prosecuting regulatory authority; no expression of contrition or remorse; and there was no remediation or offer to remediate the environment harmed by commission of the offence. The defendant was, however, a first offender.78 The objective gravity of the offence in Hudson was greater than that in the present case. The area of native vegetation cleared in Hudson was over double, and hence the objective harmfulness to the environment was likely to be greater. Although both cases involved deliberate wrongful conduct, in Hudson there was also a failure to heed the warning of the regulatory authority. Conversely, the mitigating, subjective circumstances in Hudson were far less than those in the present case. 79 The current Act replaced the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997. Section 17(1) made contravention of s 21(2) of the former Act an equivalent offence to that against s 12(1) of the current Act. The JIRS sentencing database reveals four sentencing decisions for an offence under the former Act. The first two cases in chronological order, namely Director-General of the Department of Land and Water Conservation v Leverton Pastoral Company Pty Ltd [2002] NSWLEC 212 and Director General of National Parks and Wildlife v Wilkinson & Anor; Director General of Department of Land and Water Conservation v Wilkinson [2002] NSWLEC 171, involved offences committed at a time when the maximum penalty was only 10% of the current maximum penalty, namely only $110,000. 80 In Leverton Pastoral Company, Talbot J imposed a “modest” fine of $5,000 and noted that the defendant had agreed to pay the prosecutor’s costs. In addition, the defendant had entered into an agreement to remediate the land affected by the clearing. The objective circumstances of the offence and the mitigating, subjective circumstances of the offender were different in material respects to the present case. Nevertheless, even on its own facts, the fine in Leverton Pastoral Company does seem to be at the extreme lower end of the range of sentences for the offence of clearing native vegetation contrary to law. The sentence is not comparable and provides no guidance for the present case.81 In Wilkinson, the offences were part of a set of eight charges relating to the conduct of the offender in clearing vegetation. Two of the charges were for clearing native vegetation contrary to s 21(2) of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997. The other six charges were for offences against s 118D(1) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 for damaging habitat of threatened species. The maximum penalty at the time for those offences was also $110,000. Lloyd J imposed a total penalty for all eight offences of $43,500. The fines for the two offences against s 21(2) of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 were $11,000 and $1,750. The defendant was ordered to pay the prosecutor’s costs, in the agreed sum of $50,000, and the defendant entered into an agreement with the prosecutor to carry out remediation, conservation and management of vegetation on the property. The objective circumstances of the offence and the mitigating, subjective circumstances of the offender were also materially different to those in the present case. Again, the case, and the sentences imposed in that case, are not comparable. 82 The two more recent cases involving an offence against s 21(2) of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997, namely Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Taylor [2007] NSWLEC 530 and Director-General of the Department of Environment and Climate Change v Wilton [2008] NSWLEC 297, involved offences committed at a time when the maximum penalty had been increased to its current level of $1,100,000.83 In Taylor, Lloyd J fined the defendant $20,000 and ordered the defendant to pay the prosecutor’s costs. The objective circumstances of the crime were of moderate seriousness. The area of land cleared of native vegetation was approximately 30.5 hectares. The actual harm to the environment was held to be significant, including clearing vegetation comprising an endangered ecological community. Although there was some suggestion that the reasons for the defendant clearing the vegetation related to improving the grazing potential of the land, the Court did not make a positive finding as to the defendant’s reasons. The defendant knew in a “roundabout way” that there was legislation regulating land clearing but denied knowledge of precise legislation or the department responsible for administering legislation regulating the clearing of vegetation. There were some mitigating, subjective factors personal to the defendant: no prior convictions; early plea of guilty; and some evidence of contrition and remorse, although the extent was tempered by untruthful and misleading statements made by the defendant in the investigation phase to the prosecutor. There was a need for general deterrence. Lloyd J considered that the appropriate penalty was a fine of $30,000, discounted by 33% for all mitigating factors, including the utilitarian benefit of the guilty plea and the remediation agreement, resulting in a fine of $20,000. 84 The objective gravity of the offence in Taylor is less than that in the present case. The area of land was significantly less, only 14% of the area is involved in the present case, and the objective harmfulness to the environment caused by commission of the offence was also proportionately less. The defendant’s conduct in Taylor was not found to be premeditated, intentional and with knowledge of its illegality, in contrast to the conduct in the present case. The Court did not positively find the defendant in Taylor to have committed the offence to increase profits or the capital value of the land, unlike in the present case. Similarly, no findings were made that the defendant could have reasonably foreseen the risk of harm caused by the commission of the offence, unlike in the present case. 85 The subjective circumstances in Taylor have some similarities to the present case in that the defendant in each case has no prior convictions and entered an early guilty plea. The defendant in each case hampered in some way the investigation of the offences and lessened the assistance to the authorities, in the present case by Mr Rae not returning calls of the investigating authority for many months and in Taylor by the defendant making untrue or misleading statements to the investigating authority. However, it would seem that Mr Rae in the present case may have offered greater assistance once he agreed to and did participate in a record of interview. Both defendants expressed contrition and remorse, although doubt was expressed in Taylor as to the genuineness of such expression, while I accept the genuineness of Mr Rae’s expression of contrition and remorse in the present case.86 In Wilton, Biscoe J fined the defendant $30,000 on one charge and $10,000 on another charge for clearing native vegetation on the eastern and western parts of the defendant’s property respectively and ordered the defendant to pay the prosecutor’s costs of $30,000 in total. The land cleared in the eastern part was between 13.1 and 13.5 hectares and 18.3 hectares in the western part. There was actual environmental harm caused by commission of the offence, but Biscoe J found it to be “relatively moderate”, with no findings made that the clearing had adversely affected any threatened species, populations or ecological communities. The defendant in Wilton cleared the land for the purpose of commercial planting and harvesting of trees for profit. The defendant believed that clearing the vegetation was exempted from needing development consent under the Act, but the Court found that the defendant made a “serious and careless error” in forming that belief. There were many mitigating, subjective factors in Wilton: no prior convictions; prior good character; full assistance to the prosecution; plea of guilty at the earliest available time; expression of remorse, acceptance of responsibility for his actions and acknowledgment of the damage caused; donation of the felled timber to charities; and compliance with a remediation order in respect of the western area cleared. In respect of the charge for clearing the eastern area, Biscoe J added $10,000 to the fine that was considered to be otherwise appropriate with the object of negating the net financial advantage that the defendant would otherwise obtain. The Court held that there was a need for general deterrence but not specific deterrence. 87 Again, the objective gravity of the offence in Wilton is less than in the present case. The areas of land cleared, individually and in aggregate, are significantly less than the area involved in the present case, representing 6% in respect of the eastern area and around 8.5% in respect of the western area. The objective harm to the environment caused by commission of the offence in Wilton is not only proportionately less (by reason of the smaller areas involved) but also the environmental consequences of the clearing were significantly different and less important than in the present case. The conduct was not found in Wilton to be premeditated, intentional and with knowledge of illegality, such as the conduct in the present case but rather was committed in a mistaken belief that the clearing was exempt from the need for development consent. However, the defendant did carry out the clearing for the commercial advantage, as did Mr Rae in the present case. The mitigating, subjective circumstances of the defendants in the two cases are very similar. A difference to note is that the amount of the fine imposed by the Court in Wilton for the charge relating to the clearing of the eastern area was increased by $10,000 to take account of the financial advantage gained, increasing the fine beyond what would otherwise have been the figure.88 Prior to the enactment of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997, clearing of native vegetation was regulated under State Environmental Planning Policies made under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1997. However, the statutory scheme, the maximum penalties and the approach to sentencing of the court were sufficiently different as to make the sentences imposed for offences under that regime offer no guidance to the court when sentencing for offences under the current Native Vegetation Act 2003.89 Finally, although concerning different statutory provisions in another jurisdiction, I also note the penalties imposed for clearing native vegetation in breach of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) in Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No. 3) [2004] FCA 1317; (2004) 136 LGERA 89 and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts v Lamattina [2009] FCA 753. 90 In Greentree, the area cleared was about 100 hectares and had a significant effect on a declared Ramsar wetland. Sackville J imposed a civil pecuniary penalty of $150,000 on the individual and $300,000 on the corporation, and made an order for costs. Sackville J’s decision was affirmed on appeal: Greentree v Minister for Environment and Heritage [2005] FCAFC 128; (2005) 144 FCR 388; 143 LGERA 1. 91 In Lamattina, the area cleared was 73.4 hectares and had a significant effect on the habitat of the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo, a listed threatened species. Mansfield J imposed a civil pecuniary penalty of $220,000 on the corporation and made an order for costs. In Lamattina, the clearing of the native vegetation also constituted an offence against s 26 of the Native Vegetation Act 1991 (SA). Both the corporation and an individual were charged with offences against the South Australian Act for clearing not only the area of 73.4 hectares that was the subject of the federal prosecution but also a further area of 274.8 hectares. The corporate defendant was fined in total $68,000 for the offences and the individual was fined $51,000: see Lamattina & Anor v Gould [2009] SASC 130.Synthesising the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence92 I take into account the objective circumstances of the offence, as mitigated by the subjective circumstances of Mr Rae. I also take into account the existing pattern of sentencing, making allowances for the differences in the particular circumstances, objective and subjective, between those cases and the present case. I take account of the need to impose a sentence that achieves the purpose of denouncing the conduct of Mr Rae, ensuring Mr Rae is adequately punished for the offence, making Mr Rae accountable for his actions, recognising the harm done to the environment by commission of the offence and, in particular, preventing crime by deterring other persons from committing similar offences. 93 Synthesising these factors, I consider that an appropriate penalty for the offence is a fine of $200,000. This figure should be discounted by 20% for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, which results in a fine of $160,000. In addition, Mr Rae should be ordered under s 257B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) to pay the prosecutor’s costs of the proceedings as agreed or assessed under s 257G of that Act.94 Accordingly, the Court orders:1. The defendant is convicted of the offence as charged.2. The defendant is fined the sum of $160,000.3. The defendant is to pay the prosecutor’s costs of the proceedings as may be determined under s 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 PRICE J: Michael Robert Bell and Michael Jelisavac seek leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon them by Knox DCJ (the Judge) in the District Court at Sydney on 11 August 2008. For the sake of convenience, the appeals were heard together. With no disrespect to the applicants, I will refer to them by their surnames.  
     
      
    3 Bell and Jelisavac were co-offenders and pleaded guilty to the same offences on 12 November 2007 which was the first day of their trial. The first count was an offence of robbery when armed with a dangerous weapon that was committed at Pritchard’s Hotel in Mount Pritchard on 20 February 2006 (the Mt Pritchard robbery). This offence contravened s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The second count was an offence of conspiracy to commit a serious indictable offence, namely an aggravated break and enter between 1 March 2006 and 27 March 2006 (the conspiracy). As this was an offence of conspiracy, the maximum penalty for the substantive offence of aggravated break and enter contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act of 20 years imprisonment was the relevant yardstick: The Queen v Hoar (1981) 148 CLR 32 at 39. A standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment has been prescribed for a s 112(2) offence.  
     
      
    4 Each of the applicants asked the Judge to take into account on sentence three offences which had been included on a Form 1. Two of these matters were offences of whilst in company using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s 33B(2) of the Crimes Act that were committed at Mount Pritchard on 20 February 2006. An offence contrary to s 33B(2) is punishable by 15 years imprisonment. The third matter was an offence of aggravated break and enter contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act which was committed at Guildford on 27 March 2006 (the Guildford break and enter). 
     
      
    5 The following sentences were imposed on Bell:  
     
      
       
      Count 1 ( 
      the Mt Pritchard robbery) 
        
       
      (including matters on Form 1) Imprisonment for 6 years 8 months to commence on 10 December 2006 and to expire on 9 August 2013, with a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 10 December 2006 and to expire on 9 December 2011.  
       
       
      Count 2 ( 
      the conspiracy 
      ) Imprisonment for 4 years to commence on 10 December 2009 and to expire on 9 December 2013, with a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 9 December 2012.  
       
      
    6 As a result of partial accumulation the total effective sentence was 7 years to commence on 10 December 2006 and to expire on 9 December 2013 with a non-parole period of 6 years to expire on 9 December 2012.  
     
      
    7 The following sentences were imposed on Jelisavac:  
     
      
       
      Count 1 ( 
      the Mt Pritchard robbery 
      )  
       
      (including matters on Form 1) Imprisonment for 6 years 8 months to commence on 11 August 2008 and to expire on 10 April 2015 with a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 11 August 2008 and to expire on 10 August 2013.  
       
       
      Count 2 ( 
      the conspiracy 
      ) Imprisonment for 4 years to commence on 11 August 2011 and to expire on 10 August 2015 with a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 10 August 2014. 
       
      
    8 As a result of partial accumulation the total effective sentence was 7 years to commence on 11 August 2008 and to expire on 10 August 2015 with a non-parole period of 6 years to expire on 10 August 2014.  
     
      
    9 The Judge had reduced the sentences of each applicant by 10 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    10 Justin Quarta (Quarta) was sentenced by the Judge at the same time as the applicants. As his sentence does not give rise to a parity argument, it is unnecessary to consider the sentence here. Robin Leslie Martin (Martin) was sentenced by Armitage DCJ (the sentencing judge) on 23 February 2007. As issues of parity with Martin’s sentence arise in the appeals, it is convenient to detail the sentence imposed upon him.  
     
      
    11 Martin had pleaded guilty to two counts on an indictment. The first count was the Mt Pritchard robbery. The second count was the Guildford break and enter. This was offence 3 on the Form 1 for Bell and Jelisavac.  
     
      
    12 Martin also asked that the conspiracy be taken into account on a Form 1. This offence was the second count to which Bell and Jelisavac had pleaded guilty. Martin had entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court and the sentencing judge discounted his sentence by 25 per cent for the utilitarian effect of his pleas. A further discount of 25 per cent was allowed for his assistance to authorities. Martin was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 ( 
      the Mt Pritchard robbery 
      ):  
      
      
      (including matter on Form 1) Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 27 March 2006 and to expire on 26 September 2007 with a parole period of 18 months to expire on 27 March 2009.  
       
       
       Count 2 ( 
      the Guildford break and enter):  
        
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
                
                Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 27 September 2006 and to expire on 26 March 2008 with a parole period of 18 months to expire on 26 September 2009.  
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    13 As a result of partial accumulation the total effective sentence imposed on Martin was 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years. FACTS 
     
      
    14 The facts of the offences were not in dispute and a statement of agreed facts was tendered. The Judge summarised the facts of the Mt Pritchard robbery as follows (ROS at 3-4):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The police evidence in relation to each of the offenders on both counts arose from telephone intercepts of mobile phones used by Quarta and Jelisavac, as well as records of conversations which took place at Quarta’s home.  
        
       
       
        
        In mid-February 2006, Bell informed a co-offender, Robin Martin, that about $180,000 would be at the Pritchard’s Hotel following the delivery of money by Armaguard as part of regular ATM deliveries.  
        
       
       
        
        Martin approached Quarta to assist in the armed robbery. Quarta in turn brought in Jelisavac to assist in the robbery.  
        
       
       
        
        Martin, together with the three offenders went to the hotel on 20 February 2006 to reconnoitre and assess the hotel. There, they located the offices and noted the access and egress routes. They then discussed how the offence would be carried out. Bell, by arrangement, obtained a firearm and provided it to Quarta. Martin was to provide, and did provide, a stolen car.  
        
       
       
        
        All four then met at Bell’s residence in Canley Vale where they changed clothes. Bell gave Quarta a sawn off .22 calibre rifle to be used in the robbery. Martin drove them in the stolen car to the hotel and the three offenders got out at the hotel. Quarta put a magazine in the rifle at that time. Martin then drove off to a pre-planned pick-up point.  
        
       
       
        
        It is clear from all those matters that there was considerable planning and premeditation involved in the offences by all offenders.  
        
       
      
     Events inside the hotel  
     
      
       
        
        The three offenders entered the hotel, Bell was carrying a knife with a 30 centimetre blade.  
        
       
       
        
        Quarta yelled at the crowd “get on the ground”. The crowd consisted of six or seven patrons and three staff including a security officer.  
        
       
       
        
        Jelisavac took the hotel manager, Mr Tran, to an office yelling at him “take me to the fucking safe”. Inside the office, Jelisavac pushed Tran inside and yelled at him to open the safe. Quarta then joined them in the office and pointed the gun at Tran’s head also yelling at him to open the safe. One of the offenders threatened to shoot Tran if he didn’t open the safe.  
         
         
        Tran opened one of the two safes in the office. One of the offenders then placed $39,500.00 into a bag. Tran was ordered to open another combination safe but could not remember the precise combination. As he tried to open the safe, one of the offenders kicked Tran in the right side of his ribs.  
         
         
        While this was happening, Bell stood outside the office door and kept guard. He was holding the 30 centimetre long knife.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        All these matters are clearly visible on the video which was tendered and played in these sentencing proceedings.”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    15 The facts of the two offences contrary to s 33B(2) of the Crimes Act (count 1 Form 1) were summarised by the Judge as follows (ROS at 4):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In terms of the factual basis for the form one matters; when the three offenders were leaving the hotel security officer, Mr Brown, threw a glass ash-tray at Jelisavac. Quarta then fired one round of the rifle in Brown’s direction.  
        
       
      
     This forms the first offence on the Form 1 common to all offenders.  
     
      
       
        
        Another patron threw a glass at Quarta and Quarta fired another shot.  
        
       
       
        
        This forms the second offence on the Form 1 common to all offenders.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        All three offenders fled the hotel and were collected by Martin in the car.  
        
       
       
        
        The offenders went back to Bell’s residence where they changed clothes and divided the cash, each receiving about $10,000.00. 
        
       
       
        
        The Police intercepts indicating the preparation and planning for the offence was consistent with the CCTV footage of the events.” 
          
        
       
      
     16 The Judge summarised the facts of the conspiracy (count 2) as follows (ROS 4-5):  
     
      
       
        
        “In March 2006, Bell told Martin that he knew of a person called “Min” who had information about a drug dealer living in Canley Vale. The dealer was thought to keep a large quantity of heroin and about $250,000.00 in cash in his house.  
        
       
       
        
        Martin spoke to Jelisavac and Quarta about a proposed robbery. On a number of occasions Martin, Bell, and Jelisavac went to look at the house.  
        
       
       
        
        On 20 March 2006 Quarta was involved in a motorcycle accident whereby he sustained injuries. It was then determined that he would not take part in the robbery but that he would still get a share of whatever the others got.  
        
       
       
        
        On 24 March 2006 Jelisavac and Martin went to Quarta’s house where their conversation planning the robbery was recorded.  
        
       
       
        
        Subsequent planning was directed to obtaining a vehicle, a glass-cutter, bolt cutters and firearms. The conversations also indicated not only the presence of cash and drugs on the premises but that the occupants would be assaulted in the course of the break and enter.  
        
       
       
        
        Jelisavac and Quarta were recorded having a conversation about the amount of money involved, the possibility that the dealer might have a gun with him, and what they should do in terms of their balaclavas to be worn and the language to be used.  
        
       
       
        
        Jelisavac and Martin met at Quarta’s home on 26 March 2006. Quarta gave them advice on taking a sledgehammer, wearing balaclavas and offering them a machete and meat cleavers.  
        
       
       
        
        Martin and Jelisavac left Quarta’s unit and, driving in Martin’s car, or the car he had taken, went to collect another person said to be a co-offender, David L’Estrange. They then collected Bell at his home in Canley Vale and drove to the premises at Butters Street, Canley Vale.  
        
       
       
        
        Martin telephoned the woman known to Bell to ask someone to go to the premises so that the premises would be opened up. It is a matter of inference that that would be someone going to the drug dealer’s premises.  
        
       
       
        
        After waiting a period of time the offenders decided not to go ahead with this robbery. 
        
       
       
        
        It does not appear from the agreed facts why the offenders did not carry out these plans. Nevertheless, they were in an advanced stage of pursuit of these plans at the time particular enterprise was called off.  
        
       
       
        
        Further, it cannot be said that this was a case of remorse or reconsideration leading to the withdrawal by them from the plans. What the offenders then did was to transfer their attention to the Guildford premises where Mr Bell knew, or thought that there would be, substantial amounts of money in the premises having been collected by his former employer.  
        
       
       
        
        That being the case it does seem to me that the conspiracy matter should be the subject of a significant penalty.” 
          
        
       
      
    17 The facts of the Guildford break and enter (count 1 Form 1) were summarised by the Judge as follows (ROS 6):  
     
      
       
        
        “The offenders, Bell, Martin, Jelisavac and L’Estrange, then decided instead to rob another house at Guildford where they expected there would be substantial cash. Bell knew about those premises and the intended target. They drove to the premises at 229A Fowler Road, Guildford at about 12.30am on Monday 27 March, 2006.  
        
       
       
        
        The occupier of those premises, Perry Koelmeyer, had employed Bell for a six month period as a labourer. Bell knew from that experience that Koelmeyer retained cash which he had collected from his Coca Cola deliveries prior to depositing the money through the bank. 
        
       
       
        
        The premises were occupied by three mates – Koelmeyer, Luke Barker and another.  
        
       
       
        
        Bell remained outside in the car as he did not want Koelmeyer to recognise him. Martin, Jelisavac and L’Estrange wore clothing including bandanas and balaclavas to disguise themselves. Jelisavac was armed with a meat cleaver with a six inch blade. 
        
       
       
        
        Martin kicked in the front door. The three entered. Jelisavac handed L’Estrange the meat cleaver while he and Martin searched the kitchen. When Koelmeyer appeared Jelisavac punched him in the face with a closed fist in the mouth causing bleeding. Martin ran upstairs. He entered Koelmeyer’s bedroom and started searching it. He located a number of mobile phones and other items, including a Samurai sword which he took. 
        
       
       
        
        Jelisavac went upstairs and realised one of the bedroom doors was locked. Martin kicked the door in and saw Luke Barker in bed. Martin then searched the bedroom and located a Samurai sword, a wallet, and other items. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Five of six associates of the occupants came to the premises. The three offenders fled and joined Bell in the car and drove off.” 
          
        
       
      
     Bell’s Subjective Circumstances 
     
      
    18 Bell was born on 31 January 1970. He was 36 years old at the time of the offending and 38 years old when sentenced. Bell did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. The Probation and Parole pre-sentence report disclosed that his parents separated when he was 12 years old and being the second eldest of five children took it upon himself to become the provider for his sisters and mother. Prior to leaving school at the age of 14 years he had been a good student. He reported a history of polydrug abuse commencing at that age.  
     
      
    19 The Judge noted that Bell had been in and out of gaol since he was eighteen and had accurately described himself as a habitual offender. The Judge remarked upon Bell’s difficult upbringing and that he had initially been a good student until his expulsion in Year 9 which had led to his drug and behavioural problems. Bell had been in a relationship for nine years and has two young children. The Judge said (ROS at 9): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Bell has had a relationship out of which he and his partner had a stillborn child, which traumatised him. He and his partner had two other children who are now about the age of five and three. For five years he stayed out of trouble with the law but then ended up resuming his association with people that he had met in gaol, losing his job and reverting to substance abuse and then crime.”  
        
       
      
    20 Bell had been operated on for cancer of the left kidney in April 2008. The left kidney is his solitary functioning kidney as his right kidney is atrophic and non-functioning. Material placed before the Judge as to Bell’s medical condition included reports from Dr Stuart Eshman and Dr David Gracey. Bell’s medical condition is detailed at [57-59] below.  
     
      
    21 Bell has an extensive criminal record which as an adult commenced in 1988. The Judge remarked (ROS at 12-13): 
     
      
       
        
        “These include assaults, at least ten, or thereabouts, break and enter offences, as well as stealing and receiving charges.  
        
       
       
        
        Bell, as I have said, has been extended a variety of sentencing options including counselling, fines, recognisances.  
        
       
       
        
        Bell received a sentence of imprisonment in the District Court in 1997 for breach of recognisance. He has also had opportunities extended to him by his participation in the Parramatta Drug Court. He also has a number of driving offences. It was submitted on his behalf that his record was essentially a “Local Court record”. While it is true that many of his offences were dealt with in the Local Court, he has also had a number of sentences imposed in the District Court and the Drug Court including sentences of imprisonment.  
        
       
       
        
        The record indicates an escalating degree of criminality whereby the offender, Bell, has not recognised any of the opportunities which have been extended to him. I do not regard his record as entitling him to any leniency whatsoever.”  
        
       
      
    22 The Judge referred to Bell’s record within the correctional system and particularly noted that he had failed a urine test which related to him taking anti-depressant drugs. His Honour considered that it indicated a degree of recalcitrance in Bell’s refusing to accept the appropriate authorities and their regime.  
     
      
    23 At the time of the offending Bell was on bail. He had been sentenced in the Fairfield Local Court on 7 November 2005 to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months for driving whilst disqualified. He appealed to the District Court and bail was imposed. The appeal was dismissed and the conviction confirmed by the District Court on 29 March 2006. In sentencing Bell for the present offences, the Judge found the commission of the offences whilst Bell was subject to conditional liberty to be an aggravating factor. Bell’s sentence commenced on 10 December 2006 which was accepted as the date that his custody was solely referrable to the present offences.  
     
      
      Jelisavac’s subjective circumstances  
       
      
    24 Jelisavac was born on 7 July 1979. He was 25 years old at the time of the offending and 28 years old when sentenced. During the proceedings on sentence two Probation and Parole pre-sentence reports were tendered as was a report from Anita Duffy, a psychologist. Jelisavac has a longstanding problem with addiction to prohibited drugs. Mike Ryan, the author of the pre-sentence reports, reported that Jelisavac whilst in custody had attended alcohol and drug counselling regularly and had recently completed a relapse prevention course. He had participated in a number of education courses to improve his reading, writing and computer skills. Mr Ryan recounted that Jelisavac had expressed his remorse and regret for the harm he caused his victims, and would like an opportunity to say sorry to them. Ms Duffy in her report noted that the applicant expressed immense remorse and sorrow at his behaviour and frankly acknowledged he had “stuffed up”.  
     
      
    25 References were tendered from Reverend Liva Tukutama and Herman Kim, a ministry leader of the Presbyterian Church. Reverend Tukutama referred to Jelisavac having come to terms with what he had done and his desire to show his remorse. Mr Kim related a change in the applicant’s demeanour, character and outlook. He stated that he had seen him truly express remorse for the things that he had done and was changing for the ‘good’.  
     
      
    26 Jane Kim, Mr Kim’s sister, told the Judge that she had been in a relationship with Jelisavac for about thirteen and a half years and had discussed with him the possibility of marriage upon his release. She gave evidence that the applicant had shown “deep remorsefulness” for what he had done and had found his Christian faith. She spoke of his wishing to move forward through the initiatives undertaken by him whilst in custody. 
     
      
    27 A letter to the Judge from the applicant was also tendered in which he expressed his regret and remorse for his offending and took full responsibility for his actions. He stated that whilst in custody he was taking advantage of the resources in helping him find out where he had gone wrong and to fix the problem. An Alcohol and Other Drug report confirmed the applicant’s regular attendance at alcohol and drug counselling and that he had “continued to display honesty, insightfulness and empathy to family, friends and victims of his offence”. The applicant had been placed in a position of clerk at the carpenter’s shop which required “a high level of trust and responsibility”. Jelisavac did not give evidence during the sentencing proceedings.  
     
      
    28 The Judge noted that Jelisavac came from a mixed Serbian/Italian family where there was dysfunctionality involving his father’s alcohol abuse and domestic violence. He also had a difficult relationship with a physically violent mother, running away from home at fourteen and ending up living on the streets.  
     
      
    29 His Honour recounted that Jelisavac had been involved in drugs since the age of ten graduating from marijuana to heroin and cocaine. He was using methylamphetamine and cocaine at the time of the offences. The Judge remarked that Jelisavac had a gambling problem and the offences were used to support “his chosen lifestyle”. Jelisavac has hepatitis C.  
     
      
    30 Jelisavac had, the Judge noted, a substantial criminal record as an adult. His Honour said (ROS at 15):  
     
      
       
        
        “When I come to his record in the Local Court he has convictions for goods in custody; assaulting police officers; larceny; resisting police officers; break and enter; possess housebreaking implements in 1999; larceny. The opportunities afforded to him for periodic detention were not observed or taken up by him. There was a cancellation of his periodic detention. He was imprisoned for a period of forty-five weeks.  
        
       
       
        
        That record of non co-operation, or abusing the privileges extended to him and the opportunities he had with periodic detention are relevant and were clearly relevant to the parole authority… 
        
       
       
        
        His record also included offences of resisting an officer in the execution of his duty; obtaining money by deception; various offences of dishonesty; break and enter in the District Court in 2002; an aggravated break and enter with committing a felony for which was subject to terms of imprisonment.”  
        
       
      
    31 The applicant had appeared for sentence in the District Court on 24 May 2002 on two counts of obtaining money by deception, two counts of breaking, entering and stealing in circumstances of aggravation, one count of breaking and entering with intent to commit a crime in circumstances of aggravation and four counts of breaking, entering and stealing. Sixteen other offences were taken into account on a Form 1, five of which were breaking, entering and stealing and two were obtaining a benefit by deceit. The other offences were escaping lawful custody, possessing housebreaking implements, resisting arrest, having goods in custody suspected of having been stolen or dishonestly obtained, stealing a motor vehicle and being carried in a stolen motor vehicle. An overall effective sentence of imprisonment of 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was imposed in the District Court. Jelisavac appealed to this Court against the severity of the sentences imposed. In R v Jelisavac [2003] NSWCCA 107, Adams J with whom Smart AJ agreed, granted leave to appeal, quashed the sentences and re-sentenced the applicant. The effective head sentence remained the same but the non-parole period was reduced by 1 year. Jelisavac was eligible for release to parole on 1 February 2005.  
     
      
    32 Jelisavac was released to parole on 1 February 2005 and the present offences were committed before the parole period had expired. The commission of the offences whilst subject to parole the Judge found to be a factor of aggravation.  
     
      
     
     
      
      Bell’s Appeal  
       
       
       
      Ground 1:  
      The learned Sentencing Judge erred in relation to the degree of partial accumulation.  
       
      
    33 Ms Nash, counsel for Bell, submitted that the Judge erred by imposing a period of partial accumulation of 12 months in respect of the individual sentences. Ms Nash contended that consistent with the findings of Armitage DCJ in sentencing Martin the period of accumulation should have been 6 months. It was argued that the second count to which Martin had pleaded was the more serious count of the Guildford break and enter whereas the conspiracy was the second count to which the applicant had pleaded, the Guildford break and enter being one of the matters on the Form 1. Ms Nash referred to what was said by Armitage DCJ (Martin ROS at 21) as to the conspiracy that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Form 1 matter, while serious, did not result in an offence actually going through to completion. It was serious and organised criminal conduct, but not as serious by any means as the robbery offence.” 
        
       
      
    34 The bulk of the criminality, Ms Nash submitted, was adequately reflected in the first individual sentence and the period of accumulation of 12 months exceeded that which was warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. Ms Nash noted that in counts 1 and 2 his Honour provided a non-parole period for each individual sentence at 75 per cent of the total term but because of the partial accumulation of sentence the proportion of the effective non-parole period (6 years) to the effective overall term of the sentence (7 years) was 85.7 per cent which supported the contention that the Judge erred.  
     
      
    35 Martin was sentenced before Bell, Jelisavac and Quarta and submissions were made to the Judge during the proceedings on sentence by Ms Nash (who was Bell’s counsel at first instance) and counsel for the co-offenders on parity of sentence. In particular it was put to the Judge by Ms Nash that Martin had been charged with what was said to have been the more serious offence of the Guildford break and enter and the extent of accumulation of sentence for count 2 should be 6 months.  
     
      
    36 The agreement to rob the house at Canley Vale which had reached an advanced stage was undoubtedly a serious offence. When analysing the conspiracy, his Honour took into account:  
     
      
       
        
        1. That all offenders were contemplating a robbery of drug premises in which there was heroin and substantial amounts of cash; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The steps taken by the offenders to make arrangements to be armed with various items including a sledgehammer and meat cleaver and to take clothing such as balaclavas which could be used to conceal their identities and to terrify and intimidate the occupants; and 
        
       
       
        
        3. What the offenders did to carry out the conspiracy stopping as they did, almost on the front door of the premises. His Honour observed that all of the offenders went to the premises in the car and remained outside. Martin telephoned “Min” who was known to Bell to attempt to have the premises opened up so they could carry out their plans.  
        
       
      
    37 The Judge carefully considered the submissions that had been made to him by counsel. The Judge said (ROS at 20):  
     
      
       
        
        “Counsel for all three offenders submitted on at least ten occasions that there would be a justifiable sense of grievance if the offenders and each of them were not sentenced or subject to the same head sentence as the co-offender Martin. It was further submitted that Martin had in fact been charged with a more serious offence namely aggravated break and enter in relation to the Guildford property rather than a conspiracy to commit an aggravated break and enter. I have already indicated that the conspiracy which was almost carried out but stopped short when the offenders were indeed outside the relevant premises.”  
        
       
       
      
    38 The Judge’s evaluation of the seriousness of the conspiracy was one of fact and is reviewable by this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. His Honour was not bound by the assessment of Armitage DCJ of the comparative seriousness of the conspiracy and the Guildford break and enter. I am not persuaded that his Honour’s assessment of the seriousness of these offences was not open to him on the evidence. 39 His Honour recited the submissions concerning the roles of the co-offenders in the Mt Pritchard robbery and noted there was a difference in Martin’s role by virtue of the fact that he had remained outside in the stolen vehicle. His Honour found that there was a “marginal difference” in Martin’s role as Martin had been “clearly aware that there was a weapon to be taken into the premises”. The principal difference the Judge found between Martin and his co-offenders (Bell, Jelisavac and Quarta) was that Martin had good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    40 The Judge said (ROS at 21): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        This is in marked contradistinction to my own view of these three offenders and each of them and the evidence which is that there is nothing on which I can find for each of them that there are any real prospects of rehabilitation.”  
        
       
       
      Armitage DCJ had found that Martin had expressed sincere remorse, was a person who impressed him “as a person sincerely bent on reforming himself” and had “a strong likelihood of not re-offending and of rehabilitating himself”. 
       
      
    41 His Honour went on to consider “the extent of any questions of accumulation or concurrence as well as totality, and particularly having regard to the consideration of that matter by Judge Armitage in his sentence of the co-offender Martin”. (ROS at 31) 
     
      
    42 The Judge said (ROS at 31): 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a difference as I have said in Martin’s role, although of a relatively minor nature, but in particular in relation to the finding of rehabilitation and to some extent there needs to be a consideration of those matter against the principles of totality.  
        
       
       
        
        Here the two counts represent two kinds of offences committed on separate occasions with different victims and premises and separated in times. There are different kinds of criminality involved in each of the offences.  
        
       
       
        
        Normal principles are that the discrete features of the individual offences or criminality of different orders requires at least partial accumulation of the sentences and that is referred to in the decisions of  
        Harrigan v R 
         [2005] NSWCCA 449;  
        R v VAA 
         [2006] NSWCCA 44;  
        Cahyadi v R 
         (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27].  
        
       
       
        
        The specific issue is there, whether the period of six months partial accumulation meets that consideration.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In my view it does not. I need to consider this matter afresh in relation to these particular offenders but also have regard to the appropriate period of accumulation bearing in mind my assessments of these particular offences and the earlier matters concerning parity which I have set out earlier and which I will not repeat.  
        
       
       
        
        The Crown submits that there appears to have been some confusion at the sentencing proceedings before Judge Armitage, at least as far as the then Crown was concerned, as to whether the six month partial accumulation period was the relevant period.  
        
       
       
        
        It is not for me to say whether there was or was not that confusion. I need to focus on what is an appropriate period of partial accumulation, and here, having regard to the different kinds of offences, the different victims, the different premises, and the nature of the criminality involved, there should be a greater degree of partial accumulation than the six months referred to earlier and in my view the period of accumulation should be twelve months.”  
        
       
      
    43 The applicant complained that his Honour’s reference to “different victims” in the passage at [42] above indicated error as there were no victims in the conspiracy. It seems to me that when the Judge made this remark he was doing no more than acknowledging the actual victims of the criminality in count 1 and the three Form 1 matters and the intended victims of the conspiracy. The Judge was plainly aware that the agreed crime had not been carried out.  
     
      
    44 It is evident from all of the Judge’s sentencing remarks that he approached his sentencing task by fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence and then considered questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. His Honour was aware of the recent statements of the law as to accumulation or concurrence and cited relevant decisions of this Court including Cahyadi v R. His Honour was mindful of the principle of parity and expressly referred to Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295.  
     
      
    45 The parity principle is “an aspect of equal justice”: Postiglione v The Queen at 301. As was pointed out by Dawson and Gaudron JJ “like should be treated alike, but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them”.  
     
      
    46 Although it is recognised that the parity principle is of wide application and is not to be applied in a technical or pedantic way: R v Kerr [2003] NSWCCA 234, the different charging of offenders may present difficulties for complaints of marked disparity which are said to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance: see R v Formosa [2005] NSWCCA 363. The considerations which apply to sentencing an offender where an offence is included on a Form 1 are not the same as when that offence is charged discretely. The focus of the sentencing court is the primary offence and the Form 1 matter is taken into account by greater weight being given to personal deterrence and to retribution. The extent to which greater weight may be given to these considerations is limited by the maximum penalty for the primary offence and the principle of totality: Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 per Spigelman CJ at [39]-[42].  
     
      
    47 The conspiracy (count 2) was a primary offence when the Judge came to sentence Bell. At Bell’s request, three matters were placed on a Form 1 including the Guildford break and enter when the sentence for the Mt Pritchard robbery (count 1) was considered. The other two matters on the Form 1 (s 33B(2) of the Crimes Act) each of which concerned the firing of a rifle shot by Quarta were serious matters in their own right. Martin was not charged with the s 33B(2) of the Crimes Act offences nor were they included on a Form 1. The conspiracy was not charged as a primary offence but was included on a Form 1 to be taken into account when Martin was sentenced for the Mt Pritchard robbery (count 1). No other Form 1 matters were taken into account. The Guildford break and enter (count 2) was charged as a primary offence.  
     
      
    48 Dissimilarity in the charging of Bell and Martin necessarily gave rise to different considerations which included the extent of accumulation of the primary offences and the totality principle. The applicant’s argument that the extent of the partial accumulation should be determined by Martin’s sentence is in my opinion not to be accepted. All things were not equal between the applicant and Martin. In any event they had different prospects of rehabilitation and the Judge had found that Bell’s criminal offending indicated “a continuing attitude of disobedience” and greater weight was to be given to retribution, deterrence and protection of society (ROS at 15-16). Martin was to serve his sentence in protective custody and special circumstances were found justifying an adjustment in the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and balance of term. No finding of special circumstances was made in the applicant’s case nor was he required to serve his sentence in protection.  
     
      
    49 The Judge was not obliged to partially accumulate the sentence for count 2 by six months. The extent of accumulation was a discretionary matter for the Judge which his Honour applied according to well established principle: R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. He was entitled to consider when applying the principle of totality that the separate criminality in the offending required a partial accumulation of sentence of 12 months.  
     
      
    50 As a consequence of partial accumulation of the individual sentences, the overall non-parole period was 85.7 per cent of the overall sentence or in the language of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the balance of the term of the overall sentence was one sixth of the overall non-parole period. It is apparent from the Judge’s comprehensive consideration of his sentencing task that he deliberately did not preserve the statutory ratio of 75 per cent to ensure for a period of partial accumulation of 12 months.  
     
      
    51 When special circumstances are not found, there is no obligation upon a sentencing judge to fix a balance of term of the sentence which is not less than one third of the non-parole period: R v Gill [2002] NSWCCA 93; Trindall v The Queen (2006) 171 A Crim R 87; R v So [2004] NSWCCA 362. This was not a case, in my opinion, where the Judge overlooked the “statutory” proportion between the balance of term and the non-parole period.  
     
      
    52 During oral argument Ms Nash raised the issue of parity with the sentence imposed on David L’Estrange (L’Estrange). L’Estrange had pleaded not guilty to the conspiracy and the Guildford break and enter and was found guilty of each count by the jury. Woods DCJ sentenced L’Estrange on 27 March 2009 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 ( 
        the conspiracy 
        ) Imprisonment for a fixed term to commence on 27 May 2007 and expire on 26 May 2009. 
        
       
      
     Count 2 (the Guildford  break and enter) Imprisonment with a non-parole  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
                
                 
                  
                  period of 4 years to commence on 27 November 2007 and expire on 26 November 2011 with a balance of term of 2 years to expire on 26 November 2013.  
                  
                 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    53 The overall effective sentence imposed on L’Estrange was 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months.  
     
      
    54 The degree of partial accumulation of the individual sentences was 6 months. L’Estrange, however, was not charged with the Mt Pritchard robbery nor with the offences contrary to s 33B(2) which were included on the Form 1. The extent of Bell’s criminality was more than that of L’Estrange. Moreover, L’Estrange’s role in the offending for which he was charged was described by Woods DCJ as “that of a willing and violent follower of those who had organised both these enterprises”, whereas Bell was characterised as an initiator: see [68] below. As in the case of Martin all things were not equal and the difference in the sentences imposed upon Bell and L’Estrange does not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    55 I am not persuaded that the Judge erred in partially accumulating the sentence for the conspiracy by 12 months on the sentence for the Mt Pritchard robbery. This ground has not been established. 
     
      
    Ground 2:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) The learned Sentencing Judge erred in failing to find special circumstances on the basis of the applicant’s medical condition;  
        
       
       
        
        (b) The learned Sentencing Judge erred in failing to find that the applicant’s medical condition was a mitigating factor.  
        
       
       
      
    56 Ms Nash submitted that the Judge erred in failing to find Bell’s medical condition to be either special circumstances or a mitigating factor. It was contended that Bell’s medical condition was sufficiently special to justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence, particularly when there was evidence of imprisonment adding a degree of complexity to Bell’s health. Ms Nash argued that Bell’s medical condition rendered the period of imprisonment more burdensome for him than for the average prisoner.  Bell’s medical condition  
     
      
    57 There was undisputed medical evidence before the Judge that Bell in April 2008 whilst in custody prior to being sentenced had undergone surgery at the Prince of Wales Hospital for the removal of a cancerous lesion in the left kidney. Dr Ehsman, the urological surgeon, felt confident that the operation had totally excised the cancer and there was no evidence that the cancer had spread. Dr Ehsman opined that Bell had a 1-2 per cent chance of developing another cancer of the kidney in his life time. Bell’s right kidney was, however, atrophic and non-functional. Post-operative testing of Bell’s left kidney demonstrated moderate renal failure with approximately 40 per cent of renal function remaining. Dr Gracey, the consultant nephrologist, opined: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Because of his solitary functioning left kidney, Mr Bell is at high risk of acute renal failure from any catastrophic injury or other significant pathology to the left side (such as a stab wound). Loss of function of the left kidney would mean dialysis dependence in a short space of time.”  
        
       
      
    58 Bell’s other medical history includes hepatitis C the treatment for which is more complicated in the presence of renal failure. Bell’s multiple medical co-morbidities required ongoing monitoring and intervention through specialised clinics. Dr Gracey stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Mr Bell’s status as an inmate adds a degree of complexity to the process of follow up and coordination of his care.  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bell’s renal failure and solitary kidney place him at risk of significant future morbidity. This requires careful monitoring with intervention to attempt to slow the progression of his renal failure, as well as treat any complications. Generally, such care is undertaken in a specialised nephrology clinic (such as at Prince of Wales). It is possible that, despite any intervention, Mr Bell may progress to develop dialysis-dependent End-State Renal Failure. We would need to prepare for dialysis in a timely fashion, if this were the case. Monitoring, follow up, arranging appointments and arranging investigations are all made more difficult given his status as an inmate of Long Bay Jail. We have several patients on dialysis from Long Bay Jail at our centre.  
        
       
       
        
        Cigarette smoking is associated with more rapid progression of renal failure and would place Mr Bell at higher long-term risk of progressive disease.  
        
       
       
        
        Another consideration is the importance of avoiding trauma to the left kidney. Any catastrophic injury to that side would almost certainly mean he would require dialysis.” 
        
       
      
    59 An affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor was tendered in this Court. Bell has informed his solicitor that he continues to be monitored by the Kidney Care Centre and Urology Clinic and because of his requirement for ongoing treatment and monitoring had been told that he is to remain in the hospital area of Long Bay Correctional Centre. Bell had also been informed by medical staff that there is a high risk of renal failure and because of this he has to be extremely careful when interacting with other inmates. His prison classification was C1 but because of the need for ongoing monitoring had to stay in the hospital area of Long Bay Correctional Centre which was an “A” or maximum security classification gaol.  
     
      
    60 In oral submissions, Ms Nash said that whilst there was no new development in the applicant’s medical condition, the material in the affidavit re-emphasised the dangers to his health. Ms Nash submitted that there is always a danger in a maximum security prison of being stabbed by other inmates. Furthermore, Bell’s medical condition forced him to remain at Long Bay Correctional Centre which meant family visits are curtailed because of the maximum security classification.  
     
      
    61 The medical evidence established that Bell had a cancerous lesion in the left kidney surgically removed. Whilst there is a small chance that the cancer will re-emerge, he remains at risk of re-occurrence. Only 40 per cent of renal function of the left kidney remains. The left kidney is his sole functioning kidney. Bell is at high risk of acute renal failure from any significant injury to the left side (such as a stab wound). Loss of function of the left kidney would mean dependence on dialysis. Bell has a history of several traumatic injuries (stab wounds). The treatment of Bell’s hepatitis C is made more difficult in the presence of renal failure.  
     
      
    62 There was no evidence before the Judge that Corrections Health could not adequately care for Bell’s medical condition other than in the case of acute renal failure.  
     
      
    63 Submissions had been made to the Judge that Bell’s sentence should be mitigated because of the applicant’s ongoing medical condition as imprisonment would be a greater burden upon him. The Judge was also urged to find special circumstances for the same reason.  
     
      
    64 The Judge recognised that the applicant’s medical condition was a factor which impacted upon his sentencing task. During his sentencing remarks the Judge referred to the medical evidence and to the applicant’s submissions. His Honour said (ROS at 17): 
     
      
       
        
        “Ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that the imprisonment will be a greater burden to the offender by reason of his state of health or where there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender’s health, the principle is set out in  
        R v Smith 
         (1987) 27 A Crim R 315.  
        
       
       
        
        Here there is evidence that the offender, Bell, has the problems and issues I have outlined above. It is the responsibility of the prison authorities to ensure that the prisoner is not subject to undue hardship as established by  
        R v Zappalla 
         NSWCCA (1993).  
        
       
       
        
        After some consideration of the medical reports and the actuality of what Bell is suffering from, and the extent of the treatment being afforded to him, I do not regard that as a mitigating factor for Bell let alone for the other offenders.” 
        
       
      
    65 In those sentencing remarks, his Honour cited R v Smith in which King CJ authoritatively considered the relevant principles whereby the health of an offender is properly taken into account on sentence. King CJ said at 317:  
     
      
       
        
        “The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. Ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. It is the responsibility of the Correctional Services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners. Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender’s health.”

        R v Badanjak 
         [2004] NSWCCA 395.  
        
       
      
    66 In R v Badanjak Wood CJ at CL (with whom McClellan AJA and Smart AJ agreed) considered at [11] that it is only in a relatively rare case that the Smith principle is applicable.  
     
      
    67 It appears from his Honour’s remarks quoted at [64] above that he considered that the applicant’s state of health neither provided a greater burden for the applicant whilst in custody nor were the prison authorities unable to adequately manage it.  
     
      
    68 During his consideration of the roles of Bell, Jelisavac, Quarta and Martin in the offences, the Judge observed that Bell’s involvement appeared to have been the “critical instigating factor” resulting directly from the information he had received about the delivery of the money to the hotel in the Mt Pritchard robbery, the amount of the money he knew the heroin dealer would have at Canley Vale in the conspiracy and his former employer would have had at Guildford (the Guildford break and enter). His Honour found that Bell was the person who had the “main initiating role” in the selection of the other offenders and to an extent in the planning. The Judge said (ROS at 19):  
     
      
       
        
        “I have given considerable thought to Mr Bell’s role as on one view as I say, he might be regarded as being the initiator and recruiter of the others. He was an older person with obviously some sources of criminal intelligence on the premises he seems to have been instrumental in selecting. 
        
       
       
        
        … I was at one stage minded to consider that he deserved a higher sentence given that role, but I consider that, balancing all the matters out, that I would not approach the matter by way of a different sentence given the medical condition that he has and the possibility of a difficult time in prison. To some extent that is an artificial running together of the two matters but I think that the overall result needs to be the same given my findings in that regard.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Subject to the balancing factors, as I say I have thought about at some length in relation to Bell, I find in relation to both matters that the offenders had an equal though different role in the respective joint criminal enterprise.” 
         (italics added).  
        
       
      
    69 These remarks reveal that notwithstanding what was said by the Judge in the passage quoted at [64] above, the Judge has mitigated the sentence that could otherwise have been imposed on Bell because of his ill health and the hardship he may experience in prison. If Bell had been sentenced as being at a higher role in the joint criminal enterprise, I have no doubt that his sentence would have been significantly longer than that imposed.  
     
      
    70 When considering special circumstances, the Judge said (ROS at 29): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Firstly, that his medical condition warranted a finding of special circumstances given that he has to have repeated medical examinations and treatment relating to his medical condition and the risks of further kidney complications.  
        
       
       
        
        This is a matter to which I have given some considerable thought. It is clear that there may be dangers to Mr Bell from his position as an inmate, particularly if he was involved in any further acts of violence which might be inferred he was involved in earlier in his period of incarceration on other matters. However, the circumstances of his incarceration and continuing care are very much matters for the Corrective Services department. He has a position in the prison library and, if his counsel’s submissions from the bar table are accepted as the inaccuracy of his correctional record, subject to the matters raised this morning, and the offences while in gaol in earlier years are irrelevant, given that they occurred prior to this sentence, then there appears to be no recent recurrence of the earlier acts of violence which marked his earlier incarceration.  
        
       
       
        
        I see nothing in his record or the material tendered on his behalf which would warrant a finding of special circumstances sufficient to justify a reduction in the normal statutory ratio by which the non-parole period should bear to the head sentence.”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
    71 From those remarks, it appears that the Judge determined that whilst there may be dangers to Bell from his position as an inmate, the evidence did not demonstrate that there was a serious risk of further violence to Bell. Although the realities of prison life are not to be ignored when considering the exercise of the sentencing discretion: R v Miranda (2002) 128 A Crim R 362 at 367, it seems to me to establish a serious risk of further violence there must be more than mere reliance on the assertion of the danger of being stabbed by other inmates whilst in a maximum security prison. Bell did not give evidence. The Judge considered the evidence of the prior stabbings (such as it was) and Bell’s custodial conditions. His Honour was entitled to reach the conclusion that he did upon a consideration of the material before him. The affidavit of the applicant’s solicitor discloses that Bell is required to stay in the hospital area of the Long Bay Correctional Centre. There is nothing which suggests that Bell is at a serious risk of being stabbed or otherwise assaulted because of the conditions of his present incarceration.  
     
      
    72 In my opinion, by failing to find special circumstances, the Judge did not err in the exercise of his discretion.  
     
      
    73 His Honour in any event had expressly taken into account Bell’s ill health and the possibility of a difficult time in prison in fixing the head sentence. In R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172, Spigelman CJ observed at [18]:  
     
      
       
        
        “’Double counting’ for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence, and therefore already reflected in the non-parole period must be avoided… Almost all matter capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing Judges should ensure that double counting does not occur.”  
        
       
       
      A finding of special circumstances founded on Bell’s medical condition would in my opinion have involved erroneous double counting.  
       
      
    74 The Judge did not fail to find that the applicant’s medical condition was a mitigating factor. The Judge did not err in failing to find special circumstances on the basis of the applicant’s medical condition. 
     
      
    75 Ground 2 has not been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3:  
      The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    76 Before considering this ground it is necessary to relate that Ms Nash was permitted in oral submissions to informally raise as a ground of appeal a complaint that the Judge erred by confining the extent of the utilitarian discount for the pleas of guilty to 10 per cent. Ms Nash argued that the discount could have been as much as 15 per cent. 
     
      
    77 Bell pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial. The Judge observed that all of the offenders (Bell, Jelisavac and Quarta) had maintained their pleas of not guilty at committal and the Crown was ready to proceed with their trial. His Honour was informed by the Crown Prosecutor that all the victims had been contacted and were available to give evidence. In my opinion, his Honour’s assessment that the utilitarian value of the pleas was limited and the discount should be 10 per cent for each offender was appropriate. The utilitarian value of the pleas had been significantly diminished and the Judge did not err in the application of the discount. 
     
      
    78 The complaint in ground 3 that Bell’s sentence was manifestly excessive, in my view, has no merit. All of the offences which were taken into account by the Judge in sentencing Bell were offences of the utmost gravity which were committed whilst Bell was subject to conditional liberty. Anything less than a non-parole period of 6 years would not have appropriately reflected the objective gravity of Bell’s criminality and no other sentence was warranted: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    79 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    80 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      2. Appeal dismissed. 
      
    Jelisavac’s Appeal  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: 
        
      The Sentencing Judge erred in his consideration of the evidence relating to the applicant’s contrition and remorse, and steps taken by him whilst in custody, when determining that the applicant has no real prospects of rehabilitation.  
       
      
    81 Mr Watts, counsel for Jelisavac, submitted that the Judge paid no real regard to the considerable amount of evidence suggesting that the applicant was genuine in his remorse and had changed significantly in the period of his incarceration from the date of his arrest on 27 March 2006 to the commencement of the proceedings on sentence on 7 August 2008. Mr Watts contended that those changes were such that to find no realistic prospect of rehabilitation was to fall into error. The material placed before the Judge by the applicant which was of relevance to his Honour’s consideration of rehabilitation has been summarised at [24-27] above.  
     
      
    82 During his sentencing remarks, the Judge referred to the evidence relevant to remorse and rehabilitation on a number of occasions. When considering the testimony of Jane Kim, his Honour remarked (ROS at 8):  
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that Miss Kim had had little impact on Mr Jelisavac and those aspects of his associated criminal behaviour including larceny and various crimes of dishonesty and violence, his prior imprisonment as well as his associates and drug usage. Given that history, I do not regard her as being someone who could with confidence assist in his rehabilitation to any significant extent.”  
        
       
      
    83 His Honour referred to Ms Duffy’s report and to the report of the drug and alcohol counsellor. The Judge observed (ROS at 11): 
     
      
       
        
        “Jelisavac participated in counselling, alcohol and drug counselling and found permanent employment on his release. Previously he had limited employment or employability and supported himself through dishonesty. None of those actions taken under the auspices of the various authorities apparently assisted him in any effective rehabilitation on any level. He reverted to his old associates to drug usage. He also has hepatitis C. 
        
       
       
        
        These matters are confirmed in the report of Dr Anne Duffy who also referred to his dependency characteristics and the need for long term, lengthy and close supervision.  
        
       
       
        
        The Alcohol and Drug counsellor’s report refers to his supportive family and the extent of his counselling and other programmes while he has been incarcerated on this occasion and before.” 
        
       
      
    84 When referring to all the co-offenders (Bell, Jelisavac and Quarta), his Honour said (ROS at 11):  
     
      
       
        
        “All have been offered substantial opportunities and alternative sentencing options in the past. All have participated in counselling programmes while in prison of varying lengths. All have reverted to contact with their former associates.  
        
       
      
    85 The Judge went on to consider the references which had been tendered for Jelisavac, Bell and Quarta and said (ROS 11-12):  
     
      
       
        
        “…there is nothing in that or the other material tendered which can overcome the combined effect of the offenders’ respective track records exemplified by their prior police and custodial records and their reversion to prior associates, frequently drug usage and associated lifestyle and then the crimes which have been brought about the charges.  
        
       
       
        
        Despite the pleas made on their behalf by their counsel and particularly by those who are either dependent on them or associated with them, I cannot find that there are any realistic prospects for rehabilitation for them or any of them.” 
        
       
      
    86 When considering the letters written to him by each of the co-offenders (Bell, Jelisavac and Quarta) the Judge remarked (ROS 25-26):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Absent the offenders’ preparedness to be cross-examined, I put very little weight on their respective letters expressing their remorse and contrition, particularly in circumstances where their pleas of guilty were entered on the first day of their trial in the face of a very strong Crown case.  
        
       
       
        
        I do accept them as being genuine in their letters but I have real concerns to the point of view of despair that they will be able to carry out their expressed intention on the evidence before me.” 
        
       
      
    87 Earlier in his sentencing remarks, the Judge referred to R v Jelisavac (ROS at 15):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        He again has had a number of opportunities extended to him which has not … been recognised by him. When he had had the benefit of lesser matters being imposed on him as a result of appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal they do not seem to have had the slightest impact on him.  
        
       
       
        
        In that regard, what was tendered was a decision of New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal  
        R v Jelisavac 
        …, whereby he was successful in obtaining a lesser fixed term of imprisonment. By virtue of the findings that the sentencing judge in that instance did not give sufficient discount to the contrition and remorse expressed by the offender, and that is evident in para 10 of the remarks of Adams J.  
        
       
       
        
        It is against that background and the background of what has happened since that time that the offender asks me to take into account the remorse and contrition which he expresses. Included in that obviously is his background set out in his record.” 
        
       
      
    88 In Jelisavac (see [31] above), there was evidence before the sentencing Judge that since the applicant’s incarceration Jelisavac had stopped taking drugs without medical assistance, had undertaken counselling and “engaged enthusiastically” in a number of rehabilitation courses. A pre-sentence report was tendered which indicated that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were good. Adams J considered at [10] that the sentencing judge erred “in his consideration of the impact of the obvious contrition and remorse demonstrated by the applicant.” As a result, the non-parole period of Jelisavac’s sentence was reduced by 1 year. The present offences were committed whilst Jelisavac was on parole.  
     
      
    89 In the present case, the Judge comprehensively considered the evidence of remorse and rehabilitation. He was entitled to consider that evidence with a deal of circumspection. Repeat offenders of serious crime cannot expect that sentencing judges will accept without reservation expressions of regret for offending and steps taken in custody towards rehabilitation whilst awaiting sentence. This will particularly be the case where leniency has been extended by courts on prior occasions on the promise of rehabilitation and crimes of considerable gravity continue to be committed. Notwithstanding the importance of the promotion of the rehabilitation of an offender in the exercise of sentencing discretion, a sentencing judge will be entitled to conclude that any prospects of rehabilitation are unrealistic.  
     
      
    90 His Honour carefully evaluated the applicant’s subjective case and history of re-offending. It was open, in my opinion, for the Judge, who had heard the evidence first hand, to conclude that Jelisavac has no real prospects of rehabilitation and no error has been demonstrated.  
     
      
    91 Ground 1 has not been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: 
        
      The sentencing Judge erred in not finding special circumstances, and in imposing a total sentence in which the parole period was inappropriate in all of the circumstances.  
       
      
    92 Mr Watts referred to the Probation and Parole report dated 29 July 2008 in which Mr Ryan opined that Jelisavac “will need to seek assistance when released to put relapse prevention strategies into place” and to the opinion of the psychologist, Ms Duffy, that the applicant following release would need “very lengthy close supervision from the Probation and Parole Service.” Mr Watts submitted that all of the material before the Judge required a parole period of more than 12 months and if the statutory ratio in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act had been adopted by the Judge then the parole period would have been 18 months. It was contended that in all the circumstances special circumstances should have been found and the period on parole should have been longer than 18 months. If the statutory ratio had been set then the balance of term would have been 21 months. 
     
      
    93 The Judge concluded that there was nothing in Jelisavac’s record and the material tendered which warranted a finding of special circumstances. His Honour remarked (ROS at 30): 
     
      
       
        
        “I see nothing in his record which would justify any confidence in any finding that he would cooperate with the parole authorities.” 
        
       
      
    94 The Judge had concluded that Jelisavac had no reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. Jelisavac’s history of non-compliance with the Probation and Parole Service was disclosed in the pre-sentence reports and by his criminal record. It was open to the Judge to have little confidence in the applicant’s future co-operation with the parole authorities upon his release to parole. In failing to find special circumstances, the Judge did not err in the exercise of his discretion.  
     
      
    95 The impact of the partial accumulation of the individual sentences was that the proportion of the effective non-parole period (6 years) to the effective overall term of the sentence (7 years) was 85.7 per cent which was the same as the overall sentence imposed upon Bell. As has been discussed in Bell’s appeal at [50-51] the statutory ratio was deliberately not preserved by the Judge to ensure for a period of partial accumulation of 12 months and no error has been demonstrated.  
     
      
    96 Ground 2 has not been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
      :  
      The sentence imposed is excessive by virtue of the principle of parity.  
       
      
    97 This ground of appeal raises the issue of parity relative to the sentence imposed upon Martin. Mr Watts referred to the undiscounted starting points of Martin’s sentence for the Mt Pritchard robbery and the Guildford break and enter which Armitage DCJ considered to be 6 years whereas the undiscounted starting points of Jelisavac’s sentence for the Mt Pritchard robbery was 7 years 5 months (round figures) and the conspiracy was 4 years 5 months (round figures). Mr Watts pointed out that Martin had been on parole at the time he had committed the offences but had his sentences backdated to the day of his arrest (26 March 2006) whereas Jelisavac’s sentence was backdated to 11 August 2008. It appears that Martin had been released to parole on 30 November 2005 and as at the date of his arrest had until 30 July 2007 for that parole period to conclude.  
     
      
    98 During the sentence proceedings Mr Watts (who was Jelisavac’s counsel at first instance) made submissions to the Judge on parity of sentence which his Honour did not accept for the same reasons that the submissions on parity made for Bell were rejected.  
     
      
    99 Jelisavac was charged in the same way as Bell giving rise to the same considerations of dissimilarity in the charging of Martin which have been discussed at [45-48] above. Furthermore, Jelisavac and Martin had different prospects of rehabilitation and the Judge found that Jelisavac’s criminal offending indicated “a continuing attitude of disobedience” and greater weight was to be given to retribution, deterrence and protection of society (ROS at 15-16). Martin was to serve his sentence in protective custody and special circumstances were found justifying an adjustment in the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and balance of term. No finding of special circumstances was made in Jelisavac’s case nor was he required to serve his sentence in protective custody. Although Armitage DCJ did not expressly state why he backdated Martin’s sentence to the time of his arrest, Armitage DCJ had been impressed by Martin’s likelihood of not re-offending and of rehabilitating himself whilst the Judge determined that Jelisavac had no real prospects of rehabilitation. The backdating of a sentence is a matter of discretion and Jelisavac did not have the advantage of the findings made in favour of Martin. All things were not equal between Jelisavac and Martin. I am not persuaded that the difference in the sentences involves a marked disparity giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    100 Ground 3 has not been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
      :  
      The commencement date of the sentence should have been earlier than that imposed.  
       
      
    101 Mr Watts contended that Jelisavac’s sentence should have been backdated to commence on the date of his arrest or if not on that date, then to a date which would have the effect of the sentence being partially concurrent with the balance of his parole. It was argued that Jelisavac was unduly punished for a second time by the finding that the offences were aggravated by being committed whilst on parole and by the revocation of parole and the subsequent accumulation of sentence.  
     
      
    102 The applicant had been released to parole on 1 February 2005 but was arrested on 26 March 2006 after the commission of the present offences. His parole was revoked by the parole authority and was due to expire on 1 February 2009. During the sentence proceedings the Judge was urged by Mr Watts to commence Jelisavac’s sentence on the day he went into custody. In rejecting this submission the Judge said (ROS at 32): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has what can only be described, and I have described earlier as an appalling record, both in terms of prior convictions as well as his correctional record. He has been given a series of benefits and privileges which he has abused both in terms of sentencing options, and in particular, parole periods. The conditional liberty he was on at the time of the offence is a privilege which he abused. It indicates an attitude to the law generally and the sentencing process in particular. The action taken by the parole authorities was for the earlier offences which are unrelated to the current offence. He was released to parole that he be of good behaviour, simply and comprehensively while he was on liberty. That was referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v Wallace 
         [2007] NSWCCA 6. I do not see this sentence as constituting a crushing burden, rather it must be a method of bringing it home to him that if he is ever given another parole opportunity, he must not abuse it. To accede to the submission made would not, in my view, give proper recognition to the purposes of sentencing as are specified.”  
        
       
      
    103 His Honour, it appears, commenced Jelisavac’s sentence on 2 February 2009. As this was the day after the expiration of the applicant’s balance of parole, the Judge corrected the sentence on 22 August 2008. The sentence was then fixed to commence on 11 August 2008 which the Judge said “was to be served concurrently with the remainder of the revoked parole period.”  
     
      
    104 It was a matter for the Judge’s discretion to make the sentence wholly or partly cumulative upon the sentence being served by Jelisavac as a consequence of the revocation of parole: Callaghan v The Queen (2006) 160 A Crim R 145. The Judge during his sentencing remarks considered the principle of totality and had remarked that by wholly accumulating the sentence upon the parole period a “crushing burden” was not being imposed. The sentence which his Honour ultimately fixed was backdated to commence on 11 August 2008 and was partially accumulated by almost 6 months upon the sentence being served.  
     
      
    105 No error, in my view, has been demonstrated in the exercise by the Judge of his discretion. This ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    106 In any event all of the offences which were taken into account by the Judge in sentencing Jelisavac were offences of the utmost gravity which were committed whilst Jelisavac was subject to conditional liberty. Anything less than a non-parole period of 6 years would not have appropriately reflected the objective gravity of Jelisavac’s criminality and no other sentence was warranted: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    107 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.  
       
      
    108 HARRISON J: I agree with Price J.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 14 July 2008 this Court granted the applicant leave to appeal against sentence imposed in the District Court on 5 May 2006 following pleas of guilty to an indictment containing five counts. Two counts were laid contrary to s 233B(1)(ca) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), each of which concerned the applicant’s possession of commercial quantities of ecstasy, and three counts laid contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 each of which concerned the applicant’s supply of commercial quantities of ecstasy ([2008] NSWCCA 98).  
     
      
    2 The appeal was allowed and the applicant was re-sentenced. The orders of the Court were entered in the Registry on 29 July 2008.  
     
      
    3 This is an application to vary those orders as provided for in rule 50C(2) of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The applicant represented himself at the hearing of the appeal and on the present application. 
     
      
    4 Rule 50C provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        50C Power to set aside or vary order 
         
        (1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order. 
         
        (2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered. 
         
        (3) Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered. 
         
        (4) The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3). 
         
        (5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order. 
         
        
       
      
    5 The applicant did not file a notice of motion or affidavit in support of the application. His correspondence dated 11 and 13 August 2008 and 11 September 2008, following publication of the judgment of the Court, was treated as an application to vary the orders entered on 29 July 2008 and the grounds upon which the application was based. Having regard to the date of the correspondence and the matters raised in it, the Crown accepted that the application was made within 14 days of the orders being entered, as provided for in r 50C(2), and that the power to entertain the application was thereby enlivened.6 The applicant was not legally represented at the hearing of his application by the Court on 29 April 2009 and appeared on his own behalf. The Crown arranged for an interpreter in the Dutch and Flemish languages. The applicant stated that he did not consider that he needed the assistance of an interpreter and the applicant proceeded without such assistance. 
     
      
    7 It was the agreed position at the hearing that the applicant’s affidavit affirmed on 29 April 2009 would only be read in the event that the application was successful and the Court was called upon to re-sentence. On the same basis, the Court admitted the following documents:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Exhibit A: Officer Report form dated 20 June 2008. 
       
      (2) Exhibit B: Letter from the applicant to New South Wales Ombudsman dated 27 August 2008. 
       
      (3) Exhibit C: Document from Ombudsman dated 11 August 2008. 
       
      (4) Exhibit D: Document from Embassy of Belgium to the applicant dated 28 April 2008. 
       
      (5) Exhibit E: Document from N Gelin, solicitors, to David Barrow, Legal Aid Commission dated 28 April 2009. 
       
      (6) Exhibit GAD1 – annexed to the Registrar’s affidavit. 
       
      
    The principles to be applied 
     
      
    8 In Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69 this Court (differently constituted) had occasion to deal for the first time with the operation of r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules. The operation of the rule commenced on 7 September 2007 (see Criminal Appeal Rules (Amendment No 1) 2007; GG No 116). In Alramadan the Court held that the power to vary or set aside orders made consequent upon an appeal against conviction (or an application for leave to appeal against sentence) is to be understood and applied commensurate with the power the Court has always had under the general law to vary or set aside orders in an appropriate case. The Court also emphasised that after a full hearing on the merits of an appeal against conviction or sentence the circumstances in which further argument should be entertained on an application to vary or set aside its orders are quite limited. In that regard it cited the judgment of Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300 at 303 where his Honour identified the criteria by which an application to re-open a proceeding should be decided. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases. 
         
        
       
      
    It was this approach which the Court in Alramadan accepted as the proper approach when an application is brought under r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  
     
      
    9 In applying those principles to this application, the Crown submitted, in our view correctly, that there are three questions that require an affirmative answer before the Court would be entitled to consider varying the orders entered on 29 July 2008.10 The first question is whether, in considering the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the Court proceeded (or apparently proceeded) according to some misapprehension of fact or law. Unless that has occurred the application to vary the sentencing order must be dismissed. If it is established that the Court proceeded according to some misapprehension of fact or law, the Court must then be satisfied that the matter complained of affected its consideration of the merits of the appeal in some material way. That is, the misapprehension must be a material one. Again, unless that matter is established, the application to vary the sentencing order must fail. Assuming the materiality of the misapprehension of fact or law, the final question is whether it was due to the applicant’s neglect or default. 11 Although the applicant did not cast his submissions in accordance with the principles to which we have referred, it is essential on this application that the question whether the Court should vary or set aside its orders be resolved strictly in accordance with those principles since to do otherwise is to run the risk that the application takes on the character of an appeal or a re-hearing of the original appeal.  
     
      
    The grounds upon which the application is based 
     
      
    12 After a distillation of relevant parts of the lengthy correspondence received from the applicant, and after considering his oral submissions to the extent that they were relevant to the questions the Court has to decide, the grounds upon which the application is based are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) the Court did not have the applicant’s grounds of appeal and the written submissions he prepared and filed in advance of the hearing of the appeal but instead had the grounds of appeal and written submissions prepared by his former lawyers, both of which he had specifically abandoned when he assumed the conduct of his appeal; and 
       
      (b) the Court determined the appeal based upon his former lawyers’ submissions and the grounds of appeal filed by them.  
      
    The evidence 
     
      
    13 The Registrar of the Court, Ms Gabrielle Ann Drennan, of her own motion provided an affidavit sworn 28 April 2009 in order to assist the Court in understanding the chronology of her dealings with the applicant from the time he assumed carriage of his appeal and, importantly, to trace the provenance of the materials that ultimately comprised the appeal papers the Court was provided with in advance of the hearing. 
     
      
    14 The applicant objected to Annexure “D” to the affidavit. That annexure, by reason of the objection, was removed from the affidavit and handed back to the Registrar (transcript, 29 April 2009, p 5). 
     
      
    15 The relevant dealings between the Registrar and the applicant are as follows: 
     
      
       
       (a) On 23 November 2006 a notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence was filed in the Registry supported by grounds of appeal at that time drafted by the legal practitioners retained by the applicant to act on the appeal (hereinafter referred to as the original grounds of appeal). They also included written submissions prepared by the same legal practitioners. 
        
        
       (b) On the same date, the applicant forwarded a letter addressed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, where he identified aspects of the lawyers’ documents with which he did not agree. 
        
        
       
       
       (c) On 22 January 2007 the applicant advised by letter that he would represent himself on the appeal and that he intended to file new submissions. 
        
        
       (d) On 31 January 2007 the hearing of the appeal, listed for 14 February 2007, was vacated. 
        
        
       (e) On 14 June 2007 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions filed the application book in the Registry in accordance with the customary practice. The original grounds of appeal were included at AB5. The application book did not contain the submissions prepared by the applicant's former lawyers. (In addition, it is clear beyond doubt, that the Registrar did not otherwise provide the members of this Court with those submissions in advance of the hearing. In accordance with her usual practice, she retained the original submissions but struck through the first page of the document with the notation “superseded by K’s own submissions”.)  
        
        
       The six original grounds of appeal, as they appeared in the appeal book are set out in full as follows:  
        
         
          
          1. The learned sentencing Judge erred in finding the Appellant’s level of participation and the quantities involved put his level of offending at the highest end of the scale. 
           
          2. The sentence in all of the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 
           
          3. The learned sentencing Judge erred in placing too much weight on the Appellant’s record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor. 
           
          4. The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to give the Appellant an appropriate discount for his assistance. 
           
          5.The learned sentencing Judge erred in miscalculating the appropriate sentences to give affect to her findings. 
           
          6. The Appellant has a justifiable sense of grievance by nature of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and those imposed upon his co-offender, Doran Yona.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
       (f) A week later, on 20 June 2007, the Registry received a bundle of documents from the applicant under cover of a letter of three pages addressed to “ 
       their honourables Justice’s of the supreme court of NSW 
       ” and attaching a hand written document of 136 pages headed “Appellant’s Submissions”. Seven numbered grounds of appeal appear on the first page of the submissions under a subheading entitled “Grounds of Appeal”.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       They are set out in full as follows:  
        
         
          
          1. Due to unprofessional conduct of legal representation Ken Gilson, Fresh/new evidence. The AFP Phone intercepts of my co offender Doran Yona. 
           
          2. The learned sentencing Judge erred in finding that my level of participation and the quantities involved put my level of offending at the highest end of the scale. 
           
          3. The sentence in all of the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 
           
          4. The learned sentencing Judge erred in placing too much weight on my record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor. 
           
          5. The learned sentencing Judge erred in not mentioning or giving due consideration that I was in fact an unwilling participant. 
           
          6. The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to give me an appropriate discount for my assistance. 
           
          7. I have a justifiable sense of inequality, unfairness, injustice and grievance by nature of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon me and those imposed upon my co-offender, Doran Yona. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
       (g) Immediately prior to the commencement of the hearing of the application for leave to appeal on 4 September 2007, the Registrar informed the applicant of the various documents that had been provided to the Court in preparation for the hearing including, inter alia, the two volumes of the application books prepared by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions together with his written submissions.  
        
       
      
    16 Neither the Registrar nor Mr Wigney SC, who appeared for the Crown on the appeal and on the present application, were apparently aware of the discrepancy between the applicant's grounds of appeal, appearing as the facing page to his submissions, and the original grounds of appeal, as they appeared in the application book. To the extent that the applicant was aware of the fact that the original grounds had been included in the appeal books, and that his grounds of appeal had not, he did not draw it to the Court’s attention in the hearing. In making that observation no criticism of him is intended. The Court is conscious that he was unrepresented on the appeal and for that reason may not have appreciated that it is the obligation of an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence to invite attention to the precise grounds upon which it is submitted leave should be granted and the appeal allowed.  
     
      
    17 At paragraph 13 of the judgment Fullerton J set out the grounds upon which the application for leave to appeal had been advanced at the hearing, with a view to addressing the grounds of appeal as they crystallised in the course of the argument. This was by reference both to the grounds as they appeared in the application book and those set out on the facing page of the applicant’s submissions filed after the application book was settled. It is clear that the precise terms in which Ground 1 of the applicant’s grounds of appeal was expressed were not replicated in the judgment and that the applicant’s Ground 5 was not identified separately as a ground of appeal. In addition, Ground 6 was nominated as a ground of appeal which the applicant did not include in his grounds of appeal but which appeared as Ground 4 in the original grounds of appeal. 18 Paragraph 13 of the judgment reads as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        The applicant, who was unrepresented on the appeal, did not identify or address these specific errors ( 
        referring to the Crown’s concession that her Honour failed to comply with relevant sections of the Crimes(Sentencing 
        )  
        Procedure Act  
        or 
         R v Way 
        ) in either his written or oral submissions. His appeal was advanced on the following grounds: 
         
          
           
          (1) The incompetence of his legal representation resulted in relevant evidence being withheld from the sentencing judge. 
           
          (2) The sentencing judge erred in finding the applicant’s level of participation in the criminal enterprise and the quantities of drugs involved put his level of offending at the highest end of the scale. 
           
          (3) The sentences in all of the circumstances were manifestly excessive. 
           
          (4) The sentencing judge erred in giving undue weight to the applicant’s record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor. 
           
          (5) The sentencing judge erred in failing to give the applicant an appropriate discount for his assistance. 
           
          (6) The sentencing judge erred in miscalculating the appropriate sentences to give affect to her findings. 
           
          (7) The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by nature of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and those imposed upon his co-offender.  
          
         
        
       
      
    The discrepancy between the filed grounds of appeal and the grounds of appeal set out in the judgment 
     
      
    19 A comparison between the applicant’s grounds of appeal and the original grounds and the grounds as set out in the judgment exposes the extent of the discrepancy. 
     
      
    Ground 1 in the judgment is a restatement of the applicant’s first ground of appeal.Ground 2 in the judgment equates with the applicant’s second ground of appeal (and appears in the original grounds of appeal as Ground 1).Ground 3 in the judgment equates with the applicant’s third ground of appeal (and appears in the original grounds of appeal as Ground 2).Ground 4 in the judgment equates with the applicant’s fourth ground of appeal (and appears in the original grounds of appeal as Ground 3).Ground 5 in the judgment equates with the applicant’s sixth ground of appeal (and appears in the original grounds of appeal as Ground 6).Ground 6 in the judgment was not included in the applicant’s grounds of appeal but appears as Ground 5 in the original grounds of appeal.Ground 7 in the judgment equates with the applicant’s seventh ground of appeal (and appears in the original grounds of appeal as Ground 6).20 The fact that the Court considered a ground of appeal the applicant did not wish to argue (Ground 6 in the judgment and Ground 5 in the original grounds of appeal) is irrelevant to this application. We simply note that in the course of considering Ground 6, and after considering comparative sentences, the Court was of the view that a more appropriate starting point for the calculation of sentence on the first count was 22 years.  
     
      
    21 At the hearing of the application, there were a number of exchanges between the Bench and the applicant directed to identifying in specific terms the grounds relied upon. This was necessary, given the need for the applicant to establish either a misapprehension of the facts by this Court when deciding the appeal and/or a misapprehension to the relevant law or both. In the course of the exchanges, the Court observed that it was not open to the applicant to simply contend that the judgment of the Court was affected by legal error as to do so would be tantamount to an attempt to involve the Court in exercising an appellable review of its own judgment. The applicant indicated that he understood the point made in that respect. 
     
      
    22 The applicant confirmed that he wished to contend that the Court did not, in dealing with his appeal, consider grounds that he had raised. These were identified as Grounds 1 and 5. Mr Kauwenberghs, however, sought to broaden the scope of his application to argue that Grounds 1 and 5 were effectively inter-related or so connected with other grounds that he should be entitled to revisit the other grounds of his appeal (t.16). 
     
      
    23 The applicant fairly added in this respect that he could not say that the matters concerning Grounds 1 and 5 would affect the other grounds of the appeal but that it could have such an effect (t.16).Ground 5 was not separately considered24 The applicant’s fifth ground of appeal - namely that the sentencing judge was in error in not giving due consideration to his claim that he was an unwilling participant in the drug trafficking enterprise - was not reproduced in the judgment as a separate ground of appeal. We do not regard the failure to nominate the applicant’s fifth ground of appeal in the judgment as a discrete ground of appeal as an error capable of being characterised as a misapprehension of fact for the purposes of this application. However, even if it could be so regarded, the issue as to whether the applicant was a willing or unwilling participant (the sole question raised by Ground 5) was both the subject of submissions by the applicant and was expressly addressed and dealt with in the judgment when consideration was given to the impact of the fresh evidence on the applicant's second ground of appeal, namely his challenge to the sentencing judge’s assessment of the level of his participation in the drug trafficking enterprise and in the assessment her Honour made of his objective criminality for sentencing purposes. Reference to the following paragraphs in the judgment make that plain:  
     
      
       
        
        52 As I have noted, notwithstanding the fact that her Honour  
        accepted that the applicant acted under duress when he initially agreed with Koen to supply 200,000 of the ecstasy tablets 
        , she was satisfied that over succeeding weeks  
        his role changed to that of an active participant in the supply of drugs for reward 
        . She also concluded that  
        his attitude changed from being a person taking a passive role in compliance with those who had duped him into a proactive role, and that this was evidenced by the fact that he unilaterally determined when and how much of the drug he would supply. She also found he attempted to negotiate a much higher financial reward for himself both from Yona as the person to whom he supplied drugs on 26 and 27 June 2004 and Koen as the person on whose instructions he acted. 
         She described the applicant’s role in this context as that of a warehouseman and first-line distributor of the drug rather than a courier or mule. In short, her Honour regarded the offending constituted by the commercial supply counts in counts 4 and 5 on the indictment as at the highest end of the scale of criminality.  
         
         
        53 In oral submissions the applicant conceded that while he welcomed the prospect of the financial reward that Koen offered him given his strained financial circumstances, he did not engage in brinkmanship to secure it and that her Honour was in error in interpreting his conduct in that way. He conceded that while the evidence tendered at the sentence hearing showed that he was not a totally unwilling supplier of drugs (in particular in regard to supply of 10.7-12 kilos to the man at The Entrance on 21 June 2004) he maintained he received no reward for doing so. In addition, he submitted that at no time in his dealings with Yona, dealings which culminated in the supply of large quantities of ecstasy tablets on 26 and 27 June 2004, did he demand money before he supplied the drugs and that he only agreed to supply drugs to him at all because of a fear of reprisals and in order to secure his safe passage out of Australia. He submitted that to the extent that he took unilateral action in deciding when, where and how much of the drug would be supplied this was in order that the risk of being caught would be minimised in circumstances where he was the one who had been put in the compromising position of being in possession of the drugs having accepted the job of delivering them. He submitted that her Honour misconstrued his role and that the fully extracted telephone intercepts demonstrate that he was a reluctant warehouseman and first line distributor and that at all times he was acting for and on behalf of others whilst at the same time being manipulated by them. In addition, he asks rhetorically, why if he was seeking to hold Yona and others to ransom would he leave the county after supplying the drugs without being paid the money he had been promised when he had the option of leaving the drugs buried in the ground until he had been paid? 
         
         
        54 In addition the applicant sought to demonstrate, again by reference to the fully extracted calls, that he was subordinate to the role Yona performed in the distribution of the drugs.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        56 In my view, after comparing the summary of the intercepted calls in the agreed facts with the fully transcribed calls tendered as fresh evidence, there is some substance in the applicant’s submission. However when read in their entirety,  
        I am not of the view that the calls go so far as to compel the conclusion contended for by the applicant. In particular, I find that while his actions were dictated by the contingencies that presented from time to time in the process of delivering the drugs to Yona, he nevertheless performed an active, informed and consultative role 
        .  
         
         
        57 After the applicant was told by Koen to supply Yona with 230,000 tablets on 24 June 2004, he made his way from The Entrance to Bondi to meet with Yona but did not take any drugs with him. From what Yona reported by telephone to others it would appear that the applicant was extremely agitated and concerned about the speed and reliability of the rented car he was driving and the distance he had to travel carrying the drugs as distinct from positioning himself to broker a better financial arrangement. After collecting the Commodore from Yona and over the course of a number of conversations with Koen the applicant also complained to Koen about having to travel a considerable distance with drugs in his possession to supply people that he described as not “Koen’s people”.  
        This would tend to suggest that the applicant had at least an appreciation of who Koen’s people were and that the person he supplied with 10.7-12 kg on 21 June 2004 was in that category whilst Yona was not. 
         The applicant proposed that Koen ask Yona to drive to collect the drugs. (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
      
    25 In the course of dealing with the impact of the fresh evidence the following observations were made: 
     
      
       
        
        60 It would also appear that in the course of his dealings with the applicant Yona was intentionally downplaying the extent of his own knowledge of the trade in drugs in order to keep the applicant in the dark as to the true extent of his involvement and also so as to encourage the applicant to view him as a person who was also simply acting at the direction of others. That is not to say however  
        that the calls reveal the applicant as reluctant or resistant to the role he had agreed to perform. Importantly, in none of the calls with Koen or Yona does the applicant appear to show any reluctance to supplying the vast quantities of ecstasy with which he is charged even if he was temperamentally ill-fitted to the task.  
          
         
         
        61 In the result,  
        while I do not regard the role that he performed as in the most serious category of offending, I do accept he was at least on an equal footing with Yona in their possession of commercial quantities of ecstasy (albeit at different times) and that Yona was intimately connected with those who were to receive the drugs the applicant supplied to him, no doubt for the ultimate supply to end users. 
         
         
        62 I will have something more to say about Yona’s role when coming to consider the question of parity.  
        At this stage, however, I am satisfied that the applicant was not a reluctant distributor of the drugs but was manipulated by others to secure their objectives. By contrast, I am not satisfied that the evidence discloses that the applicant sought to exploit his control over the drugs to his own financial end otherwise than in an increasingly desperate effort to be paid the money he was promised by way of an advance from Yona to enable him to leave Australia.  
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    The difference in the wording of Ground 1 (“legal representation”)26 The only remaining issue left for consideration on this application is whether the difference in the wording of the first ground of appeal, as it appears at paragraph 13 of the judgment, and the way it appears in the applicant’s grounds of appeal, is indicative or suggestive of the fact that the Court considered the application for leave to appeal according to some misapprehension of fact.  
     
      
    27 The Court construed the applicant’s first ground of appeal as limited to a complaint about the quality of his legal representation before the sentencing judge due to the failure of his counsel to tender some telephone intercepts, as distinct from the quality of his representation being productive of error in the sentencing exercise in some other way. 
     
      
    28 At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal the Crown consented to the Court receiving the telephone intercepts as fresh evidence. Given the way the applicant expressed the first ground of appeal, we understood that this disposed of that ground of appeal, subject only to the necessity to consider the extent to which the fresh evidence impacted on the findings of the sentencing judge as to the level of the applicant’s participation in the criminal enterprise generally, and how this compared with the sentence of his co-offender for parity purposes.  
     
      
    29 The Crown observed that if Ground 1 was considered by the Court as limited to the telephone intercepts, that would be a misapprehension of fact or law. However, the Crown’s submission was that, even if there was a misapprehension in that respect, the question then was whether it was a material one. The Crown contended that such a misrepresentation in this case lacked materiality as other matters, in particular, those of delay and parity, were considered by the Court. Accordingly, the Crown’s ultimate submission was that the misapprehension in that respect had no bearing upon the Court’s approach to the appeal and its determination. 
     
      
    30 We accept that the applicant’s written submissions in support of Ground 1, in particular, at pp 6-14 set out a litany of complaints about the quality of his legal representation at the sentencing proceedings extending beyond the failure to tender the full telephone intercepts. He also complains about his counsel’s failure to adequately inform her Honour of the reasons for the delay in bringing the sentence proceedings to a conclusion, the harsh conditions of his remand in the interim, and his counsel’s failure to consult with him before advancing submissions on sentence, in particular on the issue of parity.  
     
      
    31 However, as the Crown submitted and as discussed below, the issues of delay, the harsh conditions in which the applicant was held in custody and that of parity were dealt with in relation to grounds of appeal other than Ground 1. 
     
      
    32 Dealing first with the issue of delay and the conditions of his remand, it is clear from the sentencing remarks that her Honour took delay and the unusually harsh conditions to which the applicant had been subject as a remand prisoner into account in mitigation of sentence. For this reason we can see no basis for the applicant's claim that his lawyers were incompetent in failing to direct attention to the mitigatory effect of these matters much less that her Honour failed to take account of them. In addition, this Court considered that each of those matters should be afforded weight in the quantification of the discount for the applicant’s assistance to the authorities and in the result determined that a discount of 45 per cent should apply. This was dealt with at paragraphs [100] to [102] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        100 While it is true there was no evidence before her Honour that the applicant would be incarcerated in onerous conditions for any nominated or predicted period beyond the date of his sentence because of his assistance, in my view the fact that the applicant was forced to withstand inhumane conditions of incarceration over an extended period prior to sentence, such that his medical condition was exacerbated and his mental functioning compromised, is compelling. I regard this case as legitimately falling within an exceptional class of case where a combined discount of more than 40 per cent should have been allowed, not because of evidence that the applicant will spend his sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population, but because the onerous conditions to which he was subject whilst on remand were directly related to the assistance he offered and the threats to his life that resulted.  
         
         
        101 I note that in  
        Sukkar 
        , 
          
        Latham J considered that the fact that there was little in the assistance by way of contrition, no evidence of any personal risk to the offender or to any member of his family and no evidence of any hardship arising directly out of the provision of assistance, allowed her Honour to conclude that a combined discount of 45 per cent was unduly generous and that it should be reduced to 35 per cent.  
         
         
        102 By contrast, in the case of this applicant his assistance was significant and all three features were present. For that reason I consider that a combined discount of 40 per cent in respect of counts 1, 2 4 and 5 was inadequate and that a 45 per cent discount should have been allowed. I am not of the view that the combined discount of 60 per cent for count 3 is in the same category, indeed I regard it as generous. 
        
       
      
    33 In relation to the applicant’s complaints about his legal representation, insofar as he complained about what was said to be the paucity of his counsel’s submissions on the issue of parity, it is important to observe, as already noted, that this Court dealt with the issue of parity as a separate issue or ground of appeal. For this reason any complaint about the way parity was addressed by the applicant’s counsel on sentence was effectively overtaken not only by the Court looking at the issue afresh when considering whether the challenge to the approach taken to parity by the sentencing judge was made out but by the Court ultimately being satisfied that the applicant’s sentence was disproportionate to the sentence imposed upon his co-offender and that he would be re-sentenced taking parity considerations into account. The Court dealt with that issue at paragraphs [104] to [109] which are set out below in full: 
     
      
       
        
        104 Following his arrest on 28 June 2004, Doran Yona was charged with two offences. The first was laid under the  
        Customs Act 
         (Cth) and concerned his possession of the ecstasy supplied by the applicant on 26 and 27 June 2004 as located by police in the boot of the Holden Commodore parked in the car park at the Swiss Grand Hotel at Bondi Beach on 28 June 2004. He was also charged with money laundering an amount of $1,000,000 contrary to s 400.3(2) of the  
        Criminal Code Act  
        1995 (Cth). The maximum penalty for the money laundering offence was a fine not exceeding $79,200 or imprisonment for 12 years or both. The maximum penalty for the drug offence was life imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $825,000 or both. The sentencing judge imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years for the money laundering offence and a term of imprisonment of 5 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 7 months in respect of the drug offence. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. His Honour arrived at that sentence after allowing a 60 per cent discount for the combined value in his plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities. From the remarks on sentence it would appear that after assessing the objective seriousness of the drug offence and the offender’s role, which his Honour regarded as tangential and marginal, a head sentence of 15 years was considered an appropriate starting point for the calculation of sentence.  
         
         
        105 Although her Honour noted that at the time of the applicant’s sentence hearing Yona’s sentence was subject to a Crown appeal, she considered that in addition to the sentence being lenient there were good reasons why parity with Yona did not apply. She considered the charges faced by the applicant and Yona were markedly different in that Yona was charged with a money laundering offence and a single count of possession under the  
        Customs Act 
         (Cth), while the applicant faced multiple counts of possession and supply. She also noted that the quantity of drugs involved in Yona’s offence were less than the drugs the applicant possessed and supplied and that in Yona’s sentencing proceedings the sentencing judge described his role in possessing the drugs as tangential and marginal, that Yona’s assistance was far more valuable than the assistance given by the applicant because he gave evidence against other offenders both at committal and trial and that he had a stronger subjective case. 
         
         
        106 Following the sentencing of the applicant, this Court published its decision on the Crown appeal. The majority found that his Honour erred in appointing 15 years as the starting point for the calculation of sentence in circumstances where the quantity of drug involved was almost 33 times the commercial quantity and erred in his description of the offender’s role as a “somewhat tangential or marginal”. The Court regarded Yona’s role in arranging for the applicant to transfer the drugs to him as far more significant than the time he was in actual possession of the drugs and that the offending comprehended by both counts on the indictment reflected a high level of criminality such that it was patent that his Honour’s sentencing discretion had miscarried. The Court regarded that finding as reinforced by the fact that his Honour allowed a 60 per cent discount for the combined value of the assistance and his plea of guilty. 
         
         
        107 In accordance with the principles that apply when re-sentencing following a successful Crown appeal, Beazley JA was of the opinion that the lowest sentence that could have been imposed for the drug offence was a sentence of 16 years imprisonment. In arriving at this sentence her Honour took into account Yona’s mental condition and compromised capacity to function as diminishing the need for general deterrence without reducing the sentence by any arithmetic calculation an approach taken by the judge at first instance which her Honour found to be in error (see [44]-[69]). Her Honour then allowed a 50 per cent discount for the combined utility of the assistance to authorities and the plea of guilty reducing the head sentence to one of 8 years and imposed a non-parole period of half of the head sentence since that was an approach taken by the sentencing judge, an approach that was not challenged on appeal. Her Honour then ordered partial concurrency in respect of the sentence for money laundering and specified that the sentence for the drug offence commence 12 months after the commencement of the sentence for the money laundering offence. In the result, Yona was sentenced to a period of 5 years imprisonment before being eligible to be released on parole. 
         
         
        108 The Crown submitted that there were sound reasons why the parity principle had no application in sentencing the applicant and that the sentencing judge was correct to find that there were significant differences, both objective and subjective, between Yona’s case and the applicant’s, and significant differences between the offences committed by Yona and the applicant. The Crown submitted that the applicant’s attempts in his written submissions to portray Yona as more significantly involved and more senior than him should be rejected. The Crown also submitted that if there was to be any comparison between the sentence imposed on Yona and the sentence imposed on the applicant, the comparison would only relate to count 1 where the applicant was charged with being in possession of the drugs that he supplied to Yona such that they were in Yona’s possession on his arrest. While that comparison is valid, in my view, it does not necessarily stop there given that the applicant was also charged with supplying the drugs in Counts 4 and 5 which Yona was charged with possessing. 
         
         
        109 Although her Honour was correct in identifying differences in the number and type of offences with which Yona and the applicant were charged, and while I am conscious that parity as a sentencing principle does not extend to redressing any imbalance or discrepancies in the manner in which prosecuting authorities might charge co-offenders (see  
        R v Formosa  
        [2005] NSWCCA 363), I am also mindful of the fact that a justifiable sense of grievance may arise in cases where even though a co-accused is sentenced on a different factual basis so as to justify the imposition of unequal sentences, the sentences are nevertheless disproportionate to that degree of difference (see  
        Formosa 
        , 
          
        per Simpson J at [49]). For these reasons, I propose to take into account the issue of parity when re-sentencing the applicant. I am not however of the view that equal sentences will be the result. It cannot be ignored that Yona was re-sentenced after a Crown appeal where, consistent with principle, Beazley JA calculated the head sentence from a starting point at the lowest end of the range, namely 16 years. On this appeal the Court is not so constrained. In addition, Yona’s subjective circumstances were such as to entitle him to leniency by reason of his mental health which was of a different nature to the psychological stresses from which the applicant suffers.  
        
       
      
    34 In determining the question as to whether there was a misapprehension of fact and/or of law in the judgment of Fullerton J (with which the other members of the Court agreed) and, if there was, the question of its materiality, it is necessary to observe that the issues which the applicant relied upon in this application to set aside or vary the orders entered on 29 July 2008 were considered and dealt with by the Crown though not strictly in accord with the particular numbered grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    35 It is not uncommon for this Court on appeal to consider issues that relate to different grounds together, rather than separately, when determining the outcome of an appeal. This may occur, for example, where issues overlap or are inter-related in some way or ways. Accordingly, in the present case, for example, the matter of the telephone interceptions was relevant to the issues of the applicant’s role as well as to that of his willing participation and also to the complaint concerning the applicant’s legal representation.  
     
      
    36 In general terms, it may be said, of course, that it is the substance of the grounds of an appeal, rather than the form or manner in which they are presented or dealt with by the Court that is of fundamental importance. We do not consider that any of the issues or the grounds pursued by the applicant on the appeal were overlooked or were the subject of a misapprehension of a kind that enlivens an exercise of the Court’s power under Rule 50C. 
     
      
    37 In the course of the hearing of the application, it was indicated to the applicant (t.28) that the Court may need to consider, for the purposes of Rule 50C, the appropriate approach to be taken in order to determine the significance, if any, of Grounds 1 and 5 to any of the other grounds of the appeal. The three possible courses identified were:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That the Court considers the whole of the applicant’s written submissions in order to determine whether Rule 50C is engaged in this case. 
       
       
      (2) That the Court considers the whole of the applicant’s submissions and then determines how or, if at all, Grounds 1 and 5 impact upon or are integrated with other matters raised in the applicant’s submissions. 
       
       
      (3) That the Court only considers matters concerning Grounds 1 and 5 and such of the material in the applicant’s submissions that deal with those two grounds. 
       
      
    38 In determining which of the above mentioned three courses is appropriate, the primary issue is whether there was misapprehension of fact and/or law by the Court of a material kind concerning any relevant aspect or matter concerning either Ground 1 and/or Ground 5. If there was no misapprehension of that kind, then there would be no occasion to consider the possible inter-relationship between Grounds 1 and 5 and the other grounds relied upon by the applicant. If there was any misapprehension by the Court of the kind to which reference has been made, then it would be necessary to consider whether there is any consequential impact upon other grounds. In the latter event, the Court would need to consider the applicant’s submissions relating to other grounds additional to his submissions on Grounds 1 and 5. 
     
      
    39 It is apparent from what has been stated in this judgment that the Court did not, in fact, proceed according to a misapprehension of the facts or as to the relevant law of a material kind in determining the applicant’s appeal. It follows from that conclusion that it is not open nor would it be necessary or appropriate for this Court on this application under Rule 50C to undertake a general review of the grounds of appeal and the applicant’s submissions in relation thereto (other than Grounds 1 and 5) those grounds having been determined by the Court in its judgment given on 29 July 2008. 
     
      
    40 For the above reasons, the application to vary the orders of the Court entered on 29 July 2008 is dismissed.

    JUDGMENTCosts Application1 After a relatively short trial, a jury found the applicant not guilty of three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 and one count of committing an act of indecency on a child under 16. The alleged offences were stated to have been committed between 1 January 1999 and 31 January 2000, although when the charges were laid, the allegation was that the offences were committed during the calendar year 2000. The jury reached its verdicts after about half an hour of consideration. Thereupon Mr Dhanji, for the applicant, made this application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967, the relevant parts of which read as follows: 
     
      
      2 Certificate may be granted  
       
      (1) The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:  
       
        
        (a) where, after the commencement of a  
        trial  
        in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned, or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken, or  
         
        (b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and:  
         
          
          (i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted, or  
           
          (ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,  
          
         
        
       
      grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings.  
      
     
     
      
      3 Form of certificate  
       
      (1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:  
       
        
        (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of  
        all the relevant facts 
        , it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and  
         
        (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.  
        
       
       
      3A Evidence of further relevant facts may be adduced  
       
      (1) For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in section 3 (1) (a) to ""all the relevant facts"" is a reference to:  
       
      (a) the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and  
       
      (b) any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate, and  
       
      (c) any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Magistrate that:  
       
        
        (i) relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and  
         
        (ii) were not adduced in the proceedings.  
        
       
      
    2 In Ramskogler v The Director of Public Prosecutions of New South Wales [1995] NSWSC 110 [28], Kirby P, with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, indicated that a judge considering an application for a certificate, under sections 2 and 3 of the Act divide his or her task into two categories -- the ""facts"" aspect and the ""reasonableness"" aspect.The facts aspect3 The prosecution case depended almost entirely upon the evidence of the complainant, who was a girl aged seven or eight at the time of the alleged offences. The alleged offences were said to have been committed in 1999 or 2000. This was based on the complainant's initial statement to the police in an interview conducted in August 2007, in which she said that she recalled the events taking place when she was in Year 3, and it was common ground that this was the year 2000.4 There was evidence that the complainant told a school friend of the alleged sexual assault shortly after the events occurred. There was also evidence from the school counsellor that when the matter was referred to him in August or September 2000, he interviewed the complainant, and subsequently, as required by the law at that time, reported the matter to the Department of Community Services.5 He recalls how, and the documents produced on subpoena by the Department of Community Services show that, the complainant alleged that she had been touched inappropriately by a friend of her brother. She named neither the perpetrator nor the particular brother. The evidence was that she had several brothers. Nor did she make specific allegations of the sexual conduct involved.6 In the information recorded by Links House in 2007, it is recorded that the complainant had said that a friend of her brother had taken her to a tent, undressed her and caused her to perform oral sex on him. It also records that he also performed oral sex on her. The record did not name the perpetrator, but recorded that he still lived around the corner from the complainant.7 In her interview with the police officer from the JIRT team, the complainant did not mention being undressed, but did complain that the perpetrator had caused her to suck his penis, and then had penile-vaginal intercourse with her.8 It was only when the officer in charge interviewed the complainant again in December 2007 and took a written statement from her, that it emerged that she alleged four separate sexual acts: in that statement she alleged fellatio, followed by masturbation in her presence, followed by cunnilingus and penile-vaginal intercourse. Those acts, and the order in which the complainant described them gave rise to the four charges in the indictment, which are stated in the same order. As I have indicated, the indictment originally alleged that all four offences occurred during the year 2000.9 In the week before the trial, the prosecution was able to obtain from the Board of Studies a statement that the applicant attended one high school until he obtained his School Certificate at the end of 1999. He was enrolled at another high school in 2000 and 2001, when he completed his Higher School Certificate.10 In the light of that information, a new indictment was prepared, indicating that the offences took place between 1 January 1999 and 31 January 2000.11 When the allegations were first reported to the complainant’s school, in August or September 2000, apparently by a friend of the complainant, the principal called the complainant's mother to the school and advised her of what her daughter had said. When the complainant returned home from school that day, her mother told her that she was not in trouble and generally took a sympathetic approach. She asked her daughter about the complaint and her daughter denied that there was such a complaint. One document in evidence suggested that she had told her mother that the girl who reported the incident was telling lies.12 About three weeks later, the Department of Community Services contacted the complainant's mother by telephone and asked her about the matter. The mother reported the conversation with their daughter and her opinion that there was no substance to the complaint. The Department then closed its file and took no further action until 2007.13 The complainant gave evidence that in the second half of 2007 she was in a health class at her school (a different school from the one she had attended in 2000) where there was a discussion of sexual assault. She said that this discussion reminded her of the alleged sexual assault upon her when she was in Year 3. The people conducting the class had given the number of Links House, a sexual assault counselling and assistance service. The complainant phoned Links House, and that agency alerted the Department of Community Services and the police. As a result, an officer from the Joint Investigation Response Team went to the school and interviewed the complainant. This officer subsequently left the team and the present officer in charge took over the case some time about October 2007. He wished to clarify some matters with the complainant and arranged to interview her at a police station, which he did in December 2007. As a result of this the complainant gave a written statement.14 The police then attempted to locate the applicant. The evidence at the trial indicated that his family had moved from the area in the first half of January 2000. Ultimately the officer in charge contacted the applicant's father, who instructed a solicitor, and on legal advice the applicant contacted the police. He voluntarily attended the police station at Tweed Heads in May 2008, and in the presence of his solicitor, participated in an electronically recorded interview. That interview was in evidence at the trial. Also in evidence is a handwritten statement, which the applicant prepared himself and handed to the police during the electronically recorded interview. He denied recollecting any of the events alleged by the complainant. He did admit that he had, for a relatively short time, been a friend of the complainant's brother, D, and that on one or possibly two occasions he had visited D's house. He recalls that the house had a tent in the garden, but he did not recall ever having been in the tent. In cross-examination at the trial he conceded that it was possible that he had been in the tent. He did not recall that the house had a pool attached to it. He did recall that a young girl was present and that he assumed that this was D's younger sister. He did not recall her name or what she looked like. He denied that he had ever slept over at D's house.15 The complainant gave evidence that the alleged offence took place in the course of a ""family visit"". Her evidence was that her parents and the applicant’s parents were friends because her father and the applicant's father were both members of a bushfire brigade. The complainant gave her version of events in the following way. She, her brother D, and the applicant were watching a movie in the lounge room of the family home, and that it was dark. The applicant then asked her to come with him to the tent in the backyard. Her evidence was that the applicant was going to spend the night, and that her brothers and the applicant would sleep in the tent which had been erected in the backyard. She said that after they went to the tent they were playing a game of ""dare"". This had started in an innocent way, when the applicant dared her to drink water from the swimming pool and to ride the dog. Her evidence in court was that she did neither of these things. She then said that the applicant lowered his shorts, and her evidence was that both were wearing swimming costumes at the time, took out his erect penis and began masturbating in front of her. She said that he said to her ""suck my cock"", and that although she was at first reluctant, she did so. She pulled away when he started to thrust his penis deeper into her mouth. She said that then he moved her bikini pants to one side and licked her vagina. She said that he then said to her, ""It's your turn now. Close your eyes for 30 seconds and I will do what I want."" She then said that he lay on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina and thrust once or twice. She said that this hurt and she pulled away, got up and returned to the house where she sat next to her brother on a couch, under a blanket. She said that a few minutes later the applicant came into the room, sat next to her and tried to hold her hand, but she pulled away. Her evidence was that she realised that what they had done was probably silly or naughty, but she did not appreciate the significance of what happened until much later. This version of events is different from earlier accounts she had given, especially in relation to the order in which the various sexual acts occurred. 16 D's evidence was that he, his sister and the applicant were all together in the tent. He left the tent to go to the toilet and returned a few minutes later when they were still there. He said that later his sister said to him ""what we did in the tent was naughty"".17 In both his recorded interview with the police and his evidence in court, the applicant denied recollecting anything of the nature alleged by the complainant. He confirmed his handwritten statement that he had been friendly with the complainant’s brother D, and that he had visited the house. He denied ever staying overnight with the complainant's family. His evidence was that he did not spend the night away from home at all, because, from an early age, he had suffered from a problem of bed-wetting, and was embarrassed in case he wet the bed when he was staying away from home. Both his parents confirmed that he had suffered from this complaint from early infancy until he was about 18 years old. This information was apparently not available to the prosecution until the witnesses gave evidence at the trial.18 Both the applicant's parents gave evidence that his father had never been a member of the bushfire brigade and that they did not know the complainant's parents socially.19 The complainant's mother gave evidence that she had met the applicant's mother at Alcoholics Anonymous and the applicant's mother confirmed this. Both women agreed that apart from that, there was no social contact between the two families.20 The applicant gave evidence that he knew of other boys the same age as him whose first name was ""C……"". D was not cross-examined as to whether he knew any other boys about his own age with that name.21 The applicant's mother gave evidence that she did recall on one occasion that she and her husband had driven their son to D's house. Her evidence was that she remained in the car with her youngest son, who was then a baby, and that she saw D's mother, whom she recognized from Alcoholics Anonymous, answer the door.22 The evidence from the officer in charge of the investigation was that, or when he took over from another officer, he re-interviewed the complainant. Evidence was given that some time in 2008, a statement was taken from the complainant's brother D. There was no evidence as to whether D, or any of the complainant's other brothers was asked about any friends who might have visited the family home at or about the time at which these alleged sexual assaults occurred. There is no evidence as to whether D or any of his brothers were ever asked about the names or identities of friends who may have stayed overnight in the tent. It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that she may have been mistaken about the identity of the person who committed the alleged sexual assaults, and it would be open on the evidence available to conclude that the complainant's evidence was completely correct, except for the identification of the perpetrator. The police investigation, in my view, should have excluded the possibility that a person who was a friend of D or another of the complainant's brothers, other than the applicant, was the perpetrator of these alleged events.The reasonableness aspect23 The applicant submits that, given the whole of the facts as they emerged during the trial, it was not reasonable to commence the prosecution at the time when the accused was charged in May 2008. The basis of this submission rests on a number of aspects of the reliability of the evidence given by the complainant. The applicant did not suggest, either at the trial or in the course of this application, that the complainant had no honest belief in what she said.24 First, the applicant says that the complainant’s evidence of what happened on the day is not consistent with any of the supporting evidence, particularly that of her brother D. This is because the complainant says that the applicant asked her to go to the tent with him, and that D was not present. D's evidence is that he was present but left temporarily.25 Secondly, the complainant’s evidence was that the events took place on a day where there was social activity between the parents. This is not consistent with other parts of her evidence, or that of her mother and brother, let alone the evidence of the defence witnesses.26 Thirdly, the complainant says that to the best of her recollection, the events took place when she was in Year 3 - that is, 2000. The evidence obtained by the prosecution in the week before the trial, as well as the defence evidence, is that the applicant and his family moved in January 2000, so that he was not in the area where the events are alleged to have taken place in 1999. The first complaint of the events was made in late August or early September 2000, which the complainant says was shortly after the events happened. A period of between seven and twelve months could not be described as ""a short period"".27 Fourthly, when the complainant finally named the alleged perpetrator, she appeared to be in some doubt, although she did say that he was called ""C……"" or possibly ""C……"". She consistently described him as a family friend, and in her complaint to Links House described him as still living around the corner. There is overwhelming evidence that the applicant had left the area more than seven years before that time.28 Fifthly, the complainant's evidence was that the plan was for the applicant to sleep at her house. The applicant's evidence and that of his parents, was that he never slept over.29 Sixthly, when the complainant recounted the events, on earlier occasions she was not specific. The school counsellor did not recall any detail of the complaint except that he recalled that it concerned ""inappropriate touching"". The report to Links House mentioned only oral sex by the perpetrator on the complainant and by the complainant on the perpetrator. The first interview at the police described fellatio and penile-vaginal intercourse, but not cunnilingus or masturbation. It was only on the fourth opportunity when she was able to talk to the authorities that she mentioned four different types of sexual activity, those which gave rise to the four counts in the indictment, and that on each occasion when she gave an account of what happened, she narrated the events in a different order.30 The applicant submits that the combination of these deficiencies and inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence makes that evidence so unreliable as a foundation for the prosecution case that, if the prosecution had been in possession of all the facts in May 2008, it was unreasonable to commence the prosecution on that basis.The law31 The applicable principles in costs applications have recently been summarised succinctly by Beazley JA in Mordaunt v DPP [2007] NSWCA 121, [36], the relevant parts of which are as follows: 
     
      
      36 The following principles can be extracted from the authorities dealing with applications for a s 2 certificate: 
       
        
         
        (a) The CCC Act is reforming legislation with a beneficial purpose designed to confer valuable privileges upon persons who succeed in criminal prosecutions; its provisions should not be narrowly construed so as to defeat the achievement of its general purposes:  
        Nadilo v Director of Public Prosecutions  
        (1995) 35 NSWLR 738 
         at 743 per Kirby P; see also  
        Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions 
          
        (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 
         (at 559-560) per Kirby P, Meagher JA, Handley JA; 
         
         
        (c) The “institution of proceedings” in s 3 refers to the time of arrest or charge not to some later stage such as committal for trial or the finding of a bill: (at 558); 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The applicant for a s 2 certificate bears the onus of showing it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings; it is not for the Crown to establish, nor for the Court to conclude, that the institution of the proceedings, was, or would have been in the relevant circumstances, reasonable:  
        Manley 
         (at [15]) per Wood CJ at CL;  
        R v Johnston 
          
        [2000] NSWCCA 197 
         (heard concurrently with  
        Manley 
        ) (at [17], [29]) per Simpson J (Wood CJ at CL agreeing); 
         
         
        (e) The task of the court dealing with an application under the CCC Act is to ask the hypothetical question, whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings: Allerton (at 559 – 560); the judicial officer considering an application must find what, within the Act, were “all the relevant facts” and assume the prosecution to have been “in possession of evidence of” all of them and must then determine whether, if the prosecution had been in possession of those facts before the proceedings were instituted, “it would not have been reasonable to institute [them]; an applicant for a certificate must succeed on both the “facts issue” and the “reasonableness issue”:

        Ramskogler  
        (at 134 – 135) per Kirby P; 
         
         
        (f) The hypothetical question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under s 3A of the CCC Act; all of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision-maker

         (at 559 – 560);  
        Manley 
         per Wood CJ at CL (at [9]); the relevant facts include those relevant to the offences charged and the threshold question posed by s 3(1)(a); other facts will also be relevant and admissible going, amongst other things, to the question posed by s 3(1)(b) and to the ultimate question whether, assuming that the court is of the opinion required to be specified, it should exercise its discretion under s 2:

        (1992) 65 A Crim R 160 
         (at 164 – 165) per Sheller J (with whom Mahoney JA and Hope AJA agreed); 
         
         
        (g) Courts should not attempt to prescribe an exhaustive test of what constitutes unreasonableness for the institution of the proceedings within the meaning of s 3(1)(a):  
        Fejsa v R

        (h) The reasonableness of a decision to institute proceedings is not based upon the test that prosecution agencies throughout Australia use as the discretionary test for continuing to prosecute, namely whether there is any reasonable prospect of conviction, nor is it governed by the test in  
        s 41(6) 
         of the  
        Justices Act 
         1902 
         [prior to its repeal] applied by magistrates, namely whether no reasonable jury would be likely to convict; the test cannot be a test of reasonable suspicion which might justify an arrest and it cannot be the test which determines whether the prosecution is malicious:

        ; 
        
       
       
        
        (i) The fact a prosecution may be launched where there is evidence to establish a prima facie case does not mean it is reasonable to launch a prosecution; there may be cases where there is contradictory evidence and where it is reasonable to expect a prosecutor to make some evaluation of that evidence:

        (k) The fact that a court concluded the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessarily indicative of unreasonableness:  
        R v Williams; ex parte Williams  
        [1970] 1 NSWR 81 
         (at 83) per Sugarman P (with whom O’Brien J agreed; cf Manning JA (at 85)); 
        
       
       
        
        (l) The fact that a court enters a judgment of acquittal in favour of an accused does not mean that it was not reasonable to have prosecuted; sometimes that course is followed rather than to order a new trial if (for example) the accused has already served most of the sentence imposed upon him or her

        (m)  
        Section 3 
         calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence, and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt, or inherent weakness in the prosecution case;  
        matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be Judge or Jury:  
        Manley 
         per Wood CJ at CL (at [14]);  
        Johnston 
         (at [26] [29]) per Simpson J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sully J agreed); it is not sufficient to establish the issue of unreasonableness in favour of an applicant for a certificate that, in the end, the question for the jury depended upon word against word; in a majority of such cases, it would be quite reasonable for the prosecution to allow those matters to be decided by the jury; 
         it would be different where the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit:

        (o) In considering an application for a certificate it is relevant to have regard both to the information in the possession of the prosecuting authorities, and the conduct of the defendant, bearing in mind the essentially adversarial nature of a criminal prosecution and the tactical decisions that are legitimately a part of the process: Manley per Simpson J (at [76]) (Wood CJ at CL agreeing); 
         
         
         (r) Before a certificate is granted, the judge must have formed an opinion specifying the matters in  
        s 3(1)(a) 
         and (b), and must also exercise the residual discretion, contemplated by  
        s 2 
        , to grant a certificate:

      37 In  
      Manley 
       (at [43]) Sully J referred with approval to Sugarman P’s statement in  
      Williams  
      (at 83) that “relevant facts” did not mean “‘all’ the relevant facts in any literal or absolute sense” and that “omniscience is not to be attributed to the prosecution in the hypothetical inquiry” and: 
       
        
        “ ‘All the relevant facts’ means, in my opinion, all the relevant facts as they finally emerge at the trial; the facts in the prosecution’s case but, as well, the facts in the accused’s case as these emerged from cross-examination of the prosecution’s witnesses or from evidence called by the accused. That seems to me the nature of the hypothetical inquiry which is called for by  
        s 3(1)(a). 
        ” 
        
       
       
      38 It appears to have been Sugarman P’s statement in  
      Williams 
       which prompted the insertion of s 3A into the CCC Act by the  
      Costs in Criminal Cases (Amendment) Act  
      1971: Second Reading Speech, New South Wales Legislative Council,  
      Parliamentary Debates 
       (Hansard) 4 May 1971 at 508; see also  
      Allerton 
       (at 559). It is important not to lose sight of the opportunity given by s 3A to both the defence and the prosecution to adduce evidence additional to that led in the proceedings. It has not been suggested that s 3A imposes a standard akin to “omniscience” on the Crown. The standard is one of reasonableness in commencing the proceedings (s 3(1)(a)) and reasonableness on the part of the defendant to the extent that any act or omission of that person contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings (s 3(1)(b)). 
      
    32 A further question, to which Beazley JA referred in Paragraph [36(m)] above, is whether it was reasonable for the prosecution to allow the case to go to the jury, which normally is the proper tribunal to determine issues of credibility. 33 Here, the applicant says that, even though, on the complainant's evidence a prima facie case against him might be made out, there were so many inconsistencies in her evidence, and between her evidence and other evidence, that it was unreasonable to institute proceedings against him solely on the basis of that evidence.34 In my opinion, the question of the credit of a single witness, on whose evidence the prosecution case depends, is a separate question from whether the prosecution should invariably accept what a complainant says in its entirety. In Manley, the Court indicated that questions of policy should not be considered. In the past, it is notorious that complainants in sexual assault cases were often not believed or given full credit for what they said. It is also notorious that there is considerable political pressure for greater participation by victims of alleged offences in the prosecution process. Notwithstanding what was said in Manley [2000] 49 NSWLR 203, it seems obvious that policies adopted by the Director of Public Prosecutions are relevant considerations in determining whether or not it is reasonable to institute, or continue, a prosecution. There is no evidence before me of any policy relating to complainants in cases of alleged sexual assault.35 It does not follow, however, that, notwithstanding the nature of any particular case, the prosecution is excused from its obligation in every case to exercise a professional discretion and to have full regard to all the evidence available, before making the decision whether or not to institute or continue prosecution. In this case, the fact that the prosecution case depended on the evidence of a single witness, the complainant, meant that the jury must receive a direction of the type described in Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, 19(E). That direction requires that the jury apply special scrutiny to the evidence of that single witness before accepting it as the basis for finding a verdict of ""guilty"". In this case also there was a significant delay between the alleged events and the institution of proceedings. That required that the judge would have to direct the jury as to the prejudice to the defendant in facing a complaint of some age, where it would be difficult to test the prosecution case or to produce evidence favourable to the defence: Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79.36 Even if these two warnings were not required, and the prosecution would necessarily have been aware that they were, there were still significant inconsistencies in the prosecution case. Some of those arose from the different versions of events given by the complainant at different times, in particular her failure to mention specific incidents of sexual assault in some of the accounts that she gave. There were also inconsistencies between her account and that given by her brother D. The police had not investigated in such a way as would eliminate a possibility that some other friend of a brother of the complainant might have been the perpetrator. Even in the absence of any evidence from the defence, it seems to me that the prosecution should have had serious doubts about the reliability of the complainant's evidence, not just limited to her identification of the alleged perpetrator, which was vital to its case, to the extent to which that evidence could convince any reasonable jury of essential elements of each of the charges beyond reasonable doubt.37 When further evidence emerged, in the form of the school enrolment records of the applicant, and the applicant's evidence, supported by that of his parents, that he rarely, if ever, stayed away from home overnight, the evidence was such that it must have raised a reasonable doubt in the mind of any reasonable jury, and that should have been apparent to the prosecution.38 In this case, I have formed the view that no conduct on the part of the applicant would have affected the reasonableness of the decision to institute proceedings at the time they were commenced.39 It is fundamentally important in our system of criminal justice, where the prosecution has a wide discretion whether or not to institute or continue proceedings, that the Director of Public Prosecutions exercises his discretion with appropriate professional rigour. It is important that people who claim to be victims of serious offences be treated with respect and not summarily disbelieved. However, the professional obligations of the prosecution mean that the accounts given by such people must be subjected to rigour, in order to determine whether it is reasonably possible that those accounts will satisfy a jury beyond reasonable doubt of the essential elements of the offences charged. 40 I am mindful that there is no clear universally applicable test of the reasonableness of instituting proceedings. However, in view of all the factors that I have considered, I conclude that it was not reasonable to institute proceedings against the applicant.41 In this case, I have formed the view that if the prosecution had been in possession of all the relevant facts at the time the applicant was charged with these offences, it would not have been reasonable for him to be charged with those offences.42 As a result of the commencement of the proceedings against him, the applicant has been the subject of these charges for over two years. He has endured emotional pressure and considerable expense which, on any reasonable view, were unnecessary. It is important to have proper regard to the rights of complainants, but this does not mean that the rights of suspected persons should be disregarded.43 I order, in these circumstances, that the applicant have a certificate pursuant to the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967, s 2.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Kenneth Noel White, was indicted for the murder of Paul Richards at Kingswood on 10 December 2007. His plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of the indictment. The plea was entered, and accepted, on the basis of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind: s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 At the time of the killing the offender was living in a home unit on the Great Western Highway at Kingswood. The deceased lived in a home unit nearby. He had friends who lived in the same block of units as the offender and he was a frequent visitor to that unit complex. It is likely that the offender had at least seen the deceased before the killing and, perhaps, had come into contact with him.  
     
      
    3 At about 7.00am on Monday, 10 December 2007, the offender and the deceased came into contact, with tragic consequences, in the basement of the garage area of the offender’s unit complex. There the offender stabbed the deceased a number of times, causing his death. The deceased made his way to the hallway outside a unit on the first residential level and called for help. The residents of that unit found him in the hallway, bleeding heavily and with a knife in his hand. Police and ambulance officers attended, but he died at the scene. 
     
      
    4 In the meantime, the offender had gone to a service station on the Great Western Highway not far from the units. He spoke to two shop attendants, asking for help and saying, “The guy’s coming after me, he has stabbed me, he is coming to get me.” He was observed to be covered in blood, from his face to his pants, and he was holding a bottle of beer and a set of keys. One of the attendants called emergency services. The offender said a number of other things to the operators before the police arrived. He said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          “I have been having problems with this guy for the last couple of weeks and he’s been pushing me around.” 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          “I’ve been stabbed.” “He stabbed me, he’s coming after me.” 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          [It happened] “in my garage” or “at my place.” “The guy came with a knife to my place.” 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          “Someone is trying to get me, he’s after me.” 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          “He reckons I’ve got his camera.” 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          “He’s been around my place for two or three weeks. He’s been bothering and troubling me. He comes and he pushes me.” 
         
        
       
      
    5 One of the attendants asked the offender if he had hit the other man back. The offender replied, “No, I was just trying to save myself. I was putting my hands over my body and he was continuously hitting me.” As he said this, he moved his hand up near the front of his face. 
     
      
    6 Police arrived at the service station at about 7.05am. Senior Constable Clancey spoke to the offender and recorded what he said to her. The offender gave a version to the effect that, after not sleeping for twenty-four hours and after drinking all night, he went that morning to his garage to get some food from the freezer. He was attacked in the garage and was punched in the mouth. His assailant came at him with a silver thing/a knife/a screwdriver, and stabbed him with it. He had to wrestle the man off, he got away and ran for his life.  
     
      
    7 He repeated this version over and over. He also said that he had seen the assailant a number of times previously, and he had been having trouble with him over the previous few weeks. He said that he knew that the man had been coming to the unit block to visit people at units 1 and 10, where he sold drugs. He said that every time he saw the man, he was “hassled” by him.  
     
      
    8 He said that when he was going down to the garage that morning, he saw the man at unit 1. The man followed him downstairs to the garage area and “started saying shit”, which he ignored. Then he was hit to the head and the man started pushing him around. All of a sudden he was cut by the man, and the next thing the man was on top of him and he was trying to get him off. He said, “He was trying to get me in the neck, it was a screwdriver or a knife, a flathead screwdriver, I am not quite sure, I just know I blanked out.” 
     
      
    9 The offender was treated by ambulance officers and taken to hospital. There he was treated for a 6.5cm wound to his left palm near the base of the thumb with 5 sutures, and for a 3cm wound to the front of the right thigh with 3 sutures. He had a swollen right cheek, with a fresh laceration and a fresh contusion on his left cheek. He had red marks on his left and right forearm and small scratches on his upper left and right hands.  
     
      
    10 At the hospital he repeated and added to his version of events a number of times. He added that the man had been following him for three weeks, and they had had an altercation at a Subway outlet three weeks previously. He said that he got a screwdriver mark on his leg and a cut to the hand. He said, “I blanked out for a lot of it, I can’t really remember what happened till down the servo and I nearly passed out.” In a further version, he said that he thought that the man was gay and was trying to rape him. He also said that the man had previously said that he was going to “punch me out”, and the next time he was going to kill him. 
     
      
    11 He told hospital staff that he suffered from schizophrenia, that he was prescribed 20mgs of “diprexa” per day, but that he had not been taking as much and had been medicating himself. 
     
      
    12 Testing was conducted on the blood found on the offender’s shirt and shoes, together with a swab of the blood on his head and of blood found on the handle of the knife held by the deceased. The DNA profile of all four items was consistent with that of the deceased. Fingerprint testing on the knife was unsuccessful.  
     
      
    13 On post-mortem examination, it was determined that the cause of death was a stab wound which penetrated the chest. Coronary artery atherosclerosis was detected, a condition possibly contributing to the death. There were multiple stab wounds to the body of the deceased, seven to the chest and abdominal areas and two to the back. The fatal wound to the chest had penetrated the right pleural cavity and extended to the right ventricle of the heart. The wound displayed evidence of repeated insertions within the same entry point, showing that the knife was inserted, withdrawn and inserted again on a number of occasions. 
     
      
    14 On searching the offender’s unit, police found and seized multiple knives of various types, along with a number of swords and axes. One resident of the unit block told police that he had seen the offender in possession of a knife in a leather pouch, attached to a belt, about two weeks prior to the incident. 
     
      
       
      Victim impact statement 
       
      
    15 I received a victim impact statement by the sister of the deceased, Ms Linda–Joye Lord. Ms Lord read the statement in court during the sentence proceedings, which cannot have been an easy task. It discloses that it was she who had to identify her brother’s body. The statement is an eloquent expression of her outrage and grief, and of the enduring effects of this tragedy upon her immediate and extended family, including the deceased’s daughter and step-daughter.  
     
      
    16 Sentencing the perpetrator of this crime is a complex task, involving the balance of competing considerations. I am well aware that no sentence I pass can cure the pain of those who have suffered such a loss. I can but hope that the completion of these sentence proceedings will make some contribution, however small, to their coming to terms with it. The members of Mr Richards’ family, and all those affected by his tragic and untimely death, have my deepest sympathy. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    17 The offender was 21 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 23. He has no criminal history. He has been in custody since his arrest on the day of the offence, 10 December 2007.  
     
      
    18 He was brought up in the Penrith area. He has three brothers, and one of his older brothers, James White, provided a statement to the police. His background is sketched in that statement, together with the reports of two forensic psychiatrists, Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Olav Nielssen. It seems that James White and his wife have maintained contact with the offender while in custody and remain supportive of him.  
     
      
    19 His parents separated when he was 9 or 10 years old. When he was about 11 or 12, he was diagnosed with ADD and put on a course of medication. Because of his condition, he was taken out of a regional high school early in his period of secondary education and placed in a special school at Penrith.  
     
      
    20 In Year 9, when he was 14 years old, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and placed on a different regime of medication. He left school at the end of that year. His brother observed that he interacted well with people when he took his medication but, if he did not take it, he became “very withdrawn and not real good with social interaction”. Generally, his brother described him as a “real homebody”, who pursued hobbies and watched television. He did not develop a circle of friends and, while he was attracted to women, he never had an intimate relationship. He had long been on a disability pension, and has never worked. 
     
      
    21 According to his brother, he became accustomed to his course of medication and, generally, took it as required. He sometimes had verbal arguments with members of the family but was never violent. However, he used cannabis and began to drink heavily from the age of 18. His brother noted that the alcohol “didn’t mix well with his medication and medical condition”. 
     
      
    22 There was an incident in March 2007 which, it seems, occurred because he had not been taking his medication and had been drinking. As his brother put it, he “smashed the house up and punched the walls” after an argument with his mother and a younger brother. This led to his admission to the psychiatric ward at Penrith Hospital, where he was observed to be remorseful about his behaviour. He was discharged the following day. 
     
      
    23 He moved in with his brother, James and his family at Cambridge Park for some months. His brother said that there were “no problems” during that period, and that he was controlling his drinking. His brother observed that he generally stayed in the flat and watched television, and did not have any visitors. He moved out in August 2007 and stayed in a group home at Werrington for some weeks, before moving to the flat at Kingswood. There he lived alone.  
     
      
    24 James and his family maintained contact with him. He told his brother that he had “a few conflicts” with people in the unit block, and he complained that there were “a heap of junkies that lived around him that yelled and screamed at all hours of the day”. He also said that people “hung around in the car parks and streets around his unit and just yelled stuff out to him”, but he did not “mention anything specific”.  
     
      
    25 For some unknown reason, a resident of the unit next to his had mounted a surveillance camera which focused on his front door. There appears to be nothing to suggest that he was the target of surveillance. Nevertheless, towards the end of November 2007 his brother visited him and noticed that the camera had been removed, leaving a trailing wire. The offender said that he did not know where it had gone, but his brother noted that he had “a bit of a smirk on his face” and suspected that he had removed it.  
     
      
    26 James White said that the offender kept machetes, swords and knives in his unit. He mentioned specifically “medieval axes and a heap of pocket knives”. He said that the offender did not take these out anywhere, and the effect of his statement is that he was a collector of items of this kind. The offender told Dr Allnutt and Dr Nielssen that they were a hobby and were merely “ornamental”. 
     
      
    27 Generally, James observed that he continued to use cannabis and drink. At the conclusion of his statement he described the offender in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        I don’t think Kenneth is a violent person. He is pretty quiet and keeps to himself. … 
        
       
       
        
        Kenneth is a bit of a coward. If someone raised their fist at him, he would more than likely back down. He is more likely to yell at someone than get physical with them. I have never seen him in a fight, so I don’t know if he would fight back or not during a physical altercation. 
        
       
       
      Psychiatric evidence 
       
      
    28 Both Dr Allnutt, engaged by the Crown, and Dr Nielssen, engaged for the defence, interviewed the offender in the later part of last year and Dr Nielssen saw him again in June of this year. I have four reports of Dr Allnutt and three of Dr Nielssen, and it is apparent that both of them have given the case careful consideration. In the event, there is substantial agreement between them and it is unnecessary to examine their reports in detail. 
     
      
    29 When interviewed by the two doctors last year, the offender gave each of them an account of the killing which was not entirely consistent and which did not adopt all of what he had told police on the day of the offence. To both doctors he denied having met the deceased before. He told Dr Allnutt that the deceased had approached him with a knife, that he thought he was going to die, that he wrestled the knife off the deceased, and that he himself was stabbed before he left the scene.  
     
      
    30 He told Dr Nielssen that the deceased had come into the garage and punched him without any provocation on his part, that the deceased was holding a knife, and that he thought he was a “junkie” who was trying to “roll” him. He added that after the deceased hit him he was not sure what happened, but that he must have taken the knife from him and stabbed him. It will be noted that he told both psychiatrists that it was the deceased who initially had the knife. To Dr Nielssen he denied owning the knife and said that he had never previously carried a knife, although he kept one in his fishing tackle box.  
     
      
    31 He gave both psychiatrists an account, to which I have referred in reciting the agreed facts, that he had been drinking through the night preceding the killing and had not slept. That account is consistent with evidence not only that he was holding a bottle of beer when he went to the service station after the killing, but also that police who attended his unit found a large number of empty beer bottles at different locations within it. Moreover, he told Dr Allnutt that he had not been in contact with mental health workers around that time, and he told Dr Nielssen that he had been off his medication for “a few months”. This is borne out by Medicare records of his supply of medication.  
     
      
    32 The experiences he described to his brother after his move to the flat at Kingswood point to the consequent deterioration of his condition. In that regard, I accept that it was he who removed the surveillance camera. No doubt, his condition also explains his being seen in possession of a knife a couple of weeks before the offence. These matters are indicative of what Dr Nielssen described as the development of a “paranoid belief that he was under threat …” The doctor also saw this as the reason for the collection of weapons found in his flat, but it may be that they were merely the pursuit of a hobby and had no aggressive or protective purpose.  
     
      
    33 Both doctors confirmed the diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Dr Nielssen also diagnosed substance abuse disorder. When interviewed by both of them last year, the offender denied any psychotic symptoms at the time of the killing. However, both doctors considered that the various accounts of his actions which he gave on that day were the product of delusional beliefs. Dr Nielssen noted that it was “not uncommon for people with chronic schizophrenic illnesses accused of serious offences to adhere doggedly to implausible explanations of events …” However, when he saw the offender again in June of this year, he found him to be “a little more open to the likelihood that he may have been irrationally suspicious and affected by symptoms in the period leading up to the offence”. 
     
      
    34 Both doctors concluded that the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind was available. In a report of 24 April 2009, Dr Allnutt expressed the view that, due to “underlying propensity to irrational thinking” the offender might have been more prone to misinterpreting events and less concerned about whether his reactions were right or wrong. In a report of 7 May 2009, he expressed the conclusion that the offender was suffering “symptoms of a mental illness at the relevant time”, and he favoured “the likelihood that the information he provided to police and other witnesses in the material time following the alleged offence related to thought processes that he was experiencing at the time …” 
     
      
    35 In a report of 6 May 2009, Dr Nielssen expressed his conclusion in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        During the acute phase of the illness schizophrenia can give rise to an abnormality of mind that can have a significant impact on a person’s perception of events, their capacity to judge right from wrong and their ability to control their actions. It is more probable than not that at the time of the offence Mr White was affected by persecutory beliefs that increased his perception of threat. The pattern of behaviour observed during his earlier acute episode suggests that he was also probably affected by irrational hostility that led to significant impairment in his capacity to judge right from wrong and to exercise self control. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr White’s consumption of alcohol would not exclude the defence of substantial impairment because of the severity of his underlying mental illness and the exaggerated effect of alcohol on a person in an acute episode of schizophrenia. 
        
       
      
    36 In their final reports, the two doctors considered whether the offender might pose a danger to the community upon his eventual release. Dr Allnutt considered static and dynamic risk factors, and thought that he “probably falls into a group of individuals who are at moderate risk of future recidivism”. He went on to say that he needed to undertake a number of “rehabilitation tasks”, which he specified as follows: 
     
      
       
        ongoing consultation with a psychiatrist, with anti-psychotic medication; 
       
       
        “psychoeducation”; 
       
       
        referral for drug and alcohol rehabilitation and abstention from alcohol; 
       
       
        vocational assistance; and 
       
       
        social skills training. 
       
      
    37 Of course, the offender has been under treatment for his condition while in custody and has maintained a course of medication. He told Dr Nielssen that he understood the need for long-term treatment, and said that he was “willing to accept medication given by long acting injection after his eventual release”. He also expressed a determination to stay away from drugs and alcohol. Dr Nielssen noted that his acute symptoms were controlled through consistent treatment with anti-psychotic medication, and considered that he had predominantly “negative” symptoms, being “impairment in motivation, organisation, spontaneity and capacity for abstract thinking”. 
     
      
    38 As for the future, Dr Nielssen had this to say: 
     
      
       
        
        With regards the risk of further offences, Mr White has mainly negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which are associated with a lower risk of serious violence. Moreover, he does not express any objection to treatment, including treatment by long acting injection. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr White also has the strong support of his brother and sister-in-law, who have provided him with accommodation and helped him to obtain a Housing Department flat. His family seem likely to provide him with support after his release. 
        
       
       
        
        He gave a spontaneous account of no longer needing to drink or abuse drugs, which is the main risk factor for further violence in patients with established schizophrenic illnesses. He seems to interpret advice in a literal way, which could translate to literal adherence to any parole conditions, such as the advice that he abstain from drinking and taking any kind of illicit drug. 
        
       
       
        
        Ideally, people with severe forms of schizophrenia who are charged with serious violent offences should be returned to the community via the secure hospital system and have their care monitored by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. However, there is no reliable mechanism to arrange this, especially for a person who is stable in custody, and it will probably be left to a parole officer to check on adherence to treatment and other conditions. Hence I recommend a relatively long period of parole. 
        
       
       
      Sentencing 
       
      
    39 What exactly were the circumstances of this tragic incident I cannot say. Clearly, there was some kind of altercation and a struggle between the two men. The offender’s own injuries are testament to this. I think it likely that the knife which caused the fatal wounds was the offender’s, although I cannot be certain of that either. Assuming that the knife found in the hand of the deceased was the weapon which caused his death, the fact that he had it does not necessarily mean that it was he who produced it. It could be that the offender had left it in his body when he departed, and the deceased had managed to remove it as he made his way to the first level of the units to seek help. 
     
      
    40 I find it unnecessary to resolve this question. Whatever might have been the provenance of the knife, the offender’s attack upon the deceased displayed a high level of violence and this is a serious offence of its kind. Given the post-mortem findings, particularly the manner in which the fatal wound was inflicted, I am satisfied that he intended to kill the deceased. Mr Young SC, who appeared for him, did not submit the contrary. On the other hand, the attack was perpetrated by a man with no criminal record and no history of personal violence. It can be explained only by a considerable level of mental impairment arising from his psychiatric illness. 
     
      
    41 The Crown prosecutor questioned the degree of impairment, in the light of transcripts of some intercepted telephone calls made or received by the offender in custody early last year. Most of the conversations were with his brother, James but two were with another man. Put shortly, during these conversations the offender discussed his defence to the charge of murder which he then faced in an apparently rational way. He said that his case would be that the deceased attacked him, armed with a knife, that he feared for his life, that he managed to wrest the knife from the deceased and that he stabbed him in self defence.  
     
      
    42 However, these conversations were at a time when he had been stabilised on medication and, no doubt, he was in the process of formulating what Mr Young described as “a legally acceptable explanation” for his actions. In any event, what he said to police and other witnesses on the day of the killing amounted, for the most part, to an assertion of self defence. His state of mind is far better gleaned from what he said at that time and, in the light of the psychiatric evidence, that material supports the conclusion that his functioning was seriously disordered.  
     
      
    43 Nevertheless, in determining the extent of the leniency which this might earn him, it is necessary to consider whether he should have been aware of the possible effect upon his behaviour of drinking and neglecting his medication. On that question the Crown prosecutor properly raised the destructive incident in March 2007 to which I have referred, which appears to have been the product of the same two factors. However, while that incident was no doubt alarming for the members of the family in the house at the time, it did not involve personal violence. As I have said, there is no evidence of any violence in his background, let alone violence of the order which he meted out to the unfortunate deceased. It cannot fairly be said that he should have foreseen behaviour of this kind if he went off his medication and drank to excess.  
     
      
    44 That said, given that it was those factors that led to this killing, there remains the question of the extent to which the protection of society must play a part in the sentence which I pass. On the psychiatric evidence, this turns very much upon whether he could be trusted to maintain a course of treatment and abstain from alcohol and illicit drugs upon his release. The reports, particularly that of Dr Nielssen, leave me with some confidence that he would, although it would be important that he have the benefit of an extended period of liberty under supervision and the sanction of parole and that he continue to enjoy the support of his brother and sister-in-law. 
     
      
    45 Accordingly, the level of the offender’s impairment calls for an appropriate measure of leniency. He has the benefit of his unblemished criminal history, and I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable. There is no evidence that he has expressed remorse for his crime, and that is not a matter which Mr Young raised on his behalf. The two psychiatrists took time to assess his case, and he pleaded guilty to manslaughter promptly after they furnished reports supporting the partial defence of substantial impairment. I shall recognise the utilitarian value of that plea by a 15% reduction of the sentence which would otherwise have been appropriate. I am satisfied that the process of achieving the offender’s rehabilitation calls for a finding of special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
    46 But for the plea of guilty, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 12 years. A 15% reduction for the plea produces a term, in round figures, of 10 years. I shall fix a non-parole period of 6 years.  
     
      
    47 Kenneth Noel White, for the manslaughter of Paul Richards you are sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing on 10 December 2007 and expiring on 9 December 2013, and a balance of term of 4 years, commencing on 10 December 2013 and expiring on 9 December 2017.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 31 July 2008 the accused was found by Johnson J to be unfit to be tried for the offences of the murder of Jasmine Bell (""the deceased"") on 30 July 2007 and of attempting to wound Andrew O'Grady with intent to murder on the same day: see R v Grant [2008] NSWSC 784. On 17 August 2009 the accused came before me upon a special hearing pursuant to s 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act""). Sections 19 and 21 of the Act provide relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        19 Court to hold special hearing after advice received from Director of Public Prosecutions 
          
         
         
        (1) If the Court receives a notification of a determination from the Tribunal under section 16 (3), 45 (3) or 47 (5) that a person will not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for an offence, the Court:  
         
          
           
          (a) is to obtain the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether further proceedings will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the offence, and  
           
           
          (b) is to conduct a special hearing as soon as practicable unless the Director of Public Prosecutions advises that no further proceedings will be taken.  
          
         
         
        (2) A special hearing is a hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.  
         
        
       
       
        
         
        21 Nature and conduct of special hearing  
         
         
        (1) Except as provided by this Act, a special hearing is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings.  
         
         
        (2) At a special hearing, the accused person must, unless the Court otherwise allows, be represented by an Australian legal practitioner and the fact that the person has been found unfit to be tried for an offence is to be presumed not to be an impediment to the person's representation.  
         
         
        (3) At a special hearing:  
         
          
           
          (a) the accused person is to be taken to have pleaded not guilty in respect of the offence charged, and  
           
           
          (b) the Australian legal practitioner, if any, who represents the accused person may exercise the rights of the person to challenge jurors or the jury, and  
           
           
          (c) without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the accused person may raise any defence that could be properly raised if the special hearing were an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings, and  
           
           
          (d) without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the accused person is entitled to give evidence.""  
          
         
        
       
      
    2 The procedures for a special hearing were considered in R v Zvonaric [2001] NSWCCA 505; (2001) 54 NSWLR. A special hearing should be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial, including a formal arraignment and the proper reception of evidence: s 21(1) of the Act. Although the practice is not to be encouraged, the tendering of statements that are not read aloud during a special hearing does not infringe the section. A trial judge should expose his or her reasons for the findings that are made in respect of the elements of the offence. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    3 The facts are sufficiently recorded in the reasons for judgment of Johnson J and are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[11] It is the Crown case that, in May 2007, the deceased, Jasmine Bell, and her partner, Andrew O'Grady, moved into a guesthouse in Harris Street, Fairfield. Also living in the guesthouse was the Accused.  
         
         
        [12] At around 11.30 am on 30 July 2007, Mr O'Grady woke to a knock at the door of their room. He sat up and saw Ms Bell (who was pregnant) standing in the doorway and the Accused trying to push his way into the room. He heard the deceased say  
        ""Go away Andrew is asleep"" 
        . Mr O'Grady then said  
        ""What are you doing, get the fuck out"" 
         to which the Accused replied  
        ""What cunt?"" 
        .  
         
         
        [13] The Accused then produced a knife and moved further inside the room. The knife was approximately 27 centimetres long with a single flat blade. The deceased saw the knife and screamed and tried to move backwards into the room. The Accused said to Mr O'Grady  
        ""Say sorry cunt"" 
        , to which he replied  
        ""Sorry"" 
        . The Accused then said  
        ""What are you sorry for, what are you sorry for?"" 
         and Mr O'Grady replied  
        ""I'm sorry for being rude"" 
        . At this stage, the Accused was holding the knife out towards both the deceased and Mr O'Grady. The deceased then tried to get around the Accused to get out of the room. As she did this, the Accused lunged forward and stabbed the deceased in the chest. The Accused then swung the knife towards Mr O'Grady who moved backwards to avoid being stabbed. The Accused again made a stabbing motion towards Mr O'Grady's stomach. Mr O'Grady then grabbed the knife and both men struggled over the knife until the blade snapped off in Mr O'Grady's hands. Mr O'Grady then chased the Accused outside the room with the knife blade.  
         
         
        [14] Once outside, Mr O'Grady saw the deceased lying on the ground not far from the front door of their room. The Accused ran passed [sic] the deceased, out the front yard and jumped the gate running up Harris Street towards Fairfield Railway Station. Emergency assistance was sought for the deceased. However, the treatment was to no avail and she was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. The deceased died from a stab wound to the chest which pierced her lung and then entered the aorta and pulmonary artery. Mr O'Grady suffered five superficial cuts to his left hand. In addition, he suffered a superficial puncture wound to the left side of the upper chest.  
         
         
        [15] At about 12.30 pm on 30 July 2007, the Accused presented himself to Fairfield Police Shop Front and was conveyed to Cabramatta Police Station where he participated in an ERISP in the presence of his uncle. It is fair to observe that the ERISP, which formed part of the evidence at the present inquiry, revealed a significant level of thought disorder in the Accused shortly after the offences."" 
        
       
      
    4 These facts were not in contest before me. There was no dispute about the evidence from which they were derived, all of which was tendered without objection. The evidence clearly established the facts from which the present charges emerge and was substantially to the following effect. 
     
      
    5 Mr O'Grady said that he and the deceased moved into the guesthouse in May 2007. A short time after that they met the accused who would occasionally ask Mr O'Grady for a cigarette. On occasions the accused would come to their room and knock on the door for that purpose. Mr O'Grady said that when the accused talked to him he often did not make sense. Mr O'Grady said that he would talk about many different things and it was difficult to understand what he was talking about. He gave evidence in a statement that contains the same details of what occurred referred to earlier. 
     
      
    6 Mr O'Grady later took part in a photographic identification procedure at the police station. He was able without difficulty to identify the accused as the person who had entered his room and stabbed the deceased. 
     
      
    7 Mr Majok was also a resident of the guesthouse. At about 11.45am on 30 July 2007 he was sitting in his car outside the guesthouse when he heard a woman and a man screaming. The sound was coming from the room of the deceased and Mr O'Grady. The next thing that occurred was that Mr Majok saw the deceased coming out of the front door of the house bent over holding her stomach with blood all over her hand. She fell down on the front lawn of the house near the mailboxes. 
     
      
    8 Mr Majok then saw the accused running out of the front door. He jumped over the fence and ran down the street and out of sight. Mr Majok was able to give a description of the clothes that the accused was wearing. He then saw Mr O'Grady emerge from the house holding a knife and start to chase the accused. Mr O'Grady gave up the chase and threw the knife to the ground. He saw that the knife was a kitchen knife with a broken handle. He said that Mr O'Grady described to him what happened. The description was consistent with the later version given to the police by Mr O'Grady. 
     
      
    9 Mr Majok also later took part in a photographic identification procedure at the police station and identified the accused as the person he had seen at the time of these events. 
     
      
    10 Mark Jackson was also a witness to these events and gave an account of what he saw and heard that was consistent with the evidence of other witnesses. 
     
      
    11 Alan Tranter also lived at the guesthouse. He said that he had seen the deceased and Mr O'Grady in the company of the accused on about half a dozen occasions before the incident on 30 July 2007. He had seen them all leaving the house together and walking along Harris Street. He formed the view that there may have been some connection or friendship among them. Mr Tranter said that he regarded the accused as a bit strange and he formed the opinion that he was ""a bit weird'. The accused used to say odd things to him occasionally. Mr Tranter was also a witness to some of the events that took place outside the guesthouse that were described by Mr Majok and Mr Jackson. 
     
      
    12 Patricia Kelly gave a statement to police about the accused. The accused is Mrs Kelly's grandson. She described his early life and troubled and difficult background. His parents separated when the accused was about 11. He originally stayed with his mother but later moved to live with his father. However, when he was about 15 the accused's father asked Mrs Kelly if the accused could come to live with her. That is what happened. She described how the accused subsequently ""went down hill"". He became untidy in his appearance and would tell her stories that made no sense. He was eventually taken to Liverpool Hospital following a noisy domestic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was placed on medication. She became aware that there were times when the accused was sleeping on the streets and was not taking medication as prescribed. The accused told her that there were also times when he would spend the night riding on trains. He occasionally stayed with her overnight. 
     
      
    13 Shortly before he was arrested Mrs Kelly said that she had become very concerned about the accused's behaviour. She said that she could tell that he was not medicated. On one occasion he stood on her porch and started yelling at a man in the street for no apparent reason. On the Monday prior to his arrest he turned up at her house unannounced. His behaviour was odd and Mrs Kelly said that she could tell he was not right. 
     
      
    14 Expert forensic medical evidence confirmed that the deceased died of the effects of a knife wound to the chest that penetrated the aorta and entered the pulmonary artery through the left pleural cavity. The depth of the wound was approximately 8.5 cm from the skin surface of the left anterior chest to the vertebrae. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    15 I am satisfied on the limited evidence available that the deceased died as the result of injuries she sustained following an attack upon her with a knife by the accused. I am also satisfied on the limited evidence available that Mr O'Grady sustained injuries at the same time that were caused when the accused attacked him with a knife. I am therefore satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the deliberate acts of the accused that caused the death of the deceased and the injuries to Mr O'Grady. 
     
      
    16 However, I am not satisfied on the limited evidence available that the acts causing the death of the deceased or the injuries to Mr O'Grady were done with an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her or with reckless indifference to human life, or in an attempt to wound Mr O'Grady with intent to murder him. My reasons for forming this view are set out below. 
     
      
    Defence of mental illness 
     
      
    17 It is uncontroversial that every man and woman is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his or her crimes until the contrary is proven. In order to establish a defence on the ground of mental illness it must be clearly proved that, at the time of committing the act the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong: R v M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718.  
     
      
    18 In cases involving a jury the jury would not be required to consider the defence of mental illness until it were satisfied that the offence had been proved beyond reasonable doubt: R v Stiles (1990) 50 A Crim R 13. I also observe that in considering whether an accused person committed the offence(s) charged, a jury would be instructed to ignore the question of mental illness when determining whether the accused had the intent charged, relying upon the presumption of sanity. In this way they may acquit on the defence of mental illness if they find that the accused did not have the necessary intention as a result of the defect of reason. If there were evidence of mental illness, a jury would not consider the question of intention or voluntariness separate and distinct from the issue of mental illness. 
     
      
    19 A ""disease of the mind"" is any disease capable of affecting the mind, whether it has a mental or physical origin and whether or not the defect of reason is temporary or permanent: R v Kemp [1957] 1 QB 399. Whether the condition amounts to a disease of the mind is a question of law: R v Falconer [1990] HCA 49; (1990) 171 CLR 30 at 60. A ""defect of reason"" is the inability of the accused to think rationally: R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1936) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190; Sodeman v The King [1936] HCA 75; (1936) 55 CLR 192 at 367. 
     
      
    20 A person does not know the nature and quality of his (or her) act if he does not know the physical nature of what he is doing or the implications of it. A person does not know what he was doing was wrong when he does not know that it was wrong according to ordinary standards of right or wrong adopted by reasonable persons (see Stapleton v The Queen [1952] HCA 56; (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367), or where the accused cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing: Sodeman v The King (supra) at 215; R v Pangallo (1989) 51 SASR 254. 
     
      
    21 Medical evidence is not essential to prove insanity: Lucas v The Queen [1970] HCA 14; (1970) 120 CLR 171. The tribunal of fact cannot reject unanimous medical evidence unless there is evidence that can cast doubt upon it, but such evidence may be found in the behaviour of the accused. The tribunal of fact may decide between competing medical evidence. Medical witnesses may give evidence of their opinion as to whether the accused could appreciate the nature and quality of his acts or, if he could, whether he knew it was wrong: Thomas v The Queen [1960] HCA 2; (1960) 102 CLR 584. 
     
      
    22 The accused was born in 1979 and was therefore 28 years of age on 30 July 2007 when the events that give rise to the present charges occurred. The psychiatric medical history of the accused is long and significant. Its aetiology predates these events and must be considered in some detail. The medical opinions expressed concerning the accused and his mental condition are also unanimous. They are referred to in what follows. 
     
      
    Dr Nielssen 
     
      
    23 Dr Olav Nielssen is a psychiatrist. In his report dated 27 November 2007 he expressed the following opinion after examining the accused on 28 September 2007: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Grant was assessed to have a severe and disabling form of the chronic mental illness schizophrenia. The diagnosis was made on the basis of his account of typical symptoms of the illness and a pattern of treatment consistent with longstanding mental illness, and the gross disorganisation of thinking and the persecutory beliefs that were evident during the interview. 
         
         
        At the time of the offence Mr Grant was thought to have experienced an acute exacerbation of the illness as a result of having stopped antipsychotic medication about three months earlier. Although the history of recent substance abuse was unclear, recent use of cannabis may also have contributed to the exacerbation of illness. 
         
         
        The diagnosis of substance abuse disorder is based on Mr Grant's account of previous abuse of cannabis and amphetamine and the complications of that abuse, which most certainly include a contribution to the unstable nature of Mr Grant's mental illness and his previous homelessness and criminal charges. The disorder was described as being in remission because he reported having largely given up drugs several years before the offence. 
         
         
        I was unable to elicit a reliable history of the events that led to the offence. However it was quite evident that Mr Grant was acutely mentally ill and I believe he was mentally ill at the time of the offence. He has a severe form of the chronic mental illness schizophrenia, which is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. His illness gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of persecutory beliefs about Ms Bell and her partner. His beliefs that he was being poisoned and the misidentification of Ms Bell as being present [at] other situations in which he believed he was in danger are delusional beliefs that are associated with serious violence by patients with mental illness. 
         
         
        I believe on the balance of probabilities Mr Grant would have the defence of mental illness open to him, as at the time of the offence he was deprived on [sic] his capacity to understand that his actions were wrong because of the faulty logic arising from his delusional beliefs. He was unable to reason with any sense of composure about the consequences of his actions because of the gross disorganisation of his thinking and impaired emotional regulation associated with acute psychotic illness. 
         
         
        Mr Grant's communication was so disorganised at the time of the recent assessment that I believe he would be unable to follow any proceedings in a meaningful way or give reliable instructions. However, he has only recently resumed treatment with antipsychotic medication after a long period without medication and he may eventually respond to treatment to the extent that he will become fit for trial. I would be happy to review Mr Grant again after a period of consistent treatment and also to review any medical records of his treatment in the community and since his arrest."" 
        
       
      
    24 Dr Nielssen examined the accused again on 7 December 2007 and provided a further report dated 22 January 2008. His further opinion was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The history elicited and the observations made during the second interview confirms my opinion that Mr Grant has a chronic schizophrenic illness. His illness is relatively treatment resistant in the sense that he has persisting delusional beliefs despite four months treatment with high doses of antipsychotic medication. The further history elicited supports the opinion that Mr Grant has the defence of mental illness available to him. 
         
         
        As of 7 December 2007 Mr Grant was assessed to be fit to enter a plea and fit for trial. He was more coherent in his communication, demonstrated a reasonable understanding of the nature of the proceedings and was assessed to be able to follow the proceedings in a general sense and give reliable instructions to his legal representatives. In particular, he recognised that he had a mental illness, even if he was unable to recognise the symptoms of his illness, and did not object to his illness being raised in his defence. 
         
         
        He should remain fit for trial provided he continue[s] to receive treatment with an adequate dose of antipsychotic medication in the period leading up to the trial."" 
        
       
      
    25 The accused was further examined by Dr Nielssen on 17 April 2008 and expressed the following opinion in his report dated 29 April 2008: 
     
      
       
        
        ""After the most recent interview I am now of the opinion that Mr Grant is unfit to plead and is unfit for trial. His mental state has not continued to improve and if anything is worse than it was at the time of the interview in November. He expressed fixed delusional beliefs about the victim and the events surrounding the offence and appeared to be distracted by active auditory hallucinations during the interview. He initially said that he was willing to enter a plea of not guilty due to mental illness, but was unable to say how he was mentally ill and later contradicted himself by saying that he wanted to plead guilty to get a fixed term. 
         
         
        Hence I now believe Mr Grant is unfit for trial, as his interpretation of events is likely to be affected by ongoing auditory hallucinations and fixed and evolving delusional beliefs, and he would be unable to give reliable instructions while affected by acute symptoms of treatment resistant schizophrenia. 
         
         
        Mr Grant may become fit for trial within twelve months if he responds to treatment with the atypical antipsychotic medication clozapine. About thirty percent of treatment resistant patients have a significant response to clozapine treatment and Mr Grant should be referred to the psychiatric ward of Long Bay Hospital for a trial of this treatment."" 
        
       
      
    Dr Roberts 
     
      
    26 Dr Samson Roberts is a consultant forensic psychiatrist who examined the accused on 5 June 2008 with a view to assessing his fitness to plead at that time. His opinion, set out in his report dated 16 June 2008, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Grant is a 29 year-old man who provides an unclear account of himself so affected by delusional content that it is not possible to determine with certainty which aspect of his account is reflective of reality. It is evident that Mr Grant has a history of psychiatric illness which has led to hospitalisations in the past. Based on his account, his treatment has been characterised by a need for involuntary treatment both in hospital and in the community. His psychiatric condition has been compromised by non-compliance with medication and illicit substance use. During his incarceration he has been under the care of psychiatric services. 
         
         
        Despite being in receipt of supervised psychiatric treatment, Mr Grant continues to exhibit symptoms of his illness. If his account of the pharmacological treatment prescribed for him is an accurate reflection of fact, his condition is being treated aggressively. Based on the contents of Dr Nielssen's reports, it is apparent that despite a protracted period of supervised treatment, Mr Grant's symptoms have not improved over time. 
         
         
        In considering Mr Grant's fitness to stand trial, it is apparent that he has an understanding, albeit imperfect, of those issues outlined in Presser. The nature and severity of his illness however is such that delusional material continues to intrude upon his understanding of issues relating to the offences for which he is before the Court. Additionally, his conduct as demonstrated by the self-inflicted burn aimed at removing a tattoo, indicates that his psychiatric condition continues to impact upon his day to day life. It is therefore expected that his psychiatric illness will adversely impact upon his ability to follow Court proceedings and will intrude upon instructions given to his solicitor. Although he expresses a superficial understanding of the plea of Not Guilty by reason of mental illness and has expressed a desire to enter such a plea, he stated the perception that he will receive a fixed term of incarceration indicating limited understanding of the ramifications of such a plea. 
         
         
        In conclusion, it is my opinion that in the absence of improvement in Mr Grant's mental state, he will remain unfit to enter a plea and unfit to stand trial. 
         
         
        I concur with Dr Olav Nielssen's opinion with respect to the recommendation that a trial of Clozapine be instituted. Given the lengthy period that Mr Grant has remained unwell despite consistent treatment, it is expected that in the absence of a response to Clozapine, he will remain unwell for the foreseeable future and therefore is expected to be unfit to stand trial for in excess of a further twelve months."" 
        
       
      
    27 Dr Roberts' report dated 27 May 2009 was to a like effect. He examined the accused on 15 May 2009 and reported his conclusions relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Based on the account provided by Mr Grant, it is considered that he would have available to him a defence of Mental Illness. Mr Grant gives an account of his belief that he was under the control of his uncle at the time of the commission of the offences. He acknowledges that he was intoxicated with alcohol and cannabis at the time. He stated that he was unaware that the conduct in which he was engaged had the potential to either kill someone or even injure someone. On this basis, it is my opinion that Mr Grant was so affected by his psychotic illness and the compounding effects of substances at the time of his commission of the offence, that he was entirely without understanding with respect to the nature of his conduct or the potential consequences of his conduct. It is evident that his ability to reason at the time of his commission of the offence was grossly impaired by virtue of the effects of his psychiatric condition."" 
        
       
      
    Dr Wilcox 
     
      
    28 Dr Rosalie Wilcox is a general and forensic psychiatrist. She gave evidence before me that she has treated the accused since 2000. She has had occasion since he was taken into custody to examine him approximately on a weekly basis. She gave the following further evidence-in-chief: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Now, doctor, given your long history with this accused, what are able to say about his condition?  
         
        A. Mr Grant has unfortunately slowly deteriorated as far as his mental state. He has what we would classify as treatment resistant schizophrenia. His illness has responded quite poorly to traditional medication. And for this reason, he is now on a very high dose of the novel anti-psychotic drug known as clozapine, which is only used in cases where people have failed to respond to all other medications. He is now on a dose of 850 milligrams, which is considered to be quite high, but so far there has been minimal change in his mental state. 
         
         
          
          
         ********* 
         
         
        Q. And, doctor, how would you assess him at the moment? Is he in relation to this matter before the court are you able to make any assessment as to his state of mental illness?  
         
        A. I think Mr Grant remains unfit. He continues to have a very disorganised way of formulating the whole thought process, and he remains mentally ill in relation to his understanding of everything that's gone on beforehand too in relation to the offence. But he also continues to experience symptoms of active mental illness. He experiences hallucinations on an almost daily basis and regularly expresses a whole range of delusions, or by that I mean false beliefs.  
         
         
        Q. What about any auditory hallucination at all?  
         
        A. Yes. He continues to have auditory hallucinations on almost a daily basis that often influence his behaviour. He incorporates people into his delusions at times. He has incorporated me into his hallucinations, believing I am influencing his actions, that I have caused him to wet the bed at night. And so he remains a concern.  
         
         
        Q. And as far as you are concerned, doctor, he is so unwell, so mentally ill, that he is, as far as you are concerned, not fit to be in anywhere other place apart from where he is now, is that right?  
         
        A. Mr Grant needs to be in a secure hospital, and until there has been any change in his mental state, he will continue to stay in a secure hospital.  
         
         
        Q. In 2000, when you treated him, he showed then signs of schizophrenia and definite schizophrenia and psychosis, did he not?  
         
        A. Yes. He showed signs in 2000 from schizophrenia. He had prominent thought disorder. He was responding to auditory hallucinations and was quite delusional.  
         
         
        Q. And his mental state has deteriorated even from that state back in 2000, is that right?  
         
        A. From my recollection, in 2000 he responded to treatment then and became less thought disordered and was less disorganised. But on this occasion, there has been virtually no change in his symptoms despite, you know, the medication. So this has been - this progressive deterioration, less response to medication, and overall he has become more treatment resistant.  
         
         
        Q. And, of course, given the situation he is in at the moment, that is the best place to treat a person such as him, because you can ensure that he takes the medication. Is that right?  
         
        A. That is correct. I mean, we - at one stage we were concerned that he may not have been taking his medication when it was changed, because the clozapine is given by a tablet, and it can be defaulted on in that patients can sometimes hide it in their mouths, spit it out. But the advantage of clozapine is that you can do blood levels, and we regularly test his compliance with the medication by doing a blood test to check that he is - the level is within the range that we would anticipate it to be within.  
         
         
        Q. And you are satisfied, having checked those blood tests, that he has been taking his medication?  
         
        A. That is correct.  
         
         
        Q. And despite the high dosages, there has been no improvement?  
         
        A. No, no improvement.  
         
         
        Q. Now, based on that, doctor, are you able to foresee that, given the clozapine has been taken for a considerable period of time now, that it is unlikely there will be an improvement?  
         
        A. I would hate to say there would never be an improvement, because I always remain optimistic in treating the patients. But I think with Craig we may have to go to quite extreme doses before we see any improvement, if ever, that we are - well, I am continuing to increase the dose as tolerated, and we - with clozapine, you have to watch the level, because as you go higher, you can lower the seizure threshold, and there is a risk that you can induce the patient to have a seizure and - if you go too high. So it's a balance between trying to get the dose high enough with not causing him to have an epileptic seizure.  
         
         
        Q. In terms of any relation to any mental illness defence, as indicated to you previously, Dr Roberts has indicated that there is such a defence. Would that accord with your general observation of this particular accused, would it not?  
         
        A. That is correct. Mr Grant has given a number of different accounts of why he committed the offence, but each of the accounts has been quite delusional and have consisted of a number of persecution beliefs. The most prominent belief he had is that the victim was somehow someone he knew through that her mother, when he was in Parklea Correctional Centre, had placed some device on his back, and this was controlling him, and that she - and he has given all these different accounts, but that was - that's been the most common version, and they have all been persecutionary in nature.  
         
         
        Q. And indeed, have you had a chance to read the record of interview that he gave to the police?  
         
        A. No, I have never had a chance to read that, but I understand that he did give a number of different accounts, and they were quite disorganised and bizarre in nature.  
         
         
        Q. Including the one you have just related?  
         
        A. Yeah."" 
        
       
      
    29 Dr Wilcox was not cross-examined. 
     
      
    30 I note that evidence given by psychiatrists of statements made by an accused constitutes original evidence even where the statements are not confirmed by the accused in evidence at the trial. The psychiatrists and the tribunal of fact can permissibly use such statements in assessing the state of mind of the accused at the time of the alleged offences: see R v Pangallo (supra). I have taken into account the statements of the accused made to the psychiatrists in forming the views I have formed. 
     
      
    Consideration 
     
      
    31 Regardless of who raises the defence, the onus lies upon the accused to prove the requisite mental illness on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659. In this case the defence was raised by the accused. 
     
      
    32 In the particular circumstances of this case I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, on the limited evidence available, that the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind and that he was labouring under such a defect of reason as a consequence, that he knew neither the nature and quality of his actions nor that what he was doing was wrong. I consider that the evidence in this respect is overwhelming. 
     
      
    33 The medical opinions concerning the history and development of his condition and the contemporaneous lay evidence concerning his behaviour on and leading up to 30 July 2007 demonstrates that the accused was in an apparently florid and untreatable psychotic state associated with persecutional and delusional beliefs. The psychiatrists who examined him speak with one voice. The accused gave several different accounts of why he committed the offence, but each of the accounts has been quite delusional with irrational and unfounded beliefs of persecution. The experts agree that, having regard to the terms of their specialty as applied to the medical condition of the accused, a defence of mental illness has been made out.  
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    34 It only remains for me in these circumstances to make the following orders: 
     
      
      1. I find that the accused Craig James Grant is not guilty of the murder of Jasmine Bell by reason of mental illness. 
       
       
      2. I find that the accused Craig James Grant is not guilty of attempting to wound Andrew O'Grady with intent to murder him by reason of mental illness. 
       
       
      3. In accordance with s 39 of the  
      Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act  
      1990 
      , I order that Craig James Grant, formerly referred to in these reasons for judgment as the accused, be detained in an appropriate correctional centre or such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law. 
       
       
      4. Pursuant to s 39(3) of the  
      Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act  
      1990 
      , I direct that the Registrar of this Court notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of this order. 
       
      
    Further matters 
     
      
    35 It is important that the tragic circumstances of this case do not pass without mention of the understandable grief that attends the loss of a loved one. The deceased was a young woman with the happy prospect of a future life with Mr O'Grady and their expected child. Her death was a cruel and unforeseen consequence of events that could not realistically have been prevented or anticipated. I extend my sympathy to those of her relatives and friends who are left without her. 
     
      
    36 It is also important to understand and appreciate that the system of criminal justice in this state does not provide for findings of guilt or punishment for crimes unless the accused person has been found to have committed the charged offence to the requisite standard of proof according to law. There can be a tendency, understandable in the extreme, for some of us to feel the need for vengeance, for punishment and for retribution when the acts of another have led to the death of an innocent person. Sometimes a defence, such as a defence of mental illness as in this case, will appear to many as some kind of inappropriate and artificial legal construct that permits the guilty to go free and victims to be left without answers. It is not. It is necessary at these times to understand that the particular events that occurred in this case are much like a catastrophic and unavoidable accident. The only significant difference in the end result is that it will usually be easier to come to terms with a death resulting from a cruel freak of nature, like a landslide or a bushfire, than those cases where another person has committed the physical acts that have caused the death. Unfortunately for the deceased in this case she was, through no fault of her own, in the wrong place at the wrong time, just as much as if she had perished in a natural disaster. 
     
      
    37 I also extend my sympathies and concern to the relatives and friends of Mr Grant. His long and troublesome mental affliction is a continuing and unfortunate fact of his life and of theirs. Hopefully some relief from its burden emerges for him and for them in the not too distant future.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The trial of the accused, Mohammad Al-Sayaheen, began two days ago on Tuesday. The jury was empanelled and after introductory remarks from me the Crown opened the case to the jury. Mr Johnson then opened the case on behalf of his client. In particular he said that his client would be giving evidence, and would say that he now accepts that what he told the police in a recorded interview he had with them, was not true. 2 The first witness was then called by the Crown. Evidence-in-chief was completed and she was part way through cross-examination at the end of the day. The following day the accused did not appear, as required. It was a condition of his bail that he arrive at Court escorted by either his solicitor or Mr Johnson or both but although they had made arrangements to meet him at Mr Johnson’s chambers, he did not attend. There was a short adjournment when enquiries were made as to whether the accused had just turned up late to Mr Johnson’s chambers, but after it became clear that that was not the case. I called the jury into Court, explained that the accused was absent for a reason that we could not ascertain (although I did give sickness as an example) and asked the jury to leave on the basis that they would be contacted if they were required the following day, that is the Wednesday.3 Enquiries during the rest of the day were not of assistance in procuring the attendance of the accused. Counsel for the Crown called evidence from an interpreter who said that at the conclusion of the evidence on Tuesday, the accused said to her something like “my friends ask me why I have to go to Court when I can just get out of the country.” He indicated that his friends had said that they could assist him in that endeavour. 4 It thus became clearer, or much more likely, that the accused has absconded rather than met with misadventure. Accordingly, the jury members were contacted and asked not to come in on the Thursday but to attend at 10 o’clock on Friday, that is tomorrow. The matter was adjourned until 2 o’clock today, that is Thursday, so that I could be informed of progress of attempts to locate the accused and decide what would happen with the trial. 5 The case against the accused is that he sexually assaulted a German tourist who was intoxicated to a very high degree. The Crown case is that he did this in an apartment he shared with another man. When he was interviewed by police soon after the relevant events, he denied that the complainant had ever been inside the apartment. When Mr Johnson opened the case to the jury, he said that his client now accepted that that was a lie, that his version now was the complainant had been inside the apartment but there had been no sexual contact between them. 6 The allegations are very serious and if proved would inevitably require a significant custodial penalty. 7 The evidence establishes that the accused has voluntarily absconded. There are problems with the address that the accused gave to police in that it does not seem to exist. The surety was contacted and he said that the money which he put up to ensure Mr Al-Sayaheen, that is the accused’s, attendance was not in fact his money at all, but that it had been received from the accused’s parents in Jordan. I understand from both Mr Johnson’s opening and the evidence put before me today, that the accused is not an Australian citizen, is ordinarily resident in Jordan and has had his visa to remain in Australia cancelled. 8 It is clear that in the circumstances, as I have outlined them, I have a discretion as to whether this trial should continue (see R v McHardie and Danielson [1983] 2 NSWLR 733; R v Serrano [2007] VSC 209; R v Jones (1998) 72 SASR 281) . Whilst an accused has a right to be present during the course of his or her trial, that right can be waived. I am satisfied that by absconding, as the accused has done, he has waived his right to be present at his trial. No doubt one of the factors he took into account was the strength of the Crown case and the weakness of his response to it, as revealed in Mr Johnson’s opening. I need not go into the details but a particular item of evidence found in the accused’s apartment, is strongly supportive of the complainant’s version of events. That would no doubt have become apparent to the accused. 9 I confess that my first reaction on hearing that the accused had absconded was to exercise my discretion in such a way that the trial would continue. An accused person cannot be the person who decides that if things are going badly, he would like the trial to stop and start again. It is an important principle that an accused person is not able to control whether a trial continues or not by simply deciding whether to turn up. The complainant has flown from Germany to give evidence. That is of a particular hardship to her because she has a fear of flying. There is also a Crown witness who flew over from Perth yesterday. Because the complainant’s evidence has not been completed, although it was being recorded, a recording of her evidence will not be able to be used in a subsequent trial. When the accused is eventually found and arrested, if I exercise my discretion to discharge this jury, the complainant will have to go through it all again. They are powerful factors suggesting that I should exercise my discretion to order that the trial continue. 10 But, as in most things involving a judicial decision, there are countervailing factors. Two matters in particular are important to mention. One of those concerns the defence opening. It has no status as evidence and I would be required to tell the jury to put it out of their minds. The case would thus go to the jury on the basis that the only explanation offered by the accused is the one he offered to police, an explanation which, in the light of the evidence from the complainant, is doomed to fail. It is not in the interests of justice that the accused’s case, such as it is, is not put before the jury. 11 I also take into account in quite a significant way, that the trial had only been going for one day. If the accused had absconded twenty-four hours earlier the trial could not have started without him. In the well known decision of R v McHardie and Danielson, a case which has been followed throughout Australia (despite doubts expressed as to its correctness by Hunt J amongst others see R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67), the trial had been going for a number of days before one of the accused absconded and the other accused desired that the trial continue. Of course the fact that a trial has only been going one day before an accused absconds is not determinative on the question as to whether the trial should continue or not (see R v Jones), but it is a significant factor in my mind. 12 For these reasons, I am satisfied that my initial reaction was incorrect and that the interests of justice require that the jury be discharged and a new trial commenced once the accused is found. This is a decision I reach with great reluctance, recognising as I do that it will involve considerable inconvenience and perhaps even distress to the complainant as well as inconvenience to the jurors who have put aside their personal lives intending to sit as juror in this trial for about two weeks. 13 The decision I have reached might be thought to allow the accused to dictate the course of the trial which is perhaps a reason for my initial reaction. On the other hand, calm, considered, reflection on the various factors which I must weigh up in exercising my discretion, has persuaded me that the least worse option is to stop the trial and discharge the jury and that is what I will do.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: At about 12.45pm on 3 September 2001, Saeb Raad robbed an armed security guard and, in the process, killed him. The armed security guard was Mr Ahmed Rashid, who worked for All Time Security, a sub-contractor to Chubb Security. Mr Raad has been indicted for both the murder and the armed robbery and pleaded guilty to each.  
     
      
    2 The crime of murder is regarded as the most serious of crimes because it involves the felonious taking of human life. The maximum sentence for the crime is life imprisonment, which penalty is imposed in the worst category of murder. Because the offence occurred in 2001, Mr Raad is required to be sentenced in accordance with the law, as it then existed, and there is no standard non-parole period for the offence. 
     
      
    3 The introduction of a standard non-parole period for the crime of murder had a significant effect in increasing the range of sentences generally imposed for the crime of murder and it is necessary to bear in mind the range of sentences that were imposed at the time that the conduct occurred, rather than at present. 
     
      
    4 Even within the crime of murder, a crime perceived as the most serious because of society’s understandable and correct view of the sanctity of human life, there is a range of culpability associated with the crime. In order to determine the objective features, which measure the culpability of Mr Raad and deal with his subjective circumstances, it is necessary to set out the circumstances of the offence. Before doing so, I briefly set out the purpose of sentencing in a case such as this.  
     
      
    Sentencing Principles 
     
      
    5 The purpose in sentencing any offender, even those charged with murder, seeks to resolve what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals. In serious crimes such as murder, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform. Each of these factors, particularly the protective nature of sentencing, personal and public deterrence, and punishment, must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances, viewed objectively, within the range of crimes that may fall within the offence charged. These point most obviously to the factors that require protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution. Reform or rehabilitation may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offences, but is a factor affected most obviously by the subjective circumstances of the offender and the capacity for rehabilitation. That capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of, rehabilitation, in turn, impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed, which ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. There is no single correct sentence, and the often-complicated interplay of considerations point in different directions.  
     
      
    Circumstances of the Offences 
     
      
    6 On 3 September 2001, as already noted, Mr Raad shot and killed Mr Rashid. Mr Rashid was a security guard who had, shortly after 12.30pm on that day, arrived at Punchbowl Ex-Services Club in Punchbowl and collected cash and cheques totalling approximately $55,000. Mr Rashid returned to his vehicle. Mr Raad approached Mr Rashid, informed him that he was armed and told him to get out of the vehicle. On the evidence before the Court, I am satisfied that Mr Raad’s weapon was still tucked into his belt. It seems that Mr Rashid disputed that Mr Raad was armed and Mr Raad took the weapon from his belt and a struggle ensued.  
     
      
    7 That struggle involved Mr Raad pulling Mr Rashid from the vehicle and Mr Rashid holding on to the hand or arm of Mr Raad. During the course of that initial struggle, a number of bullets were fired which were later recovered from the vehicle.  
     
      
    8 After Mr Rashid had been forced from the vehicle and the initial struggle had occurred, Mr Raad and Mr Rashid wrestled and, it seems, that Mr Raad at one stage had Mr Rashid in a headlock. I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Raad deliberately, presumably in order to escape detection, shot Mr Rashid. I am satisfied that Mr Raad shot Mr Rashid during the course of the struggle. 
     
      
    9 There were independent persons who witnessed the struggle. Each of the witnesses attest to hearing two sets of gunshots, consistent with the foregoing. Each of them also attests to the struggle between the offender, Mr Raad and the deceased, Mr Rashid. One of the witnesses did not see the second round of shots, which included the ultimately fatal wound. One of the witnesses saw the struggle and the weapon against the deceased’s chest, but none of that evidence is inconsistent with a struggle. A third witness also heard the shots and saw the offender holding the weapon and saw him fire at the deceased who was struggling with him. At the time, Mr Raad and Mr Rashid were in a struggle and, it seemed, according to that witness, Mr Raad had Mr Rashid in a headlock. The last of the witnesses in effect was unable to add to what had already been put, except that he confirmed the nature of the struggle, and that the deceased continued to hold on to the hand which was holding the gun, or the gun itself.  
     
      
    10 The medical evidence establishes that Mr Rashid died from a gunshot wound, the fatal wound being a wound over the left upper back, centred approximately 200mm to the left of the posterior midline and approximately 1.28metres above the level of the left heel. The wound is consistent, equally, with a deliberate shot fired down the body while the deceased was in a headlock and also with the gun having discharged during the course of a struggle while the deceased was in a similar position. There was a second gunshot wound that, of itself, may not have been fatal. That second gunshot wound perforated the skin of the left lower back and passed through the muscle fracturing the vertebrae. That wound also is consistent with both a deliberate shot and also consistent with the result of a struggle. As already stated, I am not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was deliberate. There is no dispute that there was a struggle between the two men and medical evidence of laceration and bruising is consistent with that fact.  
     
      
    11 After shooting the guard, Mr Raad took the money and escaped in the guard’s car. He drove a short distance and abandoned the vehicle. He transferred to his own vehicle and went to his mother’s house which was nearby.  
     
      
    12 Mr Raad, during the armed robbery and shooting, wore an “afro style” wig and none of the witnesses were able to identify him. Further, Mr Raad had been wearing gloves, left no fingerprints on the vehicle or at the crime scene, and no traceable DNA was available. As a consequence, the Police and law enforcement authorities had no idea as to the perpetrator of the armed robbery and murder. Mr Raad was not apprehended and was not even questioned in relation to these offences.  
     
      
    13 Shortly after 5.00pm on 7 February 2008, Mr Raad, of his own volition, went to the Green Valley Police Station and informed Police that he had committed a murder and robbery at the front of the Punchbowl RSL Club. He said that he could not live with it anymore. Police, who were unaware of the offence, made a number of enquiries, determined that a robbery had been committed and a security guard shot. Mr Raad was arrested and has remained in custody since that date. The information in relation to the offence comes almost entirely from Mr Raad. It is absolutely clear that, but for Mr Raad’s confession and attendance at the Police Station, he would never have been apprehended.  
     
      
    14 There were some aspects of the offence which involved planning, but predominantly, that planning related to the armed robbery, rather than the murder. Those aspects are the use of a disguise, and the fact that Mr Raad had obtained a radio scanner and was listening to the Police radio network before, during and after the robbery.  
     
      
    15 Much debate occurred during the sentence hearing as to whether there was an intention to kill (or at least an intention to cause grievous bodily harm), submitted by the Crown, while counsel for Mr Raad contended for a finding of felony murder. The Crown has failed to satisfy me of an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. However, that failure does not necessarily mean that the crime is not a relatively serious one, even within the category of murder.  
     
      
    16 The relative seriousness of any crime depends on its own facts and does not depend on some general categorisation. While it is difficult to imagine a murder that involves the requisite intention, being less serious than the least serious felony murder, this is not in the category of least serious felony murder. Mr Raad intended to commit an armed robbery. He did so with a loaded gun. He had loaded the gun shortly before the robbery and had his finger on the trigger when he pulled the gun out from his belt.  
     
      
    17 Even though I am not satisfied that he intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, he must have understood that committing an armed robbery with a loaded gun, having the safety catch off the weapon and having his finger on the trigger could foreseeably result in serious injury, if not death. The seriousness of the offence, including the armed robbery, must be measured against the regime that existed at the time of the commission of the offence, namely, in 2001.  
     
      
    18 As the Crown, most properly, concedes, Mr Raad is entitled to the highest level of discount for a plea of guilty for the utilitarian value of the plea. Further, Mr Raad is entitled to a significant added element of leniency for making the voluntary disclosures of involvement in a serious crime in respect of which the Police had no knowledge: R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. In R v Bell [2005] NSWCCA 81, Grove J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Bell J agreed, referred to Ellis and cited the following well-known passage from the judgment of McHugh J in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at [12]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, according to  
        Ellis 
        , the degree of leniency to be shown for the disclosure of unknown offences will vary according to (1) the likelihood that the offences would have been discovered by the authorities; and (2) the likelihood that the offences could have been proven beyond reasonable doubt in a court without the disclosure.” 
        
       
      
    19 In this case, each of the factors to which McHugh J referred, in determining the degree of leniency to be shown, are relevant in assessing the significance of the discount. As already made clear, the offences, by this offender, would not have been discovered by the authorities and it is and would have been impossible for the authorities to have proved these offences, beyond a reasonable doubt, without Mr Raad’s disclosure. Indeed, without Mr Raad’s disclosure, Mr Raad would not have been charged.  
     
      
    20 Nevertheless, however significant the Ellis factors ought to be, the sentence imposed cannot fall below that which is appropriate for the seriousness of the crime.  
     
      
    Subjective Circumstances 
     
      
    21 No account of the history of Mr Raad can adequately describe the transformation that has occurred in him. The person to be sentenced is a very different person to the one who committed the offences. Nevertheless, and taking into account his subjective circumstances, Mr Raad must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment that reflects the seriousness of the offences with which he is charged and to which he has pleaded. His history is a sorry one and unfortunately not an unusual one.  
     
      
    22 He had an early dysfunctional family environment, his parents having separated when he was 7 years’ of age. He came to Australia at the age of 10 and did not see his mother again until he was about 18 years’ of age. He did not have a good relationship with his stepmother and was not particularly close to his father. This early environment, according to Mr Taylor, Clinical Forensic Psychologist, in his report of 3 April 2009, impacted on his social and emotional development. From about the age of 13 years, he was having significant behavioural problems and ran away from home at the age of 15. He lived on the streets with his friends and as a consequence engaged in substance abuse and criminal behaviour.  
     
      
    23 Mr Raad has a criminal history of some length, which reflects his street life and substance abuse. His first offence was for stealing a motor vehicle, when he was approximately 15 years’ of age. Most of the offences with which he has been charged, and for which he has been convicted, have been property offences such as stealing, break, enter and steal, and the like, and drug offences including supply of hemp, possession and supply of heroin and related offences such as goods in custody. Mr Raad continued over a 10-year period with these kinds of offences and received more and more serious punishment. In 1985 he escaped from lawful custody and in 1988 and 1992 committed armed robberies. These were the last offences before the offences for which he now stands to be sentenced. The gap in offending between 1992 and 2001 related to various issues associated with his attempts to cease his drug abuse and with his custody.  
     
      
    24 He had tried, partly successfully, on a number of occasions to cease using drugs, but relapsed shortly before the date of the offence. He has been in his current relationship for approximately 10 years and that relationship has provided some significant stability. His relapse on drugs was the cause of this offence and the armed robbery was committed for the purpose of obtaining money to pay a bill from prior drug purchases. The $55,000 (or as much of it as could be used) was spent on that drug bill and on the purchase of other drugs.  
     
      
    25 The effect of his relationship has been, both literally and figuratively, sobering. His partner’s devotion to him and her religion have had an enormous impact on his life. He assists in rearing his stepchildren and has an extremely close relationship with them. He cares deeply for his family and they care for him. This was the subject of oral evidence, and obvious from the reaction of those of his stepchildren who attended during his sentencing hearing. It was that relationship, both with his wife and her children, that brought about his stability and change in attitude. Mr Taylor’s report, and the evidence of Mr Raad was that Mr Raad got to the stage of his life when he couldn’t handle his crime anymore. Mr Raad, one day, looked at his own stepchildren and realised that the man he had killed had children too and would never see his children grow up. It was this that led to Mr Raad’s voluntary admissions. His remorse is profound.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    26 Murder is the most serious of offences and causes the most serious of consequences. This particular crime is objectively serious. It involves Mr Raad intending to rob an armed guard and killing that guard.  
     
      
    27 The circumstances were not only dangerous to Mr Rashid, but there were bystanders, people in the street and it was a threat to public safety. The Court takes this into account in dealing with the seriousness of the offence. It is an aggravating feature under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    28 The armed robbery of itself would be a serious offence and warrants condign punishment. However, the culpability in relation to that offence is wholly overtaken by the murder with which I now deal. The murder was not itself planned or part of a plan or organised criminal activity, but did form part or was a result of the robbery. I have already mentioned that I do not consider that it has been proved to the requisite standard that there was an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The offender has a significant record, which I take into account.  
     
      
    29 Mr Raad not only has prospects of rehabilitation, he has, it seems, wholly rehabilitated himself. He has been clean from alcohol and drugs for a significant period of time and for almost all of the time since the commission of the offence in question. I have no doubt that, subject to the effect of prison itself, Mr Raad would not re-offend. Even in relation to the incarceration and association with other offenders and association with criminal elements in prison, this would be more than matched by the positive effect of his family. Indeed, one of the most troubling features of the sentence is the effect that prison, itself, will have on the rehabilitation of Mr Raad.  
     
      
    30 I deal firstly with the calculation of the armed robbery count. The guideline in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 is relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence. While armed robbery offences escalate according to how weapons are used and which weapons are used, it is important not to double-count the effect of the use of the firearm and the murder with which Mr Raad is charged and to which he has pleaded. As earlier stated, the robbery was planned, although not as planned as many, and is aggravated by the firing of the gun. By firing of the gun I do not refer to those shots that ultimately shot and/or killed the deceased, but, as earlier stated, the weapon to be used for the robbery was discharged some little time before the murder occurred. On the charge of armed robbery, Mr Raad is entitled, once more, to a discount for a plea of guilty at the highest level and for a significant added element of leniency on account of the factors in R v Ellis, supra. All of the issues already discussed as to the confession to Police and the fact that the crime would have otherwise gone undetected are relevant to this charge as well as the charge of murder. Mr Raad’s criminal history is more relevant to the armed robbery count than it is to the murder charge. The offence to which Mr Raad has pleaded guilty, in this respect, is an aggravated offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, the aggravation being that Mr Raad was armed with a dangerous weapon. The maximum sentence is imprisonment for 25 years, which is the main guidepost to the fixing of a sentence. Further, generally heavy sentences are appropriate for persons who commit armed robbery in order to feed a drug habit, as was the case for Mr Raad: R v Ellis (1993) 68 A Crim R 449.  
     
      
    31 Mr Raad was not a young offender. At the time of the offences, he had just turned 41 years’ of age and he is now about to turn 49. In 1988, when Mr Raad was last before the courts for an armed robbery offence, Judge Herron sentenced Mr Raad to 8 years’ imprisonment, with a 5-year non-parole period. As earlier stated, Mr Raad is a very different person from that person, who was before Judge Herron; his remorse is profound and his rehabilitation almost complete. I would expect that he would not re-offend.  
     
      
    32 I turn then to the question of the murder offence. Most of the aspects of this offence I have already discussed or are covered in the subjective matters that I have dealt with in relation to the armed robbery. I bear in mind that the sentence must be imposed under the regime that existed prior to the institution of a standard non-parole period and in accordance with the range of sentences that would have applied at the time of the offence. The statistics, from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, provided by counsel, are of some assistance, but not overly helpful. The statistics provided disclose the term of the sentence, i.e. the head sentence, imposed for murder in circumstances where there was no standard non-parole period that applied. It shows that the top third of the sentences imposed were for 22 years and above. Of course these statistics take into account sentences imposed on persons who had pleaded guilty and were the subject of significant discount. Nevertheless, to the extent that they disclose a range of sentences, it is appropriate that the commencement point for the sentence to be imposed for this murder ought be at the bottom of the top-third of that range, namely, 22 years. That is the commencement point suggested by the Crown and, in this case, I accept that it is an appropriate point.  
     
      
    33 As already stated, I apply the highest level of discount for the plea of guilty and a significant discount for the factors associated with the voluntary disclosure and those factors associated therewith. But I fix a sentence, which I consider to be appropriate in all the circumstances.  
     
      
    34 I do not find special circumstances. The sentence that I will impose will have a sufficient non-parole period to allow for his supervision and to ensure that he returns to a life without crime, without drugs and alcohol, and with the kind of stability that has earned him a leniency that, for such a serious offence, would not otherwise be given.  
     
      
    Conviction and Sentence 
     
      
    35 Saeb Raad, you are convicted of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, namely, a self loading pistol, in that on 3 September 2001 at Punchbowl in the State of New South Wales you did rob Ahmed Rashid of approximately $50,000 in cash and cheques, the property of the Punchbowl Ex-Services Club Limited.

     HEADNOTE 
    The appellant shared a prison cell while with a person accused of a murder in remand. As part of the murder investigation shoes were removed from the cell for analysis by a forensic podiatrist. The analysis of shoes was of forensic importance to the expert evidence as a shoe had been left at the murder scene.The appellant testified at the murder trial that the shoes removed from the cell were his shoes, and not those of the cellmate. The appellant’s cellmate was acquitted of the murder charge. After the conclusion of the murder trials the appellant was legally recorded by a covert police operative saying that he had testified that the shoes were his when he did not know whose shoes they were.The appellant was then charged with perjury and stood trial in a judge alone trial in the District Court of NSW. The trial judge found the appellant not guilty of two counts of perjury with intent to procure an acquittal on a charge of murder, but guilty of two alternative counts of perjury under the crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 327. The appellant was sentenced to an overall head sentence of five years four months with a non-parole period of four years.The appellant appealed against the conviction and if unsuccessful sought leave to appeal against his sentence. The appeal grounds against conviction were: 
     
     i) that it was not open to the trial judge on the evidence to conclude that the evidence given by the appellant in the murder trials was objectively false; 
      
      
     ii) that the trial judge erred in not directing himself in relation to the possibility of the appellant being mistaken and did not consider the possibility of mistake;  
      
      
     iii) that the verdict was unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence.  
    The appeal ground against sentence was that there were mitigating factors that the trial judge failed to take into account when sentencing the appellant and therefore that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.Held dismissing the appeal against the conviction, allowing leave to appeal against sentence and dismissing the appeal against sentence.ConvictionAllsop P (Price and Harrison JJ agreeing): 
     
     i) The appellant’s conversation with the undercover policeman was an admission that the shoes were not his. Taken as a whole the discussion with the undercover policeman was clearly to the effect that the appellant gave what knew to be false evidence: [42] 
      
      
     ii) There was no necessary element requiring expert evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the shoes did not belong to the appellant: [40]. 
     
     
     iii) Once the admission made to the police was understood to be admission and once trial judge disbelieved the appellant’s evidence at his own trial that he was big noting himself then the possibility of mistake did not arise: [50]  
      
      
     iv) On the findings his Honour made, which were plainly open to him, a finding beyond reasonable doubt of the element of the offences was available: [52].  
    SentencingAllsop P dismissing the appeal against sentence (Price J agreeing): 
     
      
     i) The crime of perjury is grave and strikes to the heart of the administration of justice as perjured evidence does significant damage to the judicial system: [63]. 
      
      
     ii) The trial judge correctly considered the range appropriate to the gravity of the particular offence and the subjective circumstances of the particular offender: [61]. 
      
      
     iii) It is not relevant to consider whether the sentence imposed is more severe or lenient than some other sentence imposed in another case: [61]-[63]. 
      
      
     iv) The sentences given to the appellant were well within the sentencing judge’s discretion and were not manifestly excessive: [64].  
    Harrison J (in dissent) allowing the appeal against sentence, quashing the sentences of the primary judge and imposing a lesser sentence: 
     
     i) A lesser sentence was warranted and should have been imposed: [73]. 
      
      
     ii) The perjury was committed in the absence personal motivation: [72]  
      
      
     iii) The seriousness of the proceedings in which the perjury was committed should not be considered as an aggravating factor in sentencing:[72] 
      
      
     iv) There was no need for emphasis on personal deterrence and the utility of the case for deterring others to commit perjury is limited: [73]-[74].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: On 21 June 2007, the appellant was found guilty of two counts of perjury by Sorby DCJ in a judge alone trial for which the appellant elected under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 132. The trial judge found the appellant not guilty of two counts of perjury with intent to procure an acquittal of one Gerard Gallagher on a charge of murder, but guilty of two alternative counts of perjury under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 327. 
     
      
    2 On 21 September 2007, his Honour sentenced the appellant on the first perjury count to a fixed term of three years, to commence on 24 November 2005 and to conclude on 23 November 2008. On the second perjury count, his Honour sentenced the appellant to a head sentence of four years four months with a non-parole period of three years to commence on 24 November 2006. It follows that the overall sentence was a head sentence of five years four months with a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against the conviction and if unsuccessful in that appeal seeks leave to appeal against his sentences. 
     
      
    4 The background to the charges against the appellant was the stabbing murder of one Mateo Mamaril on 30 May 1999 at a home unit in Bondi. The location was a brothel run by Mr Marmaril’s sister. There were no witnesses to the attack. Police located a single Fila running shoe (UK/Australian size 9, left foot) next to the bed in the lounge room where Mr Mamaril had been sleeping. A partial shoe print from a right shoe with a matching sole to the Fila left shoe was found on the tiled window sill of the kitchen window through which Mr Mamaril’s attacker was believed to have entered the premises. 
     
      
    5 A finger print impression on the inside of the front door to Unit 3 was identified as matching the right ring finger of Gerard Gallagher, an Irish national living in Australia on a working holiday. Mr Gallagher was an occasional client of the brothel who, a few weeks prior to the attack on Mr Mamaril, had been refused entry following a dispute with Mr Mamaril’s sister. 
     
      
    6 The Fila running shoe located at the crime scene was subjected to DNA testing. A bloodstain on the shoe was found to match the DNA profile of Mr Mamaril and DNA from an area inside the shoe was found to match the DNA profile of Mr Gallagher. 
     
      
    7 In an electronically recorded interview with police on 17 June 1999 Mr Gallagher agreed that the Fila running shoe located at the crime scene “looks like mine” and “could be it”. Mr Gallagher stated that such a pair of shoes in size “9 or 10” had gone missing from outside the front door of his home about a month before.  
     
      
    8 Mr Gallagher was charged with the murder of Mr Mamaril. 
     
      
    9 On 11 May 2000 police executed a search warrant on Mr Gallagher’s cell at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (MRRC) at Silverwater in order to locate other shoes belonging to Mr Gallagher for the purpose of comparison with the Fila running shoe. Mr Gallagher was asked to produce all shoes worn and owned by him and in response provided, amongst other shoes, a pair of US size 11½ blue, grey and black Asics running shoes (UK/Australian size 11) from a black plastic bag beneath a bed to the extreme left of the cell. The execution of the search warrant was videotaped, but it was later discovered that there was no concurrent audio recording. 
     
      
    10 A comparison between the wear patterns on the internal structure of the blue, grey and black Asics running shoes seized in the police search of Mr Gallagher’s cell and the Fila running shoe located at the crime scene was conducted by Jillian Fogarty, a forensic podiatrist. 
     
      
    11 Mr Gallagher pleaded not guilty to the murder of Mr Mamaril and his trial proceeded on three separate occasions in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Murder Trial 1 (14 August 2000 – 5 September 2000) resulted in a hung jury; Murder Trial 2 (29 January 2001 – 5 February 2001) was aborted part way through and Murder Trial 3 (7 April 2001 – 1 June 2001) resulted in an acquittal. 
     
      
    12 The appellant gave evidence on oath for the defence at Murder Trial 1 on 28 August 2000 and at Murder Trial 3 on 21 May 2001. The testimony given on both occasions was substantially the same. The appellant’s evidence was that during April 2000 he was awaiting trial at the MRRC at Silverwater. The appellant shared a cell with Mr Gallagher and two others. The appellant said (as was the case) that he had been taken to the Junee Detention Centre to attend court in Albury, where he remained until late May 2000 before returning to Silverwater. When the appellant went to Junee he said that he left behind clothing, a brief of evidence, personal papers, shoes and an electric fan: “Just bulky things I did not want to take to Junee. I took an overnight type thing to Junee”. The appellant said that he did this because he thought that he would only be away for two or three days and, being a plumber at the MRRC, “an essential worker there … they would try to get me back as quick as they could to Silverwater”. 
     
      
    13 The appellant gave evidence that he left his property in the care of Mr Gallagher because “[t]hey don’t hold private property at Silverwater … [If you take it to the property office] [t]hey pack all your property up and send [it to] Junee. Because of the bulk of property, I knew I was only going for a few days, so I took a carry bag with all the clothes I needed … It is a common practice if you don’t want to take it to Junee or wherever you are going. You leave [it] in the care of somebody … You have got this large amount of property which could be lost or whatever in transit. Doesn’t come with you, you wait two or three months for it to come back”. He said that his possessions were left in a large garbage bag “under [Mr Gallagher’s] bed so they would be looked after”. Mr Gallagher agreed to look after the property until the appellant returned. 
     
      
    14 The appellant gave evidence that the shoes he had left with Mr Gallagher were Asics running shoes which were blue, grey and black with a little bit of yellow on them. They had grey splatters of paint that had been spilled by the appellant when he was doing some painting in the MRRC. 
     
      
    15 The appellant was shown the blue, grey and black Asics running shoes seized by police on 11 May 2000 and identified them as being his own shoes. He also indicated that these were the shoes referred to in a Department of Corrective Services’ invoice dated 30 October 1999, thereon recorded as being size 10½ and as item 33 on the “Alpha Listing of Inmate Property” purporting to list property of the appellant within the prison system as at 9 August 2000. The appellant stated that he received size 11 ½ shoes and cannot explain the discrepancy with what is printed on the invoice. The appellant stated that whist at the MRRC he purchased two pairs of Asics running shoes. He said he took size 10 ½ and on both occasions ordered size 10 ½. Both pairs of Asics running shoes received fit him, although the first pair were size 9½ and were “a little bit firm on me, tight” a “very tight fit, but I still wore them anyway, because if I handed them back it would take another two months to go through the procedure again to get another pair”. The second pair, being size 11½, the appellant “could wear them, comfortable … in gaol you really don’t have a choice”. “They were a little bit large, but I could wear them and I kept them also. I used them for work. They were more of a work shoe”. 
     
      
    16 The appellant gave evidence that he did not give Mr Gallagher permission to wear the Asics running shoes he left in Mr Gallagher’s cell and to his knowledge Mr Gallagher never wore them. The appellant did not buy a pair of Asics running shoes for Mr Gallagher, nor did he give or lend him a pair. 
     
      
    17 Mr Gallagher also gave evidence at the first and third murder trials. Mr Gallagher denied ownership of the Asics running shoes and stated that he had told police, upon production of the shoes, that “they are not mine”. Mr Gallagher confirmed the appellant’s version of events regarding the leaving of the shoes in Mr Gallagher’s care. 
     
      
    18 Agreed facts were tendered at the appellant’s trial stating that the appellant shared cell 224B with Mr Gallagher at the MRRC from 2 April 2000 until 16 April 2000; that Department of Corrective Services’ records showed that on 16 April 2000 the appellant was transferred to Junee Correctional Centre, returning to the MRRC on 17 May 2000; that the appellant was absent from the MRRC on 11 May 2000 when Mr Gallagher’s cell, 224B, was searched; and that the appellant again shared cell 224B with Mr Gallagher on 2 June 2000. 
     
      
    19 After giving evidence in Mr Gallagher’s third trial, the appellant returned home to Queensland. On 6 June 2001, pursuant to an unrelated investigation, the appellant was (legally) recorded speaking to a covert police operative, “Phillip Lucas”, in a car park on the Queensland Gold Coast. The appellant volunteered the following in conversation: “I’ve been through a bit of shit, I’ve been through a murder trial and shit the last … I got a bloke in … (unintelligible), went and testified for a bloke in there last week, he got off and he’s gone back to Ireland … it was all over some runners and that found at a murder scene and shit … well, we put a lot into it you know, I fucken’ put my head on the line to get him, going fucken’ on about it … this Gerry Gallagher the name is … So it was all about runners and who owned ‘em and all this sort of shit, you know … And I put me hand up to fucken’ owning a pair of runners, there was one found at the scene, murder scene and then when they raided the gaol to get his runners to try and do a DNA test and that, well I was actually in remand for nearly two years a couple of years ago … And I was living with him when they took these runners and I put me hand up and said, ‘Oh they’re fucken’ my runners’. I don’t know whose runners they were, whoever’s runners they were, who gives a fuck. But anyway, fucked ‘em up in court … I did a you know, stat dec and I got ‘em to –inside [gaol] you fucken’ when you buy something they put it on ya dot – ya know, on your property sheet and everything. It was all fucken’ signed up in my name and everything, all the runners and that and fuck it. It fucked the DNA up. This could fuck Australia’s fucken’ new DNA laws … Yeah keep laughin’. The jury come back and said ‘Not guilty’ … They couldn’t have touched me ‘cause when it happened I was in custody see? …So there’s no way it’d come back onto me. It’s just a matter of me fucken’ sticking my hand up in the air a little bit fucken’ further than I wanted to”. 
     
      
    20 “Phillip Lucas” gave evidence that he had met with the appellant on at least 12 and perhaps as many as 20 occasions. In cross-examination, “Mr Lucas” rejected the suggestion that the appellant was simply “big noting himself”. “Phillip Lucas” said: “I don’t believe so. With other conversations I’ve had with [the appellant] whatever he said he would do or provide he has done so, so I had no reason to doubt him”. 
     
      
    21 In November 2005, the appellant was extradited to New South Wales on the perjury charges. While in custody in Queensland awaiting extradition Queensland police executed a search warrant on the appellant’s cell and property. Footwear was taken – some Asics runners, Puma runners, one pair of black slides and one pair of Rockport black dress shoes. 
     
      
    22 These shoes were later sent to Ms Fogarty, the forensic podiatrist, for examination and comparison with the shoes earlier examined in relation to the Gallagher trial. Another forensic podiatrist, Mr Bennett, also examined the shoes. 
     
      
    23 In 2006, the appellant consented to testing of his feet. 
     
      
    24 There was expert evidence tendered in the appellant’s trial. First, the transcript of evidence of Ms Fogarty, that had been given at an earlier trial of the appellant was tendered. Mr Bennett also gave evidence. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that both Ms Fogarty and Mr Bennett gave evidence that the Asics shoes taken from Gallagher in his cell appeared to have different foot patterns from the runners and shoes taken from the appellant but that neither could be in any way certain of that. 
     
      
    25 The appellant gave evidence in his own trial. He swore that the Asics running shoes taken from Gallagher were his, having left them in Gallagher’s care when he had been temporarily transferred to Junee. He said that at and prior to the time of the conversation with the covert police operative he was taking antidepressants and had consumed 10-12 bourbon and cokes. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “’I was just big noting myself in conversation I think. Just pulling things out of the air.” 
        
       
       
      He said that he had told the truth in the two murder trials. 
       
      
    26 As to the appellant’s degree of intoxication, the undercover policeman gave evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “‘[the appellant] wasn’t suffering from any level of intoxication which made his demeanour, his appearance, his general dealings with me any different to any other occasion. It just appeared to be normal conversation’.” 
        
       
      
    27 Professor Graham Starmer, a professor of pharmacology, gave evidence that in his opinion, based on the appellant’s history of drinking between 10 and 12 bourbon and cokes on 6 June 2001, the appellant would have had a blood alcohol reading in the range of 0.188 to 0.229. Professor Starmer ultimately agreed that it was not really possible for him to reach any firm conclusions as to what effects alcohol and prescription medication may have had on the appellant on that day. 
     
      
    28 In his reasons, the trial judge reasoned and concluded as follows. First, he directed himself to the elements of each count stating, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of each of the offences the crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The accused made a false statement 
        
       
       
        
        2. On oath 
        
       
       
        
        3. In a judicial proceeding 
        
       
       
        
        4. Knowing the statement to be false 
        
       
       
        
         … 
        
       
       
        
        5. With the intent to procure the acquittal of a person of a serious indictable offence.” 
        
       
      
    29 His Honour then turned to the evidence. 
     
      
    30 The first complaint, being ground one of the appeal, is that it was not open to his Honour to conclude on the evidence before him that the evidence of the appellant in Mr Gallagher’s trials was objectively false. 
     
      
    31 There was no dispute about the evidence that the appellant gave at the first and third trials of Mr Gallagher. The evidence was that the Asics runners belonged to him (that is the appellant). 
     
      
    32 The trial judge discussed the evidence as to the objective falsity of the statement. First, a Detective Fountain gave evidence of the search of Gallagher’s cell and his production of the runners when asked to produce his shoes. The Detective denied that Gallagher said that they were not his. The judge made the following finding: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not accept that Gallagher, when he produced the Asics from the black bag under his bunk told Detective Fountain that the shoes did not belong to him. There would be no point, in terms of the murder investigation, for shoes other than Gallagher’s to be seized. Therefore I find that when asked by Detective Fountain on 11 May 2000 to produce his footwear, Gallagher took a pair of Asics from a black bag under his bunk which were then placed in the exhibit bag without any comment as to the ownership of the Asics. This finding leaves open the question of whether or not the Asics shoes taken from the black bag by Gallagher during the cell search of 11 May 2000 were in fact his shoes, or those of the accused Mr Mainwaring as claimed by Mr Mainwaring in the evidence at the trial of Gallagher on 28 August 2000 and the subsequent trial.” 
        
       
      
    33 The trial judge then discussed Ms Fogarty’s transcript and Mr Bennett’s evidence. The judge recognised the imprecision in the evidence and gave particular weight to Mr Bennett’s evidence as to difference and similarities between the Asics runners taken from Mr Gallagher and the shoes taken from the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “He was then asked about the difference and similarities between the two sets of shoes and he said: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Q. Answer this question if you are able to. Are you of the view that there were more differences than there were similarities between the footwear taken in the Gallagher matter and the pressure results from the accused Mainwaring. In other words, do the differences outweigh the similarities? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to say whether or not it’s reasonably possible that the accused Mainwaring was the wearer of the shoes taken in the Gallagher matter, that is the blue/grey Asics runners is that a reasonable possibility? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It is possible. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to say whether it is a reasonable possibility? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It is difficult to be completely certain about that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why is that sir? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Given that there was the issue to deal with the load in the second toe which is, whilst common, it does draw a point of distinction so the two individuals could have shared the same characteristics.’ 
        
       
       
        
        In cross-examination by Mr Cooley, Dr Bennett said at 204: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Mr Mainwaring could have been the wearer of the Asics shoe sized eleven and a half US in the ‘Gallagher matter’. He said Mr Mainwaring could have worn that shoe and could have put that shoe on his foot.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Bennett said that he was not able to exclude that Mr Mainwaring was in fact the wearer of the Asics in the ‘Gallagher matter’, transcript 205. Dr Bennett went on: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Q. Didn’t you also indicate in your evidence in chief that the differences between the two outweigh similarities? You go on to say immediately thereafter (in the second report of 12/11/2006) ‘The Asics insole in the Gallagher demonstrates it should be ‘Gallagher matter?’ 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The Asics insole in the Gallagher matter demonstrates some inconsistency with the observations reported above? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you are saying all that information in relation to Mr Mainwaring’s feet had some consistency with the Gallagher shoes? 
        
       
       
        
        A. In some aspects of it in a very localised area of it? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say that the feet of Mr Mainwaring could potentially produce shoe wear characteristics identifying the Asics footwear in the Gallagher matter? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You also include the internal wear characteristics in the vicinity of the fifth toes of both feet? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What do you mean by that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That the area inside the shoe, if anybody wants to wear that, if I was to wear that, or you were, lose the potential to wear the shoe in a particular area. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you saying all the information you have about Mr Mainwaring’s feet indicates that he would have created the wear in the location of the fifth toes of both feet in the Asics and the Gallagher matter? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It is possible. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s what you seem to be saying, do you agree with that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It’s possible. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You couldn’t exclude could you that Mr Mainwaring was in fact the wearer of the Asics in the Gallagher matter? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I’m not able to exclude him. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Q. Didn’t you also indicate in your evidence in chief that the differences between the two outweigh the similarities? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s correct.” 
        
       
      
    34 As can be seen from an examination of this exchange, this expert evidence did not prove that the Asics runners found in Mr Gallagher’s cell were not the appellants, but it was not inconsistent with that proposition.35 The gaol property list did not record the appellant owning any Asics. 
     
      
    36 The primary judge then discussed the evidence of the undercover policeman. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The key elements of this evidence are the admissions made by Mr Mainwaring as to what he said and did in relation to the shoes at the Gallagher’s first and third trials. He said in conclusion in relation to his evidence that ‘I put my head on the line, we put a lot into this testimony’ and ‘I put my hand up to owning a pair of runners which I didn’t know whose runners they were’. This last quote is significant and suggests to me that Mr Mainwaring, not knowing who owned the shoes, built up a case for ownership of the Asics to assist Gallagher, emphasising as he did in evidence before the Supreme Court and myself, matters that point to his being the owner of the shoes, for example the grey paint on the front of the shoes, that he said he got as a result of maintenance work at the MRCC. 
        
       
       
        
        An examination of the conversation that Mr Mainwaring had with the undercover operative Lucas, reveals a great deal of accuracy by Mr Mainwaring, not withstanding the amount of alcohol he says he consumed that morning (ten to twelve bourbons and coke) transcript 231. Undercover operative Lucas said the presentation of Mr Mainwaring, while noting he had been drinking was essentially the same as on other occasion [sic] that he had met with Mr Mainwaring.” 
        
       
      
    37 The trial judge then turned to the evidence of the appellant. His Honour examined the evidence with care and over a number of pages and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have considered the evidence of Mr Mainwaring in the witness box, both his answers and their tone and his demeanour before me and the contents of exhibit 2, in particular, in which I find Mr Mainwaring was not so much big-noting himself as ragging about what he had done in the Gallagher trials. In his conversation with the undercover operative Lucas, he kept adding more detail as to his involvement in the Gallagher trials, the information not provided as a result of any direct questions or prompting by undercover operative Lucas. There was some element of big-nothing as when he told the undercover operative the significance of his evidence on DNA evidence in Australia.” 
        
       
      
    38 His Honour then concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find beyond a reasonable doubt that the blue/grey Asics joggers produced by Gallagher in the cell search of the MRCC cell on 11 May 2000 were joggers that belonged to Gallagher and Gallagher did not tell the police officer Fountain that they belonged to Mr Mainwaring as he claimed. This finding is made first on the basis of the evidence of both the forensic podiatrists and making appropriate allowance for the lack of scientific precision in their work and the conclusions that there were more similarities in the differences between the foot patterns in the grey/blue Asics and the foot patterns of Gallagher than Mr Mainwaring. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly having heard the CD and the conversation between Mr Mainwaring and undercover operative Lucas, and the admissions made voluntary [sic] by Mr Mainwaring in that conversation revealed the considerable knowledge on his part of exactly what he said in the Gallagher trials and his reason for doing so – ‘good bloke … you know he fucken shouldn’t have been in there’ and considered the evidence of Mr Mainwaring before me, both his demeanour and his explanation for what he said to undercover operative Lucas, I find beyond reasonable doubt that when Mr Mainwaring told the jury in the Gallagher trial on 28 August 2000 that the Asics shoes seized by police in the search on 11 May were his, his statement was false and he knew it to be false.” 
        
       
      
    39 The submissions on behalf of the appellant emphasised, first, the proposition that concluding that the appellant lied at his own trial did not prove a positive proposition that the runners were his and, secondly, that the expert evidence was not conclusive. 
     
      
    40 Both propositions can be accepted and were not challenged. The importance of the lack of acceptance of the appellant at his trial lay in its effect upon the evidence of his admissions to the policeman. Secondly, the importance of the evidence of the experts was that it was not inconsistent with the conclusion that the Asics did not belong to the appellant. There was no necessary element requiring the expert evidence itself to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Asics runners did not belong to the appellant. This fact and the objective falsity of the appellant’s evidence at Mr Gallagher’s trial could be proved by the appellant’s admissions to the undercover policeman. 
     
      
    41 Thus the appeal really collapsed into an analysis of what the appellant had said to the undercover operative as the transcript of the conversation revealed. The crucial passages were identified in the submissions for the appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “T1: And I put me hand up to fucken owning a pair of runners, there was one found at the scene, murder scene and then when they raided the gaol to get his runners to try and do a DNA test and that well I was actually in remand for nearly two years a couple of years ago. 
        
       
       
        
        CPO: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        T1: And I was living with him when they took these runners and I put me hand up and said ‘Oh, they’re fucken mine’. I don’t know runners they were [sic], whoever’s runners they were, who gives a fuck. But anyway fucked ‘em up in court. 
        
       
       
        
        T1: I did a stat dec and I got ‘em to, inside (gaol) you fucken when you buy something they put it on ya dot ya know on your property sheet and everything, it was all fucken signed up in my name and everything, all the runners and that it just totally fucked the DNA up. This could fuck Australia’s fucken new DNA laws, yeah yeah the jury come back and said “Not Guilty”. 
        
       
       
        
        CPO: All for sticking your hand up for someone else’s fucken shoes. 
        
       
       
        
        T1: Yeah, so we grabbed a catholic Priest that was Irish, then to the Department of fucken Immigration and got him a visa and fucken passport and bang he’s home fucken, actually Monday twelve o’clock he leaves. 
        
       
       
        
        T1: So there’s no way it would come back and, just a matter of me fucken sticking my hand up in the air a little bit fucken further than I wanted to.” 
        
       
      
    42 It was submitted on appeal that at the most these statements were no more than an admission of a lack of certainty or recklessness as to who was the owner of the shoes. 
     
      
    43 I do not agree. The issue at the primary trial was not whether or not the appellant owned the Asics runners found in Gallagher’s cell. The issue was the known falsity of the clear evidence given by the appellant that they were his. Taken as a whole, the discussion with the undercover policeman was clearly to the effect that he gave what he knew to be false evidence at Gallagher’s trial. 
     
      
    44 That left the question whether the appellant was “big noting himself” or whether he was speaking truthfully. This question was a factual one in which the judge did not accept the appellant’s evidence. That conclusion meant that not only was the trial judge entitled to conclude that the objective falsity of the evidence was proved beyond reasonable doubt, but also the appellant’s knowledge of the falsity was likewise proved. 
     
      
    45 The next ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in not directing himself in relation to the possibility of the appellant having been mistaken and did not consider the possibility of mistake. 
     
      
    46 This submission founded itself upon the proposition that the transcript of the discussion with the undercover policeman reflected the possibility of mistake. For the reasons that are referred to above I do not think the discussion with the police office raises any possibility of any relevant mistake. In his Honour’s judgment at p. 6 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The last element common to all four counts is that the accused Mr Mainwaring knew the statements about the ownership of the Asics shoes to be false. The crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that not only was Mr Mainwaring’s statement about the Asics shoes false, he knew it to be false. It has not been submitted by the defence that the accused was under any mistake about the matter [if] Mr Mainwaring was lying in the Supreme Court when he said the Asics were his then he must have been deliberately lying.” 
        
       
      
    47 The appellant relied on MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348. There, a solicitor appealed against his conviction for perjury. The alleged false statement made by the solicitor was that when his client was shown a lease and other documents in an interview with the police the document was not discoloured by the ninhydrin technique for developing latent fingerprints. In cross-examination, Mr MacKenzie was asked if he could be mistaken and he said he could not. In the High Court, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed that Mr MacKenzie almost to the end gave his testimony with an element of dogmatism and certainty that left little possibility of his being mistaken. The High Court allowed Mr MacKenzie’s appeal and quashed his conviction. Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ in a joint judgment said at 373-374 the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “With respect to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant's repetition, in Mr Barbaro's trial and in his own trial, of his conviction of certainty as to the evidence he was giving was equally consistent with the giving of false evidence innocently and mistakenly as distinct from the giving of such evidence dishonestly and with criminal intent. Neither the repetition nor the expressed certainty nor the belated suggestion that the lease as originally seen was a photocopy, are inconsistent with the hypothesis of innocent mistake. Sometimes repeated assertion of false evidence can tend to establish the criminal intention of the witness, especially where the falsity is ‘inescapable and self-evident’ or where it leaves no reasonable cause for a belief that it is true. But honest mistake, inadvertence, carelessness or misunderstanding leading to evidence shown to be false will not constitute perjury for which a criminal intention must always be proved … . In  
        R v Dickson 
         [[1983] 1 VR 227 at 231] … it was rightly said  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ‘[I]t is essential to distinguish between honesty and accuracy and not assume the latter because of belief in the former’.  
          
         
         
        The converse is also true.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Thirdly, the foregoing conclusions make it all the more important that, in a case of this kind, the judge should have given assistance to the jury on the differentiation between honest mistake and deliberate falsehood, the latter being an essential element to the offence. In this Court, it was submitted for the prosecution that the mistake was inconsistent with the way in which the accused had given his evidence at both trials and conducted his defence at his own trial. Even if this were so, it would, nevertheless, be the duty of the judge to deal with the matter in his directions to the jury. This is inherent in the fact that the charge is one brought by the Crown. The judge must explain, by reference to the facts, the ingredients of the offence. In this case, the issue was specifically raised in a request for redirection on behalf of the appellant. What then happened is the source of the appellant's alternative contention before this Court that a miscarriage of justice occurred because the jury were not, in the result, properly directed, or directed at all, on the need to differentiate between false evidence given with knowledge of its falsity or false evidence given mistakenly but without criminal intent … .” 
         
        (footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    48 Dawson and Toohey JJ also referred to mistake at 356-357. 
     
      
    49 Reference was also made to the decision of this Court in R v Liristis [2004] NSWCCA 287; 146 A Crim R 547 at 570 [133]. 
     
      
    50 I am prepared to approach the matter on the basis to the extent that a direction should have been given to the jury, his Honour should have given such a direction to himself: Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250. Nevertheless, here, not only did the defence not raise the matter it was not coherently open on the evidence. In MacKenzie, there was the possibility that Mr MacKenzie was being dogmatic about something he was mistaken on. This was not the case here. The appellant gave sworn evidence at the trials of Mr Gallagher that the runners were his. He made a clear admission to the effect that this was not so. The admission is plainly to be understood that it was to his knowledge at the time of Mr Gallagher’s trial that he didn’t know whose the shoes were. Once one understands the admission made to the undercover policeman that it was an admission that the shoes weren’t his and in effect that he gave false evidence and once the trial judge disbelieved him in his explanation that he was big-noting himself, the question of the possibility of a mistake does not arise. The only way it could be said to arise was out of the text of the conversation with the undercover policeman. For the reasons I have given I do not think it does so arise in that context. 
     
      
    51 In these circumstances the second ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    52 The third ground of appeal was that the verdict was unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence. For the same reasons I have expressed above I do not think that this ground can be made out. On the findings his Honour made, which were plainly open to him having, in particular, formed a view about the credit of the appellant a finding beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the offences was available. 
     
      
    53 The appellant also sought leave to appeal as to his sentences. It was conceded that the crimes were objectively grave and it was further conceded that the fact that the perjury counts related to a charge of murder aggravated the offences. 
     
      
    54 On the other hand, it was submitted that there were a number of features that mitigated the offences. The learned sentencing judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had given false evidence in order to obtain an acquittal. There was also no evidence, it was said that the appellant agreed to give false testimony for any reward.  
     
      
    55 The appellant was born on Christmas Day 1951. He was 48 and 49 years old at the time of the offences. He was married and has been married for 36 years. He had three adult sons and he worked as self employed concreter. His criminal record included prison sentences for drug and firearms offences, but very few entries for dishonesty. There were no prior offences relating to the administration of justice. 
     
      
    56 The appellant drew the Court’s attention to various cases involving perjury sentences in criminal trials. In R v Treglia [2002] NSWCCA 338 the offender pleaded to guilty to a single count of perjury. The perjury had been given at a trial in which he and another man were charged with three counts of armed robbery and two charges of assault arising out of a violent home invasion. The offender and another had given evidence of an alibi and called other witnesses in support of it. Both men were acquitted. Evidence was obtained by a listening device in the offender’s cell. He was 21 years old at the time of the offence and 28 when he was sentenced. He was immersed in a drug taking culture the sentencing judge said. There was a plea of guilty, a discount of 20 per cent and an imposed sentence of four years with a non parole period of three years. The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the appeal and resentenced the offender to a head sentence of three years with a non parole period of eighteen months. 
     
      
    57 In R v Langton [2002] NSWCCA 382 the offender pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury, one count of affray and three counts of assault. Mr Langton was one of a group of off duty police officers who were involved in a brawl with a group of young men. The men were arrested and a Detective Haken supplied the offender and his colleagues with batons. The arrested men were required to “run the gauntlet”. Later Langton, with other police, punched one of the prisoners. He gave false evidence about all these events. He was 34 years old, had a prior conviction for assault and was sentenced to an overall sentence of three years six months with a non-parole period of three years. On appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal the overall sentence was not changed but the non-parole was reduced to two years three months. The sentences for the two perjury charges were reduced to head sentences of eighteen months with a non-parole of six months and three months respectively. The overall sentence for the two perjury counts for Mr Langton was a sentence of two years with a non-parole period of nine months. 
     
      
    58 Reference was also made to R v Fish & Swan [2002] NSWCCA 196; 131 A Crim R 172 which was an appeal arising out of the same incident as Langton. Ms Fish and Mr Swan were both police officers who gave false evidence denying that Langton and other police had forced the prisoners to “run the gauntlet”. This Court allowed an appeal from their perjury sentences and imposed on Ms Fish a head sentence of twenty months with a non-parole period of six months and on Mr Swan twenty months with a non parole period of twelve months. 
     
      
    59 Mr MacKenzie was sentenced to two concurrent sentences of twelve months with a non-parole period of nine months. 
     
      
    60 The effective sentence here was a head sentence of five years four months with a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
    61 I do not think appropriate to compare the sentence under challenge directly with those imposed on these other offenders. What should be looked at is the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender and not whether it is more severe or lenient than some other sentence: see R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371 per Hunt CJ at CL. 
     
      
    62 In Treglia and Langton the offenders pleaded guilty. In Treglia there was only a single count. In Langton the sentences were reduced in the context of a restructuring of the sentences imposed for multiple offences. The offenders in Fish & Swan did not plead guilty, but both were first offenders and former police officers who would serve their sentences on protection. There also had been considerable delay in the charging of both of them. Ms Fish was convicted of a single offence and was extended further leniency on account of having committed the offence in the context of an abusive relationship. Mr Swan suffered from post traumatic stress disorder arising from his service in Vietnam and had undergone triple bypass surgery for heart disease. 
     
      
    63 These cases do not provide a mandatory or even helpful guide. The crime of perjury is not only grave but it strikes the heart of the administration of justice. It is also a crime extremely difficult to identify and to prove. The damage to the judicial system of perjured evidence is substantial.  
     
      
    64 In my view, the sentences given to the appellant were well within the sentencing judge’s discretion and were not manifestly excessive. No lesser sentence was warranted in law. 
     
      
    65 For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal on conviction, grant leave to appeal on sentence and dismiss the appeal on sentence. 
     
      
    66 PRICE J:  I have had the advantage of reading the drafts of the judgments prepared by Allsop P and Harrison J. Their Honours disagree as to the outcome of the appeal against sentence. I adopt the learned President’s discussion of the relevant sentencing principles and their application to the present case. In my opinion, the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were within the discretionary range open to him and were not manifestly excessive. Like Allsop P, I consider that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but the appeal be dismissed. I also agree that the appeal against conviction be dismissed.  
     
      
    67 HARRISON J: I have read the draft reasons for judgment of the learned President and agree with him that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. However, I disagree with his conclusions on the application for leave to appeal against the sentence. In my opinion the learned trial judge imposed sentences that were manifestly excessive in the particular circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    68 It goes without saying that I do not disagree with the learned President’s characterisation of the crime of perjury as grave and one that strikes at the heart of the administration of justice. It requires vigilance to detect it and undoubtedly warrants the imposition of a sentence that reflects its gravity. Indeed, the trial judge was also at pains, in my opinion correctly, to emphasise these factors in his remarks on sentence, which are instructive and in principle beyond controversy. However it is always important that some relativity be accorded to the circumstances of the particular offences without derogating generally from these principles. 
     
      
    69 The appellant referred the Court to statistics generated by the Judicial Commission in relation to sentences imposed in higher courts for the offence of perjury since January 2001. Of the 12 recorded cases since then, 10 cases representing 83 per cent received a sentence of full-time imprisonment. The highest head sentence in that group was one of 4 years and 6 months. In relation to non-parole periods, the results for consecutive cases are not recorded although it appears that there were two such cases. Of the remaining eight cases, the highest non-parole period or fixed term was 18 months, and there is only one such case. The non-parole period imposed for each count in the present case is therefore at least double that of any other non-parole period imposed in that time. 
     
      
    70 Whilst these figures are interesting, and at one level quite instructive, they are not and cannot alone be determinative of the question of the adequacy or inadequacy of any particular sentence for a like offence. They may provide guidance but no more. 
     
      
    71 Any period of imprisonment must be understood for what it is: onerous, unpleasant, oppressive and burdensome. It is, as it should be, the last available punitive resort in any civilised system of criminal justice. Public discussions about the need to deter crime by the imposition of heavier sentences are not always obviously, or at least apparently, informed by an appreciation of the significance of full-time incarceration upon men and women who receive such sentences. In contrast, I have no doubt that the learned trial judge was acutely aware of such matters, as his careful disposition of the case reveals.  
     
      
    72 The cases emphasise that the crime of perjury is not victimless, but that in contrast the victim is the system of justice itself. That wisdom applies with equal force here. But it is important to bear in mind that the present offences were not associated with any demonstrated or even assumed prospect of personal gain or advantage, as in the case of a falsely constructed alibi by an offender facing a trial of his own or in the case of an agreement to give perjured evidence for reward. Other examples of special advantage or personal motivation can be imagined, but none was present here. Indeed, one curious aspect of the present offences is the apparent absence of an identifiable or comprehensible motivation of any sort other than possibly some ill-considered and misplaced allegiance on the part of the appellant to a fellow prisoner. Nor am I convinced that the seriousness of the perjury can been characterised as a function of the seriousness of the proceeding – in this case, a trial involving a charge of murder – in which the perjured evidence is given. Such an approach rather suggests that there is or may be a range of cases over the reach of which truthful evidence is more or less important depending on the case concerned. I would not be prepared to accept the unqualified accuracy of such a proposition in general or that a concession that it should be treated as an aggravating factor in this case was properly made. 
     
      
    73 In my opinion a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been imposed. Four years of full-time custody is in my view out of proportion to the particular offences concerned. I consider that a sentence of 2 years for each offence with a non-parole period of 12 months partially accumulated by 6 months, so as to produce a non-parole period of 18 months, would have been appropriate in the present circumstances. The objective criminality of the offences was not increased by the presence of negative subjective factors indicating some specifically sinister agenda or calculated purpose. There is in these circumstances no apparent or identified need for emphasis on personal deterrence.  
     
      
    74 Questions of general deterrence would in my view have been more than satisfied by the sentences I propose. For example, the appellant was not a well known, trusted and highly respected member of the judiciary whose offending conduct was wholly inimical to the exercise of a notoriously public office and an affront to the standards expected of a person in such a position. Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the imposition of sentences that recognise in comparative terms the harm done by the offending conduct in question. The utility of this case as a vehicle for deterring others who may be likely to commit perjury is patently limited. A combination of two terms of imprisonment totalling 4 years with an effective term of 18 months full-time custody is, and should be acknowledged to be, a significant sentence and a salutary punishment marking out in clear and unambiguous terms the disapprobation with which the community views any interference with the operation of its fundamental and important institutions. 
     
      
    75 In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      1. Dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
       
       
      2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences imposed by Sorby DCJ on 21 September 2007 and in lieu thereof sentence the appellant on the first count to a non-parole term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 24 November 2005 and concluding on 23 November 2006 with a balance of term of 12 months commencing on 24 November 2006 and concluding on 23 November 2007 and on the second count to a non-parole term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 24 May 2006 and concluding on 23 May 2007 with a balance of term of 12 months commencing on 24 May 2007 and concluding on 23 May 2008.

   JUDGMENT1. On 27 January 2009 George El Hassan was arraigned upon a charge that he had robbed Yan Li on 28 May 2008 at Redfern of $250. There was a lot more riding on any conviction for this offence than any sentence he might receive. Six and a half months earlier than the date of the robbery he had received a fifteen month suspended sentence. Upon conviction for a robbery he would be exposed to a revocation of the Section 12 Good Behaviour Bond and the subsequent activation of that fifteen month term of imprisonment.2. The Crown case on the robbery charge was strong, nonetheless George El Hassan pleaded not guilty and put the Crown to proof as he was entitled to do. On 28 January the jury returned with a verdict of guilty. Today the offender is to be held accountable for his criminal involvement in the robbery and, as events have turned out, in the breach of the Section 12 Bond imposed by Judge Woods QC on 30 November 2007 for an offence of maliciously wounding a man, indeed a neighbour, named Naggar in the course of a street fight.3. As sentencing Judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this Court committed by this offender harming the victim he did in this community. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters.4. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing Judge to make findings of fact from the evidence that was before the jury consistent with their verdict, and facts before the Court relating to the offender. The facts that I may find arising from the offence are not necessarily the most favourable facts that I can find from the jury’s verdict, but rather upon my view of the offence and in recognition of the jury verdict, facts that I deem appropriate to find.5. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are technical questions relating to deterrence, whether special circumstances are to be found and of course the ultimate length of term of imprisonment or other penalty that is to be imposed. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740. Facts6. The Commonwealth Bank has a branch in Redfern Street, Redfern. On the street façade of that branch are located two ATM machines. Each has, as part of its security system, a camera installed internally within the machine, situate at a height to take photographs of faces and upper torsos of those using the machine. In so doing it will often take photographs that show objects within the forward viewing range of the camera’s lens, indeed objects across the road. There is a third camera installed above the machines. Its lens is capable of capturing images of persons in or approaching what I might call the “vestibule” area in front of the two ATM’s. 7. On 25 August 2008 the cameras were taking and recording images so that at the very least every five seconds the area of the ATM was recorded by these three cameras. Police retrieved a record of all activity captured by the cameras trained on the ATM area for a period commencing 2:14:04pm and concluding 2:44:56pm for 25 May. Apparently selected from that group was a number of photos covering the period 2:23:21 until 2:30:57pm. Those photos show that for more than seven minutes the offender must have remained in the immediate vicinity of the ATM’s or nearby. By that I mean that he was not always in the focus of the camera, but he was there sufficiently frequently to suggest that when he was not in focus he was not far away.8. At 2:30:11pm he is almost immediately in front of one of the ATMs. At the same time Ms Li has her face pressed against the glass screen of the ATM she is in front of. The photo at 2:30:12 shows the offender in the area of the ATMs. The photo taken at 2:30:34 shows Christian Prokash at his car looking across Redfern Street to the ATM. Another photo taken at the same time shows the offender moving, it would seem at some speed away from the area to his right side of the area. 9. Miss Li and Mr Prokash fill in the gaps left by the photos. The jury must have accepted the account of each. Miss Li approached the ATM machine intending to withdraw $270. She approached the ATM on the right hand side, the offender was to her left. As the machine dispensed the money to her she was hit on the head just forward of her left ear and above the hairline with sufficient force for her head to hit the glass panel above the dispensing mechanism. She turned around, perhaps momentarily, disoriented. A bank note became dislodged from the delivery chute, it was a twenty dollar note and was seen falling through the air by Mr Prokash. It was later seen on the ground by Miss Li. The other five (I assume) notes of $50 were taken by the offender. 10. Miss Li was distressed rubbing her hair and having difficulty speaking. The offender de-camped to the left of the machine. I still think it is to the right but it might have been to the left as the machine took the photo. 11. I am satisfied his purpose in lurking near the machines for some seven minutes was that he was waiting for an opportunity to do the very thing he ultimately did, that is to grab the money from the machine as it was delivered to a bank customer.12. Two minutes before the robbery, Maria Ayoub(?) was drawing money from the machine. She noticed the offender close to her. She took her money and confronted the offender. She said to him: “What do you want?” He replied: “I want to ask you for the time.” She told him to go away. The photo taken at 2:19:19pm shows the offender very much in her “personal space” with his left arm so close to Miss Ayoub that his hand could well be touching her. Such conduct appears inconsistent with an innocent inquiry as to the time. One second later they are further apart. I am satisfied that is because Miss Ayoub moved backwards. See her arms, they are behind her. 13. The offender did not give evidence. His case simply was that while he was seen in the vicinity it was not he who committed the robbery. His case is that he was doing no more than looking around in the area. The victim described the attacker in terms that may have excluded the offender and identification was an issue in the trial. However the jury determined otherwise, that is to say the jury determined that Miss Li’s description was not an accurate one.Objective Criminality14. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing Judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant case, that is in this case, with criminality of offences of a similar kind, that is other robberies. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence is evaluated. The objective criminality quite obviously has a very important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.15. Chief Justice Gleeson when presiding in New South Wales encapsulated the essence of the legal wrong or the criminality done by robbers and the reason why substantial punishment is required in the R v Rause unreported NSWCCA 8 August 1992. His Honour said: 
     
      
      “One of the primary purpose of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and to go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others. Offences of the kind committed by the present [offender] are not trivial instances of disrespect of private property, they are serious breaches of the peace, they are direct attacks upon the security of the person and the property which the law exists to protect.” 
       
       
      
    16. That is to say it is a double pronged attack. One upon the person and the other upon the person’s property. That is why the law views robbery as a serious offence. Robbery is only accomplished by the violence of an offender towards his victim or the threat of violence towards his victim of such magnitude that the victim is willing to forego his custody over the property which may be his or may be someone else’s but in his care. In this case the overbearing of the will of Miss Li to possess her property was violence rather than a threat of violence. The force used in the robbery was a single blow to the left temple region. It had sufficient force to knock her into the ATM, but not sufficient force to otherwise unbalance her. She remained on her feet throughout. The violence in that sense is towards the lower range. The person targeted was a woman, predictably physically weaker than the offender. She was alone. In that sense she was vulnerable, but her vulnerability was not such as to constitute a statutory aggravating feature. Had she been more aged or perhaps infirm the vulnerability would have been of such an order.17. The offence was being contemplated by the offender for a full seven minutes. In that sense it was clearly pre-conceived. The method by which the robbery was to be accomplished mush have been worked out at least to the extent that the offender recognised force would be needed in order to divert the attention of the victim or to secure the money when first delivered by the ATM. 18. It cannot, however, be said the offence was planned in any sophisticated way. 19. The loot taken was limited to money. Street robberies often include the taking of a handbag and contents, that is not this case. The sum taken was also relatively small. In so far as the planning is concerned it will be noted that I disagree with defence counsel’s concession to the contrary. It is not difficulty to imagine any time a robbery, even an opportunistic one is undertaken that some thought or forethought is necessary, but the level of planning contemplated by s21A (2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires more than forethought or simply waiting. 20. The impact upon the victim was to cause her immediate distress to the point of having difficulty speaking. Robberies often cause a lingering sense of trauma and on occasion post-traumatic stress disorder. While there is no evidence before me to prove post-traumatic stress disorder, I am prepared to find there was a strong sense of trauma and that that sense of trauma lingered for some time, although its duration could not be pinpointed. I can do no more than assume it was for a relatively short period.21. By its objective facts this offence falls towards the lower range of criminality associated with crimes such as this. However to that assessment of the objective criminality is the aggravation occasioned by its being committed whilst the offender was on a Section 12 Good Behaviour Bond in lieu of serving a fifteen-month sentence of imprisonment. The fifteen-month sentence was suspended conditional upon him agreeing to be of good behaviour. There were other conditions to assist him in achieving good behaviour. His breach of his undertaking to the Court and obviously his breach of the bond constitutes aggravation of the objective criminality of the offence I am dealing with.22. Defence counsel seeks a finding the offence is motivated by drug dependency. His difficulty is there is no evidence in support of this proposition that there was any caused or link between the offender’s drug addiction and his unlawful taking of the $250. The offender certainly did not give evidence to that effect. He told Dr Richard Furst, a psychiatrist retained by the defence, in June of 2009: “That he was with his son celebrating his son’s birthday on the day he was accused of robbing the victim and was angry about the trial”. That statement seems to be a retraction of the concession at the trial he was in the area at the time of the robbery. He also told Dr Furst that he was using illicit drugs on “a couple of occasions and both benzodiazepines and Panadeine Forte on a more regular basis, however, he maintained attendance at Clinic 36 for his methadone supply of up to 70 milligrams per day”. Those disclosures to Dr Furst, if accepted, do not establish any causative link that would justify a finding as sought by defence counsel. 23. That does not mean that the offender’s drug abuse is not something to be considered in the subjective matters.24. In March of 2009 in consulting with Cherise Ciepulcha, a psychologist working with Lennings Seidler Collins, he said he was present at the offence but denied taking the money from the victim or coming into physical contact with her. Again a denial of involvement coupled with an absence of any material supporting a nexus between his drug use and his violence crime precludes a mitigatory finding that his drug dependency played some role in his criminal conduct. While in the circumstances of this case there is no evidence supporting of the objective criminality as a result of any direct causative nexus between the offence and drugs, I would still find the offence was related or connected to his long term drug dependency and associated lifestyle.25. El Hassan has a significant criminal record to which I will shortly come. I note here however, that I reject the defence submission that his criminal history constitutes and aggravating feature of his objective criminality. He is certainly disentitled to leniency on account of his record and it may impact adversely upon any assessment of his rehabilitation prospects, but it is not appropriate to regard this particular record as constituting an aggravating feature of the objective criminality pursuant to s21A (2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 26. My overall review of the objective criminality is to find the objective criminality falls towards the lower end, although aggravated upwards on account of the breach of conditional liberty.Subjective Matters27. I turn now to the subjective factors I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by him or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.28. The subjective features are gleaned from forensic reports prepared by two psychiatrists and a psychologist. I am conscious of the observations of the CCA (eg. R v Palu v 134 A Crim R 174) that I must exercise care in giving weight to self-serving matters arising from such reports in the absence of oral evidence from the offender. That is particularly appropriate in this case.Family Background and Relationships 29. The offender is aged thirty-two. He is one of seven siblings born in Australia of Lebanese parents. There were four brothers and two sisters. He claims a supportive family upbringing, a caring and supportive family environment. If that is true then events appear to have overtaken him. He left home aged thirteen, an unusual feature in a strongly supportive family environment, to live with a sister. One of his brothers was murdered, is currently in custody and at least another one other has been in custody. His “best friend” is one of his brothers. 30. The father had returned to Lebanon to participate in family mourning for a deceased relative and felt unable to return because of ill health. When hearing news of the demise of the murdered son, the father suffered a severe stroke and died. El Hassan who was the second youngest child was devastated by the death of the older brother and the father said to have occurred on the same day. At the time El Hassan was twenty-one. He still has grief issues arising from this. 31. El Hassan presented to Miss Ciepulcha as engaged to his present partner. He says the relationship commenced fifteen years ago. He says to Miss Ciepulcha they have a twelve-year-old son. I have already made reference to that son. However he appears to have told Dr Allnutt in November of 2007 he was a single man with no children. He presented to Dr Allnutt as having had two long-term relationships, initially a girlfriend of seven years and in 2007 the current one involved in a relationship of six years who was said to be supportive. A Miss McKenna, I think it was, gave evidence before Woods DCJ, I have assumed she is his partner. Her evidence in 2007 was the relationship was ongoing and she continues to be supportive. But it does not appear that she has been able to be contacted by probation and parole for confirmation of any of the history given by El Hassan while his sister and others do appear to be capable of being contacted.32. It would seem the offender is an unreliable historian. However the probation and parole service prepared a full background pre-sentence report for Woods DCJ in November of 2007. In preparing this report they contacted the offender’s sister and a personal support program worker but not his claimed partner. On the basis of that report I was prepared to accept he had a son. 33. Having already prepared those remarks on family history from the various reports, I was this morning given a pre-sentence report prepared for 3 April 2009, it contains the following: 
     
      
      “Mr El Hassan reported to this service that he was particularly close to his father and one older brother, both are now deceased. The offender stated that his life changed when he was nineteen years old due to the murder of his brother and death of his father.” (I pause here to note that he says to others that occurred when he was twenty-one).  
       
       
      “He stated that his father did not cope with the news of his brother’s death and gave up his battle with an illness and died a short time later. It was confirmed via interviews with the offender’s family that his brother was murdered and that his father death followed in the subsequent years.  
       
       
      At the time of the offender’s brother’s death Mr El Hassan was approximately fourteen years old and because of the age gap between his brother and himself the length of time the brother spent in custody and the lack of contact that his brother had with his family, their relationship was not incrementally close.  
       
       
      It was mentioned throughout the phone interview with the offender’s family that he often distorts the truth and that his family do not trust the information he provides them with”. 
       
       
      
    34. I think I read elsewhere that the father died seven years afterwards. Thus it’s difficult to assess the relationship and the impacts of events within the family upon him. Indeed the inaccurate reporting may itself be a consequence of the trauma or may be some manipulation by him. I am certainly not in any position to know.Education, Employment and Skills35. He has told the professionals that he left school part way through Year 11. On his account he did not encounter significant learning, social and behavioural difficulties during his early school years. He claimed satisfactory grades. There was a significant sporting accident resulting in a broken jaw and loss of hearing in the left ear. He claims memory and concentration difficulties arising from the accident. However there is nothing before the Court other than the history given to the professionals that is capable of establishing any traumatic brain injury at the time his jaw was broken. Nonetheless, the loss of hearing to the left ear may well have had a detrimental impact upon his abilities to function in an educating environment because of the diminution in hearing capacity. But there is no evidence as to what that diminution is and whether there has been any compensation of it from the other ear.36. As often happens he found high school more demanding, began to associate with negative peers, became behaviourally difficulty, disruptive and non-complaint. He was truanting towards the end, he was smoking on school grounds and fighting. It is likely his intellectual capacity for academic work is impaired and probably has always been impaired. His work choices involved manual labour. Included among past employment are roof tiling, ground maintenance, brick laying, painter and air-conditioner repairer. In respect of that last occupation, he has expressed an interest in returning to it upon release. The time of appearance before Woods DCJ his income stream was sourced from NewStart Centrelink benefits. He was participating in the personal support program. His caseworker with that program reported that at that time he had been fully participating in their program having recently undertaken a number of courses with a view to finding employment. The most recent pre-sentence report again throws some doubt upon some of the matters that he has told the professionals, but time does not permit of a more close analysis of that in respect of his working history.General Health37. He is a drug abuser. His general appearance confirms that fact. He looks older than his thirty-two years. His other most significant medical problem is loss of hearing in the left ear. As I say the extent of that disability is not clearly made before me. He suffers headaches, sees stars in front of his eyes from time to time, he also experiences dizziness and physical tension.Mental Health Issues38. He complains of restless sleep and weird dreams. Dr Furst found he is still deeply affected by the deaths of his brother and father earlier referred to. He suffers from depressed mood, poor sleep, anxiety, panic attacks and hears voices of deceased relatives that are thought to be part of the pathological grief reaction. Reviewing the history given to Dr Furst by the offender, it is difficult to resist a finding of paranoia in terms of those he was interacting with during the period he was on the bond. From the forensic reports provided it would appear he experiences depression. There is a history of interpersonal aggression and difficulties managing emotion. Dr Furst’s diagnosis include opioid and cocaine dependence, adjustment disorder and depressed mood. Dr Furst also notes borderline personality traits. It is also likely there is cannabis dependence, that is a poly-drug dependence.39. This offender’s cognitive assessment indicates an intellectually low functioning man with compromised functioning aggravated from other sources, drug abuse, unresolved grief, depression, difficulties managing emotion.Character and Criminal History40. El Hassan is a poorly functioning thirty-two year old long term unemployed poly-drug abuser. He has impaired intellect verging, on one account, to borderline intellectually disabled and mental health issues. He is vulnerable psychologically. It is likely he has limited supports in the community. There is a past history of employment in the manual labouring work. He has a long association with the criminal justice system starting in his adolescence in 1990 with a malicious damage matter, 1992 there were break enter and steal, assault and possession of offensive implement. 1993 armed robbery in-company, 1994 assault, being unlawfully carried in a conveyance. 1995 break enter and steal, assault police, stealing, driving offences. 1997 marks his first appearance in the District Court with robbery in-company, there was also a resist arrest, carried unlawfully in a conveyance. 1998 carried unlawfully in conveyance. 2001 aggravated break enter and steal. He was before the Drug Court as I read the record on two other break enter and steal that same year. 2002 there was an assault, a break and enter with intent. 2004 shoplifting times two. 2006 larceny and possessing a prohibited drug. 2007 goods in custody and malicious wound. As an adult El Hassan has been sentenced to imprisonment on eight occasions. On two of those in 2007 the sentence was suspended. Since 1998 he has served on my calculation more than three years in prison.Attitude to Offence41. The offender denies any involvement in the robbery. While he is said to understand the impact of violence upon the victim, he still denies responsibility for that violence. In those circumstances making a finding of any contrition is impossible.Rehabilitation Prospects42. El Hasssan’s rehabilitation prospects, absent any serious intervention program, are dismal. To the extent his past record is indicative of future conduct the outlook is bleak. While it appears he has attempted rehabilitation in the past, including the Drug Court program, none has succeeded. He has long term unemployment issues, although there is a suggestion of past work history extending to his mid twenties. A positive note is his effort in 2007 with the personal support program. He has no accommodation. There are stressors between some of his family and himself. The status or involvement of his claimed partner is unclear. Whilst in custody he has been subject to two charges for breach of discipline, one in July of last year, failed to attend muster, and one in the same day, disobey a direction for which he received two days in the cells and fourteen days off amenities. On the other hand whilst he has been in custody he has also self referred to alcohol and other drug services. 43. There can be little doubt El Hassan needs close oversighting and supervision during his post-release period. Absent structured release programs, he is in real danger of becoming an entrenched recidivist.Setting the Sentence44. This is complicated by the need to deal with this offender for the breach of the Section 12 Bond given by Woods DCJ. The facts of that offence are set out in his Honour’s judgment: 
     
      
      “The offender lived in a complex in south Granville near to the victim a Mr John Naggar. They knew each other and there had been some friction between them. On February 2007 the victim was standing outside his unit and El Hassan and his partner Cheryl McKenna were walking along Chiswick Road involved in an argument. Mr Naggar intruded himself into that argument and the offender threatened him. Naggar placed himself between McKenna and El Hassan and there was a fight. 
       
       
      During the course of the course of the fight the offender ended up on the roadway with the victim on top of him. The offender struggled and the victim ended up lying on the roadway with the offender standing over him. During the course of the struggle the contents of Mr Naggar’s pockets became dislodged, including a wallet, a set of keys, a small folding knife and some coins. El Hassan picked up one of the items on the ground and was seen making repeated punching motions towards Naggar with a silver object in his hand. The object was either the small pocket knife or the keys… 
       
       
      [There was] a slight cut to the face of Naggar and there were other wounds as well. A linear wound behind the knee joint and a few other minor wounds. The offender was also injured behind the ear and on the shoulder”. 
       
       
      
    45. The conditions of the bond were designed to assist the offender rehabilitate. They included, one, to be of good behaviour, two, to accept supervision and guidance and comply with all reasonable directions of Probation and Parole during the term of the bond, three, to reside at Foster House or in community housing approved by Probation and Parole, and four, continue methadone program to the satisfaction of Probation and Parole. 46. The breaches that have been notified are that he was charged with and now convicted of the offence of robbery on 25 May 2008; he failed to reside at Foster House or Probation and Parole Service approved housing, and he failed to continue on the methadone program to the satisfaction of Probation and Parole. It is not difficult to see the importance of each of those conditions to advancing the offender’s rehabilitation. His breach of them undermines his stability and the consequence flowing from that was his re-offending. In respect of the fifteen month sentence, his Honour did not set a non-parole period, I shall do so now. The non-parole period will be twelve months and the balance of term will be fifteen [as said] months.Custodial History47. The offender appears to have been in continuous custody since 2 July 2008 when bail was refused in this matter. Deterrence48. Given that I am satisfied the offender’s intellectual impairment is described as “very low cognitive ability”, deterrence will play a much more muted part in the sentence I seek.Sentencing 49. El Hassan I find the breaches of the Section 12 Good Behaviour Bond given to you by Judge Woods to be proved. I revoke the Section 12 Bond. I sentence you to a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 2 July 2008 and to expire on 1 July 2009. That sentence is already served. 50. There is an additional term or a balance of sentence to expire on 1 October 2009. The overall sentence I am setting for the robbery is one of three years. I find special circumstances. The sentence however will be cumulative to the twelve month non-parole period I just imposed. For the offence that you on 25 May 2008 at Redfern did rob Yan Li of $250 I convict you and sentence you to a non-parole period of twenty-two months to commence on 2 July 2009 and to expire on 1 May 2011. I find special circumstances. I set a balance of term of fourteen months to expire on 1 July 2012.Drug Court Referral51. I refer this offender to the Drug Court for inclusion or for consideration of inclusion into the compulsory Drug Treatment Centre at Park Lea. I am satisfied the unexpired portion of his sentence exceeds eighteen months. I am satisfied in the proceeding five years at least two and probably three of the offences for which he was given imprisonment reflect or are related to his drug use, long entrenched drug history and lifestyle. In particular I note the goods in custody charge of 1 July 2006 and the malicious wound charge of September 2007.52. The basis of the ill-feeling between John Naggar and the offender related to the stealing from Naggar of seventy dollars and Naggar perhaps coming to a view that the offender may have been involved because of his offer to re-pay that money. I have no doubt that Naggar formed the view he did because of the offender’s lifestyle. There are shoplifting offences falling just outside the five year period that reinforce the long term nature of the lifestyle and offending relating to drug addiction. I also note that the consequence of the effects of drugs upon his psyche and lifestyle would have impacted upon the offender firstly arguing with his partner and secondly his responding to any intervention by Naggar with violence. 53. I order that copies of Dr Allnutt, Dr Furst and Miss Ciepulcha’s reports be attached to the warrant and made available to Corrective Services. I order that they also be referred to the Drug Court. 54. In the event the offender is found not to be a suitable candidate for the compulsory drug program I recommend to the custodial authority serious consideration of the recommendations made by Miss Ciepulcha towards the last pages of her report commencing at paras 47, 48 and 49. I order a copy of that judgment be published as soon as possible so that it can be referred to the Drug Court and to the Corrective Services.

   JUDGMENT1. On 27 March 2009 J.S.S was before the Court anticipating the granting of a s 11 to bail on his matter to which he had pleaded guilty. That was a charge of aggravated robbery of Gillian B on 4 July 2003 at Eastgardens Shopping Centre at Pagewood. 2. The evidence before the Court was that the offender was serving a nine month custodial sentence commencing on 28 April 2008 for a subsequent offence. His status in respect of this offence was bail refused. 3. The offender and his uncle gave evidence. Each in his own way presented as an impressive witness. I will need to return to their evidence later.4. In the circumstances, I canvassed with the Crown whether it would regard s 11 bail for a twelve month period as falling into appealable error by me. The Crown, fairly, in my view, accepted in the total circumstances of this case that a s 11 bail for the purpose of seeing whether J.S.S could show any prospects of rehabilitation was an appropriate outcome. On that day I made orders pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act granting bail. That bail contained stringent conditions and required J.S.S to report his progress to the Court on at least three occasions during the bail period. 5. The matter reached the Court Registry at 5pm on that day, when it became apparent the offender was serving a balance of parole which would expire on 5 December 2009. I made orders in chambers staying the bail orders made and listed J.S.S’s matter for mention on 3 April 2009. At that time J.S.S, supported by family, sought finalisation of the matter. Given there is to be an eight month portion of sentence to be served in fulltime custody I have determined to acquiesce to this request. 6. I have been troubled, having made bail orders, whether I can proceed. Section 11 bail orders are not final orders. In the event of any breach of the bail they can be revoked. In this case, because he was serving a sentence it is likely that I did not have jurisdiction to make them in any event. It is likely the bail orders were null and void. In the event they were not, I am prepared to revoke the orders for want of jurisdiction. Both parties accept and agree that now a sentence should be imposed.The facts7. I have reviewed the facts of this offence in some detail on 27 March 2009. Those facts as set out in my remarks of that date should be regarded as being incorporated into these remarks.Objective criminality8. This offence was a particularly nasty instance of aggravated robbery. J.S.S presents in 2009 as a solid athletic man of Samoan heritage. The violence of the robbery included a punch with his right fist to the head of his victim; the grabbing of her, forcing her to the ground; striking her head against the concrete, as I recall her head being held in his two hands; grabbing her by both her legs, dragging her some distance across concrete; pinning her legs against her body and lying on top of her; using his body weight to hold her legs up and a second punch to her head to silence her screams.9. The charge itself establishes that actual bodily harm was done to her. That level of violence has overcome her will so that she surrendered her property to him. It is the level of violence that promotes this offence into a serious example of aggravated robbery.10. The contents of the stolen backpack included the victim’s wallet, mobile phone, key card, Visa card, Student Identification, a Canadian Citizenship card, personal papers and $130. The impact of this theft of these items primarily would have been of significant inconvenience to Gillian B with the loss of her phone cards, the loss of her phone and credit cards and other cards. The sum of money taken was not great. The victim was alone in a car park late at night. She was at her most vulnerable alone and at night.11. The offender has, he says, no recall of the incident. At the time of the incident he was drinking heavily. He accepts that alcohol had contributed to his violent behaviour. While he cannot recall the circumstances of the robbery there is no evidence before me upon which I could find it was a planned or schemed offence. It is likely he has gone to the car park area to commit the robbery, because Coles was open at that hour of the night. Having gone there for that purpose he seized the opportunity to rob Gillian B. On the other hand I am unable to determine where he travelled from to be at Eastgardens or for how long he had to wait. Nor am I able to assess whether his victim was the first person he encountered or whether he let more imposing people pass by as he determined to wait for someone more vulnerable. It is likely the robbery was committed to provide funds for drinking and possibly for drugs.12. The offence is sufficiently serious to warrant fulltime custody. It is the assessment of that custody that takes some consideration. I shall return to that topic.Subjective matters13. J.S.S was sixteen years and eleven months at the time of offending. He is being dealt with at law for his offending conduct, although his age at the time of offending must necessarily be a factor to take into account when sentencing.14. He is now aged twenty-three. His parents live in Brisbane. He has a family network strongly supportive of him. His parents and relatives have been in Court on each occasion he has been before the Court. His family visit him in custody. 15. His uncle lives in Earlwood. As I said earlier, the uncle gave evidence of the offender living with him during a bail period. The uncle was prepared to set a strict, but fair limits during the nephew’s stay. One restriction was “no alcohol”. J.S.S respected his uncle and was prepared to abide by the uncle’s rules. If parole is to be served in New South Wales, the Parole Board should give consideration as to whether the uncle is still willing to house J.S.S during part or all of the parole time. If parole is not to be served in New South Wales I anticipate it will be served in Queensland, where his mother and family live.16. J.S.S is the second youngest of seven children, born in New Zealand of Samoan descent. The family moved to Australia when he was age nine. His upbringing was strict, but during his latter teen years his peer group was unsavoury.Education, Training and Skills17. J.S.S obtained his School Certificate, but was expelled in year eleven for non attendance.18. He joined the workforce as a builder’s labourer, but was irregular at work as a consequence of alcohol and drug abuse. He had experience as a forklift driver. He was, in fact, in employment at the time of his arrest.19. He has sporting skills, particularly in rugby, rugby league, golf and basketball. 20. I should have mentioned he obtained his Forklift Certificate whilst in custody on a prior occasion.General Health21. He presents from custody as in fine physical shape. He appears to be drug free. So far as one can tell there are no physical health problems that would impact upon his rehabilitation prospects.Mental Health22. Likewise, there is nothing before the Court suggesting any mental health or ingrained anti-social issues I need be considering. Drug and Alcohol History23. The offender began binge drinking at sixteen. As I said to him during the course of his evidence he is a bad drunk. He becomes violent once he is intoxicated.24. Whilst in custody he has completed programs to prevent relapsing into alcohol abuse and violence prevention programs. His evidence is these that programs had given him beneficial strategies to avoiding alcohol.25. He was also abusing drugs at sixteen. It is hard for me to know from the evidence what drugs, but he certainly was using cannabis. Cannabis is one of the most insidious drugs about. It is deceptive, because users of cannabis believe they are relaxing; meanwhile the cannabis may well be underpinning the mental health of the person using it, to such an extent that those who are heavy users become paranoid, aggressive suspicious and sometimes violent. He told the author of the Pre-Sentence Report he has stopped using cannabis with the help of an older brother, who introduced him to rugby. 26. Each episode of his offending is related to alcohol abuse. He told Probation and Parole he now realises he should not drink, that abstinence, he says, is preferable to controlled drinking. I have taken him at his word on that, as he will see in the orders I ultimately make.Character and Criminal History27. J.S.S is a physically imposing young man with above average sporting skills in rugby, golf and basketball.28. At the time of this offence J.S.S had not been before the courts. As I said moments ago, since sixteen he has drug and alcohol issues, which have seen him incarcerated in May 2006 and again in October 2008 for offences of serious violence. His parole was breached by the second offence. His parole for the first offence was breached by his commission of the second offence. The Parole Board required of him, presumably on 24 October 2008, that he serve the balance of his parole one year and nine months in respect of the first offence. Assuming my maths is correct.29. The importance of J.S.S’s character and subsequent criminal history is that it throws some light on the offender’s rehabilitation prospects and some light on his sense of remorse for his earlier offending conduct; that is, the conduct I am dealing with. His subsequent offending does not, however, aggravate the objective criminality of the offence I am dealing with.Attitude to the offence30. The offender does not recall his criminal conduct on the night of 3 July. It is likely he was well affected by alcohol. His drug of choice. It may also be he has blocked out the memory. I accept his memory of the event is seriously diminished. Nonetheless he has been confronted with the facts, or allegations, that were made by his victim. He accepts his behaviour as alleged. He has not sought to quibble with or minimise the allegations surrounding his crime. He expressed his sorrow, acknowledged his bringing shame to his family and shame to him “To think I did this”. He pleaded to the offence from the outset, indicative of his willingness to accept full responsibility for his criminal offending conduct. His plea also has utilitarian value. A reasonable identification case could have been run by the defence, although there were other aspects of the Crown case that appears strong. Calling the victim as a witness would have caused her to relive the trauma of this terrible night. That is a bonus gained to her and the Crown by virtue of his plea that she has not been called. This is a case where the full 25 per cent discount for a plea of guilty should be available.Rehabilitation prospects31. Had the offender been dealt with in the Children’s Court the sentencing structure of the Children’s (Criminal Procedure) Act places great focus on rehabilitation prospects. It is a moot point whether this offender would have been dealt with in the Children’s Court, because of the solidly violent level of his offending conduct. Necessarily the elements of the offence, robbery and infliction of actual bodily harm recognise a level of a violence over and above that required to overpower the will of the victim in respect of surrendering possession of property.32. I have reviewed the JIRS statistics for offending conduct against the same provision of the Crimes Act 1900, namely, s 95(1). More than 150 aggravated robberies were dealt by the Children’s Court. Thirty-two of them were serious enough for control orders to be given. In my view it would only have been in circumstances where the prosecution exercised its discretion to have this matter dealt with at law that it would have been so dealt with. In exercising its discretion the offender’s prior good record would have been of use to the defence until November 2005 when he was charged with the malicious wound for which he served his first sentence. That is two and a half years after this offence. There is a real likelihood, in my view, that in those circumstances if the offence had been dealt with prior to November 2005 it may have been dealt and finalised in the Children’s Court. As matters stood at the time he was charged before the Local Court, only one jurisdiction was available. He had to be dealt with at law, because he was over twenty-one. 33. Coming back to the topic of rehabilitation prospects the offender’s rehabilitation prospects will depend upon how well he exercises self discipline in respect of his alcohol consumption. As I earlier said he had agreed to submit to rigorous bail conditions to advance his rehabilitation. Those conditions included abstention from alcohol, participation in the workforce and participation in a community based activity such as sport. His acceptance of those conditions, even though he did not get a chance to prove himself, do demonstrate a desire by him to accomplish rehabilitation.34. His custodial conduct is mixed. There have been conduct charges levelled against him and there has been involvement in programs focussing upon rehabilitation. He has strong family support. He made undertakings before the family when bail was thought to be possible, that he would abstain from alcohol. Hopefully he would renew that pledge when he is released.35. I should note cases such as Hearne (2007) 124 A. Crim.R 457 stress the importance rehabilitation is to play in cases involving young persons guilty of serious offences of violence. The sentence I shall set will give due regard to that principle.Setting the sentence36. I am conscious when setting this sentence the maximum penalty for the offence, had he been dealt with in the Children’s Court, would have been two years fulltime custody. I am conscious the delay in charging (see my remarks of 27 March 2009) have denied to him any prospect of being dealt with by the Children’s Court. For reasons I expressed earlier I do not rule out that he had reasonable prospects of being dealt with in that jurisdiction. Having said that I must acknowledge that the maximum penalty for the offence is twenty years imprisonment. But when sentencing at law, all sentencing options up to the maximum penalty are available to a judge of this Court.Deterrence37. I have not given general deterrence the weight I would otherwise give had I been sentencing a criminal who committed this offence as an adult. As to personal deterrence I have designed a sentence that I believe does contain strong personal deterrence, namely, a substantial balance of term. This offender, through experience, now knows what a breach of parole will bring, because he is currently being retained on that score and he was denied an opportunity to be released to bail, because he had earlier breached his parole. Hopefully he will learn from that experience.Stale offence38. This is an offence that occurred six years ago. I have already made a reference to delay and the effect it has upon the jurisdictional options open to deal with the matter. I have already indicated I take that into account.Custody39. This offender has been in continuous custody since 28 April 2008. His balance of parole that is currently being served will expire on 5 December this year 2009. I indicated earlier (see remarks March 2009) that I would consider backdating any sentence I had to set to commence three months prior to the offender’s custody commencing in respect of this matter. As best I can glean his sentence on the assault occasion actual bodily harm, the non parole portion of that expired on 27 January this year. The overall sentence I would have set for this offence, bearing in mind all of the matters that I have reviewed, is one of three years imprisonment. I have reduced that to a sentence of two years and three months overall on account of his plea of guilty, that is the nine months that is taken off is the discount. 40. I intend to find special circumstances for the following reasons: 
     
     a). The sentence is being served in an adult gaol although the offender was a juvenile when the offence was committed. 
      
     b). His rehabilitation is better achieved within a community setting. 
      
     c). He has made useful progress on rehabilitation issues whilst in custody, and special circumstances amount to recognition that he is willing to focus on rehabilitation and provides him with an opportunity so to do. 
      
    41. J.S.S will you stand up.42. J.S.S I convict you of an offence that you between 11.50pm on 3 July 2003 and fifteen minutes after midnight on 4 July 2003 at Pagewood did rob Gillian B of certain property, to wit a Lightening Bolt backpack, leather wallet, a Nokia 3310 mobile phone, an umbrella, a New South Wales drivers licence, Credit Union cards, St George card, Student ID card, Medicare card, Canadian Citizenship card and $130 in cash, that was her property and immediately before that robbery you intentionally or recklessly inflicted actual bodily harm on her. I set a non parole period of fifteen months to commence from 27 October 2008 and to expire, on my calculation, on 26 January 2010, the day after Australia Day next year. I set a balance of term of twelve months, to expire on 26 January 2011. 43. Sit down.44. I order your release on this sentence. I do not know what other sentences you have. It took me by surprise last time, but on this sentence I order your release on 26 January 2010, the day after Australia Day next year. 45. Pursuant to s 52 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I am entitled to set conditions for your parole and I set one, I will put it this way, I impose the following parole condition in addition to any imposed by the Parole Board. The condition is that you are not to consume any alcoholic beverages for the entire period of your parole, that is a twelve month period. You survive that and you have got a good chance of surviving generally.Any other matter, Mr Wilson, Madam Crown?ARUL: Yes, your Honour, there is 166 Certificate in relation to another charge. The Crown wishes to withdraw that charge, your Honour. I can hand up that document.WILSON: There’s no objection, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: As I understand it - I am corrected 26 January is Australia Day. I was thinking 25 January, but that is the day before. I got it confused with Christmas.HIS HONOUR: The Crown, pursuant to 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, certify that the offender has been charged with inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. It seeks leave to have that charge withdrawn. Leave is granted. The charge is withdrawn. You are a young man, I hope you do well, but it will be up to you and particularly what you do with alcohol. Do you understand that? Return him to custody. Thank you.

    JUDGMENT1. James Duncan Smith was found guilty by a jury on 11 May 2009 of nine charges of sexual offences. I have heard evidence and submissions on the appropriate sentences to impose, and I am now embarking on the sentencing of Mr Smith. 2. First I should list what the charges for the offences were and the penalties which Parliament has attached to those offences.3. Mr Smith was found guilty of committing an indecent assault on the victim between 1 May 2001 and 1 December 2002. That is an offence under s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and has a maximum penalty of ten years fixed to it by Parliament. He was found guilty of having sexual intercourse with the same person, then a child aged under ten, during the same period. That offence is against s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. 4. I add at this stage that I have mentioned the name of the victim of these sexual offences. It is an offence to publish that name outside this courtroom or any means of identifying her. 5. I return to the offences which Mr Smith has been found guilty of. Four offences were all committed, so far as the indictment was concerned, between 1 November 2002 and 31 July 2003. Mr Gibson, who appeared as Crown Prosecutor on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, argued that those offences should be regarded as having occurred on one occasion shortly after November 2002. There appears to be no dispute about that. Three of the offences were indecent assaults on a person being under ten years of age, namely nine, and the victim was the same, the victim. Those offences were the same as the first offence, namely an offence against s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, and they all carry a maximum of ten years imprisonment. The fourth offence which occurred at that time was an offence of having sexual intercourse with the victim who was then under ten; she was nine years of age. That is also an offence under s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. 6. The final three offences were also all committed on the same occasion. The indictment pleads that that occasion was between 31 December 2004 and 2 January 2006 and I accept, as Mr Gibson argued, that the offences all occurred on 1 January 2005. One of the offences, the most serious, was having sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely that she was under sixteen. That is an offence against s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. In addition, Parliament has fixed to that offence a standard non-parole period of ten years imprisonment. The two other offences were both against s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act of indecent assaults against the victim in circumstances of aggravation. Those circumstances were the same in each case, namely that she was under sixteen years of age. Those offences each carry a maximum of seven years imprisonment. Once again Parliament has fixed to those offences a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. 7. I formally convict Mr Smith of all of the offences of which the jury found him guilty. 8. Next, it is important to record succinctly just what happened which gave rise to Mr Smith committing these offences. The victim’s father was [Mr V]. He and Mr Smith were friends. They shared an interest in pipe bands. Mr V and his wife, the victim’s mother, had separated and Mr V had access to the victim and her sister during certain periods of time including weekends and school holidays. On some of those occasions Mr V would take his daughters to visit his friend Mr Smith and Mr Smith’s family. Mr Smith lived at St Clair where all of these offences occurred. It was during these visits, all of which relevantly involved overnight stays, that Mr Smith committed the offences against the victim. 9. On the first occasion the victim was asleep in the lounge room of Mr Smith’s house. Her sister was there, as well as her father and Mr Smith’s own children. During the night Mr Smith approached the victim and woke her up. He rolled her over from her side to her back and took off her pyjamas and underwear. He stroked her vagina. He then touched her bottom and put his finger into her anus. This hurt her and she asked him to stop. He said ”Okay”, but added that she should not tell anyone as they would get into trouble. The victim said nothing. Mr Smith then touched her breasts with his hand and then went back into the dining room nearby where he fell asleep. 10. The second series of offences occurred in similar circumstances, where the victim was visiting the Smiths with her father. Once again she was asleep in the lounge room. Her sister was there and Mr Smith’s children were there as well. Again Mr Smith woke her up during the night. Everyone else was asleep. On this occasion he pulled his penis from his pants and, as the agreed facts say, grabbed the victim’s hand and put it on to his penis. He then moved her arm back and forth whilst she was gripping his penis before he let go. He then grabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her head towards his penis until her head was close to his penis, which was in an erect state. He then removed her pyjamas and underwear and began touching her vagina, and then slowly put his finger inside her vagina and moved it around. When he had finished that he put his hand up her shirt and grabbed her breasts and started to squeeze them. Before leaving he squeezed one of the cheeks of her bottom. He then stopped after a short time and went to sleep at a nearby table. The victim went back to sleep as well.11. The third occasion when offences occurred was, as I have said, on 1 January 2005. There had been a reunion of persons interested in pipe bands at a hotel, and that included Mr V and Mr Smith and others who were interested. As it happened Mr V met on that occasion a woman named [Ms A] who later became his wife. That was the first occasion that they met, or at least very early in their relationship. The agreed facts record that Mr Smith suggested to Mr V that he and Ms A leave his house once they had all returned after time at the hotel and that he, Mr Smith, and his wife would look after the children. Mr V and Ms A left together and another person named Andrew Sneddon was driven home by Mr Smith’s wife. 12. That night all the children again slept in the lounge room. Again Mr Smith woke the victim. He removed her shorts and underwear. He grabbed her legs and spread them. He knelt in front of her and started stroking her vagina. Then he put his finger into her vagina and moved his finger around. This hurt the victim who asked him to stop. She said “Please stop, it hurts.” Mr Smith continued what he was doing. He then started touching her breasts. After that he stopped and went back to the kitchen table where he went to sleep. Later on that night the victim woke up. She realised that her father was not there. She approached Mr Smith, who asked her to sit on his knee. She did so and he took the opportunity to put his hand inside her pyjama pants and touched one of the cheeks of her bottom. 13. It is common ground, and indeed it is recorded in the agreed facts, that Mr Smith touched the victim in a sexual manner whenever she stayed at his house. The only relevance of that fact is that the offences for which I am sentencing Mr Smith should not be regarded as isolated offences.14. I need to make a finding regarding the last occasion when Mr V, the victim’s father, and Ms A left Mr Smith’s house, because Mr Gibson argued that they were positively encouraged to leave and this was an aggravating feature of the offence. Mr Porter, who appeared at the trial and in these proceedings for Mr Smith, argued that Mr V would have left in any event. I have reviewed the evidence of Mr V and Ms A and Mr Sneddon who was there at the time. 15. Mr V’s evidence included an account that Mr Smith told him that it would be a good idea if he and Lisa took off “and we’ll look after the kids. They will be fine.” But Mr V asked if that would be all right because he did not really want to leave the children behind, and Mr Smith said that it would be fine. Mr V said that they were ushered out the door by Mr Smith. Put by Mr Porter that he did not need any encouragement from Mr Smith to want to leave the home that night, Mr V said that he had not planned to go there - which I am taking to mean at Ms A’s house, which the evidence discloses Mr V and Ms A returned to for that evening. He agreed with the proposition that Mr Smith basically pushed him out the door. Mr V said that he would like to say goodbye to the children, but was told by Mr Smith that they would be fine and that Mr Smith would tell them where they were going. 16. Ms A gave evidence about the same occasion. She said that Mr Smith shepherded them up the hallway and said to them “Go on quick” and “shut the door in our faces.” When asked about what she meant by “shepherded”, she said that he walked with his arms around their shoulders “essentially giving us nowhere to go but to follow the direction he was leading us.” She said that he had a very positive and encouraging tone of voice when he was ushering them out the door. She also said that at that point she had not planned to spend the evening with Mr V. 17. Mr Sneddon was another guest at the house that evening and, as I said, was driven home by Mrs Smith. But he was there when Mr V and Ms A left. He recalled Mr Smith encouraging them to leave and indicating that the children would be fine and that he would take care of them. He saw Mr Smith’s attitude as doing a favour to Mr V and encouraging him to spend the evening with Ms A.18. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Smith positively encouraged Mr Vand Ms A to leave the house on that occasion. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a motivation in him taking those steps was to provide him with an opportunity to be alone in the house that evening. By alone, I mean without the victim’s father being present. 19. I need to make assessments of the objective seriousness of the nine offences which Mr Smith has committed. The phrase “objective seriousness” means just how serious examples these particular crimes are of the offences which are contained in the Crimes Act. 20. Insofar as the first offence is concerned, that is, the indecent assault, I am satisfied that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness - a phrase which is convenient to use, although I am not using it in the context of considering any statutory standard non-parole period. I regard it as in the middle of the range of objective seriousness because the indecent assault involved the offender touching the skin of the victim and, indeed, touching her in her genital area, on her vagina. It also involved some pressure by telling her that they would get into trouble if she told anyone. It also, I am satisfied, involved an abuse of trust. 21. In making that last finding, I should observe that Mr Porter submitted that that finding is not open in circumstances where the victim’s father was present in the house at the same time. I do not accept that submission. Mr Smith was a close family friend of the victim’s family and she, the victim, was a guest in his house. The circumstances in which the victim’s father brought his children with him when he visited the Smiths obviously involved him trusting his friend not to sexually assault either of his children whilst everybody was asleep. A similar trust obviously resided in the victim, the victim, as well. For those reasons I regard the offences committed on the first two occasions as involving a breach of trust, and I should add that Mr Porter appropriately conceded that the last offences did involve a breach of trust. 22. I return to considering the objective seriousness of the offences and turn to the second offence, which was the sexual intercourse with a child under ten. I regard that offence as just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The penetration involved was digital. I appreciate that there is no law that provides that digital penetration is any more or less serious than any other kind of penetration, but each case must be assessed on its circumstances. This form of penetration could have been far more serious. For example, penile penetration of a child under ten I would regard as significantly more serious than what occurred on this occasion. That it was of relatively short duration is another factor which I take into account, as well as the fact that the victim was just below the age at which this offence could be committed. In a sense that is not a mitigating factor; it is the reverse of the proposition that if the victim was significantly below the age for committing this sort of offence, then it would be a far more serious example of that offence. Although it involved a degree of coercion in the sense of telling the victim not to report it and an abuse of trust, I do regard the offence as falling just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.23. I turn to consider the four offences which occurred shortly after November 2002, the subject of counts 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the indictment. I regard the offences in counts 3 and 4 as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That is because they involved the offender requiring the victim to touch his own person. In addition, it required her to touch and manipulate his erect penis. It also involved her, as the facts record, grabbing the victim so far as count 3 is concerned, and grabbing her shoulder and pulling her towards his penis so far as the second offence was concerned, which I note did not involve any touching of the penis but did involve the grabbing and pulling. I regard these, for those reasons, as within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I regard count 6 as below the range of objective seriousness, involving squeezing one of the cheeks of the victim’s bottom. In addition, I regard count 5, which is the sexual intercourse, as below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for similar reasons as I regarded count 2 as being in the same category, namely that the penetration was digital and for a relatively short period of time, although it was committed in breach of trust.24. I turn now to consider the final three offences which were committed on 1 January 2005. It is significant to note that all of these offences were committed whilst Mr Smith was on bail. He had been charged with sexually assaulting another young girl. That matter had not been dealt with at the time, but a court had given him his liberty obviously on condition that he behave himself. He abused that liberty by taking the opportunity to commit further offences of the same kind against the victim. That is, in my opinion, a significantly aggravating feature of these offences. In addition, each of these offences, as I said as conceded by Mr Porter, involved a breach of trust. I also take into account as a generally aggravating circumstance that there was a degree of planning so far as these three offences were concerned. The degree of planning was limited and opportunistic. Nevertheless, Mr Smith had encouraged the departure of the victim’s father so that he would be absent from the house that evening. 25. I should add at this point that I am not of the same view so far as the other offences are concerned, namely counts 1 to 6 inclusive. Mr Gibson submitted that the offences which occurred in November 2002 should be regarded as being aggravated by a degree of planning. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is the case. I regard the offences as being opportunistic in those circumstances. 26. The last offences, however, were attended, as I said, by a limited degree of planning and the positive encouragement to put the offender in the situation that he would be free to commit these crimes against the victim.27. So far as count 7 is concerned, the offence of having sexual intercourse with a person under sixteen knowing that she was not consenting, I regard that offence as falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I take into account that it was an offence committed on bail and that it was in breach of trust. The victim was considerably younger than the age of sixteen, namely eleven and a half years. It was attended by the limited degree of planning to which I have referred. Despite the victim saying that it hurt, Mr Smith kept going in what he was doing. 28. So far as counts 8 and 9 are concerned, I regard them too as falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That is mainly - so far as count 8 is concerned - because of the circumstances in which it was committed, namely that he was on bail and had encouraged the victim’s father to leave the home. Those factors are relevant to the last offence, but so far as the last offence was concerned the victim had actually approached Mr Smith in circumstances where she was distressed by the absence of her father. Not only did he fail to comfort her but he took the opportunity to sexually assault her when the victim was in that condition.29. I have taken into account Mr Smith’s criminal record, which is part of exhibit A. I accept Mr Porter’s submission that it affords no leniency to Mr Smith so far as any mitigating of the sentence is concerned. It is not an aggravating factor but, as I say, it affords him no leniency. 30. So far as Mr Smith’s personal circumstances are concerned, they are set out in a pre-sentence report prepared by a probation and parole officer dated 17 August 2009, which became exhibit SB. In summary, the probation and parole officer pointed out that Mr Smith is fifty-five and that his twenty-five year marriage had been formally dissolved earlier this year. He has limited contact with his four children whilst he is in custody, but has a supportive older sister who visits him in custody. His developmental years were affected by his parents’ relationship. He has had a good history of employment. It recorded that he had received some brief court directed psychiatric interventions, but Mr Smith claims to have gained no insight. It records that he was interviewed in 2006 for an assessment of his potential risk of re-offending. The report records that he fell within the high risk category due to his prior convictions, but, as the report and Mr Porter pointed out, Mr Smith was returned into custody from being on parole a short time after he had been released on parole in respect of an earlier offence. The report said that Mr Smith would be assessed for a sex offender’s program within custody and he could undertake the custody based intensive treatment program which could be followed up within the community. 31. It is likely that Mr Smith will serve good deal of his time in custody, if not all of it, on protection. He has been on protection up until now. Some courses have been available to him on protection. The authorities indicate that there is limited weight that can be put on an argument that an offender will serve his time on protection in the absence of evidence that it will be a positive disadvantage for him and so far as I can see there is no such evidence in this case.32. I have been directed to the purposes of sentencing in a case such as this. I should add that it is quite clear to me that no other sentence than full-time custody is appropriate for the serious crimes which Mr Smith has committed in this case. Both Mr Porter and Mr Gibson agree that specific and general deterrence are obviously significant factors to take into account in this case. In addition, Mr Gibson points to the need for protection of the community and for a clear denunciation of these kinds of offences, as well as making sure that Mr Smith is adequately punished for these crimes. As Yeldham J said in Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445 the Court of Criminal Appeal “has said time and again that sexual assaults upon young children, especially by those who stand in a position of trust to them, must be severely punished, and that those who engage in this evil conduct must go to gaol for a long period of time, not only to punish them, but also in an endeavour to deter others who may have similar inclinations.”Maxwell J added at 446 in the same case that “the community looks to the courts to deal with persons convicted of serious sexual assaults, or abuses upon young children, in such a way as to provide some measure of protection for young persons, and some measure of deterrence to those persons who contemplate similar activities.”I regard those principles as relevant in sentencing Mr Smith in this case.33. One matter that I need to deal with is the question of the standard non-parole periods attached to the offences contained in counts 7, 8 and 9 in the indictment. Section 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that a court is to set the standard non-parole period, “unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter then the standard non-parole period”. The section goes on to provide that the reasons for which a court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in s 21A of the same Act.34 I have reviewed the provisions of s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as well as the provision which entitles me to take into account any other matters required or permitted to be taken into account under any Act or law. Mr Smith is not a person of good character and his prospects of rehabilitation cannot be described as good. Indeed, I can find nothing in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which in my opinion would warrant a departure from the standard non-parole periods in this case. 35. Mr Smith has been in custody on these offences alone from 31 August 2007 and I propose to commence the earliest of the sentences from that date. I will fix a sentence for each count, but many of the sentences will be partly or wholly concurrent with other sentences. That is because I have taken into account the principle of totality and regard a failure to adjust the sentences and a failure to allow them to run partly concurrently as producing an overall sentence which would far exceed the criminality involved. Nevertheless, the overall sentence must be very severe because of the crimes which Mr Smith has committed.36. I have also taken into account a submission by Mr Porter that special circumstances exist which would warrant an adjustment in the ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term. I do not accept that submission. The additional term which will be eventually fixed when I sentence Mr Smith will be of such a length that he will have adequate time and opportunity to pursue any appropriate rehabilitation. Indeed, the ratio between the non-parole period and the additional period is slightly greater than the seventy-five per cent acknowledged in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I make that observation to indicate that I have not overlooked that fact. 37. I propose to sentence Mr Smith as follows. If you would stand up, Mr Smith.38. For count number 2 of sexual intercourse with the victim aged under ten, I fix a sentence of five years fixed term to commence 31 August 2007 and to conclude on 30 August 2012. 39. For count 1 of indecent assault with a person under ten, I impose a fixed sentence of four years to commence on 31 October 2008 and to expire on 30 October 2012.40. In respect of counts 3 and 4 of acts of indecency with a child under ten, I fix fixed and concurrent sentences of four years each to commence on 31 December 2009 and to expire on 30 December 2013.41. For count 5 which was the sexual intercourse with a child under ten, I fix a sentence of five years fixed term, to commence on 31 October 2008 and to expire on 30 October 2013.42. For count 6 of indecent assault on a child under ten, I impose a fixed terms of three years imprisonment from 31 December 2010, expiring on 30 December 2013.43. For count 7 of sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, I set as a non-parole period the standard non-parole period of ten years which will commence on 31 March 2009 and will expire on 30 March 2019. There is an additional term of three years from 31 March 2019 to 30 March 2022.44. For counts 8 and 9 of indecent assaults in circumstances of aggravation, I set as the non-parole period for each offence the standard non-parole period of five years to commence on 31 March 2014 and to expire on 30 March 2019. There is an additional term of one year to commence on 31 March 2019 and to expire on 30 March 2020.Ms Sawagid, Mr Porter, the first question is whether there are any factual matters in the sentence which I need to correct, or deal with?SAWAGID: Only one, your Honour, you referred to [Ms A], her last name is [Ms A]. It was a mistake in the facts. I think Mr Gibson pointed out to you on the last occasion.45. The transcript should note, and I will correct it, where I refer to Ms A that should be Ms A.Thanks, Ms Sawagid, anything else?SAWAGID: Nothing further, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: In a moment I will ask you about the mathematics. Mr Porter, any matters of fact?PORTER: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Porter, Ms Sawagid, so far as the mathematics are concerned?PORTER: The mathematics look fine to me, your Honour.SAWAGID: Yes, your Honour, I can see no problem with them.PORTER: 14 years seven months is the total term.HIS HONOUR: The total term is 14 years and seven months and the non-parole period 11 years and seven months.PORTER: Just under the ratio.HIS HONOUR: Yes, it is a slight - when you say just under, just over--PORTER: Just. HIS HONOUR: Yes, you are right, the ratio would have been about - anyway, yes, you are right. 46. So far as any parole, it is not a matter for me, it is for the Parole Authority, but I would recommend that they consider any community based - as in the pre-sentence report - maintenance programs. I recommend the Parole Authority, when considering Mr Smith’s release to parole, consider the desirability of follow up within the community of maintenance of any programs which he has undertaken in custody.47. Mr Smith, I have sentenced you to a total of fourteen years and seven months imprisonment. It commenced on 31 August 2007 when you went into custody. Your sentence will finish on 30 March 2022. Your non-parole period is eleven years and seven months. It also commenced on 31 August 2007 and it will finish on 30 March 2019. That is just under ten years from now. On 30 March 2019 you will be eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not is a matter for the Parole Authority, not for me, but the first date on which it appears you are eligible for release is 20 March 2019. Do you understand that? All right.

    1 YOUNG JA : I agree with Latham J 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J :  I agree with Latham J 
     
      
    3 LATHAM J : The applicant, Jennifer Meager, seeks leave to appeal against the asserted severity of the sentence imposed upon her on 5 September 2008 for one count of supply heroin, pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act), following a plea of guilty. The offence was committed between 31 October 2006 and 22 November 2006. It consisted of 14 separate supplies amounting to just under 3 g of heroin. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced to a non parole period of 2 years and 6 months, with a balance of term of 2 years. It is submitted that the applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance, given that an alleged co-offender, Narelle Collier, was sentenced to a non parole period of 2 years, with a balance of term of one year for (amongst others) an offence under s 25(1) of the Act, relating to a greater quantity of heroin over a longer period of time. It is also submitted that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    5 As for the parity argument, the Crown contention is that the applicant falls at the first hurdle, in that Ms Collier cannot be legitimately described as a co-offender. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine the circumstances of the offending in each case. 
     
      
       
      The Association Between the Applicant and Ms Collier 
       
      
    6 The circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence by the applicant were set out by his Honour Judge Nield (the Judge) in the course of his remarks on sentence :- 
     
      
       
        
        From about 27 September 2006 to about 1 December 2006 police lawfully intercepted conversations between Narelle Collier and other people on a mobile telephone service used by Narelle Collier. These intercepted conversations revealed that, as well as supplying heroin to users of it, Narelle Collier was supplying heroin to other people, who in turn supplied to users of it. These people were Patrick McDaid and [the applicant]. 
         
        Police investigations revealed that Narelle Collier would obtain heroin for Patrick McDaid and the [applicant] from a supplier of it in Sydney, that she would hand over the heroin to Patrick McDaid or the [applicant] at Woy Woy railway station or at her home in Umina or at their home in East Gosford, that Patrick McDaid or the [applicant] would supply heroin to users of it in the Gosford and East Gosford shopping districts, and that Patrick McDaid or the [applicant] would pay for the heroin supplied to them by Narelle Collier by depositing money into the bank account of Narelle Collier or by Narelle Collier withdrawing money from Patrick McDaid's bank account.  
         
         ….. on numerous occasions between 1 November 2006 and 21 November 2006 the [applicant] supplied heroin to users of it. 
         
        On 1 December 2006 police, armed with a search warrant, attended at the home in which Patrick McDaid and the [applicant] lived. Police arrested both Patrick McDaid and the [applicant]. During the search of the home police found paraphernalia of drug supply including gloves, razor blades, water balloons and some cannabis. 
        
       
      
    7 It is relevant to observe at this point that the applicant's counsel on sentence sought to compare the circumstances of the applicant’s offending with that of Mr McDaid. In other words, in so far as parity was an issue in the proceedings below, Mr McDaid was characterised as the relevant co-offender, not Ms Collier. These submissions were also reflected in the remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        Another factor not mentioned in s 21A of the Act is parity of sentencing. On 6 March 2008 I sentenced Patrick McDaid to imprisonment for five years and one month, with a non-parole period of three years and a parole period of two years and one month, for a single rolled up offence of supplying a prohibited drug to users of it on 26 occasions between 31 October 2006 and 23 November 2006, with a total weight of the drug being 6.5 g. There are similarities and differences between Patrick McDaid and the [applicant], with the main difference being that he admitted having supplied a prohibited drug on 26 occasions, with a total weight of the drug being 6.5 g, whereas she has admitted having supplied a prohibited drug on 14 occasions, with a total weight of the drug being 2.9 g.  
        Notwithstanding that they were principals in the business of supplying prohibited drugs to users of them 
        , I see this difference as the reason to differentiate between them. 
        
       
      
    8 The underlined passage in the remarks above demonstrates the basis of the Judge’s approach to sentencing. The applicant was not regarded by the Judge as a co-offender of Ms Collier’s, rather she was regarded as an independent supplier who happened to source her heroin from Ms Collier. The applicant’s arrest was merely a by-product of a covert police operation targeting Ms Collier.  
     
      
    9 Ms Collier was sentenced by the Judge four months before the applicant. Unlike the applicant, who had pleaded guilty on the second day of her trial, Ms Collier pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and received a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of her pleas. In addition to the offence under s 25(1) of the Act, Ms Collier was sentenced in respect of two offences under s 25A(1) of the Act. The s 25(1) offence related to the supply of at least 80g of heroin between 27 September 2006 and 1 December 2006. Ms Collier received a sentence of 3 years imprisonment, comprising a non parole period of two years, for this offence. However, the sentences she received for the s 25A(1) offences and a degree of accumulation resulted in an aggregate sentence of 6 years imprisonment with an aggregate non parole period of 4 years. 
     
      
       
      No Issue of Parity 
       
      
    10 The applicant’s counsel maintains that Ms Collier was a co-offender, so as to attract the parity principle, but in the alternative it is contended that this Court should strive to produce consistency in sentencing as between offenders who commit related offences. The applicant relies upon what was said by Blanch J in Mitchell v R [2008] NSWCCA 192 at [8] – [10] :-  
     
      
       
        
        The first ground of appeal seeks to raise the question of a justifiable sense of grievance and reliance is placed on the line of authorities following  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606. In that case Mason J said at page 613: 
         
        ""... a court of appeal is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance, by reducing a sentence, which is not excessive or inappropriate considered apart from the discrepancy, to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate."" 
         
        9 That case was a case involving co-offenders and this issue normally arises in cases where sentences have been imposed on co-offenders. This is not such a case because the applicant and Parker purchased the drugs individually although with the purpose of going to the same function in Queensland and distributing the drugs to the other members of their party. Parker also said he was aware Mitchell had the drugs. 10 Although not a case of discrepancy in sentencing of co-offenders, this is a case of markedly different sentences imposed on two men who were living in the same house, who were each engaged in the same activity for the same purpose on the same day. 
        
       
      
    11 McClellan CJ at CL expressly agreed with the orders proposed by Blanch J only on the ground of manifest excess. Grove J agreed with Blanch J. Having regard to other decisions of this Court, to which I refer below, I would confine the reach of Mitchell to the facts of that particular case.  
     
      
    12 The applicant’s arguments in this appeal bear all the hallmarks of the arguments advanced in R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283 ; (2005) 155 A Crim R 555. It is convenient to refer to what was there said by Johnson J, at [65] – [72], with whom Simpson J and Rothman J agreed :-  
     
      
       
        
        Senior Counsel for the Applicant accepts that Mr Chandra and the Applicant were not co-offenders and that the normal parity principle does not strictly apply. However, he contends that there are similarities between the criminal conduct of the two offenders, their related arrests and parallel criminal proceedings in such a way as to attract, by analogy, the parity principle. It is submitted that the Applicant has been left with a sense of grievance which, in all the circumstances, is justifiable.  
         
        66 As the Applicant and Mr Chandra were not co-offenders, the parity principle reflected in  
        Lowe v The Queen  
        (1984) 154 CLR 606 and  
        Jones v The Queen  
        [1993] 67 ALJR 376 has no application.  
         
        67 This Court has held that the parity principle is not to be applied when a ground of appeal invites comparison between sentences imposed upon two offenders, who are not co-offenders, simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. In  
        R v Morgan  
        (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, Hunt CJ at CL (Allen J and Loveday AJ agreeing) said at 371:  
         
        “It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range.” 
         
        68 In  
        R v F 
         (2002) 132 A Crim R 308, it was submitted on behalf of an offender that the Court should treat the sentence imposed in a different case upon a different offender as being a  
        “benchmark” 
         which ought be followed. The Court rejected this argument. Simpson J said at 315:  
         
        “Consistency in sentencing may be achieved by the slavish adoption, by a subsequent court, of a sentence selected by an earlier court when the facts are comparable. However, that would be consistency purchased at the cost of the sacrifice of the proper exercise of judicial discretion. Within the bounds of the appropriate range of sentences, each sentencing judge (either at first instance or following appeal) must bring to bear his or her own independent assessment of the particular case.  
         
        I do not find the argument in relation to the desirability of consistency in sentencing persuasive in this case. Consistency is not derived from a single case. Consistency in sentencing will be achieved from a range of cases involving similar features, and also variables. It depends upon the accumulated wisdom and experience of sentencing judges. In my opinion a single case is inadequate to enable a principled consistent approach. 
         
        … 
         
        Moreover, while consistency in sentencing is, no doubt, an important goal, equally important for the administration of justice is the public perception that sentences imposed by criminal courts are appropriate to the nature and seriousness of the crime committed.” 
         
        Meagher JA at 309-310 agreed with Simpson J, but preferred to use the words  
        “more important” 
         rather than  
        “equally important” 
         in the last quoted passage. Howie J expressed a similar view to Meagher JA in this respect at 316-317. 
         
        69 In  
        R v George  
        (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47, the Court (Wood CJ at CL, Adams and Kirby JJ) approached a ground of appeal which invited comparison with sentences in other case in the following way:  
         
        “We are unable to gain any meaningful assistance from a reference to these cases. It is necessary to restate that the practice, which appears to have developed in recent times, of approaching sentence appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor justified by authority: see  
        Regina v Morgan 
         (1993) 70 A Crim R 368;  
        Regina v Salameh 
         NSWCCA 9 June 1994 and  
        Regina v Trevenna 
         [2004] NSWCCA 43 per Barr J at 98 to 101. At the most, other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing, which in the case of manslaughter is wider than for any other offence.  
         
        The difference in objective and subjective culpability, which is found in these decisions, is such that any search for a correlation between the case at hand and another decided case is to ignore the judicial discretion which is involved in the individual sentencing exercise required. As Barr J said in  
        Trevenna 
        , ‘Even if it were possible to say that the culpability in two unrelated cases was the same it would not be correct to say, if the sentences were different, that for that reason alone one of them must be wrong.’ Inter alia any such approach would have to assume that the other was correct, and that is an assumption which cannot logically be made.” 
         
        70 Similar sentiments have been expressed by this Court when arguments have been advanced on appeal comparing sentences imposed for offences of dishonesty or fraud committed by persons who are not co-offenders:  
        R v Hawker  
        [2001] NSWCCA 148 at paragraphs 17-18;  
        R v Swadling  
        [2004] NSWCCA 421 at paragraphs 29, 54;  
        R v Martin  
        [2005] NSWCCA 190 at paragraph 56. In each of those cases, the Court has emphasised that far greater assistance is derived from references to general sentencing policy.  
         
        71 In  
        R v Singh  
        [2001] NSWCCA 424, an argument was advanced that an unjustified disparity existed between the overall sentence imposed upon the Applicant when compared with others who might be considered to be his co-offenders. It was submitted for the Applicant that he was one of a group of offenders, most of whom had been dealt with by different District Court Judges, in respect of the sale of amphetamines from a particular café in Kings Cross. In the course of rejecting this argument, Howie J (Grove J agreeing) said at paragraph 12:  
         
        “The applicant was never charged with any offence in relation to the supply of drugs to, or by, the persons at the café. The applicant was not a co-offender of any person other than the unidentified person or persons who supplied him with the drugs that he on-supplied to the operative. The supply to the undercover officer was only in the most indirect way connected to the criminal conduct emanating from the café and for which other persons were sentenced. As Judge Woods noted, the applicant was not the target of the police operation and, in his Honour’s words, he ‘simply became roped in’. Regardless of what sentences the persons connected with the drug dealing from the café received, the applicant could not have a justifiable sense of grievance about them. The sentences of those persons are no more relevant than would be the sentences imposed upon other associates of the applicant for unrelated drug offences. Although Judge Woods said that he would bear in mind the sentence imposed upon one of the barmen at the café for supplying ecstasy, I cannot understand why he did so.” 
         
        72 It was accepted in this case that the Applicant and Mr Chandra were not co-offenders. Whatever may have been the position with the offences contained in the original indictment, it is the case that none of the offences to which the two offenders ultimately pleaded guilty were committed by them as co-offenders. As will be seen, it appears that there was some association between the two offenders and some overlap in their activities. However, I do not consider that this attracts the parity principle to the Applicant’s case. In my view, the correct approach to the present argument involves application of the principles referred to in  
        Morgan 
        ,  
        F 
        ,  
        George 
         and  
        Singh  
        referred to above.  
        
       
      
    13 I agree with the Crown’s submission that this applicant and Ms Collier were not co-offenders and, for that reason, the parity principle has no application. More importantly, the applicant’s submissions assume that there is a marked difference between the penalty imposed upon Ms Collier for the s 25(1) offence and the penalty imposed upon the applicant for the like offence. It is not such a significant difference in my view. The other assumption underlying the applicant’s argument is that the sentence imposed upon Ms Collier is correct. I would not readily conclude that is so, simply because there has been no Crown appeal. 
     
      
    14 This ground of the appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Manifest Excess 
       
      
    15 The Judge noted that “supplying a prohibited drug, whatever is the drug and whatever is the reward for supplying it, to users of it, is a serious offence.” The Judge referred to the fact that the applicant was engaged as a principal in the business of supplying drugs. Whilst it was accepted that the offence arose out of the need to fund the applicant’s own addiction, the Judge quite properly rejected this as an excuse, which did nothing to diminish the gravity of the offence. The fact that the applicant was a “street level supplier” stood in the same category.  
     
      
    16 The offence was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was subject to a good behaviour bond at the time of the commission of the offence. That bond was imposed on 17 October 2005 for a period of two years in relation to a drive under the influence offence. The applicant had other convictions recorded at the same time for possess prohibited drug. Her criminal history reflected the fact that she had been addicted to heroin for a period of 10 years. 
     
      
    17 The applicant's subjective case was the subject of extensive comment during the remarks on sentence. The applicant was 43 years of age when she committed the offence and 45 years of age at the time of sentence. She is the second of seven children, and was sexually abused by her father at the age of 13. She did not disclose the offence until she was 35 years of age. The applicant was in full-time employment between 1979 and 1999. She is single, never having married, and enjoys good physical health.  
     
      
    18 The Judge accepted that her prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable and that she had made considerable progress towards ceasing her use of prohibited drugs and weaning herself off methadone. The applicant had also commenced a business administration course at TAFE. In the light of these findings, the Judge considered both personal and general deterrence to be important in the sentencing exercise. Given the applicant’s positive steps towards rehabilitation, the Judge found special circumstances. None of these findings are now criticised by the applicant. 
     
      
    19 The principal thrust of the applicant’s argument on this ground is that, when regard is had to the Judicial Commission statistics, the Judge’s starting point before applying a discount of 10% falls within the top 13% of all sentences imposed, and that the ultimate head sentence of 4 years and 6 months falls within the top 15% of all sentences imposed. It is further submitted that the non-parole period falls into the top 22% of non-parole periods or fixed terms imposed. 
     
      
    20 This submission does not establish that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was outside the range legitimately available to the Judge in the exercise of a broad sentencing discretion. Even if, as the applicant asserts, the sentence is a harsh one in the light of the applicant's subjective case, that does not entitle this Court to intervene. I would reject this ground of the appeal. 
     
      
    21 I propose the following orders :- 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal allowed. 
      
     2. Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J.  
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of McCallum J in draft. I agree with the orders she proposes. The sentences in my opinion were so inadequate and the sentencing remarks so obviously infested with error that it is highly likely that, if the Crown had appealed, the sentences would have been significantly increased. 
     
      
    3 The matters were clearly inappropriate for sentencing before the Local Court having regard to their seriousness, the applicant’s criminal record and the fact that he was on parole when he committed all the offences and on bail when he committed most of them. Therefore, the maximum sentences that would have applied had the matters been dealt with in the Local Court and the statistics for sentences imposed in that jurisdiction were totally irrelevant. Yet these were matters that weighed heavily upon the sentencing judge in determining the sentences he imposed. The “extra curial punishment” was so minor and the offences committed by the applicant so serious that it should have been given no weight at all. In my opinion the applicant should consider himself very fortunate indeed that he received such undeserved leniency. 
     
      
    4 McCALLUM J: Wayne Garland seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 6 November 2008. 
     
      
    5 The offences for which he was sentenced that day were two charges of larceny contrary to s117 of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment, two charges of intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging property contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and two charges of possessing safebreaking implements contrary to s 114(1)(b) of the Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. Eight further offences on two Form 1 documents were taken into account in accordance with the provisions of s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    6 The applicant pleaded guilty to all charges in the Local Court. The prosecutor elected to have the offences dealt with on indictment, apparently on the basis that the applicant had a lengthy record of prior convictions and had committed the offences whilst he was on parole. He was accordingly committed to the District Court for sentence.  
     
      
    7 The applicant had been released to parole on 25 February 2008 in respect of sentences imposed on him in 2004 for two charges of armed robbery. On 1 April 2008 he committed the offences which formed the basis of the first Form 1. He was arrested on that occasion after being seen looking inside a number of cars. He was charged with larceny of a car radio, “goods in custody” ($9.20 in cash) and possession of implements to drive a conveyance.  
     
      
    8 The applicant was subsequently released on bail for those offences. However, on 23 April 2008, his parole was revoked in respect of the sentences for the two armed robbery offences and a warrant was issued for his arrest.  
     
      
    9 All of the other offences dealt with by the sentencing Judge involved raids on ticket-vending machines at various railway stations. The first series of charges related to offences committed at Schofields Railway Station on 6 May 2008. The applicant and another male entered the station in the early hours of the morning wearing balaclavas and gloves. They broke into the ticket machine using crowbars, a screwdriver and a sledgehammer. They removed two cash boxes containing a total of $1,146. The damage to the ticket machine was estimated to be $11,221.  
     
      
    10 The Judge noted that the pleas of guilty were entered at an early opportunity and reduced the sentences by 25% on that account. The applicant was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) for the offence of larceny, a fixed term of 15 months imprisonment;  
       
       
      (b) for the offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging property, a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment; 
       
       
      (c) for the offence of possessing safebreaking implements, a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment. 
       
      
    11 Each sentence was fixed to commence on 29 August 2008, which was the date on which the applicant had been committed for sentence in the Local Court. 
     
      
    12 The second series of charges related to a similar incident involving a ticket machine at Windsor Railway Station. At about 2.00am on 19 May 2008 police patrolling the Windsor area were notified of the offences as they were in progress. They went to the station where they found the applicant and another male near the ticket machine. The machine was open and the cash box had been removed and placed on the station platform. The cash box contained $6,281. The applicant had a sports bag containing a large sledgehammer, two crowbars, hammers, screwdrivers and assorted tools. The damage caused to the ticket machine at Windsor was estimated to be in the sum of $3,186. 
     
      
    13 In respect of those offences the sentences imposed were: 
     
      
       
      (a) for the offence of larceny, a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 1 March 2009 and a balance of term of 9 months; 
       
       
      (b) for the offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging property, a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 1 March 2009; 
       
       
      (c) for the offence of possessing safebreaking implements, taking into account the offences on the two Form 1 documents, a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 1 March 2009 and a balance of term of 12 months. 
       
      
    14 The offences taken into account on the second Form 1 were charges arising from similar raids on ticket machines at Marayong Railway Station on 1 May 2008 and at Rooty Hill Railway Station on 12 May 2008. No cash was stolen from Marayong but there was damage to the ticket machine estimated to be in the sum of $7,345. At Rooty Hill, the offenders removed a cash box containing $2,040. The damage caused to the machine there was estimated to be in the sum of $11,573. 
     
      
    15 The total effective sentence before the applicant is eligible for release to parole is a period of 18 months expiring on 28 February 2010 with a balance of term of 12 months expiring on 28 February 2011.  
     
      
    16 The applicant was represented by a solicitor at the sentence hearing. The solicitor called the applicant to give evidence. He also tendered a report from a psychologist, Kathryn Wakely and a two-page letter written by the applicant to the Court explaining how he came to commit the offences.  
     
      
    17 The psychologist’s report recited the applicant’s history of using alcohol and cannabis from the age of 13. The offender told her that, from the age of 10, he had lived on his own in a granny flat at the back of his parents home because the house was too small to accommodate them. He reported that he used to sneak out and associate with older teenagers who introduced him to illegal drugs. He first tried heroin at the age of 16 and described that as his problem drug. The psychologist’s findings relate principally to the applicant’s history of drug abuse. Her examination of the applicant produced the unsurprising conclusion that he probably has a substance dependence disorder. She did not identify the existence of any mental illness such as to reduce the applicant’s culpability for the offences.  
     
      
    18 Before closing the case for the applicant on sentence, the solicitor indicated that he wished to make a submission to the Court in relation to “extra curial punishment” and stated that there was CCTV footage available to show what had happened. He invited the Crown to make a concession in relation to those events to avoid the technical difficulties of playing the CD ROM in Court. The Crown in due course conceded that the footage shows a police officer placing his foot on the applicant’s head whilst the applicant was lying on the ground with his arms outstretched and his head to one side. The Crown indicated that the police officer did that on two occasions briefly. She also conceded that those events occurred in the context of the arrest for the offences at Windsor on 19 May 2008.  
     
      
    19 In the face of those concessions, the solicitor representing the applicant expressed the view that it was not necessary to play the CCTV footage and the sentencing Judge agreed.  
     
      
    20 In his remarks on sentence, the Judge found, contrary to the submission of the Crown, that the acts of the police officer did constitute extra curial punishment for which some allowance must be made in sentencing. His Honour noted that the applicant had sustained a split to the eyebrow and a graze above his left eye as a result of those acts. His Honour stated, however, that the weight to be given to that consideration in the present case was “somewhat minimal”, there being a need for the Court “to place such extra curial punishment in proper and balanced perspective”.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - incompetent legal representation 
       
      
    21 The first ground of appeal is that the applicant was not represented properly at the sentence hearing. The broad complaint under that ground is that the solicitor did not say or do some of the things asked of him by the applicant. The applicant was not legally represented in the proceedings before this Court. He provided written submissions in support of his grounds of appeal, which he supplemented with further written submissions at the hearing.  
     
      
    22 In his written submissions, the applicant states by way of example that the solicitor did not argue for the sentence to commence in May 2008, when the applicant first pleaded guilty at Windsor Local Court. In fact, the solicitor did make that submission (at T21). In particular, the solicitor submitted that, considering all the evidence before the Court, the Judge could seriously consider backdating the sentence to the date of arrest in May 2008, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant was serving the balance of his sentence for the offences of armed robbery from that date.  
     
      
    23 A second complaint in respect of the competence of the solicitor relates to the Crown’s written submissions. The applicant complains that, when the submissions were handed up, his solicitor said “I haven’t read them your Honour but I’ve got no objection”. In fact, that is what the solicitor said when the submissions were provided to the Court informally before the lunch adjournment. After the adjournment (at T22) the solicitor said “I’ve read the learned Crown’s submissions, I’m not going to go through them point by point”. Accordingly, to the extent that the complaint is that the solicitor did not consider the content of the submissions, it is without substance. 24 Separately, the applicant complains that he was not shown the submissions and “never heard them”. The transcript of the proceedings on sentence discloses that, when the submissions were first handed up, the applicant was not in Court. No criticism should be directed at any person on that account. The applicant was to be called for sentence at 2.00pm. Before the break at 1.00pm, the Crown Prosecutor provided her written submissions to the Judge and the solicitor representing the applicant to enable them to consider that material before the hearing commenced. That was entirely appropriate. 
     
      
    25 After the lunch adjournment, the solicitor representing the applicant stated that he had read the Crown’s submissions. The Crown then did not address the Court orally at the hearing, stating that she relied on the written submissions. The Judge indicated that there was no need for her to take him through them. Again, no person is to be criticised on that account - it was a proper and efficient use of Court time. Although the applicant did not see the written submissions himself at any stage, it is clear that the contents of the submissions were considered by his solicitor. 
     
      
    26 In determining whether the ground of appeal of incompetence of the solicitor is made out, the test is whether, on an objective determination, this Court is satisfied that there was a miscarriage of justice arising from the manner in which the defence was conducted: Yi Hong Puan v R [2000] NSWCCA 194 at [28]. That principle applies equally to sentence proceedings: Puan at [54].  
     
      
    27 The sentence proceedings in the present case entailed neither incompetent representation nor a miscarriage of justice. On the contrary, in my view, the solicitor ably represented the applicant and the sentence imposed was, if anything, lenient in all the circumstances.  
     
      
    28 A third complaint as to the solicitor’s competence relates to the fact that the CCTV footage was never watched by the Judge in the Court. In my view, there is no substance in that complaint. As already noted, the applicant’s solicitor indicated that he wished to rely on the events depicted in that footage in support of a submission based on extra curial punishment. He indicated, appropriately in my view, that the need to play the footage would be obviated if the Crown were to make appropriate concessions, which in due course the Crown did. The Judge made a finding that the conduct of the police officer did amount to extra curial punishment and took that into account in accordance with the relevant authorities. There was no incompetence and no miscarriage of justice. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - manifestly excessive sentence  
       
      
    29 The second ground of appeal is that the “sentence is outside the range”. The principal complaint under this ground relates to the sentence of 2 years imposed in respect of the second of the two offences of possessing safebreaking implements. The applicant submits that, according to the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission, no other person has ever been sentenced to a term longer than 12 months imprisonment for that offence.  
     
      
    30 That submission is apparently based on statistics that were provided to the sentencing Judge by the Crown in respect of sentences imposed in the Local Court. It is to be anticipated that the statistics in that Court would disclose a lower range. 
     
      
    31 The statistics maintained in respect of “higher courts” disclose that, between January 2001 and June 2008, six offenders were sentenced to terms of imprisonment for the offence of possessing housebreaking implements. As acknowledged by the Crown, those statistics are unhelpful having regard to the small size of the class. I note, however, that three of those six were sentences longer than 12 months.  
     
      
    32 In any event, it is well established that the upper limit of the sentencing discretion in any case is the maximum penalty for the offence in question, not the highest penalty revealed in the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission: Van Cuong Nyuyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 322 at [24].  
     
      
    33 Further, as noted by the Crown, the offence for which a term of 2 years was imposed was the offence in respect of which 8 additional offences were taken into account on two Form 1 documents. That in itself is enough to explain the length of the term imposed. I do not think there is any substance in this ground. In my view, the sentences imposed in the present case were manifestly within the permissible range. 
     
      
      Ground 3 - extra curial punishment  
      
    34 The third ground of appeal is “the extra curial punishment was not taken into account when sentencing”. This ground is manifestly unarguable. As already noted, the sentencing Judge expressly found that the conduct of the police officer in placing his foot on the applicant’s head fell within the description of extra curial punishment for which some allowance must be made in sentencing (ROS 21). His Honour observed, however, that the injury was “relatively minor”, although the fact of its occurrence was totally inappropriate.  
     
      
    35 That finding was plainly open to his Honour. His Honour had regard to the relevant authorities and concluded that, while the conduct must be taken into account in the present case, the weight to be given to it was “somewhat minimal”. No error is disclosed in that approach.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 - time fixed for commencement of the sentences 
       
      
    36 The fourth ground of appeal is “no backdate to time of arrest”. The applicant states that he pleaded guilty on 19 May 2008, which was the date upon which he was arrested, and that he had sought to be sentenced immediately. According to the Crown’s written submissions in the proceedings in this Court, the date upon which the applicant indicated his pleas of guilty was 26 May 2008, but the applicant was adamant that the pleas were first entered on the date of his arrest.  
     
      
    37 In any event, assuming that the position is as stated by the applicant, it does not follow that he was entitled to be sentenced that day, nor that he was entitled to have his sentence backdated to that day if sentenced on a later date. The applicant’s complaint ignores the fact that his parole was revoked on 23 April 2008 as a result of the offences he committed on 1 April 2008. The period of custody following his arrest on 19 May 2008 was accordingly referrable to the sentences imposed for the two offences of armed robbery. 
     
      
    38 The sentencing Judge correctly identified the existence of a discretion, in those circumstances, to backdate the sentence: see Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; (2006) 160 A Crim R 145 at [21] per Simpson J, James and Hall JJ agreeing. 39 The Judge gave careful consideration to the proper exercise of that discretion in accordance with the principles stated in Callaghan. As already noted, the solicitor representing the applicant had submitted that the sentences could properly be backdated to the date of the applicant’s arrest. It would equally have been open to the Judge not to backdate the sentences at all. The Crown had in fact submitted that the sentences should commence on 7 April the following year (2009), which was the date of expiration of the earlier parole period. His Honour, however, took the view that it was not open to him to do so, presumably having regard to the provisions of s 47(4)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and accepting, as stated by Simpson J in Callaghan at [23], that an offender who has served his non-parole period is always eligible to seek and be granted parole even after a revocation.  
     
      
    40 In the result, the Judge backdated the sentences for the first series of charges by more than 2 months, to a date roughly half-way between the date of sentence and the commencement of the period of custody referrable to the earlier parole period. No error is disclosed in that approach. 
     
      
      Ground 5 - discount 
       
      
    41 The final ground of appeal is “more discount could/should have been given in sentencing”. The applicant’s submissions in support of this ground are that a greater discount should have been allowed for his early guilty plea, the fact that he is serving his sentence on protection, the extra curial punishment, the fact that his girlfriend has just given birth to a child and the fact that he has addressed his offending behaviour by attending courses at Junee jail.  
     
      
    42 As already noted, the Judge reduced the sentence he would otherwise have imposed on account of the early plea by 25%. No greater discount was appropriate on that account.  
     
      
    43 In respect of the fact that the applicant is serving his sentence on protection, the Judge noted that there had been threats to the applicant’s safety whilst he was in custody for the earlier matters and that those threats had prompted him to escape. He had been in protection since returning to custody. The Judge proceeded on the basis that he will remain in protection for the rest of his sentence, and plainly took that factor into account. 44 In any event, the fact that an offender may be likely to serve his sentence in protection will not necessarily result in a shorter sentence. The proper weight to be given to that consideration will depend on the objective seriousness of the offence for which the sentence is passed and the extent to which other factors such as general and specific deterrence must be reflected in the non-parole period: R v Ah-See [2004] NSWCCA 202 at [27] per Hislop J, with whom Bell and Howie JJ agreed.  
     
      
    45 I have already discussed his Honour’s consideration of the appropriate weight to be given to the extra curial punishment.  
     
      
    46 In respect of the fact that the applicant’s girlfriend has given birth to their child, the Judge was aware of the impending birth of the child and referred to that event in the context of his consideration of the significant changes in the applicant’s circumstances since the offences were committed. It is apparent that his Honour took a generous approach to the question of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation on that account, notwithstanding the applicant’s lengthy criminal record and the short time frame within which he re-offended after his release to parole: see ROS at 13.4. 
     
      
    47 The remarks on sentence also disclose that the Judge paid proper regard to the steps taken by the applicant whilst in custody to address the causes of his offending behaviour by attending various courses. I do not think the Judge’s approach to any of the issues raised by the applicant under ground 5 discloses error. 
     
      
    48 I do not think the applicant has established any of his grounds of appeal. Even if error had been established, the overall sentence was, in my view, relatively lenient in all the circumstances and I do not think any lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    49 The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a limiting term imposed upon him pursuant to the provisions of s 23(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, now known as the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. 
     
      
    2 A special hearing was conducted before a judge and jury on an indictment containing three counts relating to an incident which occurred on 25 August 2005. The counts were as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 sexual intercourse without consent (penile/vaginal) being an offence contrary to s 61 
      I 
       of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 
        
      for which the maximum penalty is 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 
       
       
      Count 2 attempt sexual intercourse without consent. 
       
       
      Count 3 aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (fellatio) contrary to s 61J of the  
      Crimes Act  
      for which the maximum penalty is a period of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 
       
      
    3 A jury determined that the applicant had committed the offences charged in counts 1 and 3. A verdict of acquittal was directed in relation to count 2.  
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 The relevant facts can be shortly stated. The applicant was heavily intoxicated. He approached his victim, who was working as a prostitute, and negotiated a fee for her services. The victim accompanied the applicant to his home where she was paid. She put the money in her sock. The applicant had locked the door of the room from the inside and both parties then took their clothes off. The complainant put a condom on the applicant which he removed and then insisted, despite her protests, on having unprotected penile/vaginal intercourse with her. He then produced a knife and had unprotected oral sex with her. It was accepted that the victim submitted to oral sex because she was afraid that the applicant would use the knife on her. 
     
      
    5 The victim was able to escape, open the door to the residence and run out down the street naked except for her socks. She met a stranger who took her into his residence, calmed her down and called the police.  
     
      
    6 Although the applicant was arrested shortly thereafter the police were unable to interview him for a number of hours due to his state of intoxication. 
     
      
       
      The personal circumstances of the applicant 
       
      
    7 Medical reports from Dr Shavtay Misrachi and Dr Louise Newman, psychiatrists, were placed before the court. There was also evidence from the applicant’s solicitor and from Dr Alex Wodak, physician, the Director of Alcohol and Drug Services at St Vincent’s Hospital. There were further reports from Dr Olaf Nielssen and Dr Allnutt, who have significant experience with psychiatric patients who come into conflict with the criminal law. The evidence disclosed that the applicant suffers from a significant psychiatric illness. He has suffered many hardships.  
     
      
    8 The applicant was born on 6 December 1971 in Dhaka in Bangladesh to a comfortably off middle class family. He was the youngest of five children and had a trouble free childhood. His father was an executive engineer and his mother a medical practitioner. The family are devout Muslims.  
     
      
    9 The applicant attended an exclusive primary and secondary school where he performed well. He acquired an arts degree but became involved in political activities in Bangladesh. As a result he was imprisoned in 1991. This brought shame upon the family who did not take steps to obtain his release. There is evidence that during his period in prison he was tortured. When the family found out from a mutual friend that the applicant was homosexual he was rejected. His family refused to help him financially. Fearing further persecution and torture in Bangladesh the applicant fled to Australia. 
     
      
    10 Shortly after his arrival in this country the applicant consulted Mr David Bitel an immigration lawyer. Apart from their professional relationship they became friends. Mr Bitel assisted the applicant with his application to the Department of Immigration and before the Refugee Review Tribunal. Mr Bitel gave evidence of the deprivations which the applicant suffered on coming to Australia including his incapacity to work. Ultimately the applicant resorted to male prostitution to survive. His mental health deteriorated. He increasingly abused alcohol and developed psychiatric problems. He became dependent on Mr Bitel for support. Shortly after the applicant’s arrival in Australia his longstanding friend and partner, another Bangladeshi, was murdered in Kings Cross. The applicant himself has been assaulted because of his homosexuality. 
     
      
    11 The applicant first made an application for refugee status in 1996. That application was refused and according to Mr Bitel the applicant suffered what he, as a layman, described as a “nervous breakdown”. There was an appeal to the Federal Court which succeeded and the matter was remitted to the Refugee Review Tribunal which, although the sitting member suggested that an approval may be appropriate, ultimately refused his application. 
     
      
    12 A second appeal was lodged to the Federal Court which again succeeded and the matter was remitted to the Refugee Review Tribunal. In May 2005 the Tribunal found that the applicant was a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Refugees’ Convention and qualified for a protection visa. He was granted permission to work only in August 2005. His application for a permanent protection visa was approved in September 2007. 
     
      
    13 Although not diagnosed until late July 2005 the applicant had progressively developed a psychotic illness and a serious alcohol problem. He had been unable to obtain work legally or to be in receipt of any social security payments. He had no means of support and as a consequence committed various offences typical of a person in his circumstances. 
     
      
    14 The applicant commenced drinking alcohol and taking illegal drugs soon after he arrived in Australia. He reported to Dr Nielssen that he had developed a habit of drinking up to twenty standard drinks per night. He commenced taking amphetamines and ecstasy. 
     
      
    15 The applicant was seen by Dr Misrachi in July 2005 at which time he reported hearing voices. Dr Misrachi formed the view that the applicant was suffering from a severe psychiatric disorder, probably a gradual onset of schizophrenia of the paranoid type. Dr Misrachi prescribed anti-psychotic medication. Dr Misrachi was of the opinion that the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol dependency, poly substance abuse and a personality disorder with narcissistic and border-line personality traits. In August 2005 the applicant was admitted to the St John of God hospital in Burwood to undertake an intensive rehabilitation program. However within a short time he left the premises and consumed alcohol which resulted in his immediate discharge. 
     
      
    16 In about September 2005 the applicant, who had been arrested on other matters, was released on bail to the Bridge Program from which he was discharged in October 2005 because it was considered that his psychiatric difficulties made him unsuitable for the program. He commenced working with Mr Bitel’s firm but over time his psychiatric condition deteriorated. He was admitted to the Prince of Wales mental health unit on at least five occasions. He was drinking heavily and was only partially compliant with his medications. By January 2007 Dr Misrachi concluded that he was clearly psychotic with persecutory delusions. He was admitted to Mosman Private Hospital where he commenced on fortnightly injections of anti-psychotic mediation together with oral medications. 
     
      
    17 By 22 October 2008 Dr Misrachi noted a significant improvement in the applicant’s mental state. He had significantly reduced his alcohol intake and had maintained his oral medications as well. 
     
      
    18 The applicant was diagnosed by Dr Misrachi as suffering from schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder with the subsequent development of a panic disorder. Dr Nielssen diagnosed him as having a psychotic illness, probably schizophrenia, and probably post traumatic stress disorder and alcohol dependence and abuse. Dr Allnutt took the view that the applicant suffered from a chronic psychotic disorder, possibly schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. 
     
      
       
      Criminal antecedents 
       
      
    19 The applicant has been convicted of larceny on two occasions, one account of break and enter, one count of goods in custody, one of use false instrument and three counts of possess a prohibited drug. He has also been convicted of refusing a breath analysis and driving without a licence. On his first appearance before an Australian court he was sentenced to a fixed term of two months. All other matters were dealt with by way of non-custodial alternatives. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
       
      Ground 1 His Honour placed too great a weight on general deterrence in determining the limiting term. 
       
       
      Ground 2 His Honour failed to properly take into account the applicant’s mental disorder in determining the limiting term. 
       
       
      Ground 3 His Honour erred in finding special circumstances. 
       
       
      Ground 4 His Honour failed to refer to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       
       
      Grounds 1 and 2 
       
      
    20 It is convenient to deal with grounds 1 and 2 together. The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge failed to articulate the extent to which he had regard to the principles relating to the sentencing of mentally ill persons defined by this Court in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]. It was submitted that in accordance with those principles his Honour should have imposed a considerably less severe sentence particularly having regard to the fact that the applicant’s significant mental disorder had only been appreciated and diagnosed a few weeks prior to the commission of the offences. It was submitted that the applicant’s mental disorder was such as to impact upon his ability to reason and make appropriate judgments at the time of the commission of the offence making the applicant an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. It was submitted that a custodial sentence would, by reason of his mental illness, weigh more heavily upon him. 
     
      
    21 There was considerable evidence tendered to the sentencing judge describing the applicant’s psychiatric condition. I have already referred to it. The sentencing judge was plainly conscious of the nature of the task required of a judge when sentencing a mentally ill person. He referred to the principles identified in Hemsley and cited from the judgment at [33]-[36]. The relevant passages from Hemsley are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mental illness may be relevant – and was relevant in the present case – in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced:  
        Henry 
         at [254];  
        Jiminez  
        [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23];  
        Tsiaras  
        [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400;  
        Lauritsen 
         (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [51];  
        Israil 
         [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23];  
        Pearson 
         [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43].  
         
         
        Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration:  
        Pearce 
         (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported);  
        Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ;  
        Letteri 
         (NSW CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported);  
        Israil 
         at [22];  
        Pearson 
         at [42].  
         
         
        Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person:  
        Tsiaras 
         at 400;  
        Jiminez 
         at [25];  
        Israil 
         at [26].  
         
         
        A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence;  
        Israil 
         at [24]. “ 
        
       
      
    22 The sentencing judge indicated that he was conscious of the fact that if he was imposing a sentence, as compared with a limiting term, he would have been required to take these principles into account. His Honour acted in accordance with s 23(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 which provides for the sentencing judge to determine a limiting term that best accords with what otherwise would have been an appropriate sentence. His Honour expressly recognised that he was required to sentence the applicant upon the assumption that he was an offender who was not fit for trial but suffering from a mental illness which did not excuse the offence. Although his Honour did not expressly refer to the individual principles there is nothing that would suggest that having identified them he ignored them when determining the appropriate sentence. I reject grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    23 Although his Honour was not required to determine a non-parole period he made a finding of special circumstances. That finding was based on the fact that this would be the first time the applicant was in custody and because he is alcoholic, mentally ill and has shown an interest in rehabilitating himself.  
     
      
    24 Consideration of whether there are special circumstances is relevant only when an offender is being sentenced pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and not when fixing a limiting term pursuant to s 23 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. Special circumstances may justify a variation in the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the period on parole. Although there was no purpose to his Honour’s finding it confirms the fact that his Honour was mindful that this would be the first time the applicant would be in custody, that he is an alcoholic and mentally ill and confirms that there are prospects for his rehabilitation. All of these matters are relevant to the length of the limiting term which his Honour imposed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    25 The applicant’s counsel referred to various matters identified in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in respect of which it was asserted his Honour had made no express reference. The matters referred to were s 21A(3)(b) – not planned; s 21A(3)(e) - no significant record of previous convictions; s 21A(3)(h) - good prospect of rehabilitation; s 21A(3)(g) - unlikely to re-offend; and s 21A(3)(j) not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of a disability.  
     
      
    26 Although his Honour’s remarks were brief and did not discuss the relevant issues in any identifiable sequence I am satisfied that he gave consideration to each of the matters raised by the applicant. His Honour referred to and discussed matters relevant to the applicant’s rehabilitation. He also referred to the applicant’s record and, when considering the circumstances of the offences, described the intoxicated state of the applicant and the impulsive nature of his actions. The context of the hearing inevitably meant that his Honour gave consideration to the applicant’s mental illness. Although described as a finding of special circumstances the disabilities of the applicant’s alcoholism and mental illness were expressly recognised by the sentencing judge. I do not consider that his Honour sentenced otherwise than in accordance with the principles relating to mental illness discussed in R v Way (2004) 68 NSWLR 168. His Honour expressly recognised that when considering the objective seriousness of the offence his Honour was engaged in an exercise of determining the limiting term by reference to the head sentence which would have been imposed on an offender who was fit for trial but suffering from a mental illness which did not excuse the offence.

    27 The maximum penalty for the first count was 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The third count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The trial judge found that the offences fell below the middle range of objective seriousness and accordingly if he were sentencing the applicant to imprisonment he would have provided a non-parole period less than the standard. His Honour imposed a limiting period, which may be equated with the full term of any sentence, which was 80% of the standard non-parole period for count 3. His Honour provided that the limiting term for count 1 should run concurrently with the limiting term for count 3. 
     
      
    28 Although the sentencing judge found the offence to be lower than mid range it was a serious offence. The circumstance of aggravation was the threatening of the victim with a knife. Both offences involved unprotected sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    29 Although the applicant had compelling subjective circumstances the period which he will ultimately spend in custody will be defined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Either by consideration of the penalty imposed for count 3 alone, but after recognising that count 1 was also committed, a total term of imprisonment of 8 years was not excessive. It would equate to a non-parole period of the order of 5 years which, notwithstanding the subjective features of the applicant, may have been considered lenient. 
     
      
    30 In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 Gleeson CJ recognised the difficulties faced by a court when sentencing persons with mental disorders. Those difficulties are compounded when a person is found not fit to be tried but, applying conventional principles a court is required to determine a limiting term. It is necessary to keep steadfastly in mind that although in most cases the serious mental illness will have deprived an offender of their usual capacity for reason and control it must not be allowed to overwhelm appropriate consideration of the circumstances of the offence and the other subjective features of the offender. The particular difficulties faced by an offender which may have contributed to the offence will be addressed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal which in appropriate circumstances may release the offender before the limiting term has expired. 
     
      
    31 Although leave to appeal should be granted in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MACFARLAN JA: On 24 May 2007 the appellant was convicted by a jury of the murder, on 17 April 2004, of Michael Saad (“the deceased”). On 13 July 2007 the trial judge, Howie J, sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 22 years with a non-parole period of 16 and a half years to commence from 18 April 2004. The appellant has raised twelve grounds of appeal against his conviction and four grounds on his application for leave to appeal against his sentence. 
     
      
    2 At his trial the appellant did not dispute that he had stabbed the deceased a number of times, that this was the cause of death and that he was guilty of manslaughter. In his defence to the charge of murder he raised three matters. First, he argued that the Crown had not proved that he had the requisite intention for murder because at the conclusion of the evidence there remained a reasonable possibility that he was so intoxicated by alcohol and drugs that he was unable to form that intention. Secondly, he argued that he was not guilty of murder by reason of mental illness. Thirdly, he relied upon the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind (s 23A Crimes Act 1900).  
     
      
       
      The Events of 16-17 April 2004 
       
      
    3 At the time of his death the deceased was aged 18 years. He was friends with the appellant who was also aged 18 years and who attended the same school.  
     
      
    4 On the evening of Friday 16 April 2004 the appellant, the deceased and three other young men were at the family home of the deceased in which the deceased was at the time living alone. They drank alcohol, played computer games and watched television. At about 9.20pm the appellant went into the deceased’s bedroom and telephoned S.A. who was a close friend of H.S., his 16 year old girlfriend. The appellant would sometimes call S.A. as a means of communicating with H.S. because H.S.’s parents did not allow her to have a boyfriend or to go out at night. The relationship was kept secret from them. During the conversation, S.A. said to the appellant, “there’s no way she would choose you because her dad will never accept this relationship because you’re from a different culture to us”. 
     
      
    5 The Crown’s Summary of Trial described what happened thereafter as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “At some stage the appellant went back into the deceased’s bedroom and spoke again on the telephone, to an unknown person. When he returned to the lounge room he appeared to be angry. He told the deceased to “stop acting stupid” and started slapping him. The deceased asked a number of times, “What’s wrong?” and he said to the appellant, “Leave me alone, leave me alone”. The appellant continued slapping the deceased and then placed him in a chokehold, grabbing him by the throat and choking him. This caused the deceased’s tongue to protrude and foam to come from his mouth. J.K. and C.A. [two of the friends who were also present at the home] told the appellant to stop and they pulled him away from the deceased. The appellant told them not to worry, that he was joking. 
        
       
       
        
        The deceased left the room and showered. When he returned to the lounge room the appellant started hitting him. The appellant pushed the deceased onto the lounge and started choking him. While he was doing so he punched the deceased in the leg and put his foot on his face. C.A. and J.K. tried to grab the appellant and pull him off the deceased. When they did so the appellant pushed them back and said, “Leave me alone, I’ll hit youse”. C.A. and J.K. walked outside and C.A. tried to telephone the appellant’s brother but was unsuccessful in doing so. 
        
       
       
        
        C.A. and J.K. went back inside the house and together they pulled the appellant off the deceased. The appellant told them to relax as he was joking. The deceased got up and said to the appellant, “What’s wrong with you?” The appellant replied, “What are you talking about”? The deceased said, “What’s wrong with you, why are you doing this, I feel like dying, you’re killing me”. The appellant replied, “I don’t care”. The deceased got up and walked around a corner. The appellant pushed him to the ground and started choking him. C.A. tried to pull the appellant off the deceased and when he could not do so he went outside and tried again to telephone the appellant’s brother. The appellant called out to C.A. who told his cousin to stay outside while he went back into the house. When C.A. entered the house the deceased was lying on the floor in a corner near to the front door. The deceased was not moving and he did not appear to be breathing. 
        
       
       
        
        C.A. said to the appellant, “What’s wrong with you, what did you do this for?” The appellant said, “Who cares, my girlfriend dumped me, I’m sick of life, that’s it, I want to kill myself”. The appellant said, “Wait a sec”. He walked into the kitchen and armed himself with a knife. C.A., who had followed the appellant into the kitchen, said to him, “What are you doing?” The appellant said, “I’m going to kill him and I’m going to kill myself”. C.A. told the appellant to put the knife down and he tried to grab the knife from him. The appellant pointed the knife at C.A. and said, “Don’t make me stab you”. C.A. told the appellant that he was going home and that he was going to ring his, the appellant’s, brother. 
        
       
       
        
        C.A. walked out the front door. As he passed the deceased, who was still lying on the floor, he noticed that the deceased was breathing. The appellant followed C.A. and told him to come inside. The appellant dragged C.A. and J.K. through the front door. He got onto his knees. He said, “this is how life is” and he stabbed the deceased twice in the middle of his chest. C.A. grabbed J.K. and pushed him through the front door. The two ran a short distance up the road. When they were about two houses away C.A. heard the deceased screaming and begging for his life. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant came out of the house. He was carrying a knife and there was blood on his shirt. He walked towards C.A. and J.K. who had stopped when they heard the deceased scream. C.A. said to the appellant, “This is wrong, you shouldn’t have done this, go to the police … Why did you bring us here, what did you do? We’ve all got lives and everything, we’re only young kids, you ruined our lives, look what you did”. The appellant replied, “Don’t worry about it, you’re not going to get in trouble, I did it”. He also said, “I love youse. I’d never do this to youse”. (references omitted) 
        
       
      
    6 Later that night the appellant’s brother, Jamal Zaro, and three friends went to the deceased’s house and saw his body lying on the floor. After one of them, Romeo Siffo, attempted without success, to find a pulse, the men left the house. The deceased’s mother discovered the body of her son the next day. A post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had suffered seven stab wounds and a penetrating hole to his chest. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case at Trial 
       
      
    7 The Crown called some 19 witnesses including various police officers and various persons who were present at the deceased’s home on 16 or 17 April 2004. The witnesses included Romeo Siffo, a friend of the appellant, to whom further reference will be made below. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Case at Trial 
       
      
    8 The appellant gave evidence. He professed to have no memory of stabbing the deceased and no memory of anything that happened on 16 or 17 April 2004.  
     
      
    9 Dr Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist, gave evidence that he visited the appellant in gaol and that the appellant had told him that on the evening in question he consumed up to seven cups of vodka and lemonade and a substantial amount of wine, smoked four or five cones of cannabis and took two ecstasy tablets before leaving home and that subsequently, at the deceased’s house, he had taken a Rohypnol tablet to calm himself down. Dr Allnutt thought that it was likely that the appellant was intoxicated at the time of the offence, disinhibited and more vulnerable to engaging in aggressive behaviour and that it was possible that the appellant experienced a brief psychosis secondary to the use of the intoxicating substances. He was of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the appellant lacked the capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions and to judge that they were wrong. 
     
      
    10 Mr Stephen Woods, a clinical forensic psychologist and an adjunct associate professor, gave evidence to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         The appellant had a vulnerability to psychosis as a result, first, of exposure to trauma at a particularly vulnerable age, secondly, his use and abuse of drugs and alcohol at a vulnerable age, thirdly, his level of intellectual functioning and, fourthly, his social immaturity. 
         At the time of the stabbing, the appellant was suffering from a psychotic episode that was substance induced. That psychosis was a disease of the mind.  
         At the time of the stabbing, the appellant did not understand the ramifications of his actions and was unable to appreciate that what he was doing was wrong. 
         The appellant had a continuing mental disorder of a psychotic nature which was sometimes in remission and sometimes not. The drugs and alcohol consumed on the night in question triggered its onset. 
         It was possible that the psychotic episode might have occurred even if the appellant had not consumed any drugs or alcohol on the night.  
        
       
      The Crown Case in Reply 
       
      
    11 The Crown called Dr Wong, a forensic psychiatrist, in its case in reply. He gave evidence to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         There was no evidence that the appellant was suffering from any psychiatric disorder at the time of the stabbing.  
         There was no evidence that the appellant was suffering from psychosis at the time of the stabbing, or before or after it. 
         There was no evidence that at the time of the stabbing the appellant was suffering from a disease of the mind. 
         There was no evidence that at the time of the stabbing the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of the mind arising from an underlying condition, was not capable of understanding the surrounding events or was not capable of judging whether his actions were right or wrong. 
         There was no evidence that the appellant was severely intoxicated or affected by drugs at the time of the stabbing. 
        
       
       
      Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    12 Howie J noted in his Remarks on Sentence of 13 July 2007 that it was apparent from its verdict that the jury was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant came within the scope of the defence of mental illness. This was, his Honour said, “Notwithstanding the evidence of a psychologist that he did and the quite bizarre nature of the killing and the offender’s conduct immediately thereafter”.  
     
      
    13 His Honour described the appellant’s background as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “34 The offender was born in Baghdad, Iraq on 2 April 1986 where he lived with his family until he was seven years of age. He remained with his family in Baghdad throughout the 1991 Gulf War and was witness to coalition attacks made on that city. In 1993 the offender and his family relocated to Jordan where they lived for a period of approximately six years. The offender’s family immigrated to Australia in 1999 when the offender was aged 13 years. After completing several intensive English courses, the offender was enrolled in year 8 at St Albans high school. He left school early in 2004 by which time he was enrolled in year 11.  
         
         
        35 There are nine children in his family and he is the seventh eldest. He has no prior criminal record. He had a close relationship with his parents and siblings. He worked on occasions as a painter with a brother. There is nothing in his upbringing or relationship with his parents that appears of significance. There was some suggestion that the offender was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of what he had witnessed in Baghdad. There is little to support that diagnosis. It is not one that was made by either of the psychiatrists that examined the offender. In any event it is of little significance. I doubt that his use of drugs had anything to do with his early life experiences. On his own evidence his use of ecstasy was for recreational purposes. There is no suggestion otherwise that he was suffering the effects of any personality disorder prior to the commission of the offence.”  
        
       
      
    14 His Honour noted that it was open to him to take into account, in sentencing the appellant, any mental disorder from which he might find that the appellant suffered at the time of the offence or at the date of sentence. He said however that he was not satisfied that the appellant suffered from any mental abnormality at either date. He accepted that the appellant was intoxicated by both alcohol and drugs at the time of the stabbing and that it was the effect of those substances upon him that principally caused him to act as he did. He believed that the appellant over-reacted to a concern about his relationship with his girlfriend and “became angry towards the deceased who did not show him or his personal problems sufficient respect”. 
     
      
    15 Howie J went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “41 I have no doubt that this behaviour was out of character and a result of alcohol, drugs and emotional turmoil. I do not believe that the offender is generally aggressive at least not with his friends. I do not accept that his use of drugs and alcohol was a matter of mitigation apart from indicating that it is relevant to consider his prospects of rehabilitation and to explain his behaviour. Although defence counsel put to me that I should treat his use of drugs as self-medication, I do not accept that such a submission significantly assists the offender: see  
        R v SY 
         [2003] NSWCCA 291. However, it is not an aggravating factor in that there is no evidence that the offender had ever before acted violently as a result of his ingestion of drugs and alcohol.  
         
         
        42 The Crown accepted that this was not a killing in the worst case of murder. It was not planned, it was not for gain and was committed while the offender’s ordinary capacity for self control was disturbed by alcohol, drugs and the situation where he believed that his relationship with his girlfriend had come to an end. The Crown also pointed to the young age of the offender and his previous good record.  
         
         
        43 This is a case where the standard non-parole period provisions apply. The standard non-parole period is imprisonment for 20 years. There are a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal setting out the manner in which a sentencing court is to approach the standard non-parole provisions and I have attempted to comply with them. In my opinion the murder was above mid-range seriousness. This is notwithstanding the submission by the Crown that it was mid-range. The deceased was lying on the floor unable to defend himself after having been repeatedly assaulted by the offender. The offender had seriously tried to throttle the deceased at one stage having his foot on his throat. The attacks continued notwithstanding that the deceased had taken himself away to have a shower and the efforts of the other two youths to have the offender desist. Finally when the deceased was in no position to defend himself the offender obtained a knife for the express purpose of killing him and threatened [C.A.]. against interfering. He then struck the deceased a number of blows with the knife.  
         
         
        44 Although there is a bizarre quality about the killing and the offender’s conduct thereafter I am unable to see that this was because of some mental disorder except that caused by the ingestion of alcohol and drugs. In mitigation is principally the fact that prior to the killing the offender was a young man of generally good character and not prone to acts of serious violence. This was notwithstanding his disturbed background by reason of growing up in a war-affected area and his time as a refugee. He appeared to have overcome those setbacks. I also accept that he is contrite for the killing. He initially had difficulties coming to grips with what he had done once he had sobered sufficiently to come back to his senses. He has considerable difficulty expressing himself at least in English. The defence was conducted openly and by assisting the Crown in taking few objections to evidence and facilitated the course of the trial.” 
        
       
      
    16 Howie J then said that the major factor to be taken into account in reducing the non-parole period was the appellant’s youth. He said that the appellant had only recently turned 18 years and was immature for his age, “especially in his relationship with his girlfriend and in the persona he liked to adopt amongst his male friends”. He concluded that “even though this was in some ways a wicked crime the basis of it was the immaturity of the offender in dealing with his personal relations when he was disinhibited by the effects of alcohol and drugs”.  
     
      
    17 I now turn to the grounds raised by the appellant on his appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1:  
      The trial miscarried because Dr Wong was permitted to give evidence of opinions which were partly based on inadmissible material. 
       
      
    18 This ground was based upon the statement made by Dr Wong, in his evidence in chief, which is shown in bold in the following extract from the transcript: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Woods has said that when the accused stabbed the deceased, that the accused would not have known that he was taking a person’s life, that it was the finish of life for him. What do you say about that doctor? 
         
        A. I don’t think I can agree with that. In fact, prior to the stabbing, he told [C.A.] what he was going to do, that was, to stab him and kill him, and subsequently, he told Ahmet – I’ll just go back a little bit. What he told [C.A.] was that, ‘I’m going to kill him and then I’m going to kill myself.’  
        Subsequently, he told Jamal and Romeo that, ‘I didn’t feel satisfied just beating him up, I wanted to kill –’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He told Jamal and Romeo that he did it. Understand? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Just a moment. Is he reading from a statement that’s not in evidence? 
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s right. I want to get away from this” (emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    19 Neither the appellant nor his brother Jamal gave evidence at the trial that the appellant made the emboldened statement referred to by Dr Wong. They did not however give evidence inconsistent with the statement having been made by the appellant. Their evidence revealed an absence of any relevant recollection. The Crown’s contention on appeal was that evidence of the statement was, however, given by Romeo Siffo and that this formed a sufficient basis for what was said by Dr Wong. The Crown also submitted that in any event the trial judge’s question as to whether the material was in evidence and the Crown Prosecutor’s indication that it was not, was a sufficient indication to the jury that it was to be disregarded. As to this latter submission, it should be noted that the trial judge told the jury repeatedly, both during his remarks at the commencement of the trial and during his summing-up, that it must base its verdict upon, and take into account, only the evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    20 When Romeo Siffo came to give evidence of what occurred on the night in question, he was allowed, with the consent of the appellant, to refresh his memory from what was described as a transcript of his interview with the police. The following evidence was given in relation to one of the questions in the Record of Interview: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. The question at 428? 
         
        A. 428. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. 428? 
         
        A. Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said, “What do you mean he didn’t feel enough?” He said, “I didn’t feel enough, I beat him up and he didn’t die in my hands” so he said, “I pulled the knife and started stabbing him”. Do you recall saying that to the police? 
         
        A. Probably. I don’t remember this.” 
        
       
      
    21 Subsequently, Mr Siffo accepted that what the Record of Interview said was what he told the police on 19 April 2004. However, he did not acknowledge that what he told the police then was correct. He said in evidence, “I probably just wanted to get out of there and said many things” and “whatever I tell you here is a hundred percent true but whatever I said there, I’m not one hundred percent sure”.  
     
      
    22 When the trial judge noted that the Crown Prosecutor’s questions amounted to cross-examination, his Honour was told that leave for the Crown to cross-examine its own witness was not opposed. He accordingly granted that leave. 
     
      
    23 The following further evidence in chief was then given: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. ‘What do you mean he didn’t feel enough?’ And you have said, ‘He said, ‘I didn’t feel enough, I beat him up and he didn’t die in my hands’ so he said, ‘I pulled the knife and started stabbing him”. That’s what you told the police on that particular morning? 
         
        A. Yeah, because it’s in here. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that what the man said when you were with Jamal at the time? 
         
        A. I just swore on the Bible and I won’t lie now and I don’t remember a thing about this particular thing. My memory is there, the whole night, but this conversation, I have no clue so I can’t just say “yes”. I don’t remember nothing about what Jamal said to Jalal except he was arguing with him and I sat in my car and I called my girlfriend, she picked me up. They were arguing here but exact words, I don’t remember a thing, no.” 
        
       
      
    24 Shortly thereafter Counsel for the appellant commenced to cross-examine Mr Siffo and the following evidence was given: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Have a look at the transcript [of the police interview] page 58. The question at 429 was, “Can you remember anything else he was saying?” And the answer you gave the police on 18 April 2004 is recorded as being this, “That’s only thing I remember, that he, he said, ‘I felt like killing him and I start hanging him and I start doing all these things’”. Did you follow that as I read it? 
         
        A. Yeah, I’m following it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember answering like that to the police in the interview? 
         
        A. No, I don’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the police then asked the next question, “What do you mean hanging?” And you’re recorded as answering this way, “He start shaking him and I think he punched him and he said but this guy never died. He said, ‘I start choking him for 20 minutes, nothing happened. Then I start- I had a knife, got rid of somewhere, start stabbing him”. Did you follow that answer? 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    25 The cross-examination continued, with further reference being made to the Record of Interview. The effect of the cross-examination, as of the evidence in chief, was that Mr Siffo accepted that he had made to the police the statements appearing in the Record of Interview but that he did not in evidence confirm their accuracy. 
     
      
    26 The statements which Mr Siffo told the police had been made by the appellant were to the same effect as that referred to by Dr Wong, namely, that the appellant did not feel satisfied just beating the deceased up, he wanted to kill him. The fact that the contents of the Record of Interview were not adopted by Mr Siffo in the witness box rendered the evidence of what he had said in that Record of Interview of doubtful utility. The Record of Interview was not in evidence and Mr Siffo’s evidence of what he had said to the police on 19 April 2004, as recorded in the Record of Interview, was hearsay.  
     
      
    27 Nevertheless, through the evidence of Mr Siffo, the jury became aware of what Mr Siffo had told the police that the appellant had said. This occurred without objection by Counsel for the appellant and, by his agreement to the Crown Prosecutor cross-examining Mr Siffo upon the basis of the Record of Interview, Counsel for the appellant facilitated this occurring. Indeed, as the passage quoted above reveals, Counsel for the appellant continued the cross-examination of Mr Siffo on the Record of Interview in the same fashion and on the same subject matter. No doubt, the experienced Counsel for the appellant did this for good and proper reasons. With some force, the Crown, in its submissions on appeal, described defence Counsel’s approach to the evidence of Mr Siffo as “aimed at demonstrating that the appellant’s recounting of his vicious attack upon his friend was so bizarre as to be reflective of mental illness”. This seems to me to be a sensible explanation for what occurred and to reflect a calculated tactical decision made by the defence. 
     
      
    28 It is understandable in these circumstances that Counsel for the appellant did not seek any direction from the trial judge in relation to the statement allegedly made by the appellant to Jamal and Romeo, when it was subsequently referred to by Dr Wong. The reference by Dr Wong to that statement was not inconsistent with what can be inferred to have been the appellant’s Counsel’s approach to the conduct of the defence. 
     
      
    29 The reference by Dr Wong to the statement by the appellant to Jamal and Romeo could not therefore be regarded as prejudicial to the interests of the accused as it was material to the same effect as that which had been put before the jury, without objection, through the evidence of Mr Siffo. In any event, the trial judge’s intervention in the middle of Dr Wong’s evidence, and the Crown Prosecutor’s response, made it clear to the jury that the statement was not in evidence. When taken with his Honour’s repeated directions to the jury to have regard only to the evidence in the case, the exchange was sufficient to ensure that it was not taken into account. Dr Wong’s evidence did not, therefore, result in any unfair prejudice to the appellant and there was no miscarriage of justice arising out of what occurred. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2:  
      The trial miscarried as a result of the matters raised in grounds 3 to 12 below, considered individually and/or in combination. 
       
      
    30 This ground is applicable only if there is found to be some substance in one or more of the other grounds. For the reasons I give in relation to those grounds, I do not consider that there is. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3:  
      The learned trial judge erred by directing the jury that he could not take into account “that the psychosis was triggered by alcohol and drugs”. 
       
       
      Ground 4: 
       The learned trial judge erred by directing the jury that the appellant had to prove on the balance of probabilities that “even if he had not consumed alcohol and drugs on this night, an abnormality of mind, that is this psychotic state, would have happened in any event” and would have caused substantial impairment. 
       
      
    31 No complaint about this direction was made at the trial. This is in fact the position in relation to all of the appellant’s grounds of appeal against conviction and grounds for leave to appeal against his sentence. It is accordingly necessary for the appellant to obtain the leave of the Court under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to pursue these grounds. Whether or not leave is granted, the absence of objection at the trial, at least where, as here, the accused was represented by experienced counsel, is a matter that may be taken into account in assessing the likelihood of the interests of the accused having been prejudiced in the manner alleged on appeal (see for example R v Smyth (1956) 73 WN (NSW) 539 at 541 per Street CJ). The absence of objection at the trial gives some insight into the significance which the matter complained of had in the context and atmosphere of the trial when considered as a whole. Particularly is this so when the trial is a substantial one, such as the present one, which took place over some twelve days. 
     
      
    32 Section 23A of the Crimes Act 1900, so far as is presently relevant, provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if:  
         
         
          
          (a) at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person’s capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person’s actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
          
         
         
        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible. 
         
         
        (3) If a person was intoxicated at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, and the intoxication was self-induced intoxication (within the meaning of section 428A), the effects of that self-induced intoxication are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section. 
         
         
        (4) The onus is on the person accused to prove that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (8) In this section:  
         
         
          
          underlying condition 
           means a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind. 
          
         
        
       
      
    33 The defence case on substantial impairment under s 23A was dependent upon the evidence of Mr Woods. In the appellant’s submissions on appeal, Mr Woods’ evidence was, not inaccurately, described in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “… Mr Woods gave evidence that the appellant was suffering from a drug induced psychotic episode at the material time, which substantially impaired the appellant’s mental processes so that the appellant was incapable of understanding the nature, quality and the wrongfulness of his acts. According to Mr Woods, the substance induced psychotic episode was an “abnormality of mind”, while the appellant’s vulnerability to psychosis and his continuing, developing psychosis was an underlying condition. The appellant’s consumption of drugs and alcohol prior to the stabbing was regarded by the witness as a “trigger” or “impetus” for the psychotic episode. Mr Woods gave evidence that the drug induced psychotic episode was distinct from the mere disinhibiting effects of intoxication. In this regard, Mr Woods emphasised the extremity of the appellant’s conduct and the focussed nature of his rage (as distinct from [the] generalised or unfocussed nature of intoxication induced rages)” (References omitted) (see also paragraph [10] above). 
        
       
      
    34 The principal point taken by the appellant is that the trial judge’s directions (the substance of which are accurately referred to in these grounds of appeal) did not allow for the fact that in Mr Woods’ opinion there was an “abnormality of mind” which was separate from the direct effects of self-induced intoxication, albeit that that “abnormality of mind” was triggered by the intoxication. The appellant’s submissions sought to distinguish cases where “an accused’s substantial impairment is the direct result of self-induced intoxication (ie where the abnormality of mind is co-extensive with or indistinguishable from the state of intoxication)”. R v Jones (1986) 22 A Crim R 42, R v Ryan (1995) 90 A Crim R 191 and R v De Souza (1997) 41 NSWLR 656 were referred to.  
     
      
    35 In my view, this submission should be rejected. Section 23A(3) requires “the effects of [the] self-induced intoxication … to be disregarded”. If the appellant experienced a psychotic episode it was, on Mr Woods’ evidence, which was the only expert evidence of possible assistance to the appellant on this topic, triggered by the appellant’s consumption of drugs and alcohol. It was plainly an “effect” of the appellant’s consumption of drugs and alcohol which was found by the trial judge to have given rise to intoxication. Neither the text of the section, nor any matter of policy to which the appellant was able to point, suggests that the operation of s 23A(3) is limited in the manner for which he contended. 
     
      
    36 The present bears a similarity to R v Jones, a decision to which the appellant referred in his submissions. In that case, there was evidence that the appellant suffered from a slight degree of brain damage, resulting from long standing heavy alcohol consumption, and from either hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemic disease. The medical evidence was that an individual with those conditions could become irresponsible in consequence of consumption of a substantial quantity of alcohol similar to the quantity which the appellant had consumed on the day of the offence. Section 23A was then in a different form: it required an abnormality of mind to arise from one of the limited categories specified (not including a temporary state of alcoholic or narcotic intoxication) for a defence of diminished responsibility to be available. Street CJ (with whom Slattery CJ at CL and Carruthers J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The abnormality [of mind] was due to his state of intoxication at the time. He was predisposed to abnormality by his pre-existing condition. But the abnormality itself became manifest only as a consequence of his being intoxicated. When not intoxicated, he was not within the scope of s 23A(1). When intoxicated he became somewhat irresponsible but that in itself does not permit a finding of diminished responsibility under the statute. In such a situation it is not open to a jury to conclude that the requisite impairment of mental responsibility was due to pre-existing abnormality in the appellant” (at 44). 
        
       
      
    37 This was not, as the appellant here contended, simply a case of an abnormality of mind indistinguishable from the state of intoxication. It was a case where the abnormality of mind to which the appellant was predisposed by his pre-existing condition became manifest as a result of intoxication. This was what, according to Mr Woods’ approach, occurred in the present case. R v Jones in my view provides support for the Crown’s contentions, notwithstanding the differences in the applicable legislation. 
     
      
    38 In my view, these grounds of appeal must fail. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5:  
      The learned trial judge erred by directing the jury that the appellant had to prove on the balance of probabilities that he was suffering from a form of psychosis after the stabbing. 
       
      
    39 This ground of appeal relates to the following portion of the summing-up, which dealt with the partial defence under s 23A of the Crimes Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “You would have to be satisfied that it was more likely than not that the accused had been suffering a form of psychosis with delusions and hallucinations over a period before the offence, at the time of the offence  
        and after 
          
        the stabbing 
        . That is the underlying cause” (emphasis added; page 77). 
        
       
      
    40 This passage immediately followed the reference by the trial judge to the need, if a partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind were to succeed, to find that the appellant suffered from an abnormality of mind “that was a result of an underlying cause”. His Honour went on to say that “as I understand the evidence of Mr Woods, in his view the underlying cause of the abnormality of mind was this continuing state of psychosis under which the accused was suffering”.  
     
      
    41 The relevant part of the written directions provided by the trial judge to the jury referred to proof by the appellant of “an underlying condition, in this case being the accused’s drug induced psychosis present before and/or after the night of the stabbing” (emphasis added). 
     
      
    42 The appellant contends that it was wrong for the trial judge to tell the jury that the appellant was required to prove “that the underlying condition existed or persisted after the stabbing” and that this direction had the effect of imposing an additional, and unwarranted, burden of proof upon the appellant. 
     
      
    43 In my view, when seen in the context in which it appeared in the summing-up and of the appellant’s evidence led through Mr Woods to support his partial defence under s 23A of the Crimes Act, the trial judge’s reference to a form of psychosis continuing “after the stabbing” was not inappropriate. The effect of Mr Woods’ evidence, as recognised in the passage from the appellant’s written submissions quoted in [33] above, was that the appellant had a “continuing developing psychosis which constituted an underlying condition”. Thus, one part of Mr Woods’ evidence was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So it was a continuing disorder of the mind, a disease of the mind which was psychosis and that this particular episode of the psychosis was triggered by drugs. But the psychosis, the disease of the mind was not temporal, was not fleeting. The episode might have been fleeting on this night but not the disease of the mind. Am I right ? 
         
        A. Very much so” (at transcript page 548). 
        
       
      
    44 In my view, his Honour’s reference in the summing-up to the psychosis continuing after the stabbing was intended to, and did (quite properly), emphasise to the jury that the “underlying condition” required to be proved and the subject of Mr Woods’ evidence was a continuing one, distinct from the psychotic episode experienced on the night in question. As the evidence of Mr Woods just quoted indicated, his view was that “the episode might have been fleeting on this night but not the disease of the mind [that is, the continuing disorder of the mind]”.  
     
      
    45 I do not consider that there was any unfairness in the description given to the jury of what it was required to find for the partial defence to succeed.  
     
      
       
      Ground 6:  
      The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury on the consequences of a manslaughter conviction. 
       
      
    46 The appellant accepted that for the purpose of the jury considering whether the appellant’s “impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter” (see s 23A(1)(b)), it was necessary for it to be instructed as to the differences between murder and manslaughter. The relevant part of the summing-up was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Remember I told you that murder and manslaughter are two criminal offences. They both are concerned with unlawful homicide, but that murder is of course a much more serious offence. It is the most serious offence we have and manslaughter is less serious. People are sometimes charged with manslaughter over motor traffic accidents. There are different types of manslaughters. You have two here; you have unlawful act manslaughter and you have manslaughter by substantial impairment.  
        
       
       
        
        Manslaughter carries a different penalty to murder under the Act. A person who was convicted of manslaughter would more than likely get a much lighter sentence than somebody who was convicted of murder. That is because the culpability of the person who is guilty of murder is much greater than the culpability of a person who is convicted of manslaughter. One reason of course is because of the difference in intent to kill. Another one is because the person’s criminal responsibility has been reduced by reason of his mental condition at the time of the act. 
        
       
       
        
        One of the matters that we take into account in sentencing is what is called retribution. It is often termed an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth. I think in fact the expression is you can take no more than an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth, in other words, it is a form of proportionality.  
        
       
       
        
        One of the issues you are looking at in sentencing is the punishment, the degree of denunciation, the degree of retribution, the price one has to pay for the crime committed. Of course, if the person’s criminal responsibility is less by reason of some factor such as in this case, a lack of a capacity to understand what he is doing or to understand that it is right or wrong and to control himself, then parliament has recognised that reduced criminal responsibility by making available a defence and resulting in a charge of manslaughter. So that is why the defence is there. It is a recognition that people do act with different mental states when committing an offence of murder and that there are some situations, again prescribed by the Act, where that person’s criminal responsibility is reduced by their reduced mental state, that is, their reduced capacity. That should not only be seen in a reduction in the sentence but also in a less serious offence” (pages 74-5). 
        
       
      
    47 The appellant complained of the description of murder as a “much more serious offence”, the reference to manslaughter in relation to motor traffic accidents and the statements that a person convicted of manslaughter would “more than likely get a much lighter sentence than somebody who was convicted of murder” and that the “culpability of the person who is convicted of murder is much greater than the culpability of the person who is convicted of manslaughter”.  
     
      
    48 The appellant made the following submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is submitted that these remarks were not accurate. Due to the protean nature of the manslaughter offence, the range of sentences given for manslaughter is unusually extensive. Manslaughter sentences can equate or even exceed sentences given for murder. The repeated use of the word “much” understated the seriousness of a conviction for manslaughter. The reference to traffic accidents could only have left the jury with the impression that a manslaughter conviction was appropriate for a relatively trivial class of offences. The direction implied that a manslaughter conviction was quite inappropriate in the present case, because the appellant’s culpability could never reasonably be likened to the blameworthiness arising from an  
        accidental  
        act”. 
        
       
      
    49 The appellant also contended that it was inappropriate for a trial judge to introduce the concept of retribution and that “the direction implied, or at least carried the substantial risk of an implication, that the imperative of ‘an eye for an eye’ could never be satisfied by a conviction for manslaughter, which would result in a ‘much lighter sentence’, appropriate in cases involving the accidental death of another”. The appellant submitted that there was a substantial risk that the directions had had the effect of “compelling the jury to convict for murder”. 
     
      
    50 I do not agree with these submissions. There is no single, correct form of words which must be used to explain to a jury concepts such as the ones in question. There is no obligation to follow the wording in the Criminal Trials Court Bench Book (R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [72] - [76]). Different judges will inevitably use different language. As Gleeson CJ said in Doggett v R [2001] HCA 46; (2001) 208 CLR 343, “[d]irections are not ritualistic formularies” (at [2]). None of what the trial judge said was in my view inaccurate and the degree of emphasis he gave to the differences between murder and manslaughter and his comments about retribution did not in my view fall outside the range of what was acceptable. The fact that no complaint about the directions was made by the experienced Counsel who appeared for the appellant is a significant indication that in the atmosphere of the trial the directions could not be regarded as unfairly prejudicial to the appellant’s defences. I do not consider, as the appellant contends, that there was a risk that the directions had “the effect of compelling the jury to convict for murder”. On the contrary, the trial judge fairly put before the jury the bases upon which verdicts of guilty of murder or manslaughter or an acquittal would be appropriate. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7:  
      The direction on substantial impairment erred by omitting to refer to the appellant’s capacity to understand events. 
       
       
      Ground 8:  
      The learned trial judge erred by failing to give the jury a clear direction that the appellant was only required to prove that one of the prescribed capacities had been substantially impaired. 
       
      
    51 Section 23A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act refers to substantial impairment of a person’s “capacity to understand events”, to “judge whether the person’s actions were right or wrong” or to “control himself or herself”. 
     
      
    52 The trial judge’s Written Directions and Summing-up omitted reference to the first of these, the appellant’s capacity to understand events. The directions as to the defence of mental illness left for the jury the issue of whether the appellant knew the nature and quality of his act. The trial judge said that “in the present case the evidence of Mr Woods is that the accused would have known that he was stabbing a human being but would not have been aware of the consequences of his act and in particular that it could have resulted in the death of the deceased” (Written Directions page 6). If this evidence of Mr Woods were rejected (as the subsequent jury verdict of guilty of murder indicates it must have been), there would be little room for the view, relevant to s 23A of the Crimes Act, that the appellant’s “capacity to understand events” was substantially impaired at the time of the stabbing.  
     
      
    53 It is not surprising that in these circumstances draft written directions prepared by the trial judge did not refer to this limb of s 23A. Those draft directions were the subject of discussion with Counsel, during which the appellant’s Counsel, made suggestions as to changes. He did not suggest that the additional limb be referred to.  
     
      
    54 The Crown submitted on appeal that there were “sound forensic reasons why defence Counsel would not have wanted that limb left to the jury: it would only have served to have highlighted how weak it was to have risked contaminating the other limbs”. This is a sensible explanation for what occurred as the appellant’s position upon this limb was in fact weak. There was no error in the judge not leaving that limb to the jury, particularly when the appellant’s counsel, seemingly for good reason, acquiesced in that occurring. 
     
      
    55 There is also in my view no substance in ground 8 referred to above as the directions to the jury, both written and oral, made it clear that it was only necessary for the appellant to show substantial impairment of one of the two capacities referred to. 
     
      
    56 Ground 9: The direction on whether the substantial impairment warranted liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter involved error. 
     
      
    57 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the focus of a direction concerning s 23A(1)(b) (see [32] above) should be on the degree of impairment experienced by an accused. He submitted that the direction given involved error because it invited the jury “to engage in a vaguely defined process of reasoning, using amorphous concepts like ‘value judgment’ and the ‘appropriateness’ of one verdict over another”. 
     
      
    58 I do not accept these submissions. In his description of the differences between murder and manslaughter (see under ground 8 above), the trial judge referred to the partial defence of substantial impairment as involving “an evaluation by you of the accused’s culpability if you find those things have been proved” and he referred to the culpability for murder being much greater than that for manslaughter. In this context, his references to a “value judgment” and the “appropriateness” of one verdict over another did not misstate what the jury was required to consider, nor did they leave the jury uncertain as to what it had to decide. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10:  
      The learned trial judge erred by directing the jury that in relation to the mental illness defence the appellant had to prove that Mr Woods’ diagnosis was “more than likely than any other scenario”.  
       
      
    59 The appellant complains that the direction was “apt to confuse the jury in relation to the appellant’s onus for the mental illness defence”. I do not accept this submission. The trial judge clearly explained that the appellant was required to prove the correctness of Mr Woods’ diagnosis, being the only one which favoured the appellant, on the balance of probabilities. His Honour explained that if the balance “tilts just so slightly in favour of the accused, then he has made it more likely than not. If the scales are tipped slightly in his favour, that is enough”. This fairly apprised the jury of the relevant issue. If anything, his Honour’s reference to the correctness of Mr Woods’ diagnosis being “more likely than any other scenario” was in theory unduly favourable to the appellant because that test could be satisfied even if the probabilities of Mr Woods being correct were less than 50 percent, for example, if there were a number of possibilities. In reality however there were here only two possibilities. In any event, I did not consider that there was any unfairness to the appellant in the direction which was given. 
     
      
       
      Ground 11:  
      The directions on absence of motive involved error. 
       
      
    60 The appellant submitted that the trial judge’s directions erroneously deflected the jury from considering “the absence of any credible evidence of motive on the part of the appellant when it came to consider the defences raised by him”. It was said that this flowed from the judge’s warning to the jury against reasoning retrospectively from the absence of any apparent motive to a conclusion that the appellant must have been suffering from a mental illness at the relevant time. 
     
      
    61 Consideration of the full direction given by the trial judge as to the relevance of motive does not in my view reveal any error. His Honour rightly asked the jury to consider what was really meant by the contention that the crime was motiveless. He asked the jury to consider, for example, whether “a reaction to anger” is a motive. He also pointed out that motive was “one of the considerations that each psychiatrist or the psychologist took into account, but it was not decisive”. I do not consider that the directions deflected the jury from considering whether or not there was a motive for the offence and the significance of any conclusion that there was not. 
     
      
       
      Ground 12:  
      The learned trial judge erred by directing the jury that residual concerns about the appellant’s mental state could be addressed on sentence. 
       
      
    62 Part of the summing up was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “So all I am pointing out to you is that, at the end of the day, there may be some facts that are not resolved in your own mind or resolved on the evidence, and one of them might be: Why did the accused stab the deceased? So, for example, if you are not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities that he was mentally ill, if you are not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he had this mental impairment, then it may be that you cannot resolve that issue. You do not know because we cannot understand every facet of human behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        So at the end of the day there can be this question remaining that seems so important but yet cannot be answered. That is not your concern. You have to approach this matter in the way that you are required to, and if at the end of the day there is an issue, such as the accused’s mental state, not resolved, so be it, and that may have to be resolved in some other proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    63 The appellant contended that this direction “created the risk that if members of the jury found the task of evaluating the defences too burdensome, they could return verdicts of guilty safe in the knowledge that questions about the appellant’s mental state could be adequately dealt with on sentence”. I agree with the Crown’s response to this submission that the comments did not deflect the jury from its proper task. They simply served the purpose of dealing with a matter that may have been one of natural curiosity to the jury and may otherwise have been the subject of distracting speculation by it. 
     
      
    64 In light of the clear directions given by the trial judge as to the elements necessary to establish the defence of mental illness and the partial defence of substantial impairment, there was no unfairness to the appellant in the judge’s reference to “some other proceedings” which was plainly a reference to a possible sentencing hearing. I do not consider that what he said detracted from the clear directions that he gave to the jury as to their role in determining the two defences. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing Ground 1:  
      Error in finding that the offence was above mid-range seriousness 
      . 
       
      
    65 When imposing a sentence of imprisonment for an offence set out in the Table to Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”), that is, an offence for which the Act specifies a standard non-parole period, the Court must consider whether there are reasons for setting a different non-parole period to that specified (see s 54B of the Act). For this purpose it is necessary to consider the “objective seriousness of the offence”. This concept was described in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “85 The multiplicity of purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Act, quoted above, do not suggest a narrow perspective as to the range of facts and matters that are to be regarded as “objective” facts and matters which may affect the judgment involved in assessing “seriousness”. It is too narrow a perspective to confine attention to the physical acts of the offender and their effects, as those acts or effects could be observed by a bystander. The inquiry which we consider to have been intended is one that would take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, and those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender (see for example Fox and Freiberg,  
        Sentencing 
        , 2nd Edition at paras 3.506 to 3.510).  
         
         
        86 Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said “objectively” to affect the “seriousness” of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected:  
        Channon v The Queen 
         (1978) 20 ALR 1 and  
        R v Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence. (at [85-86]). 
        
       
      
    66 In his Remarks on Sentence, Howie J reached the following conclusions on this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “43 … In my opinion the murder was above mid-range seriousness. This is notwithstanding the submission by the Crown that it was mid-range. The deceased was lying on the floor unable to defend himself after having been repeatedly assaulted by the offender. The offender had seriously tried to throttle the deceased at one stage having his foot on his throat. The attacks continued notwithstanding that the deceased had taken himself away to have a shower and the efforts of the other two youths to have the offender desist. Finally when the deceased was in no position to defend himself the offender obtained a knife for the express purpose of killing him and threatened [C.A.] against interfering. He then struck the deceased a number of blows with the knife” (Judgment [43]). 
        
       
      
    67 The appellant (for consistency I will continue to refer to the offender as the appellant notwithstanding that in respect of his sentence he needs leave to appeal) complained that the judge erred in concluding that the offence was above mid-range seriousness but was not able to point to any error of principle in his approach. In my view, his Honour’s views were within the scope of reasonable views that could be taken about the objective seriousness of the offence. In these circumstances, this ground of appeal must fail. The appellant has not shown that the classification adopted by the judge was not open to him, as would be necessary to satisfy the principles stated in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour” (at [37]). 
        
       
       
      Sentencing Ground 2:  
      Error in finding that the offender did not suffer from any mental abnormality. 
       
      
    68 As indicated in [14-15] above, Howie J was not satisfied that the offender suffered from any mental abnormality, either at the time of the offence or at the date of sentence. He reached this conclusion after referring to the relevant evidence, which was that of Dr Allnutt, Mr Woods and Dr Wong. He noted that their verdict indicated that the jury rejected the diagnosis of Mr Woods and said that he was “unimpressed by much of [Mr Woods’] evidence and opinions”. Having presided at a trial at which the main issue was the mental condition of the appellant and at which conflicting professional evidence was given, his Honour was in a position of particular advantage, as compared to this Court, in forming a view as to whether the appellant suffered from any relevant mental abnormality. The appellant’s submissions point to various features of the evidence of Dr Allnutt and Dr Wong which it is asserted should have led to a different conclusion to that reached by his Honour. However, they amount to no more than assertions that these features should have carried more weight with his Honour than they did (compare R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] per Spigelman CJ). Particularly where it is implicit in the jury’s verdict that Mr Woods’ evidence as to the appellant’s mental state was rejected, none of these matters form a basis for interfering with his Honour’s conclusion (see Camm v R [2009] NSWCCA 141 at [68-70] as to the circumstances in which interference is justified). 
     
      
       
      Sentencing Ground 3:  
      Special circumstances 
       
      
    69 The appellant submitted that the sentencing judge should have found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Act. Such a finding would have warranted the judge departing from the rule stated in the section that the balance of the term of a sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence.  
     
      
    70 Whilst the judge did not find special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2), he did consider that departure from the standard non-parole period was warranted because of what he described as the “considerable weight” which he gave to the youth of the appellant. The judge went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is nothing in the present case that disentitles him to the greatest allowance that can be made for his subjective factors notwithstanding that the objective circumstances of the offence was more than mid-range. To the contrary he is entitled to considerable allowance for the fact that other than for this offending he appears to have overcome his earlier difficulties and adapted well into this society” (at [52]). 
        
       
      
    71 His reasons for not however departing from the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “53 There are matters that might amount to special circumstances. But the overall sentence in this case must be of such a length that the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term will be adequate to address any needs he may have for counselling or assistance on release. I indicate that I have taken into account his youth in reducing the standard non-parole period notwithstanding the seriousness of the murder.” ([53]).  
        
       
      
    72 The appellant submits that there were special circumstances because of a “combination of factors such as the appellant’s age, that it is his first prison sentence, the traumatic events he witnessed as a child and the lengthy period he will serve in prison”. These are matters of which his Honour was cognisant. He referred in his description of the subjective factors relating to the appellant to his general good character and to his traumatic background growing up in a war-affected area and subsequently as a refugee. As indicated in [15-16] above, the appellant’s subjective factors, particularly his youth, were accorded significant weight in his Honour’s conclusions as to the appropriate non-parole period. His view that in all the circumstances it was not appropriate to depart from the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term was open to him. This ground must therefore also fail. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing Ground 4:  
      Sentence manifestly excessive 
       
      
    73 The appellant’s submissions in relation to this ground are in part dependent upon success of the earlier grounds of appeal relating to his Honour’s findings as to the appellant’s mental state and as to the objective seriousness of the offence. As those grounds must fail, this ground must, to this extent, fail also. 
     
      
    74 Other matters relied upon in relation to this ground included the youth of the appellant (he having turned 18 only some two weeks before the offence), his relative immaturity, his prior good character and his traumatic childhood. It is apparent from what I have said already that these matters were taken into account by his Honour.  
     
      
    75 It was also submitted that it was relevant that the appellant is of a “low level of intelligence”. His Honour accepted that the appellant may be below average intelligence but in any event said that he did not “see the significance of [the appellant’s] intellectual abilities in sentencing him for a brutal murder where he clearly intended to kill the deceased” ([37]). There was in my view no error in this approach. 
     
      
    76 The appellant pointed to a much lower sentence being imposed on appeal in R v A B [2005] NSWCCA 360. As the Crown pointed out, in the present case, there were many differences between that case and this. It is of no assistance in resolving the present issue. 
     
      
    77 I do not consider that there is any basis for regarding the sentence imposed by his Honour on the appellant as manifestly excessive. Accordingly this ground fails also. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    78 The appellant has not made good any of his grounds of appeal or of his application for leave to appeal. As a result, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal against sentence is granted. 
       
       
      (2) The appeals as to conviction and sentence are dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Karpin DCJ on 30 July 2004 in Sydney District Court. The applicant was tried successively upon three indictments, the trials taking place between August 2003 and May 2004.  
     
      
    3 The notice of appeal was filed on 7 April 2009. An affidavit of Philip Edward Green sworn on that date has been filed in support of an extension of time for filing that notice. Given what appears therein, which it is not necessary for present purposes to summarize and the significant effective sentence required to be served by the applicant, I would grant the necessary extension. 
     
      
    4 Indictment 1 charged robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97 (2) of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence has a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Her Honour sentenced the applicant to a head sentence of 8 years commencing on 26 August 2003 and expiring on 25 August 2011 with a non-parole period of 6 years.  
     
      
    5 This offence (the Manly robbery) took place on 16 July 1997. Her Honour found that this offence involved a very sophisticated level of planning and information gathering concerning the intended victims. The applicant was one of a group of robbers who came into possession of accurate information that the male occupant of a house at Manly was absent overseas and that his wife was alone in the house with their young children.  
     
      
    6 The group of robbers made at least two attempts to carry out the offence but they were abandoned in the light of prevailing conditions. However, on the occasion of its commission, two other offenders stole a car which was to be used for escape. Other than one who was to act as a driver, the group, equipped with oxyacetylene equipment, broke into the house. The applicant instructed two men to locate the bedrooms of the children and close the doors. This was done. Then three men wearing balaclavas went into the bedroom of the wife and she was awakened by them turning on the light. She was confronted by these three men wearing balaclavas, two of whom were carrying shotguns. She was told that no harm would come to her if she was cooperative and she was handed a dressing gown.  
     
      
    7 She was interrogated about the location of safes in the house and she provided the combination to a safe located in the laundry. When the offenders were unable to open it she was brought to it and directed to open it which she did. Jewellery was taken from that safe. 
     
      
    8 She was then taken to a second safe located in the cellar and again directed to open the safe. This was done and a quantity of cash amounting to $275,000 was taken from inside. There was more jewellery in this safe but when the victim expressed distress at the potential loss of family heirlooms, the offenders replaced it into the safe.  
     
      
    9 During these events the telephone lines in the house were severed although it appears one was overlooked. The victim was returned upstairs and tied up. The driver of the stolen car was summoned by two-way radio. Before departure the victim was assured that police would be informed about her situation so that she could be released before the children awoke. The group then left and went to the home of one of the offenders where the proceeds were divided and shortly thereafter two of the group went to make a telephone call to a taxi company where they passed information concerning the plight of the victim and this information was duly acted upon to secure her release. 
     
      
    10 Indictment 2 charged two counts, first attempted robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to ss 97 (2) and 344A of the Crimes Act and a second count charged larceny of a motor vehicle contrary to ss 117 and 154A (1) (b) of that Act. On the first count the jury found the applicant not guilty but guilty of a statutory alternative of attempted robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and in company contrary to s 97 (3) of the Act. He was found guilty on count two as charged.  
     
      
    11 On count one her Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a head sentence of 6 years commencing on 26 August 2003 and expiring on 25 August 2009 with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and on the second count to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 26 August 2003 and expiring on 25 August 2004. 
     
      
    12 These offences occurred on 27 June 1997. Prior to the commission of these offences the applicant and others, as a result of inspection, identified the premises of the National Australia Bank at Leichhardt as a suitable target for robbery. The applicant was in possession of accurate information concerning the time lock system which operated to restrict access to the main safe at the bank. The second count related to a vehicle which was stolen in order to be used for the purpose of escape.  
     
      
    13 In the hours of darkness two of the offenders other than the applicant went to the bank with oxyacetylene equipment and cut the iron bars which protected a window at the rear of the bank. They then taped the bars back into place using the tape to disguise the cutting that had taken place. At about 5pm on Friday 25 June the applicant and three others met at a Leichhardt hotel. The applicant and one other then went to the rear of the bank and pulled aside the damaged bars and attempted to smash the window behind it with an iron bar. At the time both men were wearing balaclavas. They failed to gain entry to the bank because they did not make an adequately large hole in the glass in order to allow them to enter. There were persons in the vicinity and the attempt was abandoned, the two men returning to the vehicle and departing from the scene. The vehicle was later abandoned.  
     
      
    14 Her Honour found that although the attempt failed it was a well planned operation based upon accurate information as to the layout of the bank and the practices adopted in relation to the safe.  
     
      
    15 Indictment 3 charged robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97 (2) of the Crimes Act. This offence (the Burraneer robbery) took place on 11 September 1997. For this offence her Honour imposed a sentence consisting of imprisonment for a head term of 10 years dating from 26 August 2009 and expiring on 25 August 2019 with a non-parole period of 6 years.  
     
      
    16 Four men including the applicant, all wearing balaclavas and armed with sawn off shotguns, entered a private residence at Burraneer. Her Honour found that the perpetrators had substantial information concerning the victims and were aware that a female victim was suffering from cancer. That illness in fact caused her death some two or three years after the offence. The offenders had beforehand engaged in surveillance and on one occasion deliberately activated an alarm, obviously to assess any response.  
     
      
    17 The offenders gained entry when the wife opened the door to bring in one of the family pets and they pushed her to the ground and almost immediately commenced a serious assault upon the husband. Over ensuing hours the husband was severely beaten and injured and although the wife was not further harmed, and her head was covered so that she could not see what was happening to her husband, she was well aware that he was being subjected to considerable violence. 
     
      
    18 The intruders caused extensive damage to the premises, smashing ornaments of value and furnishings and damaging two Mercedes motor vehicles which were located in the garage. The damage done was evaluated at in excess of $100,000. 
     
      
    19 A quantity of cash, said by the victim to be between $6,000 and $8,000, was taken together with jewellery valued at about $140,000.  
     
      
    20 The total effective term imposed as a result of her Honour’s sentences amounted to imprisonment for 16 years dating from 26 August 2003 and expiring on 25 August 2019 with a non-parole period of 12 years with the same commencement date and expiry on 25 August 2015.  
     
      
    21 As can be seen from the facts detailed above, the trials did not take place until many years after the commission of the offences. The applicant left New South Wales and on 12 December 1997 was arrested in Queensland where he was placed in custody after committing an armed robbery and using a firearm to avoid capture. He remained in custody after that date and, following pleas of guilty to those offences, he was sentenced to terms of 7 and 11 years imprisonment in connection with which there was specified a non-parole period which, as at the dates that the applicant was brought to New South Wales to face the trials abovementioned, was scheduled to expire on 29 September 2006. That would have been the earliest date upon which the applicant might have been released to parole in respect of the offences in Queensland. 
     
      
    22 The applicant was charged with the New South Wales offences on 27 August 2001. The authorities first came into possession of evidence of the applicant’s involvement from information received in April 2000. As is obvious from the foregoing there were multiple offenders involved in the applicant’s crimes, but he stood trial alone. Other identified offenders were separately tried. However the chief witness against the applicant at all three of the trials was a co-offender named Smith. Smith was granted indemnity from prosecution for the offences in New South Wales and received a letter of comfort which was used to obtain a substantially reduced sentence for his participation in offences in Queensland. As is usual in such circumstances the indemnity and the reduced sentence were conditional upon Smith giving truthful evidence about the commission of the crimes. Obviously, each of the juries involved in the trials of the applicant accepted his evidence. 
     
      
    23 The applicant was born on 16 June 1933. He has a prior record of considerable length dating back to 1955 but it should be observed that nothing of the seriousness approaching the offences in Queensland or the three current offences appears upon his accumulated record between 1955 and 1992. That is not to say that the record is minor. On 29 March 1996 at Sydney District Court he was convicted of assault with intent to commit a felony and released upon a recognizance pursuant to s 558 of the Crimes Act as then in force on condition that he enter a bond in the sum of $2,000 to be of good behaviour for four years. That recognizance was current during the commission of all the offences which are above described.  
     
      
    24 Grounds 1 and 2 advanced by the applicant are: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The total sentence was unduly harsh and severe. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The sentencing judge erred in application of the principle of totality.” 
        
       
      
    25 It will be convenient to deal with these grounds together. I did not understand it to be contended that the individual sentences for particular offences, if viewed in isolation, were excessive. The thrust of submissions was directed to the combined effect of the Queensland and New South Wales impositions which effectively had the consequence of continuous custody from 12 December 1997 until the earliest date of eligibility for parole on the expiry of the period set in respect of the third indictment, 25 August 2015, a total period of 17 years 8 months. The combined head sentences can be calculated to constitute an effective term of 21 years 8 months. 
     
      
    26 Reference was made to the statistics collected by the Judicial Commission in relation to “s 97” offences and it was submitted that the head sentence “grossly exceeds” sentences imposed in New South Wales for “s 97” offences, however argument was principally focussed upon an asserted failure to comply with the principle of totality. I am unable to deduce an error by comparison of the sentences imposed upon the applicant with what is asserted to be a sentencing pattern for “s 97” offences.  
     
      
    27 What is involved in the concept of totality is not in doubt and the observations of Street CJ in R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 260 are frequently cited: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences. The effect of this practical consideration is always to produce an ultimate aggregate which is less than that which would be arrived at by a straightforward adding up of the terms appropriate for the offences, if each were viewed alone. In carrying out this process of adjustments, it is both inevitable as well as proper that the ultimate decision be arrived at in the light of the totality of the criminality involved in all of the offences. As has been said more than once in this Court, where the principle of totality comes into effect, it is more often than not of little importance how the ultimate aggregate is made up (that is to say, whether by a series of aggregate terms or by a series of concurrent terms, or by partly one and partly the other). The important factor is the practical significance of the sentencing order.”  
        
       
      
    28 The remarks in the final two sentences of that excerpt need to be understood now in the light of the subsequent decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    29 In the context of the current matter, totality considerations required a giving of account to the extant Queensland sentence. The approach to circumstances of an offender whose crimes are committed in different States was succinctly summarized by Moffitt P in R v Todd  (1982) 2 NSWLR 513 at 521: 
     
      
       
        
        “The circumstances that one offence is committed in one State and another offence is committed in a different State should not deter the courts of this State, at least so far as administratively possible, from imposing a sentence or from participating in the imposition overall of sentences, including a minimum sentence, which would be imposed, if all the offences were dealt with by one court in this State. The criminality and the other elements which go to determine sentences do not depend upon which side of the border some of the offences are committed.” 
        
       
      
    30 In Todd, Street CJ (at 519) said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “But it would be wrong, in my opinion, to disregard the practical situation that the appellant had already served a substantial period of imprisonment in Queensland for offences so closely related in time and character to the Sydney offences. Within a space of some eight days the appellant committed the Sydney crimes and the Queensland crimes.” 
        
       
      
    31 In the present case the time relationship between the commission of the crimes in New South Wales and Queensland was not so close, however the High Court in a joint judgment in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 referred to the comments of Moffitt P in Todd and further comments of Street CJ and made it plain that a pre-existing (interstate) sentence and the aggregate term which would result from second imposition were relevant matters to be taken into account. Their Honours added (at 66): 
     
      
       
        
        “The principle is not confined in its operation to the fixing of a non-parole period. It applies also to the fixing of a head sentence which, when considered in association with the head sentence imposed by the first sentencing court, must be seen to be appropriate in all the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    32 The remarks on sentence (ROS) of Karpin DCJ show that she was conscious of the need to apply the principle just discussed. She said (ROS 17-18): 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, these offences were committed over a relatively short period and, having regard to the total sentence that will result from the individual sentences to be imposed upon the prisoner, I am persuaded that the principles of totality require a degree of cumulation and concurrency in the total sentence which includes a calculation of the Queensland sentence. The prisoner is presently serving a term of imprisonment imposed upon him for the offences in Queensland. He went into custody on 12 December 1997 after his arrest in the course of committing a serious armed robbery. As the sentencing judge in Queensland found, the prisoner sought to shoot his way out. He was accordingly sentenced on two counts: on the robbery he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment on a plea of guilty; and on the shooting offence he was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment on a plea of guilty. Those sentences are to be served concurrently. His non-parole period expires on 26 September 2006.” 
        
       
       
      and (ROS 18-19): 
       
       
        
        “The offences for which the prisoner is to be sentenced today all occurred prior to the Queensland offences. However, each of the New South Wales offences and the Queensland offence are of the utmost gravity. The existence of the Queensland offence is, however, not a matter to be taken into account in dealing with the prisoner other than considering the total period of imprisonment that the prisoner is facing and determining the issue of totality.” 
        
       
      
    33 No express submission was made that her Honour was referring to the head sentences to the exclusion of non-parole periods when she referred to “the total period of imprisonment” and she subsequently made it clear that in considering totality as well as other factors she also focussed upon minimum terms. At ROS 20 she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the period of time he has already been in custody in relation to another serious offence, the principles of totality and to his age and health, those sentences should be structured to result in a non-parole period of 12 years. That will be further reduced by being made partly concurrent with his Queensland sentence resulting in an effective additional period of imprisonment before he is eligible to be considered for release on parole of just under nine years.” 
        
       
      
    34 Senior counsel for the applicant acknowledged the expressions of her Honour concerning totality but contended that there was a detectable latent error in part, at least, discernible from a failure to refer to the principle as expounded in Holder. There was no need for her Honour to make such a reference which would amount to mere ritual incantation. 
     
      
    35 The last quoted excerpt from her Honour’s remarks on sentence shows that she did make adjustment for totality (as well as other factors which she mentioned) and, in the light of that, it was submitted that she did not give sufficient weight to the application of the principle. Although it was said in dealing with the Crown appeal, the statement of Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 is applicable: 
     
      
       
        
        “The use of terminology such as ‘sufficient weight’ highlights the difficulty for the Crown case. Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge. The circumstances in which matters of ‘weight’ will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined.” 
        
       
      
    36 It was further submitted that her Honour did not give appropriate effect to the concept of totality in setting the non-parole periods. This was said to be apparent from the failure of her Honour to advert to “special circumstances” as contemplated by s 44 of the sentencing legislation. It is clear that she was referring to this when she said (ROS 20) “there is nothing which has been put to me which would require that other than the standard non-parole period should apply.” The expression “standard non-parole period” could not have been meant to refer to that term as defined in s 54A as the charges against the applicant were brought under sections which do not appear in the table in s 54D. That her Honour was intending then to refer to the proportional formula in s 44 was demonstrated when she used the expression again saying (ROS 20): 
     
      
       
        
        “If applied cumulatively, that would result in a total head sentence of 24 years, and applying the standard non-parole periods, the prisoner would serve 16 years before being eligible for release on parole.” 
        
       
      
    37 Of course, application of the s 44 “formula” effectively results in a non-parole period of three-quarters of head sentence and three quarters of twenty four is eighteen, not sixteen, but I am seeking only to demonstrate the sense in which her Honour was using the expression “standard non-parole periods”. If, as it appears, the statement reflected an arithmetical mistake, it operated to the advantage of the applicant. 
     
      
    38 As is plain from that part of her remarks earlier quoted, she had expressly taken into account the Queensland sentence, she made the sentences on indictments 1 and 2 wholly concurrent with each other and she adjusted the eligibility date for consideration of release to parole downwards by the order for partial concurrency with the Queensland sentence. 
     
      
    39 As already stated, the applicant’s non-parole period for the Queensland sentences were to expire on 29 September 2006. Her Honour commenced the sentences which she imposed on 26 August 2003, a benefit of concurrency to the applicant of 3 years and 1 month. 
     
      
    40 The calculation of the combined total of Queensland and New South Wales head sentences produced a term of 21 years 8 months and the minimum custody amounted to 17 years 8 months, thus the ratio of that to the head sentence was 81.5 percent. The calculations are correct. It was submitted that her Honour ought to have made adjustments so as to achieve an overall ratio of 75 percent in harmony with the prescription in s 44. Each of the sentences imposed by her Honour specified a non-parole period of that ratio to head sentence with the exception of the prescription in relation to the sentence on the third indictment which was adjusted downwards in order to maintain an overall proportion, i.e. for the New South Wales offences an effective head sentence of 16 years with a non-parole specification of 12 years overall. 
     
      
    41 The Queensland sentence was imposed in accordance with the sentencing regime of that State. Although her Honour did not articulate the above calculations, her observation that the applicant would be eligible for parole after service of an additional nine years shows that she was alert to the practical effect of the impositions. It can be observed that departure from the formula in the statute requires a statement of reasons for “downward” adjustment; there is no requirement otherwise. There is no reason to conclude that her Honour overlooked the mathematical result and that her orders reflected other than her intention. 
     
      
    42 Finally, in support of these grounds it was submitted that, in lieu of the commencement date of 26 August 2003 (which was the date upon which the jury returned its verdict of guilty on the first trial) her Honour should have selected either the date upon which police first became seized of evidence from the informer identifying the applicant, April 2000, or when the informer was granted immunity, March 2001, or when the applicant was charged, August 2001. 
     
      
    43 All of the matters, including the lastmentioned, relied upon the applicant’s challenge to the exercise of discretionary judgments by the sentencing judge. It has not been shown that her discretion miscarried and I would reject grounds 1 and 2. 
     
      
    44 Ground 3 contended that her Honour erred in failing to make any or sufficient allowance for old age. Her Honour had observed that the applicant was born on 16 June 1933 and was at the time of sentence, aged seventy one years. Later in her remarks (ROS 19) she returned to this: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have already said, the prisoner is now aged 71. He will inevitably be some years older before the non-parole period for the sentences to be imposed upon him has expired. As I have indicated, the conditions under which he will be serving his imprisonment are a matter to be taken into account.” 
        
       
      
    45 The written submissions on behalf of the Crown note that the applicant will be eighty four years of age when eligible for consideration of parole. 
     
      
    46 In R v Holyoak [1995] 82 A Crim R 502 the offender, a former supervisor at a Dr Barnardos Home, was convicted on two charges of indecent assault of a child under his care together with a number of other charges taken into account under what was then Form 2 procedure. Holyoak was aged seventy five at the time of sentence. The intervention of this Court occurred because an incident had been taken into account which was outside the period covered by the charges, however, in relation to the issue of age Allen J (Handley JA concurring, Hulme J stating that he was ‘not disposed to give the applicant’s age the same weight as I perceive Allen J is inclined to give’) said at 507: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is argued, however, that his Honour fell into error in a number of respects. The first is that, it is said, he failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s age. His counsel points out that the sentence imposed as a minimum term is such that the possibility of the applicant dying during the minimum term, despite his present state of health, is quite real. So it is. It is not to be contemplated that his Honour would not have realised that. Particular complaint is made that all that his Honour said, apart from the reference to his age to which I have already referred, was: ‘Age is not a licence to commit sexual offences, nor should it be thought that a person who commits such offences can then expect to be allowed to go free merely because of advanced years.’ I find no fault with that observation. Indeed it would seem to be taken directly from the judgment of Badgery-Parker J in  
        DCM 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 26 October 1993) with whose reasons for judgment Kirby ACJ agreed.” 
        
       
      
    47 Useful reference may also be had to the Sentencing Manual published by the Judicial Commission (I. Potas, 2001) and, although specifically dealing with reduced life expectancy because of illness rather than age, it was observed that (at 284): 
     
      
       
        
        “A substantial possibility, or even a probability, that a prisoner will not survive the non-parole period is a relevant consideration, but it is but one subjective matter to be taken into account. Other relevant matters are the responsibility of the prison authorities to provide medical treatment, the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and the powers of the Offenders’ Review Board (Parole Board), under s 160 of the  
        Crimes (Administration of Sentencing) Act 
         1999, to grant parole where a prisoner is dying or because of ‘exceptional extenuating circumstances’, including humanitarian grounds:  
        Jones 
         (1993) 70 A Crim R 449 per Carruthers J, citing  
        Giardini (Sandro) 
         (unreported, NSW CCA, 25 February 1993) per Gleeson CJ.” 
        
       
      
    48 I would understand her Honour’s remarks above quoted in which she expressly took into account “the conditions under which he will be serving his imprisonment” to include among the matters she was taking into account, the immediately preceding statement concerning the advance of the applicant’s years. This is further confirmed when she continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “He does not have, so far as I am informed, any health problems of such gravity that they cannot be properly cared for within the prison system. Whilst matters of his age and health are relevant, they do not lead to a sentence being imposed which does not adequately reflect the gravity of the offences which were committed.” 
        
       
      
    49 Inevitably, when imprisonment is to be imposed on an offender who will be of advanced years before eligible for parole pursuant to sentence, a balance must be struck between the most frequently applied of established sentencing principles requiring denunciation, deterrence an punishment and the less commonly encountered but appropriate amelioration for considerations of health and age. It is clear from the remarks of her Honour just quoted that her assessment was made with attention to such a balance. Her approach was in accord with appropriate principle. 
     
      
    50 I am unpersuaded that her Honour erred in the manner asserted by ground 3. 
     
      
    51 Ground 4 contended that her Honour erred in failing to take or sufficiently take into account custodial conditions. As appears in an extract earlier quoted, her Honour stated that she would take those conditions into account. She had observed (ROS 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “Since being transferred to New South Wales he has been held at the highest security facility at Goulburn and the conditions under which he has been serving his sentence are relevant in determining his sentence.” 
        
       
      
    52 Her Honour had been informed by counsel that the applicant was at the time, no longer in maximum security (Transcript 29 May 2004, p 9).  
     
      
    53 This Court was referred to the decision of White J in Kidd v Chief Executive, Department of Corrective Services [2000] QSC 405 where a maximum security order in respect of the applicant was set aside on judicial review and returned to be reconsidered by the delegate. Some information as to the incidents of maximum security in Queensland can be gleaned from the description in par 21 of that judgment. Of course, the applicant ceased to be held in Queensland after interstate transfer (to which he told her Honour that he had agreed). 
     
      
    54 It does not appear that the specifics discussed by White J were before the sentencing judge, however the power of this Court to intervene is dependent upon the demonstration of error. No error such as is contended in ground 4 has been demonstrated.  
     
      
    55 I would grant the necessary extension of time to allow the applicant to file his application, I would grant leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    56 HOEBEN J: I agree with Grove J.

     SBF v Regina 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J and with his Honour’s reasons. As has been recognised in a number of cases to which Johnson J refers, the correct application of the High Court’s decision in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, especially at 389, can cause difficulties when sentencing for the statutory offence involving the death of a person by the use of a motor vehicle. 
     
      
    3 In the present case the factual findings which the sentencing judge made, including that the Applicant “could not have but failed to realise the very serious danger in driving in the way he did” and “it must have been abundantly clear to him … that the course of driving which he embarked upon was potentially lethal”, were findings which were clearly open. His Honour concluded that the offences were “extremely serious” and that the sentence must reflect an adequate degree of general deterrence. 
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for the offence contrary to s 52A(2) Crimes Act 1900 is 14 years imprisonment and for the offence contrary to s 52A(4) Crimes Act 1900 is 11 years. The maximum penalty for an offence of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    5 The Applicant was sentenced on Count 1 (taking into account the Form 1 matter) to a non-parole period of two years and nine months with a balance of term of three years and seven months. On Count 2 he was sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and three months with a balance of term of two years and three months. The overall sentence was a term of imprisonment of seven years and 10 months with a non-parole period of four years and three months.  
     
      
    6 Consideration of either the individual sentences or the overall sentence indicates that, notwithstanding the Applicant’s youth, the sentences imposed were appropriate for the offences to which he pleaded guilty. To my mind, a more severe sentence could have been imposed. But more importantly having regard to the issues raised by the Applicant, the length of the sentences do not suggest that the Applicant has been sentenced as if he had been convicted of manslaughter. If that had been the case more significant penalties would have been appropriate. 
     
      
    7 JOHNSON J: Once again, this Court is called upon to consider the application of sentencing principles to a case involving a young driver, high speed, alcohol and death on the roads. In this case, the driver was a juvenile offender. The tension between the different purposes of sentencing is at its highest in a case such as this. 
     
      
    8 The Applicant, SBF, applies for an extension of time to seek leave to appeal with respect to sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Coolahan at the Newcastle District Court on 22 August 2008.  
     
      
    9 The Applicant was born in October 1989. On 7 November 2006, when the Applicant was 17 years old, he drove a vehicle at high speed, resulting in the death of two young persons, MA and DF, and serious injury to a third young person, KL. 
     
      
    10 Because the Applicant and the victims of the offences were under 18 years of age at the time of the offences, each of them will be referred to by initials in this judgment to meet the requirements of s.11 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.  
     
      
    11 On 8 May 2008, the Applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing two counts of aggravated dangerous driving causing death, an offence under s.52A(2) Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. In addition, the Applicant requested the sentencing Judge to take into account, on a Form 1, an offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm under s.52A(4) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 11 years.  
     
      
    12 The two counts contained on the indictment alleged that the Applicant drove in a manner dangerous to other persons (s.52A(1)(c)), in circumstances of aggravation, namely whilst driving at a speed that exceeded the applicable speed limit by more than 45 kilometres per hour (s.52A(2); s.52A(7)(b)). The Form 1 matter involved an offence of driving in a manner dangerous to persons (s.52A(3)(c)) in circumstances of aggravation, namely whilst driving at a speed that exceeded the applicable speed limit by more than 45 kilometres per hour (s.52A(4); s.52A(7)(b)). 
     
      
    13 Following a sentencing hearing, the Applicant was sentenced on 22 August 2008 as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Count 2 - aggravated dangerous driving causing the death of DF - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years three months commencing on 5 August 2008 and expiring on 4 November 2010 with a balance of term of two years three months commencing on 5 November 2010 and expiring on 4 February 2013; 
       
       
      (b) Count 1 - aggravated dangerous driving causing the death of MA (taking into account the Form 1 matter) - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years nine months commencing on 5 February 2010 and expiring on 4 November 2012 with a balance of term of three years seven months commencing on 5 November 2012 and expiring on 4 June 2016. 
       
      
    14 The overall effective sentence imposed upon the Applicant involved imprisonment for seven years 10 months to date from 5 August 2008, with a non-parole period of four years three months, with the Applicant to be eligible for release on parole on 4 November 2012. 
     
      
    15 Pursuant to s.19 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, his Honour directed that the sentences of imprisonment be served in a juvenile facility until the Applicant attained the age of 21 years (viz 25 October 2010). 
     
      
    16 The Applicant was disqualified from driving, on each count, for a period of three years from 22 August 2008. 
     
      
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    17 Evidence tendered, without objection, in the District Court revealed the following. 
     
      
    18 On the evening of 6 November 2006, the Applicant was socialising with a number of young persons at the flat of an adult friend, Sterling Pinkstone. Amongst those at the flat were young men, MA (aged 17 years) and DF (aged 16 years). Also present was a young woman, KL (aged 17 years). The group had dinner and alcohol was consumed during the evening. Mr Pinkstone went to bed about 1.00 am. About 45 minutes later, the Applicant went into Mr Pinkstone’s room and asked him for some cigarettes. Mr Pinkstone told the Applicant that there were cigarettes in his cupboard. The Applicant went to the cupboard and left the room. A short time later, Mr Pinkstone got out of bed and noticed that his vehicle, a 1987 Holden Commodore VL sedan, was missing. He asked his flatmate about the vehicle and was told that the Applicant, along with DF, MA and KL, had left the flat together at about the same time as the vehicle went missing. Mr Pinkstone noticed that a spare set of keys to his vehicle, which had been on the kitchen table, were no longer there. He attempted to contact the Applicant and MA by ringing their mobile phones, but the calls rang out.  
     
      
    19 At about 2.30 am on 7 November 2006, the Applicant was driving Mr Pinkstone’s Holden Commodore in Mount Hutton. The vehicle did not have an anti-lock braking system or airbags. The Applicant had been issued with a learner’s permit on 19 December 2005, but had never held a driver’s licence. He was to be tested for his provisional licence the following week and had undertaken preparations for that test. There were four people in the Commodore. The Applicant was driving and MA was in the front passenger seat. DF was seated in the back behind the Applicant. KL was the other backseat passenger. 
     
      
    20 A delivery truck driver, Andrew Trenerry, was driving on Wilson Road, Mount Hutton. He was about to make a delivery at the Lake Macquarie Shopping Centre, when he saw the Commodore pull out of the driveway of the shopping complex and turn to the right in front of his truck. The Commodore was estimated to be travelling at 40 kph - 50 kph at the time of turning, and the back wheels lost traction with the road surface. Mr Trenerry followed the Commodore and saw it turn left at the next intersection into Violet Town Road. When Mr Trenerry reached the intersection a few seconds after the Commodore, he could see it travelling along the road and said it was “sideways, doing wheel spins up the hill, the car was going from one side of the roadway, going close to the gutter, then to the other side”. Mr Trenerry saw “smoke coming from the wheels”.  
     
      
    21 Violet Town Road is an urban sub-arterial road carrying moderate traffic volumes along a north-south spine, in residential communities, to the west of the main north-south route (Pacific Highway) and the eastern side of Lake Macquarie. In the vicinity of the collision, the roadway provided for two lanes of through traffic, one in each direction. 
     
      
    22 The roadway was dry at the time and the weather was fine. The speed limit in the area was 60 kph.  
     
      
    23 Soon after 2.30 am, residents in the vicinity of the intersection of Violet Town Road and Regent Street, Tingara Heights, were awoken by what they described as a “whooshing” sound. The intersection was 1.6 kms from the Lake Macquarie Shopping Centre. One resident thought that the sound was of a car travelling at high speed. Witnesses heard a minor bang followed by a larger bang. One witness who lived on the intersection described the larger bang as “like a bomb going off … the house shook … the windows in the bedroom were vibrating”. The witness looked out and saw that the Commodore had hit a power pole.  
     
      
    24 Calculations of the speed of the Commodore at the time of impact were undertaken using physical evidence obtained from the scene. Using two accepted and independent methods of calculating speed, the vehicle was found to be travelling at a speed of 125 kph - 144 kph. His Honour Judge Coolahan sentenced the Applicant on the basis that the speed at the time of the collision was 125 kph, some 65 kph over the speed limit. 
     
      
    25 The driver’s side of the car impacted with a power pole. The force of the collision caused the vehicle to break in two, with the front of the car (including the two front seats) separating from the rear. The point of impact of the power pole was just behind the vehicle’s centre B pillar. The power pole penetrated the car by more than the pole’s full width. The rear of the vehicle remained embedded on the power pole while the front portion travelled a further 10 metres into Regent Street. 
     
      
    26 Those in the front of the Commodore, the Applicant and MA, were thrown from the vehicle as a result of the impact. MA was lying on the road near the gutter, approximately 35 metres from the collision point. The Applicant was approximately two metres from the power pole.  
     
      
    27 Five days later, MA died in John Hunter Hospital from injuries sustained in the collision. 
     
      
    28 DF and KL remained in the rear seat of the vehicle, restrained by their seatbelts. DF bore the full force of the impact and died instantly. KL suffered severe brain injury. She was in a coma for some time and was hospitalised for seven months, during which time she was completely paralysed down the right side of her body. She suffered fractures to the skull, jaw, neck, pelvis, spinal vertebrae and ribs. Her right hand was broken and was reconstructed with wires and a metal plate was inserted in her left wrist. Her diaphragm was torn, and her liver damaged. She had a tracheotomy, which left a scar and damage inside her throat which made it difficult for her to swallow and has changed her voice. She continues to suffer back, neck and stomach pain. She continues to suffer disabling migraine-type headaches. The head injury has affected her short-and-long-term memory. Apart from these physical injuries and disabilities, KL was affected psychologically as well, in ways explained to the sentencing Court. 
     
      
    29 Having been thrown from the vehicle, the Applicant was lying still about two metres from the power pole, with his upper torso on the footpath and his lower body on the road. The Applicant appeared to regain consciousness and stood up. He said to a witness who had left his nearby house “Where am I?” and started shouting and swearing. The Applicant said “I’ve got to get out of here”. By this stage, the police had arrived and the Applicant was assisted by civilian witnesses so that he did not cause himself further injury. 
     
      
    30 The Applicant was taken to hospital for treatment. He sustained bruising across his lower abdomen, mainly on the right-hand side above his hipbone, and on his right flank. Associated with this injury was the re-opening of a two-week old incision where his appendix had been removed. He had a dislocation of his right tenth rib. There was a small laceration of the right-upper eyelid and a small laceration above his right ear. There was associated linear bruising with the lacerations. A chest CT scan showed peripheral opacification, resulting from either a pulmonary contusion or aspiration. The Applicant was discharged from hospital on 10 November 2006. 
     
      
    31 The Applicant had been drinking alcohol at Mr Pinkstone’s flat. A blood sample was taken from the Applicant at hospital about an hour and 10 minutes after the collision. The blood alcohol content of the sample was found to be 0.058 grams per 100 ml of blood. In addition, 0.039 mg per litre of Delta 9-THC acid was detected in the Applicant’s blood. Dr Judith Perl, a pharmacologist, formed the view that, at the time of driving, the Applicant was under the influence of alcohol to an extent that there would have been some impairment of his driving ability. The discovery of Delta 9-THC acid indicated cannabis use at some stage by the Applicant. However, Dr Perl was unable to say whether it evidenced recent use or a residual concentration of cannabis arising from earlier use, so that an opinion could not be expressed concerning impairment by cannabis at the time of the collision. In these circumstances, his Honour disregarded the presence of Delta-9 THC acid in the Applicant’s blood. 
     
      
       
      History of Proceedings 
       
      
    32 It is pertinent to refer to the chronology of events between the commission of the offences and the imposition of sentence in the District Court. 
     
      
    33 The offences were committed on 7 November 2006.  
     
      
    34 On 16 November 2006, the Applicant made a signed statement concerning the collision in which he nominated MA as the driver of the vehicle at the time of the collision. In the statement, the Applicant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I remember saying things to  
        [MA]  
        about his driving, and I remember  
        [DF] 
         saying similar things, but  
        [MA]  
        didn’t slow down as far as I remember.  
        [MA]  
        continued speeding along Violet Town Road and I remember we came close to some gutters and traffic islands as we proceeded along the Road. The car fish-tailed a few times until the road levelled out. Almost the last thing I remember is the car’s hub-caps hitting the left-hand gutter (on my side) somewhere near the intersection with Croudace Road. I don’t remember the car veering across the road and hitting the electricity pole near Regent Street, but I understand that is what happened. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital.” 
        
       
      
    35 On 23 November 2006, the Applicant attended the Newcastle Police Station with his solicitor. The Applicant declined to take part in a record of interview with police, but the statement dated 16 November 2006 was handed to police.  
     
      
    36 On 23 November 2006, the Applicant was charged with a number of offences arising from the collision. 
     
      
    37 The officer-in-charge of the investigation, Senior Constable Harman of the Newcastle Crash Investigation Unit, prepared a report dated 7 January 2007 and a consultant engineer, Grant Johnstone, completed a report dated 6 October 2007. Both Senior Constable Harman and Mr Johnstone expressed similar opinions as to the dynamics of the collision. In summary, the conclusion was that moments prior to the collision, the Commodore was being driven in a generally southerly direction along Violet Town Road at a speed of between 125 kph and 144 kph. The driver was in the process of rounding a slight right-hand bend near the intersection of Croudace and Violet Town Roads, when the driver allowed the vehicle to run wide out of the bend. This caused the passenger side wheels to come into contact with a concrete kerb on the eastern side of Violet Town Road. The driver corrected the vehicle by steering to the right. This steering caused the vehicle to commence to rotate clockwise. The driver again tried to correct the vehicle by applying steering to the left. This caused the vehicle to commence to rotate anti-clockwise. The vehicle travelled in an arced path in a yaw across to the incorrect side of the road. The vehicle impacted with and mounted the western kerb and travelled briefly on the grassed footpath before impacting with the power pole.  
     
      
    38 Senior Constable Harman and Mr Johnstone were each of the opinion that the force of the impact would have forced the occupants in the front of the vehicle violently to their right. The driver would have been briefly, but violently, restrained by the seatbelt over his right shoulder, as well as being restrained by the lap sash. The front passenger would not have been restrained by his seatbelt and would have come into contact with anything immediately to his right.  
     
      
    39 The force of the collision caused the front of the vehicle to separate from the rear. The separation occurred forward of the centre B pillar, and when this separation occurred, the driver’s seatbelt, with one end still attached to the B pillar was ripped from the floor pan of the car. Both Senior Constable Harman and Mr Johnstone expected that the driver would have ended up in the vicinity where the Applicant was first observed. The front portion of the vehicle was halfway through the turn and the energy caused the occupant of the front-passenger seat to be launched backwards out of his seat and there was nothing to stop his trajectory. Both Senior Constable Harman and Mr Johnstone expected the front passenger would have come to rest in the area further along Regent Street where MA was located.  
     
      
    40 Dr Kevin Lee, senior specialist forensic pathologist, was engaged to review the photographs of the collision and of the injuries sustained by MA and the Applicant. Dr Lee provided a report in which he concluded that the injuries found on the Applicant were entirely consistent with him having been the driver, and that the pattern of injuries found on MA were not consistent with him being the driver at the time of the collision. Dr Lee’s opinion was supported by Associate Professor Timothy Lyons, the forensic pathologist who undertook the autopsies on the deceased. Associate Professor Lyons concluded that the injuries he observed on MA were consistent with him being the front passenger in the vehicle at the time of the collision. 
     
      
    41 On 4 December 2007, a three-day hearing commenced at the Broadmeadow Children’s Court which culminated in the Applicant being committed to stand trial in the Newcastle District Court. The prosecution case against the Applicant was based upon engineering, crash investigation and forensic evidence outlined above, which pointed very strongly to the Applicant being the driver of the vehicle at the time it struck the power pole. 
     
      
    42 The Magistrate held that there was a prima facie case, and the parties addressed on whether the matters should be dealt with according to law or finalised in the Children’s Court. The Magistrate determined that the penalties available under s.33 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 were not sufficient to accommodate the seriousness of the case (if the Applicant was convicted), and that the matters should be dealt with according to law on indictment.  
     
      
    43 On 21 February 2008, the Applicant was arraigned at the Newcastle District Court and entered pleas of not guilty to the three counts then contained in the indictment. A trial date was fixed to commence on 12 May 2008. 
     
      
    44 On 8 May 2008, the matter was relisted and the Applicant pleaded guilty to the counts involving the deaths of MA and DF with the count concerning grievous bodily harm to KL being placed on a Form 1. The trial date of 12 May 2008 was vacated. 
     
      
    45 The sentencing hearing proceeded before his Honour Judge Coolahan on 1 and 5 August 2008, with the Applicant being remanded in custody on the latter date.  
     
      
    46 On 22 August 2008, sentences of imprisonment were passed which are the subject of the present application.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Features 
       
      
    47 The Applicant was 17 years and two weeks old at the time of the offences. He had no criminal or traffic history. As mentioned earlier, he had held a learner’s permit for about 11 months, but had not obtained a driver’s licence.  
     
      
    48 The Applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing and wrote a letter which was tendered in evidence (ROS21-22). The sentencing Judge made adverse findings concerning aspects of the Applicant’s evidence, which will be mentioned later in this judgment (at [59], [64]). 
     
      
    49 The Applicant had formed a relationship with a young woman since the collision, and a son has been born to the relationship in March 2008. Testimonials were tendered from the Applicant’s partner and her father, from the Applicant’s grandmother and mother and from a butcher with whom the Applicant had undertaken work experience. Each of the testimonials spoke generally as to the Applicant’s good character (ROS22-23). 
     
      
    50 As required by law, a background report prepared by officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice was before the sentencing Judge. His Honour made extensive reference to this report in the remarks on sentence (ROS13-16). 
     
      
    51 A psychological report by Ms Katie Seidler dated 18 June 2008 was tendered on sentence. The sentencing Judge made extensive reference to Ms Seidler’s report (ROS16-21). Ms Seidler’s report recited the Applicant’s satisfactory progress through primary school before difficulties developed in his secondary education, culminating in his expulsion from school in Year 9. The family history given to Ms Seidler by the Applicant referred to a disturbed and dysfunctional family environment, including substance abuse and domestic violence. The Applicant informed Ms Seidler that he had been unemployed for about two years. Psychological testing showed that the Applicant’s overall intelligence was estimated to be in the average range.  
     
      
    52 As mentioned earlier, the Applicant was injured in the collision. A report from the treating doctor was tendered on sentence (ROS23-24). The Applicant was unconscious upon arrival at hospital. He had an open appendectomy wound. He had a dislocated rib, but no fractures. The Applicant had sustained cuts on his eyelid, scalp and knee that required sutures. He had pulmonary contusions. There was no evidence of any ongoing injury at the time of sentence and this was consistent with the treating doctor’s prognosis. 
     
      
    53 The aunt of the victim, DF, gave evidence on behalf of the Applicant and said that the Applicant was happy-go-lucky before the collision and had expressed to her his contrition and remorse (ROS22).  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    54 The Applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the aggravating features of the offences. 
       
       
      (b) Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred in the manner in which he had regard to the harm to third parties. 
       
       
      (c) Ground 3 - the sentencing Judge erred in making findings that were capable of giving rise to the more serious offence of manslaughter. 
       
       
      (d) Ground 4 - the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Some Findings by the Sentencing Judge 
       
      
    55 His Honour made detailed remarks on sentence. It is appropriate to set out parts of the remarks on sentence which have attracted attention in submissions. I have underlined certain passages about which particular complaint is made in Ground 3.  
     
      
    56 After reciting the facts, his Honour made the following observations (ROS8): 
     
      
       
        
        “These offences are of course extremely serious. This case is yet another example of young people failing to heed the warnings regarding the dangers of speed, whilst driving motor vehicles. There was on the part of the offender, and it is so conceded by his learned counsel, a complete abandonment of responsibility. As a result of this appalling incident of driving, two young men have lost their lives and another young woman has been seriously and permanently impaired. The grief and loss consequent upon these deaths and injury, can barely be imagined but some idea can be gained from the victim impact material.” 
        
       
      
    57 After referring to the victim impact statements, the sentencing Judge said (ROS12-13): 
     
      
       
        
        “I have taken these statements into account in the way in which it is appropriate to do so on sentence. What they do, in my view, is to provide a real insight into the extent of trauma, pain and loss that typically results from crimes such as this, not just to the victims but to their family and friends as well. Innocent people’s lives have been affected forever. I suspect that even these statements provide only a glimpse of the day to day pain and suffering endured by the family and friends of the deceased and by  
        [KL] 
        . 
         
         
        It is difficult to know what more Parliament can do to discourage people, such as this offender, from driving in the way that he did. The television is saturated with ads which point out the dangers of speeding on public roads. The offences which used to be known as culpable driving are in themselves, probably the only offences in the Crimes Act which do not require a criminal intent. However, these offences did involve a complete abandonment of responsibility.  
        Even given the youth of the offender, he could not have but failed to realise the very serious danger in driving in the way in which he did but he did so nonetheless 
        .” 
        
       
      
    58 After referring extensively to the report of Ms Seidler, his Honour said (T21.6): 
     
      
       
        
        “I have found the report from Dr Seidler, with due respect to her, of limited assistance for reasons which will become obvious shortly. I do not accept that the offender has little or no memory of the events leading up to the accident. Further, whilst this offence was committed whilst he was only sixteen  
        [sic]  
        years of age, he was on the verge of obtaining his provisional licence and,  
        as I said earlier, it must have been abundantly clear to him and, indeed, anyone else in his position that the course of driving which he embarked upon was potentially lethal. That potential came to fruition 
        .” 
        
       
      
    59 His Honour turned to an assessment of the Applicant’s evidence, in particular with respect to the circumstances of the offences and the Applicant’s recollection of the events (ROS24-26): 
     
      
       
        
        “A real issue which arose during the course of the offender's evidence and, indeed, which has been present throughout the case, is the point at which he recognised his guilt, vis-a-vis, the point in time when he decided to admit his guilt and also as to how much of the accident and the events leading up to it, he actually remembers. 
         
         
        Much cross-examination was directed to the version which the offender gave to police on 23 November 2008 as contained in the statement signed by him on 16 November 2006, some nine days after the accident and at a time when he not  
        [sic]  
        had access to the statements supplied by Mr Trenerry. There was, of course, a considerable degree of similarity between the statements signed by the offender and the account given by Mr Trenerry. 
        
       
       
        
        In his evidence, the offender attempted to explain this away in various ways. At one stage he said that people had told him things. He also said that he assumed that this would be the way in which hoons behaved, having conceded that he was driving like a hoon at the time. At another point, he said that he had been told that there were marks on the roadway. At another point, he said that he may have been guessing and that the similarity between his version and that of Mr Trenerry was, therefore, by implication, coincidental. 
         
         
        His answers in relation to this, are to say the least, inconsistent and unsatisfactory. I have no doubt that he has significantly more memory of the events preceding the accident than he claims to have and that in that regard, he simply transposed himself for the deceased  
        [MA] 
         in the statement of 16 November 2006. I do not mean to say by this that his memory of the events preceding the accident is necessarily perfect, but I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it extended to the details of the driving which are set out in that statement which he attributed to  
        [MA] 
        . 
         
         
        Having said that, however, I should make it abundantly clear that whilst he failed to acknowledge his guilt and responsibility in respect of these offences until late in the piece, I do take into account his age, the fact that he may not have had the wherewithal to face the enormity of what he done and the consequences thereof and I stressed throughout argument the offender is not to be punished additionally for this failure but rather, in my view, it is more relevant to issues of remorse and the timing of his pleas. 
         
         
        I must say that the overall impression that I gained from his evidence is that he is still reluctant to fully acknowledge the consequences of his actions, but again this is not a matter which would involve extra punishment but rather maybe a reflection of his youth and inability to accept and acknowledge that he has caused the deaths of two persons and a very serious injury of another and the consequences for not only them and their families but for him as a result. 
         
         
        Insofar as in his evidence the offender claimed to have no memory of anything after the group being at the Lake Macquarie Fair. I reject this.” 
        
       
      
    60 The sentencing Judge referred to the relevance of alcohol to the collision (ROS26): 
     
      
       
        
        “He  
        [defence counsel]  
        submitted that I should ignore the aspect of cannabis being present in the blood of the offender at the time of the collision and I accept this submission in that Ms Perl could not be satisfied that it was relevant to his ability to drive. However, I do take into account the fact that his driving was partially impaired by his consumption of alcohol.” 
        
       
      
    61 With respect to contrition, his Honour said (ROS26-27): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Booth  
        [defence counsel]  
        submitted that I should accept that the offender was contrite and remorseful and that these feelings were heartfelt. I have some doubts about this, as I said earlier. I have no doubt that he suffers because his friends had been killed but I just think that he still has some problems coming to grips with the fact that his conduct was the cause of their death and the serious injury to  
        [KL] 
        . As Mr Bates  
        [the Crown]  
        has put it, his remorse and contrition was late.” 
        
       
       
      
    62 His Honour addressed a defence submission concerning the victim impact statements in the following way (ROS27): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Booth submitted that whilst the victim impact statements excited feelings of sadness they were not relevant to sentencing proceedings. Whilst this may strictly be true, in my view they do no more than outline, in a very real way, a glimpse of what must be expected to flow from the deaths of two young men and the very serious injury of a young woman.” 
        
       
      
    63 In the course of considering a defence submission concerning the Applicant’s youth, his Honour said (ROS27): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Booth drew attention to the offender’s youth and to the fact that perhaps because of this he had less ability to deal with responsibility. Whilst this may be the case it seems to me that this is somewhat of a double edged sword. The reality is that the laws of this State permit young people to drive motor vehicles.  
        As I said earlier, it is difficult to imagine what else Parliament can do to make it clear to young people that driving vehicles at speed on public streets is potentially lethal. The offender must have been acutely aware of this 
        . In these circumstances it seems to me that the courts must then assume a role of ensuring that like minded offenders are discouraged from driving in the same manner by imposing sentences that reflect an adequate degree of general deterrence.” 
        
       
      
    64 His Honour accepted certain Crown submissions concerning the Applicant’s manner of driving leading to the collision, general deterrence and the utilitarian discount for the pleas of guilty (ROS29): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Bates submitted that as soon as the offender took the car he assumed the responsibility of a prudent driver and I accept this submission. He referred to the evidence, which the offender himself gave, namely that he drove like a hoon. He submitted that I would accept beyond reasonable doubt that the version that the offender gave in his statement dated 16 November 2006 was what actually happened, apart from the fact that  
        [MA]  
        was a passenger and the offender was the driver. And I have no doubt that this is the case. 
         
          
         
        Whilst Mr Bates conceded that, generally speaking, aspects of general deterrence, when dealing with young offenders, give way to considerations of rehabilitation, he submitted that this is not so in a case such as this, and I agree with this submission. Mr Bates submitted that the discount for the pleas should be in the order of only ten percent and I agree that this figure is appropriate. The pleas were entered very late and after considerable investigation had been completed by the Crown and at a point where the Crown was obviously prepared for trial.” 
        
       
      
    65 In the course of addressing factors under s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour said (ROS29): 
     
      
       
        
        “In dealing with the offender I have taken into account those matters required to be considered under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Aggravating factors which are not part of or inherent in the charges themselves are difficult to identify except perhaps for the very serious nature of the injuries to  
        [KL] 
        . As against that, the offender does not have any record of previous convictions. I am satisfied that he was a person of otherwise good character.” 
          
        
       
      
    66 With respect to remorse, his Honour concluded (ROS28-29): 
     
      
       
        
        “On the question of remorse, this is a difficult issue. On balance, however, I am satisfied that whilst he still has some reservations in this regard, he has by his ultimate pleas acknowledged that the death and injuries have been caused by his actions.” 
        
       
      
    67 His Honour observed that the Form 1 matter, to be taken into account on sentence for Count 1, was “a very serious offence and more than just lip service must be paid to it” (ROS30). 
     
      
    68 Before moving to imposition of the specific sentences, his Honour said (ROS30): 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the offences themselves, as I said they are incredibly serious. The driving involved many of the aggravating factors set out in the Court of Criminal Appeal Guideline in  
        Whyte 
        , there were two deaths and one grievous bodily harm occasioned, the degree of speed was very significant. There was some intoxication, a number of people were put at risk, namely the three passengers in the vehicle in particular. It may be that at that time of the night traffic was light but the reality is that anyone who was on the road at that time or even in the vicinity would have been put at risk by this driving. The driving was erratic and aggressive, the length of the journey was at least 1.6 kilometres and there is reference in the offender’s statement to warnings being issued by passengers about the nature of the driving.”  
        
       
      
    69 His Honour accepted a defence submission that “special circumstances” should be found by reference to the Applicant’s youth, his need for support upon release from custody and the fact that it was to be his first time in custody (ROS28). However, his Honour rejected a defence submission that there should be a significant alteration to the statutory ratio so that general deterrence could be reflected in the head sentences rather than the non-parole periods. His Honour observed that “the aggregate non-parole periods must also reflect a significant aspect of general deterrence” (ROS28). 
     
      
    70 The sentencing Judge had regard to the principles concerning concurrency, accumulation and totality (ROS28, 30-31). 
     
      
    71 The sentence imposed for Count 2 involved a non-parole period which was 50% of the full term. The sentence imposed for Count 1 (including the Form 1 offence) involved a non-parole period which was 44% of the full term. Although s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies to each individual sentence (Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [11]), it may be noted that the total effective non-parole period was 54% of the total effective head sentence.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in his Assessment of the Aggravating Features of the Offences 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    72 Ms Francis, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that the sentencing Judge inappropriately took into account a number of features as aggravating features. She submitted that his Honour (at [68] above) treated as aggravating factors matters which were inherent in the elements of the offences themselves. In particular, it was submitted that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the degree of speed in this case was an element of the aggravated offence and to have additional regard to it was an error; 
       
       
      (b) the fact that there were two deaths was not an aggravating feature where two charges were laid whilst the fact of the occasioning of grievous bodily harm to KL was to be taken into account, it did not aggravate the offences; 
       
       
      (c) the length of the journey (1.6 kms) was not, when regard was had to the generic offence, objectively aggravating and in any event it was unclear if the dangerous driving extended over the entirety of the journey; 
       
       
      (d) victims of offences such as these are always the persons  
      “put at risk” 
       and to have additional regard to this fact as a circumstance of aggravation must be double counting; 
       
       
      (e) it will always be the case that if other persons were relevantly present when such an offence was committed, then they would be put at risk - this was not an aggravating feature of the case; 
       
       
      (f) it was entirely speculative to find, as a matter of aggravation, that the Applicant had  
      “ignored warnings” 
       - the only evidence of this was contained in the false statement of 16 November 2006 in which the Applicant had nominated MA as the driver - the Applicant was cross-examined about this aspect of his statement, and he denied any recollection of MA telling him to slow down (T19.23, 1 August 2008) - this was not a finding that was open beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
      
    73 The Crown submitted that his Honour clearly appreciated that s.21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required that the Court not have additional regard to any aggravating factor on sentence if it was an element of the offence. His Honour went on to consider the guideline judgments in R v Jurisic [1998] 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 in the passage set out at [68] above. The Crown submitted that it was correct for his Honour to separately consider the aggravating features identified in these guidelines judgments: R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [15].  
     
      
    74 In response to the submissions of the Applicant (see [72] above), the Crown submitted: 
     
      
       
      (a) the evidence was that the Applicant’s minimum speed at the point of impact was 65 kph over the speed limit, and therefore significantly faster than the speed that would have made him liable for the aggravated offence - he was driving at a speed which was about 40% higher than the speed that would have made him liable for the aggravated offence - this was a highly relevant matter and it was appropriate to be taken into account:  
      R v Berg  
      at [25];  
       
       
      (b) his Honour had not taken into account, as an aggravating factor of each offence, the fact that there was a death involved - rather his Honour had described these facts, conscious of the need not to have regard to aggravating factors twice - further, the seriousness of the injury to KL, in an aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm case, was relevant to the objective gravity of the offence:  
      R v Tzanis  
      [2005] NSWCCA 274 at [13]; 
       
       
      (c) contrary to the Applicant’s submissions, the Applicant’s dangerous driving extended over the entirety of the journey from the Lake Macquarie Shopping Centre to the point of impact - so much was demonstrated by Mr Trenerry’s observations and the Applicant’s own account in his letter to police dated 16 November 2006 - his Honour was entitled to take into account at least 1.6 kms of dangerous driving, as the length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk, and with the danger created by the length of the journey varying according to other circumstances such as the locale - in this case, a continuous course of dangerous driving over 1.6 kms through roads beside a retail shopping area, and in an established residential neighbourhood, entitled his Honour to take the length of driving into account; 
       
       
      (d) the more people an offender has in his or her car at the time of engaging in dangerous driving, the greater the risk involved and the greater the objective seriousness of the offending ( 
      R v Berg  
      at [26]) - every passenger in the Applicant’s car was either killed or very seriously injured - however that does not mean that it is double counting to take into account the number of people put at risk; 
       
       
      (e) read in context, what his Honour was saying was that all the passengers in the car were put at risk and anyone else on the road, either driving or on foot, during this course of dangerous driving was put at risk by the erratic and aggressive driving over the course of at least 1.6 kms - no error was revealed in this approach; 
       
       
      (f) his Honour’s finding that the Applicant had ignored warnings was not, the Crown submitted, based on speculation - it was open to his Honour to so find on the evidence to the criminal standard (ROS25) - the sentencing Judge found that the Applicant’s account of 16 November 2006 was false in only one respect, his denial that he was the driver, but otherwise constituted an account of events which was not denied by the Applicant in cross-examination (T19, 1 August 2008). 
       
       
      Decision 
       
      
    75 This Court is bound by findings of fact of the sentencing Judge, unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504: R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [61].  
     
      
    76 The remarks on sentence of the sentencing Judge must be fairly read. The sentencing Judge was conscious of the need to avoid double counting of aggravating factors, as demonstrated by the care taken by reference to s.21A considerations (see [65] above). The portion of the remarks on sentence challenged under this ground addresses matters which all bore upon the objective seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
    77 It is necessary to bear in mind, as Howie J (Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreeing) observed in R v Berg at [15], that relevant factors influencing an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence of this type were to be found in three distinct, but related, areas: 
     
      
       
      (a) the elements of the offence of aggravated dangerous driving; 
       
       
      (b) the guideline judgment in  
      R v Whyte 
      ; and 
       
       
      (c) s.21A  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      ,  
       
       
      with there being a degree of overlap in the areas, and the relevant considerations, arising under each heading. 
       
      
    78 By reference to the submissions set out at [72] above, I conclude: 
     
      
       
      (a) the sentencing Judge was entitled to have regard to the actual speed of 125 kph as an aggravating factor given that it was significantly above the statutory aggravating level (in this case) of 105 kph - this was a most relevant matter to be taken into account which aggravated the seriousness of the offence; 
       
       
      (b) I do not accept that the sentencing Judge treated as an aggravating factor of each offence the fact that two deaths had resulted - that two deaths had resulted, reflected in two separate offences, was relevant to the totality of the Applicant’s criminality; 
       
       
      (c) the sentencing Judge did not err in referring to the length of the journey of 1.6 kms, and the course of driving during that journey, as an aggravating factor on sentence - the observations of Mr Trenerry pointed to a course of dangerous driving over a significant distance on residential streets which culminated in the vehicle colliding with the pole at high speed:  
      R v Takai 
       (2004) 149 A Crim R 593 at 600 [39] - it is noteworthy that the Applicant’s counsel in the District Court had submitted that  
      “the length of the journey was 1.6 kilometres and your Honour can find that that is indeed the length that he exposed those people  
      [MA, DF and KL]  
      to that risk”  
      (T5.48, 5 August 2008) - this finding was open to the sentencing Judge in the circumstances of the case; 
       
       
      (d) it was open to the sentencing Judge to refer to the number of persons put at risk as a circumstance of aggravation - there were three other persons in the Commodore driven by the Applicant - the Applicant’s counsel in the District Court had accepted that  
      “the risk to those in the car was extreme”  
      (T5.47, 5 August 2008) - the Applicant knew that he had passengers in the motor vehicle who were in danger because of the manner in which he drove the vehicle:  
      R v Berg  
      at [26] - the fact that each of them was killed or seriously injured does not render it impermissible for the sentencing Judge to have regard to the number of people put at risk by the course of driving, as an aggravating factor; 
       
       
      (e) the observation of the sentencing Judge, fairly read, meant that all the passengers in the car were put at risk and anyone else who may be on or in the vicinity of the roadway at the time would likewise be put at risk by the Applicant’s course of driving over a significant distance - this approach was open to the sentencing Judge; 
       
       
      (f) the finding of the sentencing Judge that the Applicant had ignored warnings was open on the evidence - the Applicant’s account of 16 November 2006 (see [34] above) was found by his Honour to be false in one respect only, namely his denial that he was the driver (see [59], [64] above) - his Honour’s finding involved acceptance that passengers in the vehicle warned the Applicant concerning the dangers of his driving prior to the fatal collision but that he did not slow down - no error is demonstrated in this conclusion. 
       
      
    79 It has not been demonstrated that his Honour double counted aggravating factors on sentence. No error of principle has been demonstrated in his Honour’s approach, nor has it been demonstrated that the findings of fact of the sentencing Judge were not open on the evidence. 
     
      
    80 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in the Manner in Which He had Regard to the Harm to Third Parties 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    81 Ms Francis submitted that error was revealed in the sentencing Judge’s reference to harm to third parties on sentence (ROS8-12). Counsel noted that his Honour had made extensive reference to the contents of the victim impact statements. It was submitted that error was revealed in the statements of the sentencing Judge set out at [56]-[57], [62] above. 
     
      
    82 Ms Francis observed that his Honour had not referred to R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76, nor to relevant authorities concerning victim impact statements in cases of dangerous driving causing death, including R v Berg and R v Tzanis.  
     
      
    83 Although acknowledging that his Honour had expressed some qualification concerning the use which could be made of this material, Ms Francis submitted that the Court, in effect, had taken into account the victim impact statements in a manner prohibited by decisions of this Court. 
     
      
    84 The Crown submitted that his Honour had not taken the victim impact statements into account on sentence in an impermissible way. The authorities do not preclude the general relevance of the acknowledged fact that death is attended by distress, and his Honour’s comments did no more than demonstrate that point by reference to the victim impact statements. The Crown points to statements in the remarks on sentence indicating that his Honour was conscious of the limitations to be placed on the use of victim impact material.  
     
      
    85 The Crown submitted that the references to the victim impact statements in the remarks on sentence were warranted by s.28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which required acknowledgement of receipt of the statements and permitted the Court to make any comment on them that the Court considered appropriate. The fact that his Honour did not refer to any authority concerning the use of victim impact statements, the Crown submitted, was not indicative of error. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    86 A sentencing Judge must approach victim impact statements (from the family of a deceased victim) within the confines laid down by R v Previtera at 84-87; R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 at 529-530; R v Tzanis at [15]-[18] and Whybrow v R [2008] NSWCCA 270 at [17]. The seriousness of injury to a surviving victim is relevant to the objective gravity of an offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm: R v Tzanis at [13]. 
     
      
    87 The victim impact statements were received and considered for the purposes of s.28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 28(3) provides that a court must receive a victim impact statement given by a family victim (of the deceased, MA and DF) and acknowledge its receipt, and may make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate.  
     
      
    88 The sentencing Judge set out, in some detail, the content of the victim impact statements made by the mother of MA and the mother of DF (prepared on behalf of herself and the stepfather and siblings of DF), together with a victim impact statement of the surviving victim, KL. To the extent that complaint is made, under this ground of appeal, to the fact that extensive reference was made to the victim impact statements by the sentencing Judge, I observe that there is no statutory or other restriction upon the extent to which a sentencing Judge may set out the contents of such statements. There is no requirement for victim impact statements to be referred to in some shorthand way. It is understandable, in the present case, that his Honour set out the contents in some detail, a course which was open to the Court under s.28 of the Act. The victim impact statements outlined the devastating consequences upon the families of the deceased young men and also the profound effects upon the young woman who survived the collision.  
     
      
    89 One of the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender is “to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community”: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    90 The experienced sentencing Judge was conscious of the limitations upon the use of this evidence (see [57], [62] above). I take these statements to be references to the well-known R v Previtera principle governing the use of such material from families of deceased victims. The Applicant’s counsel in the District Court had referred to R v Previtera in the course of submissions (T6.49, 5 August 2008). 
     
      
    91 It has not been demonstrated that his Honour misused the victim impact material on sentence in this case. I would reject Ground 2 of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in Sentencing the Applicant as Though he was Liable for the Crime of Manslaughter 
       
       
      Submissions 
      
    92 Ms Francis submitted that a number of findings of the sentencing Judge breached the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 389, in that they were consistent with conduct which would give rise to the more serious offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act involving, from the standpoint of a reasonable person, an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson v The Queen (1991) 174 CLR 313 at 333. The comments of the sentencing Judge relied upon in this respect are those underlined in the passages set out at [57], [58] and [63] above. Indeed, in oral submissions (T9.27, 22 June 2009), Ms Francis contended that his Honour’s comments extended to an effective finding of reckless indifference to human life, an element of murder. 
     
      
    93 Ms Francis relied upon R v Vukic [2003] NSWCCA 13, where Adams J acknowledged the importance of distinguishing between culpability that would found the offence of manslaughter and that of dangerous driving causing death. 
     
      
    94 The Applicant submitted that his Honour’s comments carry with them the irresistible conclusion that the reasonable person (and indeed, the Applicant) would, by such driving as was disclosed in this case, have appreciated, at the very least, the real risk of death.  
     
      
    95 It was submitted that these findings went beyond those available for the offences for which the Applicant stood to be sentenced, and infected the exercise of the sentencing discretion as demonstrated, so it was submitted, by the severity of the sentences imposed upon a juvenile offender. 
     
      
    96 The Crown submitted that the impugned remarks of the sentencing Judge related to an assessment of the Applicant’s moral culpability and the degree of his abandonment of responsibility. 
     
      
    97 In written submissions dated 26 June 2009 (furnished in accordance with the Court’s direction at the hearing), the Crown acknowledged that motor vehicle manslaughter by gross negligence is a more serious crime than one under s.52A(2), with a greater degree of negligence being required for manslaughter: R v Buttsworth (1983) 1 NSWLR 658 at 664-674. The Crown also pointed to the statutory hierarchy of offences concerning the infliction of death or serious injury by the use of a motor vehicle, which includes, in s.52AA(4), the ability for a jury to convict of an offence under s.52A on a trial for manslaughter: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [56]. 
     
      
    98 The Crown observed, however, that the Applicant’s complaint here was made by reference to the elements of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.  
     
      
    99 The Crown accepted that manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act requires the commission of an act causing death that carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson v The Queen at 333; Carroll v The Queen (2009) 83 ALJR 579 at 583 [21]. In the present case, the sentencing Judge observed that it must have been clear to the Applicant that the course of driving was “potentially lethal” (ROS21.8).  
     
      
    100 The Crown referred to R v Vukic, where Adams J at [9]-[11] acknowledged that an offender could not be punished for a crime for which he had not been convicted (manslaughter), although his Honour continued in that case to describe the offender as driving “with considerable recklessness and disgraceful irresponsibility, which resulted in a fatal collision which was clearly foreseeable to any reasonable person”. I take the Crown submission by reference to R v Vukic to be that, although it is always necessary for a sentencing Judge to keep in mind the principle in The Queen v De Simoni, strong findings of fact may and ought be made if the facts of the case warrant it, as long as the sentencing Judge does not breach the relevant principle. 
     
      
    101 The Crown submitted that the findings and conclusions expressed by his Honour were open, and that no error had been demonstrated in that respect. 
     
      
    102 Even if error had been established, the Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted in law: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
      Decision 
       
      
    103 Two issues arise for consideration under this ground: 
     
      
       
      (a) Is manslaughter a more serious offence than aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death for the purpose of the principle in  
      The Queen v De Simoni 
      ? 
       
       
      (b) If so, do the comments complained of in this case infringe that principle? 
       
       
      Does the Principle in  
      The Queen v De Simoni  
      Apply 
      ? 
       
      
    104 In imposing sentence, a Judge is entitled to consider all the conduct of the offender, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence: The Queen v De Simoni at 389.  
     
      
    105 The usual approach to determine whether an offence is a “more serious offence”, for the purpose of this principle, is to consider the maximum penalty for the crime: R v Hooper [2004] NSWCCA 10 at [26]. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. The maximum penalty for aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death is imprisonment for 14 years.  
     
      
    106 The legislative history of offences now contained in s.52A Crimes Act 1900 suggests that, at the time of their enactment, offences of culpable driving were understood to be offences of lesser gravity than manslaughter by criminal negligence: Attorney General v Bindoff (1953) 53 SR(NSW) 489 at 490; R v Buttsworth at 674-683; Director of Public Prosecutions v Yeo [2008] NSWSC 953; 51 MVR 157 at 161-163 [22]-[32]. The more recent history of s.52A was considered in R v Jurisic at 225-229, including the creation in 1994 of the offences of aggravated dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm, offences carrying maximum penalties of imprisonment for 14 years and 11 years respectively. 
     
      
    107 In R v Borkowski, Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) described the hierarchy of driving offences involving death or grievous bodily harm in the following way at [55]-[56]: 
     
      
       
        
        “55 At the present time, apart from the offences of murder and manslaughter, the Crimes Act contains the following provisions: s 51A, predatory driving causing grievous bodily harm; s 52A, dangerous driving; s 53, furious driving; and s 54, negligent act causing grievous bodily harm. Section 52A contains the following offences: dangerous driving causing death, maximum penalty 10 years; aggravated dangerous driving causing death maximum penalty 14 years; dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, maximum penalty imprisonment for 7 years; and aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, maximum penalty imprisonment for 11 years. The circumstances of aggravation are set out in s 52A(7) and include: having a concentration of alcohol of at least 0.15; driving at more that 45 kph above the speed limit; driving to escape police pursuit; and driving while driving skills are very substantially impaired by the influence of a drug or drugs. 
         
         
        56 As the law presently stands, there is a rational, logical and cohesive hierarchy of offences concerned with the infliction of death or serious injury by the use of a motor vehicle. The offences range from negligent driving causing grievous bodily harm (s 42(1)(b) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act with a maximum penalty of 9 months imprisonment) through the driving offences in the Crimes Act to manslaughter by gross criminal negligence. All of these offences involve varying degrees of negligence, however the actual conduct may be described, ranging from a lack of care and proceeding through dangerousness to culpable negligence:  
        R v Buttsworth 
         [1983] 1 NSWLR 658. This structure is acknowledged by s 52AA(4) that provides that on a trial for an offence of manslaughter or an offence under s 53 or s 54 a jury can return a verdict of guilty of an offence under s 52A. It is also seen in s 52A(6), a provision that prevents a person being convicted of both manslaughter and an offence under s 52A arising from the same facts.” 
        
       
      
    108 As noted in R v Borkowski at [56], the location of manslaughter above a s.52A offence in the hierarchy of offences is demonstrated by s.52AA(4) concerning alternative verdicts: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4)  
        Alternative verdicts 
         
         
          
          If on the trial of a person who is indicted for murder or manslaughter or for an offence under section 53 or 54 the jury is satisfied that the person is guilty of an offence under section 52A, it may find the accused guilty of the offence under section 52A, and the accused is liable to punishment accordingly.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    109 There is a further unusual feature about the offence of manslaughter. Historically, there has been a statutory qualification concerning the penalty for manslaughter. A maximum penalty was prescribed and, until 1974, other periods of imprisonment were specified in the relevant section. Further, a proviso has existed, and continues to exist, which permits a Judge to discharge the jury (giving rise to an acquittal) if a nominal punishment was sufficient in the circumstances. 
     
      
    110 As enacted in the Crimes Act 1900, s.24 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “24. Whosoever commits the crime of manslaughter shall be liable to penal servitude for life, or for any term not less than three years, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three years: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Provided that, in any case, if the Judge is of opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, a nominal punishment would be sufficient, he may discharge the jury from giving any verdict, and such discharge shall operate as an acquittal.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    111 In an article entitled “Manslaughter by Negligent Act or Omission” (1958) 31 ALJ 630 at 636, Mr HA Snelling QC observed that the NSW legislature (in s.24) had “recognized that in some circumstances manslaughter may merit no punishment”. 
     
      
    112 The 1973 Report of the Criminal Law Committee on Proposed Amendments to Criminal Law and Procedure, chaired by his Honour Judge Amsberg, recommended amendment to s.24 concerning punishment for manslaughter: 
     
      
       
        
        “We recommend that section 24 provide simply that the punishment for manslaughter be penal servitude for life - subject, of course, to reduction under section 442. The words of section 24 recommended for omission appear to us to have no practical effect other than to confuse the reader. We suspect that they are an unintended survival from the days before section 442 was amended, in 1924, to create the same effect as the words under attack.” 
        
       
      
    113 As a result, s.24 was amended by the Crimes and Other Acts (Amendment) Act 1974  to provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “24. Whosoever commits the crime of manslaughter shall be liable to penal servitude for life. 
         
         
          
          Provided that, in any case, if the Judge is of opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, a nominal punishment would be sufficient, he may discharge the jury from giving any verdict, and such discharge shall operate as an acquittal.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    114 Section 24 was amended again by the Crimes (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1989, which made a series of amendments (to ss.24, 26, 27, 28 and 29) as part of the “truth in sentencing” statutory regime, whereby a maximum penalty of life imprisonment was replaced by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Since 1989, s.24 has been in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “24  
        Manslaughter - punishment 
         
         
          
          Whosoever commits the crime of manslaughter shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years: 
          
         
         
          
          Provided that, in any case, if the Judge is of the opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances, a nominal punishment would be sufficient, the Judge may discharge the jury from giving any verdict, and such discharge shall operate as an acquittal.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    115 The Hon Mervyn Finlay QC, in his “Review of the Law of Manslaughter in New South Wales” (April 2003, paragraph 6.4, page 26), observed that the “extreme range of moral culpability for the offence of manslaughter is acknowledged by the legislature” in s.24 of the Act in its present form.  
     
      
    116 In R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1, Spigelman CJ at 27 [133]-[134] observed that “manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. … In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder”. 
     
      
    117 In cases of motor vehicle manslaughter, it has been said to be unproductive to consider, in a manslaughter case, what might have been the appropriate sentence for an offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death: R v Cameron (2005) 157 A Crim R 70 at 75 [26]. Manslaughter has been described as a “markedly more serious offence” than a s.52A offence: R v Cramp (1999) 110 A Crim R 198 at 220 [108]; R v Cameron at 75-76 [28]. 
     
      
    118 Thus, both statutory provisions and relevant authorities point to a hierarchy of offences with manslaughter located above aggravated dangerous driving causing death under s.52A. Despite the unusual features surrounding the offence of manslaughter, it should be treated as a more serious offence for the purpose of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni. 
     
      
       
      Was the Principle Breached in this Case

    119 In assessing the objective seriousness of a s.52A offence, it is necessary and appropriate for a sentencing Judge to make findings with respect to the degree of abandonment of responsibility and the moral culpability of the offender.  
     
      
    120 Clearly, a sentencing Judge cannot approach the question of penalty upon the basis that the offender has committed the crime of manslaughter when the offender stands to be sentenced for a s.52A offence.  
     
      
    121 Motor vehicle manslaughter cases ordinarily involve an allegation of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act and/or manslaughter by criminal negligence. Counsel for the Applicant focused upon the former category. However, reference should be made as well, in this context, to criminal negligence manslaughter. These are the two categories of involuntary manslaughter at common law. Manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act carries with it an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson v The Queen at 333. Manslaughter by criminal negligence involves the commission of an act which causes death where the act of the accused was conscious and voluntary, without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm, but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable person would have exercised, and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment: Nydam v R [1977] VR 430 at 445; The Queen v Lavender (2005) 222 CLR 67 at 75 [17], 87-88 [60], 90 [72].  
     
      
    122 It will be apparent that some of the concepts which may arise for consideration in a case of motor vehicle manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act or by criminal negligence are not far removed from concepts which arise with respect to, in particular, an offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death under s.52A(2). The guideline judgments of this Court in R v Jurisic at 231 and R v Whyte at 286 [216]-[220], identified a range of factors which bear upon the objective seriousness of a s.52A offence: 
     
      
      (i) extent and nature of the injuries inflicted; 
       
       
      (ii) number of people put at risk; 
       
       
      (iii) degree of speed; 
       
       
      (iv) degree of intoxication or of substance abuse; 
       
       
      (v) erratic or aggressive driving; 
       
       
      (vi) competitive driving or showing off; 
       
       
      (vii) length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk; 
       
       
      (viii) ignoring of warnings; 
       
       
      (ix) escaping police pursuit; 
       
       
      (x) degree of sleep deprivation; 
       
       
      (xi) failing to stop. 
       
      
    123 In R v Whyte at 287-288 [223], [228]-[231], the Chief Justice proceeded to explain the process for determining the level of “abandonment of responsibility” and the degree of “moral culpability”: 
     
      
       
        
        “[223] As set out above, the guideline in  
        R v Jurisic 
         was expressed in terms of an aggravating factor involving the offender's conduct being present ‘to a material degree’. The factors identified all related to the moral culpability of the offender. The reference to ‘abandonment of responsibility’ was one formulation for describing a high degree of moral culpability. The case law subsequent to  
        R v Jurisic 
         does not suggest that it has been applied as if it were a statutory test. 
         
         
          
          … 
          
         
         
        [228] In the above list of aggravating factors, items (iii)–(xi) are frequently recurring elements which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence. Individually, but more often in some combination, they may indicate that the moral culpability is high. One way of expressing such a conclusion is to ask whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. That is not the only way of expressing such a conclusion. 
         
         
        [229] The guideline for offences against s 52A(1) and s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 for the typical case identified above should be: 
         
         
          
           
            
            ‘Where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.’ 
            
           
          
         
         
        [230] In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate. 
         
         
        [231] In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment.” 
         
        
       
      
    124 In Thompson v R [2007] NSWCCA 299, Hislop J (Hodgson JA and Latham J agreeing) observed at [15]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst there is a real distinction between the extent of culpability reflected in the offence of manslaughter as distinct from the offence of dangerous driving causing death, in some cases the distinction may be a fine one -  
        R v Vukic 
         [2003] NSWCCA 13 at [10], the more so in respect of the aggravated forms of offence under s 52A.” 
        
       
      
    125 In R v Vukic at [10], Adams J said that the distinction between manslaughter and dangerous driving causing death may, in some cases, be a fine one. His Honour then characterised the offence in question, at [11], in the manner mentioned earlier in this judgment (at [100]). 
     
      
    126 The absence of a clear line of demarcation for fact finding on a s.52A offence, given the need to look at the element of risk (and awareness of risk) as part of an assessment of moral culpability, is illustrated in Gillett v R (2006) 166 A Crim R 419, where McClellan CJ at CL (Sully and Hislop JJ agreeing) said at 437-438 [47]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, as in the present case, a person takes control of a motor vehicle in circumstances where they know they represent a real risk to others and it is a risk over which they have no control, they must expect that, if the risk materialises, the penalty which will be imposed will reflect the fact that their offending had a high degree of criminality. A licence to drive a motor vehicle is a privilege which carries with it significant obligations. Those obligations require the driver to not only drive safely on the road but also to ensure that by reason of their physical health and capacity they do not endanger the lives of others. If that obligation is not met and injury or death is occasioned to others, a severe penalty will be appropriate in most cases. Every user of the road accepts a risk of injury or death. Those risks are only acceptable if other users of the road do what they can to minimise or avoid identifiable risks.” 
        
       
      
    127 In the present case, the sentencing Judge was clearly alive to the maximum penalty for the offences to which the Applicant had pleaded guilty and the distinction between those offences and offences of murder and manslaughter. Like Adams J in R v Vukic, the sentencing Judge in this case made strong findings with respect to the level of objective seriousness of the Applicant’s crimes, his level of moral culpability and the degree of abandonment of responsibility. That process involved consideration of the factors identified in R v Jurisic and R v Whyte (at [122]-[123] above). The sentencing Judge referred to these factors in the passage set out at [68] above. The most significant aspects were the Applicant’s ignoring of warnings (factor (viii) at [122]) of passengers in the vehicle to slow down, combined with grossly excessive speed (factor (iii)) and some impairment by alcohol (factor (iv)). A finding that warnings were ignored whilst driving at very high speed, as part of the assessment of moral culpability and abandonment of responsibility, involves consciousness of risk or danger which is close to, if not overlapping with, consciousness that one’s driving is “potentially lethal”. 
     
      
    128 There is no bright line test to be applied in a case such as this to guard against a breach of The Queen v De Simoni principle. An assessment whether a breach of The Queen v De Simoni  principle has occurred ought involve consideration of the substance of what was said, in the context of the case, and not merely the form of words used. An assessment of the level of moral culpability and the degree of abandonment of responsibility may, in a particular case, involve language which is close to aspects of manslaughter.  
     
      
    129 None of this is to suggest that sentencing Judges may disregard The Queen v De Simoni principle when determining sentence in cases of this type. However, I am not persuaded that the sentencing Judge in this case crossed the line into findings which took into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for the more serious offence of manslaughter (or murder). In my view, this is not a case where the principle in The Queen v De Simoni has been breached.  130 Even if the learned sentencing Judge did overstate the degree of wrongdoing, his overstatement was only a matter of degree and what he said does not amount to a material error: R v Peake (2002) 37 MVR 354; [2002] SASC 303 at 356 [18]-[19] (Doyle CJ, Wicks and Besanko JJ). 
     
      
    131 I am not persuaded that the error alleged in Ground 3 has been established. 
     
      
    132 Even if the Applicant had made good the third ground of appeal, the question would remain as to whether it has been demonstrated that some other sentence is warranted at law and ought to have been passed for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In the circumstances of this case (for reasons which will appear from consideration of Ground 4), I would not have been persuaded that this Court should intervene even if error had been established. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 - The Sentence is Manifestly Excessive in the Circumstances of the Case 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    133 Ms Francis referred to a summary of sentencing decisions in other cases in support of the contention that the sentences in this case were manifestly excessive. Whilst acknowledging that general deterrence had operation irrespective of the Applicant’s youth, it was submitted that its significance required some amelioration in this case. Ms Francis submitted that it remained necessary to determine the role which immaturity and inexperience played in the commission of such offences by young persons.  
     
      
    134 Ms Francis submitted that his Honour did not have regard to s.6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, and in particular s.6(b), despite the fact that the provision had mandatory application given the age of the Applicant. Ms Francis submitted that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive and that this Court should intervene to resentence the Applicant.  
     
      
    135 The Crown submitted that offences in contravention of s.52A(2) frequently concern offenders who are young men of good character who are genuinely remorseful: R v Whyte. In this instance, remorse only became evident close to the date fixed for trial, and followed a period when the Applicant had said that MA had been the driver at the time of the collision. 
     
      
    136 Whilst a sentencing judge must take the age and character of the offender into account, the Crown submitted that these factors had limited significance in this class of offence, and ought not be given undue weight so that sentences fail to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence. In relation to youth, the Crown submitted that the relevant principle is that, given the prevalence of this offence amongst young drivers, and the need for general deterrence, youth is to be given less weight, as a mitigating factor, than in other types of cases: R v Slattery (1996) 90 A Crim R 519 at 522-3; R v Jurisic at 228. 
     
      
    137 The Crown submitted that youth and good character were appropriately taken into account in this matter by the sentencing Judge. His Honour found special circumstances and imposed a total effective non-parole period that was 54% of the total term. 
     
      
    138 The offences were committed against different victims and, in two cases, a human life was taken. The Crown submitted that a measure of accumulation was appropriate to mark the loss of two lives: R v Whyte at 287-288 [231]. 
     
      
    139 The Crown emphasised that the degree of speed here was very significant and the Applicant was affected by alcohol. His Honour was required to have proper regard to the matter on the Form 1.  
     
      
    140 The Crown acknowledged that the relevant Judicial Commission of New South Wales statistics suggested that the total effective head sentence imposed in this case was towards the top of the range. However, the Crown observed that the same comment could not be made with respect to the non-parole period. By reference to sentencing statistics for aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death offences since R v Jurisic, the Crown submitted that it could not be concluded that the sentences imposed in this case were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    141 It is correct that the sentencing Judge did not refer to s.6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) 1987 in his remarks on sentence. However, a failure by a sentencing Judge to make some reference to the statement of principles in s.6 does not of itself constitute error: SS v R [2009] NSWCCA 114 at [64]. It is clear that detailed submissions were made concerning the relevance of the Applicant’s youth on sentence and his Honour adverted to a number of these submissions in the course of the remarks on sentence.  
     
      
    142 The relevance of the principles in s.6 to each individual case depends, to a very large extent, upon the age of the particular offender and the nature of the particular offence committed. An offender almost 18 years of age cannot expect to be treated according to law substantially differently to an offender just over 18 years of age: R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [15].  
     
      
    143 It is not the youth of an offender per se that justifies the amelioration of a sentence that would otherwise be imposed in accordance with the common law principles underlying s.6. It is only where the circumstances of a particular juvenile offender, and the circumstances of a particular offence, indicate that general deterrence and retribution ought play a lesser role that the principles are given their full expression: IE v R [2008] NSWCCA 70; 183 A Crim R 150 at 155 [16]. 
     
      
    144 At the time of sentence, s.6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “6  
        Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
         
         
          
          A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
           
           
          (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
           
           
          (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
           
           
          (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    145 On 3 November 2008, s.6 was amended to vary the opening words and to add s.6(f)-(h): 
     
      
       
        
        “6  
        Principles relating to exercise of functions under Act 
         
         
          
          A person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles: 
          
         
         
          
          (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
           
           
          (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
           
           
          (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption, 
           
           
          (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
           
           
          (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind, 
           
           
          (f) that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties, 
           
           
          (g) that it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparation for their actions, 
           
           
          (h) that, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    146 Counsel for the Applicant stressed s.6(b) as being of particular significance in this case, by reference to the Applicant’s “immaturity”. Ms Francis submitted that the sentencing Judge failed to take into account the Applicant’s emotional immaturity, and his driving inexperience, and that this failure served to explain the imposition of manifestly excessive sentences. 
     
      
    147 The Victorian Court of Appeal has recently considered the relevance of inexperience where a young driver commits an offence of dangerous driving causing death: Director of Public Prosecutions v Neethling [2009] VSCA 116; 52 MVR 422 (“Neethling”). In that case, an 18-year old driver had been licensed for 12 days only at the time of the fatal collision. The Court (Maxwell P, Vincent JA and Hargrave AJA) referred, at [27]-[32], to New South Wales decisions, including R v Jurisic and R v Whyte, concerning assessment of an offender’s degree of moral culpability, and then turned, at [40]-[44], to consider submissions with respect to the driver’s inexperience: 
     
      
       
        
        “[40] As to Mr Neethling’s own culpability, defence counsel on the plea emphasised his inexperience as a mitigating factor. When the judge referred to his deliberate decision to overtake, his counsel agreed that it was deliberate, but said: 
         
         
          
           
            
            Against that, licence for 12 days; clear lack of judgment by someone who is inexperienced, as distinct, for example, from someone who had been driving for a fair length of time and done something like this. 
            
           
          
         
         
         
        [41] In our view, Mr Neethling’s youth and inexperience cannot be said to have reduced his culpability for what occurred. He elected to drive a powerful car at high speed - well over the speed limit - when he had virtually no experience of driving unsupervised. He elected to drive at high speed in conditions which, quite obviously, made driving difficult - and dangerous. It takes little experience to know that poor visibility and wet roads significantly heighten the risk to all road users. Mr Neethling chose to speed even though he had had no experience of driving in such conditions. 
         
         
        [42] Worse still, Mr Neethling embarked on a very dangerous manoeuvre - overtaking at high speed in conditions of poor visibility. By his own admission, he had no idea how the car would respond in such conditions if he accelerated sharply. It was, moreover, an unlawful manoeuvre in that he crossed over double lines. The fact that he did not see the oncoming car until it was almost upon him demonstrates just how poor the visibility was. The fact that he did not see the double lines demonstrates that he simply did not take sufficient care. The photographs tendered to the court show the double lines very clearly. The headlights on Mr Neethling’s vehicle were on, so the double lines would have been clearly visible. As he would have known, having recently completed his licence test, it was his obligation not to overtake unless he had first established that the line markings on the road permitted him to do so. 
         
         
        [43] The newly-licensed driver well knows that he/she is on probation, on trial. Quite obviously, driving unsupervised is fundamentally different from the supervised driving which the learner driver undertakes. For the first time, the new driver must confront unexpected situations, and make quick decisions without assistance. That is an adult responsibility, and it must be discharged accordingly. The new driver must realise that his/her inexperience creates risks for himself/herself, for passengers, and for other road users. 
         
         
        [44] These are all self-evident propositions. We have little doubt that they represents the universal view within our community. And they illustrate, without further explanation, why Mr Neethling’s culpability must be viewed as high. He took a completely unnecessary risk, and in so doing put others unnecessarily at risk. In the language of Spigelman CJ, he ‘abandoned his responsibility’ - to his passengers and to other road users - with catastrophic results.” 
        
       
      
    148 Adapting what Doyle CJ said in R v Peake at 356 [16] (see [130] above), the Court said (at [49]) that, in attempting to overtake when he did, Mr Neethling created “a significant risk of a serious accident”.  
     
      
    149 With respect to Mr Neethling’s youth, the Court said at [53]-[55]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[53] It has long been accepted that, as a general rule, rehabilitation should be a primary - if not the principal - concern in sentencing a young offender. It is equally well-established, however, that this principle has sometimes to give way to other sentencing considerations. It was submitted for the Director that the present was such a case. We respectfully agree. 
         
         
        [54] It was contended for the Director that, in cases such as this, general deterrence was of primary importance: 
         
         
         
          
           
            
            [T]here is widespread community alarm at very serious motor vehicle accidents involving young drivers. It is appropriate that deterrence be used to encourage young drivers not to drive dangerously. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          We accept this submission, which accords with the authorities referred to earlier. As Spigelman CJ said in  
          Whyte 
          , the ‘frequently recurring case’ of dangerous driving causing death is one involving a young offender, of good character and with no or limited prior convictions, and showing genuine remorse. That description fits Mr Neethling perfectly. 
          
         
         
        [55] Unsurprisingly, experience in Victoria mirrors that in New South Wales. It is precisely because of the tendency of young drivers to drive dangerously that general deterrence must be regarded as of great importance, and youth must be given relatively less weight. In the present case, the victims were themselves young people. The importance of general deterrence is to try and prevent the very kind of damage which occurred here.” 
        
       
      
    150 These observations of the Victorian Court of Appeal apply to the present Applicant. His inexperience does not assist him. He had held a learner’s permit for 11 months (and was soon to be tested for a provisional licence). He chose to set out on a journey with three young passengers, and to drive in the manner which he did, after consuming alcohol which impaired his driving to some extent. He elected to drive at very high speed, despite his inexperience. He did not reduce speed in the face of warnings given to him by one or more of his passengers. He took on an adult responsibility and must realise that his inexperience created risks for others and himself. As the Victorian Court of Appeal observed in Neethling at [44], these were “self-evident propositions” which represent the “universal view within our community”. The “tendency of young drivers to drive dangerously” explains why general deterrence is of great importance. Young persons were killed or seriously injured by the Applicant’s driving and “the importance of general deterrence is to try and prevent the very kind of damage that occurred here”.  
     
      
    151 Ms Francis referred in submissions to the Applicant “having little appreciation of his own mortality” (T5.35, 22 June 2009). The Applicant’s counsel in the District Court had submitted that “it is also a fact of life that people at this tender age tend to - their brains tend to not allow them to deal with the responsibility that they sometimes demand so vocally” (T6.10, 5 August 2008). In a similar vein, the sentencing Judge in the Victorian County Court in Neethling at [51] had observed that the offender “like many young men … saw [himself] as ‘bullet proof’.” The fact that young men (in particular) may have such perceptions is a significant reason for general deterrence to be a prominent factor in cases such as these. Inexperience and immaturity, in persons aged 17 years and over, cannot operate as mitigating factors where the offender commits grave driving offences, with fatal consequences, as exemplified by Neethling and this case. 
     
      
    152 The provisions of s.6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 had application to the Applicant. However, he was over 17 years old and his proximity to 18 years was pertinent: R v Voss (at [142] above). The nature of the Applicant’s offences were such that general deterrence was a dominant factor on sentence: IE v R (at [143] above). 
     
      
    153 The question is whether the approach of the sentencing Judge revealed error in the way in which his Honour approached the Applicant’s youth, inexperience and relative immaturity. I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated on the part of the sentencing Judge in this respect. 
     
      
    154 In my view, general deterrence was a very significant factor on sentence in this case. His Honour was conscious of the fact that offences of this type are frequently committed by young persons. It remained, of course, necessary to have proper regard to the role of general deterrence as part of the sentencing mix, together with the objective features of the offences and the subjective features of the Applicant in determining an appropriate sentence.  
     
      
    155 These were very serious examples of this class of offence. The Applicant drove the vehicle, with three passengers aboard, on a residential street at a grossly excessive speed whilst affected to some extent by alcohol. The Applicant’s moral culpability was substantial, as was his degree of abandonment of responsibility as the driver of the vehicle.  
     
      
    156 It was open to the sentencing Judge to find that warnings were given by one or more of the passengers to the Applicant to slow down. He did not do so. He lost control of the vehicle whilst it was travelling at such a very high speed that it left the road and collided with a power pole, severing the vehicle. One passenger died instantly and another died days later in hospital. A third passenger was injured and disabled in profound ways which will affect her for the rest of her life. 
     
      
    157 Although the Applicant was not to be punished for his denial that he drove the vehicle and his late admission of guilt, these factors serve to distinguish his case from the typical case where there is remorse and an early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    158 The Form 1 offence was a most serious one involving grave and long-lasting injuries and disabilities to KL. It was necessary, as the sentencing Judge recognised, for his Honour to increase penalty on the first count to reflect this additional criminality: Attorney General’s Application under s.37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at 159 [42]-[43]. 
     
      
    159 I have considered the Applicant’s submissions made by reference to sentencing statistics and other sentencing decisions. They demonstrate that the total aggregate term imposed upon the Applicant was substantial, although the total effective non-parole period was less so. Caution must be exercised in the use of statistical material: R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at 739. Further, the Applicant was sentenced for two most serious offences with a third serious offence being taken into account on sentence. The Applicant’s late pleas of guilty and late remorse are other factors differentiating this case from typical cases.  
     
      
    160 This case is a stark example of the immense tragedy which can befall young persons and their families when responsibility is abandoned, in circumstances of high moral culpability, by a young person behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle. A court is presented with the challenging task of passing sentence. The guideposts to the appropriate sentence point in different directions, reflecting the tension between relevant sentencing principles: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1987-1988] 164 CLR 465 at 476. However, the objective seriousness of these offences, and the need for general deterrence, are dominant considerations and remain so even where the offender is young and inexperienced.  
     
      
    161 The sentences must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the crimes, and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to the objective circumstances: R v Musumeci (NSWCCA, 30 October 1997, BC9705741, page 5): R v Jurisic at 228; Neethling at 434 [58]. Given that the Applicant was to be sentenced for two offences, the totality principle also had application: R v MMK (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at 486 [11]-[13]. 
     
      
    162 I accept that the sentences imposed upon the Applicant are substantial. However, I am not persuaded that the sentences are manifestly excessive in the required sense, that is, that they are unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    163 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) extend time for the Applicant to seek leave to appeal against sentences imposed at the Newcastle District Court on 22 August 2008; 
       
       
      (b) grant leave to appeal with respect to sentence; 
       
       
      (c) dismiss the appeal against sentence.

    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Hoeben J. 
     
      
    2 HOEBEN J: On 20 June 2008 the applicant was sentenced in respect of the following charge by RA Hulme DCJ. Between 21 December 2005 and 5 January 2006 at Sydney – supplying a prohibited drug, namely 3,4- Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) in an amount not less than a large commercial quantity for that drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (maximum penalty imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years). 
     
      
    3 The applicant pleaded guilty to this offence. His Honour passed the following sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “A term of imprisonment of 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 10 years commencing 26 July 2007 and expiring 25 July 2017 and a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months expiring 25 January 2021”. 
        
       
       
      Factual Background 
       
      
    4 On the evening of 22 December 2005 at Darling Harbour an undercover police operative entered into negotiations with Peng Gao for the supply of 1000 MDMA tablets. During the negotiations, Gao contacted the applicant who told him to go to the Hurstville RSL Club and that he would have “it” soon. The applicant subsequently supplied Gao with 1000 MDMA tablets. Gao in turn supplied the undercover police officer at Darling Harbour with the tablets in return for $15,000. 
     
      
    5 The tablets had a purity of 26.5 percent and weighed 284 grams. 
     
      
    6 Later that evening, Gao contacted the applicant by telephone and informed him that the deal had been done. The applicant said “Good, I’ll meet you now”. They agreed to meet in town in relation to the money due to the applicant. 
     
      
    7 On 4 January 2006 the same undercover police operative entered into negotiations with Gao for the supply of 2000 MDMA tablets. Gao again contacted the applicant. Gao was told by the applicant to go to the Hurstville RSL Club. The applicant then picked him up and took him to his home. Gao emerged a short time later and went to Darling Harbour where he gave 2000 MDMA tablets to the undercover operative in exchange for $30,000. 
     
      
    8 Upon analysis these tablets were found to contain 26 percent MDMA and weighed 568.9 grams. 
     
      
    9 A short time after the transaction, the applicant drove into the city and met with Gao. They were seen to have a meal together. The applicant returned home and was seen to remove a bag from his car before going inside. 
     
      
    10 On 9 February 2006 a search warrant was executed at the applicant’s home. The police found approximately $104,320 in cash, drug paraphernalia, a small amount of methylamphetamine weighing 5.42 grams and a number of mobile telephones. 
     
      
    11 The large commercial quantity for MDMA is 500 grams. The total amount supplied by the offender was 852.9 grams. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was arrested and charged on that date. The applicant was granted bail. He was arraigned on 20 April 2007 and his trial was listed to commence on 19 November 2007. On the first day of the trial, the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence. The applicant was refused bail. 
     
      
    13 Because of the way in which the appeal was argued, it is necessary to review the facts relating to Pen Gao and Benjamin Lim. 
     
      
    14 Gao was subsequently arrested and charged. The supply to the undercover officer on 22 December 2005 gave rise to a charge of supply a commercial quantity of MDMA. The supply to the undercover officer on 4 January 2006 gave rise to a charge of supply large commercial quantity of MDMA. It should be noted that the offence of which the applicant was convicted related to the supply by him to Gao of the MDMA on both 22 December 2005 and 4 January 2006. 
     
      
    15 On 20 January 2006 the undercover police officer again contacted Gao and commenced negotiations with him for the purchase of 10,000 MDMA tablets. Gao advised the police officer that his usual supplier was unavailable and that he would have to source the tablets from another associate. As a result of this negotiation, Gao contacted Lim. 
     
      
    16 On 24 January 2006 Gao contacted the undercover police officer to negotiate the supply of between 8000 and 10,000 tablets on the following day. Gao then contacted Lim and they had discussions about the supply of the tablets. Although Gao attended at Darling Harbour on the following night and was shown $160,000 by the undercover police officer, the supply did not take place. 
     
      
    17 On 26 January 2006 Lim contacted Gao and asked for an explanation for the failure of the transaction on the previous evening. Lim urged Gao to contact the undercover police officer with a view to supplying 5000 tablets. That afternoon the police officer contacted Gao and negotiated the purchase of 5000 tablets for the following day.  
     
      
    18 On 27 January 2006 the police officer contacted Gao and confirmed that the transaction was to go ahead that evening. The police officer cancelled the supply when Gao was unable to produce the tablets that day. It should be noted that when Gao was sentenced in respect of his offences, three matters were included on a Form 1. The three matters were an agreement with the undercover officer to supply a sample of 50 tablets on 20 January 2006, the agreement to supply 10,000 tablets on 24 January 2006 and the agreement to supply 5000 tablets on 27 January 2006. 
     
      
    19 Lim was charged and pleaded guilty to the offence of supply large commercial quantity of MDMA on the basis that he had agreed to supply not less than 500 grams of MDMA (at least 5000 tablets, weighing between 1 kg and 2.5 kg) between 19 and 28 January 2006. On 9 February 2006 police executed search warrants on Lim’s premises and found 3.8 g of MDMA and 7.7g of methylamphetamine. These amounts founded two charges of deemed supply and were dealt with on a Form 1. 
     
      
    20 On 30 May 2006 Gao was committed for sentence, following pleas of guilty to the charges of (charge 1) supply a large commercial quantity of MDMA and (charge 2) supply commercial quantity of MDMA. On 15 December 2006 Gao was sentenced by Berman DCJ to a total term of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years in respect of those offences. His Honour also had regard to the three matters on the Form 1. He received a 25 percent discount for his early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    21 On 14 December 2007 the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal by the Crown against the inadequacy of the sentences imposed upon Gao. The Court found that the sentences were lenient but that they were not “entirely out of the range available”. The Court expressed concern about the inadequacy of the total sentence imposed for the two charges, but dismissed the appeal in the exercise of its discretion. 
     
      
    22 On 29 March 2007 Lim was sentenced by Berman DCJ for one offence of supplying (agreeing to supply) a large commercial quantity of MDMA. Lim pleaded guilty on the day of his trial. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment with a balance of term of 3 years. His Honour took into account the two offences of deemed supply on the Form 1. Ten percent was allowed by way of discount for Lim’s late plea of guilty. 
     
      
    23 The offence for which Lim was sentenced was not the same offence for which Gao was sentenced. That offence appeared on Gao’s Form 1, i.e. the agreement to supply on 27 January 2006. 
     
      
    24 The Crown appealed against the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon Lim. The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the appeal and re-sentenced Lim to a total term of imprisonment for 9 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 6 years. Ten percent was allowed by way of discount for Lim’s late plea of guilty. 
     
      
    25 The Court of Criminal Appeal indicated that this sentence was at the “very bottom of the available range” and noted that a starting point of 14 years would have been justified at first instance. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    26 In relation to subjective features, his Honour noted that the applicant was born on 18 October 1969 so that he was 37 at the time of the offence and 38 at the time of sentence. The applicant had a criminal history comprising convictions for some driving offences and two drug possession offences. His Honour did not regard these as being of particular significance. 
     
      
    27 The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. The evidence comprised the pre-sentence report and the evidence of the applicant’s mother. His Honour’s information concerning the applicant came from his mother. It seems that the applicant had not seen his mother for 10 years but when she learned of his incarceration, she came to Australia to provide comfort and assistance to him. 
     
      
    28 The applicant came to Australia in order to learn English in 1989 when he was 17. The applicant was apparently in regular employment as a chef until about the middle of 2005 when he was sacked for drug use. Prior to going into custody, the applicant was living with his girlfriend. The Probation and Parole officer reported that the applicant presented with “unresolved grief issues pertaining to the death of his father” who had died in 1998. The applicant attributed his use of the drug “ice” to this. Apart from the regular use of drugs, the applicant told the Probation and Parole officer he had a gambling problem and was spending between $100 - $500 per day. 
     
      
    29 The applicant’s mother told the court that since she had come to Australia, she used to visit him twice a week. He told her that he felt shame because of what he had done and he apologised to his family and to the Australian Government. He vowed to her that he would be a law-abiding person in the future. She said that she hoped to be able to remain in Australia and live with her son when he was released from prison. In relation to remorse, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because I have heard no evidence from the offender I do not have sufficient material to make a finding in his favour that he is remorseful. Although as I indicated earlier he has no significant record of previous convictions, he was a user of illegal drugs for some 10 years and so I am unable to find in his favour that he was of prior good character. I am also unable to find that he is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. Whilst he has not offended in relation to supplying drugs in the past, he did so on such a significant scale for motives of financial gain to the extent that I cannot be assured that he is unlikely to do so again.” 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour discounted the applicant’s sentence by 10 percent because of the plea of guilty entered on the first day of trial. 
     
      
    31 The details of the sentences imposed on Gao and Lim were placed before his Honour and his Honour analysed the offences which gave rise to the sentences, and the sentences themselves. His Honour also had regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in those matters (R v Gao; R v Lim [2007] NSWCCA 343). 
     
      
    32 His Honour concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “No direct parity applies given the differences between the cases, particularly Lim where the offences were constituted by an unfulfilled agreement to supply. He was not, strictly speaking, a co-offender. Nevertheless, it has been submitted that I should bear in mind the sentences imposed upon these two men when I sentence the present offender, and I will do so.” 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour assessed the applicant as being at a higher level in the drug supply hierarchy than Gao. His Honour noted that Gao sourced his drugs from the applicant and that the applicant was closer to those involved in the manufacture or importation of the drugs than Gao. Gao had to consult with the applicant before being able to conclude his negotiations with the undercover police operative. 
     
      
    34 His Honour noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had found that it was open to the sentencing judge to find that both of Gao’s offences fell slightly below the mid-range of objective gravity. His Honour was of the opinion, however, that even without that guidance he would have assessed the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending at the middle of the range. 
     
      
    35 Because the applicant’s offence involved an amount of 852 grams, which was the total quantity involved in Gao’s two offences, his Honour considered that it was appropriate for him to take into account for comparison purposes the total effective sentence imposed upon Gao when considering what was an appropriate sentence for the applicant. His Honour noted that he had to keep in mind the differences between the two cases, in particular that there were different discounts for pleas of guilty and that Gao had offences on a Form 1 to be taken into account. 
     
      
    36 Given his finding as to the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offence, his Honour considered whether there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period of 15 years. Even though the applicant had pleaded guilty before trial, his Honour noted that the sentence which he passed must still bear an appropriate relationship to the standard non-parole period which remained relevant as a benchmark. 
     
      
    37 His Honour had regard to the tension between that consideration and the fact that the sentences imposed upon Gao and Lim represented a significant departure from the standard non-parole period. The problem was further complicated by the specific differences in the cases. In that regard his Honour referred specifically to the Form 1 matters and the different discounts for the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    38 In order to make allowance for periods which the applicant had already spent in custody, his Honour backdated the commencement of his sentence to 26 July 2007. In relation to special circumstances his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No submission was made that I should find special circumstances and reduce the proportion of the total sentence that is represented by the non-parole period and in my view, that was a realistic, implicit concession. The sentence I am about to announce provides for a more than adequate period of potential parole supervision for the offender notwithstanding it is his first time in prison. Any subjective feature I can possibly take into account in the offender’s favour has been considered in my assessment of the overall sentence. I must also bear in mind the need to impose a non-parole period that properly reflects the objective gravity of the offence.” 
        
       
       
      Appeal 
       
      
    39 It was agreed between the parties that the observation made by Howie J in Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 was pertinent and that the ground of appeal relating to parity should be considered last. There his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “15 Although the first ground of appeal is based upon what is asserted to be disparity between the sentence imposed upon the applicant with those imposed upon his co-offenders, it is more appropriate to first consider the grounds asserting error on the part of the sentencing judge. This is because this Court need only consider the question of parity if there is no error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. A ground based upon parity assumes that the sentence imposed is otherwise correct. ...” 
        
       
       
      Ground of Appeal 2 – The Sentencing Judge erred in finding that the applicant’s behaviour fell within “the mid range of offending”. 
       
      
    40 The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in characterising the applicant’s behaviour as falling within the mid-range of objective seriousness because that was not how Berman DCJ had characterised the objective seriousness of the offending of either Lim or Gao. The applicant noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had found that the assessment of Berman DCJ in that regard was within a range open to him. The applicant therefore sought to invoke the principle of parity to substantiate the submission. 
     
      
    41 The submission is misconceived. Implicit in the submission is the proposition that parity informs a sentencing judge’s findings as to objective seriousness. That is not the law and is simply incorrect. Principles of parity come into play, if they are relevant, at the time when a sentencing judge is formulating the sentence well after an assessment of objective seriousness has been made. 
     
      
    42 The considerations to be taken into account by a sentencing judge when assessing the objective seriousness of an offence have been referred to on many occasions by this Court and parity has never been a matter which informs that assessment.  
     
      
    43 A useful description of the correct approach is that by Spigelman CJ in Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282: 
     
      
       
        
        “37 Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open ...” 
        
       
      
    44 This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 3 – The Sentencing Judge erred in failing to find that the applicant had demonstrated remorse for his offending. 
       
      
    45 The applicant submitted that the only evidence before his Honour supported a finding of remorse. The applicant submitted that the way in which his Honour had expressed himself suggested that before remorse could be found, an offender had to give evidence. 
     
      
    46 This submission misunderstands what his Honour did. His Honour did not say, nor did he suggest, that before he was prepared to make a finding of remorse, the applicant would have to give evidence. 
     
      
    47 What his Honour did was to summarise the only two pieces of evidence before him, i.e. the evidence of the applicant’s mother and the report from the Probation and Parole Service of what the applicant had said. His Honour, as he was entitled to do, said that he was not satisfied on that evidence that the applicant was genuinely remorseful. Since the applicant had not given evidence in the sentencing proceedings, his Honour was unable to supplement the evidence before him by an assessment of the applicant. 
     
      
    48 The submission misunderstands the onus of proof in such situations. His Honour was not obliged to accept the evidence of the applicant’s mother, nor second hand evidence in the Probation and Parole report. From his Honour’s assessment of the motivation behind the applicant’s offending, one can see why his Honour would need some persuading that the applicant was genuinely remorseful. It was well open to the judge not to be satisfied of the applicant’s remorse on the evidence before him. 
     
      
    49 This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 4 – The Sentencing Judge erred in failing to find “special circumstances” pursuant to s 34 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
       
      
    50 The applicant noted that Berman DCJ had found special circumstances when sentencing Gao on the basis that it was that offender’s first time in custody and because his family lived in another country. When sentencing Lim, Berman DCJ had found special circumstances on account of the accumulation in sentences. The applicant submitted that as a matter of parity, special circumstances should have been found in the applicant’s favour in this case because it was the applicant’s first time in custody. 
     
      
    51 The fallacy in these submissions is adequately illustrated by the following quotation from Howie J in Tatana v R: 
     
      
       
        
        “25 The second ground asserts that the Judge was in error in not finding special circumstances. Again the argument proceeds generally from a consideration of the findings made by Judge Berman and a submission that had his Honour sentenced the applicant he would have found special circumstances. This is irrelevant to this ground of appeal. Acting Judge Boulton was making a finding of fact and he was not bound by any finding made by Judge Berman. There will be many cases where judges might differ as to whether they would make a finding of special circumstances given that the same material was placed before them. It is largely an intuitive determination. As long as the finding was open to the sentencing judge it is not for this Court to interfere.” 
        
       
      
    52 His Honour specifically considered this question. He concluded that he had allowed ample time for supervision by the Probation and Parole Service in the sentence which he imposed. Apart from the fact that this would be the applicant’s first time in custody, there was no other consideration which would lead to a finding of special circumstances. Such a factor does not of itself compel a finding of special circumstances. His Honour’s finding was well open to him and this Court should not interfere. 
     
      
    53 This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 1 – The sentencing process resulted in a miscarriage of justice because the applicant has been left with a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity between his sentence and the sentences imposed on Peng Gao and Benjamin Lim. 
       
      
    54 The applicant submitted that despite his Honour stating that he was giving considerable weight to the imposition of a sentence not disproportionate to those imposed on Gao and to a lesser extent Lim, his Honour did not in fact do so. 
     
      
    55 In order to illustrate that proposition, the applicant submitted that allowing for the 25 percent discount for the plea of guilty, the starting point for Gao’s sentence would have been 14 years and 8 months. In the course of argument, counsel for the applicant accepted that his mathematics were defective and that in fact the correct starting point was 16 years. In the case of Lim, the applicant relied upon the starting point suggested by the Court of Criminal Appeal of 14 years. 
     
      
    56 The applicant then compared his own sentence which must have had a start point of 15 years before the 10 percent discount for his plea of guilty. The applicant submitted that this discrepancy demonstrated the basis for his justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    57 The applicant also relied upon a comparison of the respective non-parole periods before the application of any discount, e.g. Gao – 10 years 7 months; Lim – 9 years 1 month and applicant – 11 years 1 month. 
     
      
    58 The applicant submitted that although he was higher in the drug supply hierarchy than Gao, Gao’s objective offending was far more serious when one took into account the matters on the Form 1. These were particularly serious matters which were directly related to the criminality of Lim. 
     
      
    59 In relation to Lim, the applicant submitted that he was at the same level in the drug supply hierarchy, had been convicted of a similarly serious offence and yet his sentence was significantly less than that of the applicant. 
     
      
    60 As his Honour correctly appreciated, Lim was not a co-offender and there cannot be any justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant due to any disparity between his sentence and the sentence imposed on Lim. While it was open to his Honour to have regard to the sentence passed on Lim, the principles of parity did not require him to do so. 
     
      
    61 The applicability of parity principles in such circumstances was recently examined by Latham J in Meager v R [2009] NSWCCA 215 at [10] – [13]. During the course of that analysis her Honour (with whom Young JA and Johnson J agreed) quoted with approval the observations of Johnson J in R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “65 … Senior Counsel for the Applicant accepts that Mr Chandra and the Applicant were not co-offenders and that the normal parity principle does not strictly apply. However, he contends that there are similarities between the criminal conduct of the two offenders, their related arrests and parallel criminal proceedings in such a way as to attract, by analogy, the parity principle. It is submitted that the Applicant has been left with a sense of grievance which, in all the circumstances, is justifiable. 
        
       
       
        
        66 As the Applicant and Mr Chandra were not co-offenders, the parity principle reflected in  
        Lowe v The Queen  
        (1984) 154 CLR 606 and  
        Jones v The Queen  
        [1993] 67 ALJR 376 has no application.  
        
       
       
        
        67 This Court has held that the parity principle is not to be applied when a ground of appeal invites comparison between sentences imposed upon two offenders, who are not co-offenders, simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. In  
        R v Morgan  
        (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, Hunt CJ at CL (Allen J and Loveday AJ agreeing) said at 371: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
       
        
        70 Similar sentiments have been expressed by this Court when arguments have been advanced on appeal comparing sentences imposed for offences of dishonesty or fraud committed by persons who are not co-offenders:  
        R v Hawker  
        [2001] NSWCCA 148 at paragraphs 17-18;  
        R v Swadling  
        [2004] NSWCCA 421 at paragraphs 29, 54;  
        R v Martin  
        [2005] NSWCCA 190 at paragraph 56. In each of those cases, the Court has emphasised that far greater assistance is derived from references to general sentencing policy.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        71 In  
        R v Singh  
        [2001] NSWCCA 424, an argument was advanced that an unjustified disparity existed between the overall sentence imposed upon the Applicant when compared with others who might be considered to be his co-offenders. It was submitted for the Applicant that he was one of a group of offenders, most of whom had been dealt with by different District Court Judges, in respect of the sale of amphetamines from a particular café in Kings Cross. In the course of rejecting this argument, Howie J (Grove J agreeing) said at paragraph 12: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “The applicant was never charged with any offence in relation to the supply of drugs to, or by, the persons at the café. The applicant was not a co-offender of any person other than the unidentified person or persons who supplied him with the drugs that he on-supplied to the operative. The supply to the undercover officer was only in the most indirect way connected to the criminal conduct emanating from the café and for which other persons were sentenced. As Judge Woods noted, the applicant was not the target of the police operation and, in his Honour’s words, he ‘simply became roped in’. Regardless of what sentences the persons connected with the drug dealing from the café received, the applicant could not have a justifiable sense of grievance about them. The sentences of those persons are no more relevant than would be the sentences imposed upon other associates of the applicant for unrelated drug offences. Although Judge Woods said that he would bear in mind the sentence imposed upon one of the barmen at the café for supplying ecstasy, I cannot understand why he did so.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        72 It was accepted in this case that the Applicant and Mr Chandra were not co-offenders. Whatever may have been the position with the offences contained in the original indictment, it is the case that none of the offences to which the two offenders ultimately pleaded guilty were committed by them as co-offenders. As will be seen, it appears that there was some association between the two offenders and some overlap in their activities. However, I do not consider that this attracts the parity principle to the Applicant’s case. In my view, the correct approach to the present argument involves application of the principles referred to in  
        Morgan 
        ,  
        F 
        ,  
        George 
         and  
        Singh  
        referred to above.” 
        
       
      
    62 The sentence imposed on Lim can therefore be ignored for the purposes of the parity submission. 
     
      
    63 The applicant’s submissions in relation to the sentence imposed on Gao assume that there is a marked difference between the penalty imposed on him and the applicant. I am not so persuaded. Applying the analysis put forward in the applicant’s own argument, the start point for the head sentence imposed on Gao (16 years) when compared with the start point of the head sentence imposed on the applicant (15 years) adequately takes into account the matters which have been put to the Court in submissions. The applicant was in a more senior position in the drug supply hierarchy but Gao’s criminality was more extensive as shown by the matters referred to on the Form 1. 
     
      
    64 In that regard it should be remembered that the statutory scheme involving the use of a Form 1 requires the Court to focus on the “principal offence”. Although the Court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence by giving greater weight to the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences. (Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; [2002] NSWCCA 518.) 
     
      
    65 Allowing for the superior position in the drug supply hierarchy of the applicant, it seems to me that the difference in the starting point for the head sentences adequately reflects the lower position of Gao and the weight to be given to the matters on the Form 1 in his case. 
     
      
    66 It follows that the difference in the starting point for those head sentences is not of such significance as to leave the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    67 A comparison of the non-parole periods in the sentences imposed on the applicant and Gao to substantiate this ground of appeal, is not appropriate. That difference is adequately explained by the refusal of his Honour to find special circumstances in the case of the applicant. There was also a significant difference in the applicant’s subjective case when compared to that of Gao.  
     
      
    68 This ground of appeal has not been made out.

    69 The orders which I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
      (ii) The appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Xiao Feng Wang, was found guilty at trial in the District Court of the following charges: 
     
      
    · Supplying ecstasy in not less than the large commercial quantity, an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years; 
     
      
    · Supplying ecstasy in not less than the trafficable quantity, an offence under s 25(1) of that Act, carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 He had earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of her duty, an offence under s 58 of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment. That offence arose out of the circumstances giving rise to the drug charges.  
     
      
    4 He was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
    · On the first charge in the indictment, supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of ecstasy, imprisonment for 20 years, comprising a non-parole period of 15 years and a balance of term of 5 years, commencing on 12 July 2005; 
     
      
    · On the second charge in the indictment, supplying not less than the trafficable quantity of ecstasy, imprisonment for 3 years, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months and a balance of term of 9 months, also commencing on 12 July 2005; 
     
      
    · On the charge of assaulting a police officer, a fixed term of imprisonment for 1 year, again commencing on 12 July 2005. 
     
      
       
      Accordingly, the sentences for supplying a trafficable quantity of ecstasy and for assaulting a police officer were wholly subsumed within the non-parole period fixed for the major offence. It is the sentence for that offence which is the subject of this application for leave to appeal. 
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    5 The two drug charges relied on the deeming provision in s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The sentencing judge summarised the facts in her remarks as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The evidence which the jury must have accepted in order to find Mr Wang guilty of the two offences on the indictment at the trial was that on 12 July 2005 at around 7pm, at Strathfield Park, Mr Wang was observed to be standing near a telephone box with some other men. A car pulled up to that telephone box. Mr Wang got into the car. The car drove about 100 metres up the road, and stopped at a bus stop. Mr Wang got out of the car holding a bag which was later found to contain almost 5000 Ecstasy pills. They were later analysed and found to be such. A police officer, the police officer in relation to the assault charge, Detective Tse, was across the road from the bus stop. She announced her office and went towards Mr Wang. There was a struggle over the bag which he held. Eventually Mr Wang was able to extricate himself from the bag. He pushed the bag into the chest of Detective Tse which caused her to fall backwards and land on the ground. He then ran away. The assault on Constable Tse, which I take to be the pushing her in the chest with the bag, while it caused her to fall to the ground, is in my view, at the lower end of assaults. … 
        
       
       
        
        As to the second offence on the indictment, Mr Wang, having left the scene of Strathfield Park, was later detected by police to be at a unit at Belfield where he said he was living, although surveillance suggested that he may also have been spending part of his time at other premises. He left those Belfield premises with a bag. He got into a car and was driven a short distance whereupon he was arrested after the vehicle was stopped. In the bag there were some personal belongings including some clothing and a further approximately 80 Ecstasy tablets which had the same appearance and the same Mitsubishi logo and were analysed later to have about the same level of purity as the 5000 or so tablets which were contained in the bag at Strathfield Park. The quantity of those pills were weighed at 50.93 grams and the trafficable quantity is .75 of a gram. In terms of the first charge on the indictment, the large commercial quantity charge, the large commercial quantity specified for the drug [MDMA] is 0.5 of a kilogram and those drugs were weighed at 1464.46 grams. 
        
       
       
      Subjective Case 
       
      
    6 The applicant was 37 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 41. He is a native of China and came to this country in about 1995, when he was in his later twenties. He has a criminal record commencing in 1998, which comprises driving offences, offences of dishonesty and firearm offences, including the unauthorised possession of a firearm and ammunition. They were all summary offences, there are no entries for drug offences and, generally, there is nothing approaching the seriousness of the offence with which this Court is concerned.  
     
      
    7 There is no need to examine his criminal history in any detail. It is sufficient to say that for some of the offences he was sentenced to short terms of imprisonment. In 2001 he went back to China, returning to this country in 2005. Some of those sentences related to offences committed before his departure, but all of them were imposed after he was taken into custody for the present matters. That being so, this period of custody has been his first and about 8 months of it is referable to those short sentences. Nevertheless, her Honour was content to date the sentences which she imposed from the day he was taken into custody. 
     
      
    8 A psychological report before her Honour recorded that he had had a stable upbringing in China, although his family life was disrupted by his mother’s death from cancer when he was 14 years old. In China he completed his secondary education, and in 1991 he attained a tertiary qualification in physical education. The psychologist recorded “a degree of instability in his life“ in his early twenties. He was married but the relationship lasted only 2 years, and he had since had two relatively short term de facto relationships.  
     
      
    9 He began drinking in his late teens, and by the time he came to this country he was addicted to alcohol and was drinking to excess daily. This, no doubt, explains several entries in his criminal record for drink driving offences. Since being in custody, he had sought to address his addiction and had undertaken a course in English in which he was making good progress. Upon psychiatric testing and actuarial analyses, the psychologist assessed him as having a low to moderate risk of recidivism and a reasonably good chance of rehabilitation. It was noted, however, that the prospects of rehabilitation would be enhanced if he could resolve his alcohol abuse and develop a more stable lifestyle, and counselling to that end was recommended.  
     
      
       
      Sentencing judge’s reasons 
       
      
    10 Her Honour observed that the standard non-parole period of 15 years “loomed large” in the proceedings, and a significant part of her reasons was directed to whether that non-parole period was appropriate. Having concluded that it was, it is apparent that her Honour arrived at the sentence of 20 years by the application of the statutory ratio between sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
    11 Her Honour found that the offence fell in the mid range of objective gravity of offences of its kind. The applicant gave no evidence in the sentence proceedings and, confined to the evidence in the trial, her Honour found it very difficult “to distil any information” about his role in the offence. She found no evidence that he was “a mere courier” or that he was acting with others, apart from the evidence of the two men present with him when he got into the car and collected the drugs. She recorded that one of those men had been spoken to by police and allowed to go.  
     
      
    12 Her Honour also found no evidence that the applicant was merely delivering the drugs to another person. She saw the offence the subject of the second count as an attempt by the applicant to “retrieve the balance” of the ecstasy tablets from the premises at Belfield “after his interaction with the police at Strathfield Park …” She found this to suggest that the applicant’s possession of the pills at the park was “not an isolated event”, and that “his role in dealing with the pills involved some independence and substance …” 
     
      
    13 Her Honour also saw the quantity of the tablets, being just under three times the large commercial quantity, as indicative of the applicant’s role. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        … this was not a situation of someone being a street dealer with a small quantity of pills in his pocket ready to provide to persons at dance parties for example. The large quantity of pills suggest that he was at a higher level, rather than at a low level, in a notional hierarchy of persons dealing with those drugs. 
        
       
      
    14 Her Honour noted the applicant’s alcohol addiction but did not find it to be a mitigating factor. She found no “direct causal connection” between that addiction and the offence. By that, she explained, she meant that it did not appear that the offence was committed because of a need to satisfy that addiction. She accepted that his judgment had been affected by alcohol, but she did not see this as reducing the objective seriousness of the offence below the mid range.  
     
      
    15 Her Honour reviewed the subjective material, including the psychologist’s assessment of the applicant’s risk of recidivism and prospects of rehabilitation. She said of that assessment: 
     
      
       
        
        Those prospects of rehabilitation and low to moderate prospects of recidivism are, in my view, not striking such that they would warrant a departure downward from the standard non-parole period. 
        
       
       
      She declined to find special circumstances. She noted the applicant’s need for counselling for his alcohol problem and the fact that this was his first time in custody, but did not think that those circumstances were such that he needed “a longer period of supervision on parole, so as to reduce the non-parole period”. 
       
       
      The application 
       
      
    16 Mr Boulten SC, for the applicant, relied on written submissions prepared earlier by Mr Pickin of counsel, together with his own supplementary written submissions, developed succinctly in oral argument. Similarly, the Crown prosecutor before us relied upon written submissions previously prepared by another prosecutor and supplemented them with his own. The application was presented on two distinct but related bases: that her Honour erred in her approach to the standard non-parole period and that the sentence is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    17 Put shortly, Mr Boulten argued that it was not open to her Honour to have found that the offence fell within the mid range of objective seriousness. In any event, it was argued, a departure from the standard non-parole period was warranted by the applicant’s subjective case and there should have been a finding of special circumstances. Generally, Mr Boulten submitted that her Honour allowed the standard non-parole period to dominate the exercise of her sentencing discretion in a manner inconsistent with the approach to the relevant legislation expounded in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, 60 NSWLR 168. 
     
      
    18 That seminal decision about the approach to the provisions relating to standard non-parole periods in Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act places those provisions within a framework which recognises and retains the broad discretion which has always attended the sentencing exercise. Importantly for present purposes, the court said at [131]: 
     
      
       
        
        What is not appropriate, in our view, is for a sentencing judge to commence the process for every offence (irrespective of its seriousness, and irrespective of whether the offender’s guilt was established after trial or by a plea), at the standard non-parole period, and then to oscillate about it by reference to the aggravating and mitigating factors. The problem with that approach is that the standard non-parole period will tend to dominate the remainder of the exercise, thereby fettering the important discretion which has been preserved by the Act. 
        
       
      
    19 With respect to her Honour, there is some force in Mr Boulten’s argument. In particular, her observation that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and low to moderate prospects of recidivism were not “striking”, so as to warrant a departure from the standard non-parole period, concerns me. Whether there should be such a departure depends upon an assessment of the objective and subjective factors peculiar to each case, and there is no requirement that an offender’s subjective case, or any part of it, should rise above some notional threshold before the standard non-parole period can be ameliorated. However, I find it unnecessary to express a concluded view about this aspect of Mr Boulten’s argument because I am satisfied that it was not open to her Honour to assess the objective gravity of the offence as she did. 
     
      
    20 In so saying, I am mindful of the respect which this Court affords to a sentencing judge’s assessment of that matter: see R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216, 176 A Crim R 1, per James J at [62] ff and the cases there referred to. Nevertheless, her Honour’s function was to determine where the applicant’s offence fell within the range of objective gravity of offences of its kind, that is, the supply of the large commercial quantity of ecstasy. Undoubtedly, that assessment was bedevilled by the paucity of evidence of the applicant’s involvement in the offence.  
     
      
    21 Mr Boulten challenged her Honour’s finding that there was no evidence that the applicant was acting with others. However, for this purpose he relied upon evidence given at the trial which was not before us and which we cannot evaluate. It is true, as Mr Boulten pointed out, that the offence is founded upon the applicant’s possession for a brief time of drugs taken from a car which had been used to convey them to the Strathfield area. Mr Boulten acknowledged that it was open to her Honour to be satisfied that the applicant was more than a mere courier, particularly in the light of his behaviour in returning to the Belfield premises and retrieving the remaining tablets. Nevertheless, there is force in Mr Boulten’s submission that her Honour was left to assess the seriousness of the offence “in somewhat of a factual vacuum”. 
     
      
    22 That said, the principal focus of Mr Boulten’s argument was her Honour’s reference to the quantity of ecstasy involved and her contrast of the applicant’s criminality with that of a street dealer. As I have said, her Honour found that quantity to suggest that he was at a higher level in a “notional hierarchy” of people dealing with drugs of that kind. From those observations it appears that her Honour was assessing the place of the applicant’s criminality in the range of drug dealing generally, rather than confining it to the supply of the large commercial quantity. As Mr Boulten rightly pointed out, any offender in possession of drugs in the large commercial quantity for the purpose of supply must occupy a position in the upper echelon of drug dealing generally, and the criminality of such an offender will inevitably be greater than the type of street dealer to whom her Honour referred. 
     
      
    23 While acknowledging that the assessment of the objective gravity of an offence is a matter about which reasonable minds might differ and that each case must turn on its own facts, it is instructive to examine how this Court made that assessment in a number of cases involving the large commercial quantity of ecstasy to which Mr Boulten referred us. Most of these were Crown appeals.  
     
      
    24 In R v Knight & Biuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283, 176 A Crim R 338, the charge against the respondent, Knight was founded upon her possession of almost 1 kg of ecstasy but the offence was committed against the background of her having been involved in the business of supply of that drug from her home over a period of time. She had controlled a syndicate involving a number of male drug runners, who sold the ecstasy on her behalf and returned the profits to her. Not surprisingly, Howie J in the leading judgment evaluated her criminality as “well above the midrange in seriousness”: [50].  
     
      
    25 Edwards v R [2008] NSWCCA 281 was an unsuccessful appeal against sentence by an offender who had been involved in a business of supplying ecstasy over a period of more than 3 months. The amount supplied was 1.68 kilograms. McClellan CJ at CL held that it would have been open to the sentencing judge to have found the offence to be above the mid-range: [8]. 
     
      
    26 In R v Stankovic [2006] NSWCCA 229, the respondent had been involved as a labourer in the manufacture of 44 kilograms of ecstasy. Grove J assessed the objective seriousness of this offence as “at least in the middle of the range”: [19].  
     
      
    27 In R v Stricke [2007] NSWCCA 179, the respondent had committed two offences involving the large commercial quantity. The first was the sale of 5,000 ecstasy tablets, weighing 1.2 kilograms, to an undercover police officer. The second was the supply of a further 18,000 ecstasy tablets to the same undercover officer, that quantity being part of an agreement to supply some 25,000 tablets. Hislop J, delivering the leading judgment, placed the second offence at at least the mid range, but saw the first offence as “a little below that level”: [21]. 
     
      
    28 In R v Gao & Lim [2007] NSWCCA 343, the respondent, Gao sold 2,000 ecstasy tablets, weighing a little over 568 grams, to an undercover officer, while Lim agreed to supply 5,000 tablets, weighing between 1 kilogram and 2.5 kilograms, to the officer. Latham J characterised Gao’s offence as “slightly below the mid-range of objective gravity”: [25], and Lim’s as “below the mid-range”: [30].  
     
      
    29 R v Thompson [2005] NSWCCA 340, 156 A Crim R 467 was a successful appeal by an offender who had pleaded guilty. Mason P assessed his role as that of a “substantial street dealer operating as a principal involved in ‘wholesale’ and ‘retail’ supply of ecstasy, but as a one-man show”: [42]. Earlier in the judgment, his Honour observed that, if the matter had gone to trial, the offender would have been “a candidate for imposition of the standard non-parole period as the offence may reasonably be characterised as one which lies in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type”: [23]. 
     
      
    30 It will be seen that, unlike the present case, the level of involvement of the offenders in these cases was able to be described with some particularity. Moreover, in most of them the offenders’ criminality was demonstrably more serious than that which could be established against the present applicant. This lends support to the submission, which I accept, that her Honour fell into error in her assessment of the objective gravity of his offence. In my view, it falls somewhat below the mid range. That being so, it is unnecessary to address separately Mr Boulten’s complaints about the weight her Honour gave to the applicant’s subjective case and her declining to find special circumstances.  
     
      
    31 Accordingly, the discretion of this Court to re-sentence the applicant is enlivened. That task is assisted by the stance taken by the Crown in relation to the remaining ground of appeal, that is, that the sentence is manifestly excessive. The Crown prosecutor who drew the original written submissions acknowledged that, in the light of the decision in Thompson (supra), “there may be scope for some intervention by this Court”. Similarly, his colleague who appeared before us acknowledged in oral argument the merit of the ground of manifest excess, saying that “considering all of the material that was before her Honour and consistent with her Honour’s findings, there may be some scope” for intervention. 
     
      
    32 That the Crown’s concession was appropriate is apparent not only from the decisions of this Court to which Mr Boulten referred us, but also from the Judicial Commission’s statistics for sentences for this offence since the introduction of the standard non-parole period. From the figures for all offenders, 36 cases, it emerges that her Honour’s sentence of 20 years imprisonment is the highest recorded. In addition to the cases which I have mentioned, Mr Boulten took us to the Crown appeal in R v Nikolic [2007] NSWCCA 232, the co-offender of Stankovic, and the unsuccessful appeal by the offender in Sukkar v R [2007] NSWCCA 298.  
     
      
    33 All these cases were concerned with sentence after pleas of guilty. In some of them the offenders had also been sentenced for other related offences, and considerations of totality arose. The Crown appeals in Stankovic, Nikolic, Stricke, and Gao & Lim were successful and, of course, in re-sentencing the Court exercised the restraint appropriate in cases of that kind. Knight & Biuvanua can be left out of account, because it involved discretionary constraints in addition to those usually attendant upon a Crown appeal. Of the 3 cases in which offenders appealed against sentence, this Court intervened in Thompson but upheld the sentences at first instance in Sukkar and Edwards. 
     
      
    34 In the light of the Crown’s concession, it is unnecessary to go to the detail of the facts of these cases and the subjective circumstances of the offenders. It is sufficient to say that all of them, including Nikolic and Sukkar, disclose a level of criminality greater than that proved against the applicant.  
     
      
    35 Putting aside Edwards, to which I shall return, sentences in the cases ranged, in round figures, from 10 to 13 years and non-parole periods, again in round figures, from 6 to 9 years. The head sentences were arrived at after discounts for pleas of guilty and, in Stankovic and Sukkar, some assistance to the authorities. Starting points of sentence before the application of those discounts ranged from roughly 11 years to about 19 ½ years. (Sukkar appears to be within that range even though the sentencing judge had not quantified a discount for the offender’s plea and his willingness to assist the authorities: see the leading judgment of Hulme J at [14].) 
     
      
    36 Edwards stands out somewhat from the range disclosed by the other cases. That offender had been dealt with for other drug offences as well as the supply of the large commercial quantity of ecstasy, but the sentence for that major offence, which this Court upheld, was imprisonment for 17 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. He had been allowed a 25% discount for his pleas of guilty, so that the starting point for that offence must have been in the order of 23 years. However, in dismissing the appeal the Court was influenced by the fact that for the other offences, themselves serious, the offender had received fully concurrent sentences, so that the 17 year sentence was seen as an appropriate reflection of the whole of his criminality: see the leading judgment of McClellan CJ at CL at [12], [24] – [26]. In any event, as I have said, this was another case in which the established objective gravity of the major offence was greater than that of the present applicant. 
     
      
    37 Accordingly, I am satisfied that this Court should intervene. In the event of re-sentence, we received an affidavit by the applicant’s solicitor annexing copies of a number of certificates which attest to his continued efforts to further his education while in custody. Having regard to all the circumstances, including the applicant’s subjective case, I consider that the appropriate sentence is imprisonment for 16 years. I would not find special circumstances. The application of the statutory ratio would produce a non-parole period of 12 years. In my view, a minimum term of that length is necessary to reflect the applicant’s criminality, while affording him the opportunity of a period on parole adequate to foster his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    38 In respect of the sentence passed on the first count in the indictment, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and quash the sentence passed in the District Court. In lieu, I would sentence the applicant on that count to a non-parole period of 12 years, commencing on 12 July 2005 and expiring on 11 July 2017, and a balance of term of 4 years, commencing on 12 July 2017 and expiring on 11 July 2021. 
     
      
    39 McCallum J: I agree with Hidden J.

    JUDGMENT1. Travis Williams appeals against the sentences of imprisonment imposed upon him in the Local Court here at Broken Hill on 11 June 2009. On that occasion he was before the court on four charges really arising out of the same incident. One was an assault occasion actual bodily harm; the others are described as intimidate, contravening a prohibition specified in an order; and intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging property. The sentences for those offences varies slightly but the overall effect of them was that he was sentenced to an overall term of fifteen months imprisonment with an eight months non-parole to date from 4 June 2009.2. The facts before the learned magistrate were these, that Melissa Stokes and Travis Williams, the appellant, had previously been in a domestic relationship which had ended six months prior to the offences. There was an enforceable apprehended violence order in place naming the victim as the person in need of protection. The orders were in terms of not assaulting, molesting, harassing, threatening, or otherwise interfering with the protected person, or engaging in conduct that intimidated the protected person, or stalk her.3. Against that set of orders imposed by the court, on 3 June 2004 the victim was with her friends in Woore Street, Wilcannia. There she received a phone call from the accused, which she answered. His evidence yesterday was that he had rung her a number of times and she had not answered. He called her a dog and a whore. Well, in terms of the mandatory orders those offensive terms amounted to harassment and otherwise interfering with her. Could also have amounted to intimidation of her. There were a number of calls, of this nature and she decided not to answer them anymore. They were the ones no doubt that the appellant mentioned or referred to yesterday.4. He attempted to call for a period of two hours, then attended where she was and called her outside. She went to speak with him. He grabbed her by the hair and commenced to drag her back to a residence in Hood Street, Wilcannia; dragging and punching her the whole time he was taking her to Hood Street. Against the orders imposed, this amounted to assaulting, molesting, harassing and intimidating. That distance is said to be 200 metres. They were serious breaches of the order. But he had not finished. 5. At Hood Street he punched her, kicked her and pulled her hair. He threatened her by saying he was going to stab her. He picked up a knife and held it towards her. Then he dragged her outside and stated that he was going to kill - it says, “Then in the car but he couldn’t find the keys to the car”. Pausing yet again, he was assaulting her at that time, molesting her, harassing her, threatening her with death and otherwise interfering and engaging in conduct that intimidated her.6. Outside she fell to the ground. While on the ground she was kicked to the stomach area causing pain, then dragged back into the house and into the kitchen area. Again he picked up the knife and threatened to kill her with it. She was struggling to breathe. He got her a drink of water. She could not consume the water because she was short breathed from being kicked in the stomach. He then turned the tap on, told her to drink from the tap. As she attempted to drink he forced her head against the faucet causing pain to her forehead. Let us just check the orders again and see what that amounts to. That was assaulting, molesting, harassing, threatening, otherwise interfering and engaging in conduct that intimidated. The court had told him not to do those things. He was doing them and doing them continuously.7. He threatened her again with the knife. She held his hands so that he could not stab her. He stepped back, picked up the microwave oven and threw it at her. It missed and smashed onto the cement. At this time police arrived. Looking at that conduct it amounts to assault, it amounts to molestation, an attempted molestation by throwing the gadget at her, harassing her, threatening her and otherwise engaging in conduct that not only intimidated her but probably scared the living daylights out of her. 8. Police found the front door off its hinges. They could hear yelling and screaming. They entered inside. On walking through the house they observed the backdoor to be completely broken in half. They located the appellant and victim in the kitchen and immediately placed him under arrest. He was cautioned. 9. His victim was emotional and asking why he had bashed her. There is a puzzlement. He had not even made it clear why he was engaged in this offensive conduct. From her point of view it was what is called gratuitous, that is, inexplicable. So he had breached the orders of the court and here is a girl, a mature girl I take it, who did not have a clue why it was happening.10. The imprisonment rate for Aborigines in Australia is one in eighty. One Aboriginal person in every eight is in prison. The imprisonment rate of Aboriginals is more than 2,000 per 100,000, making it the highest by far imprisonment rate of any group in the world. It is really a sad event that so many of our young Aboriginal men particularly, and a growing number of women are incarcerated. But when you look at this conduct what other option is there that the court has? 11. The sadness is that in a community [Broken Hill] which has a gaol that houses, I think, some ninety prisoners, most of whom are Aboriginal, there are no courses dealing with anger management and there are no courses dealing with alcohol abuse. The cycle will simply keep repeating.12. Mr Williams gave evidence. I was impressed by his articulation. I was impressed by the fact that he seems to have a sense of enterprise about him, that he was able to organise the Four Way Goats project, or at least be a party to its organisation, and that the concept was such an exciting and a good one. It shows the potential that Aboriginal men have to function in the community, marred in this case by a very serious flaw, that is, his attitude to women. 13. From my experience more and more Aboriginal women are standing up and saying, “We ain’t taking it any more.” And they are the real heroines in this story. It may take some time but I am confident that ultimately domestic violence issues will be addressed by Aboriginal people in the community. 14. In any event, while I understand the social context of this offence, there is very little I can do. The learned magistrate in my view took a rather sympathetic view of the total situation and the overall sentence of fifteen months imprisonment with an eight-month non-parole on my view is about the least he could have given.15. In all the circumstances, difficult as it is that imprisonment, as I see is, is really a source of punishment rather than a source of rehabilitation, punishment is what is called for here. At the end of the day the formal orders I will be making are that the appeal will be dismissed. So I formally make those orders. The appeal is dismissed, the convictions and sentences are confirmed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
      Nature of Proceedings 
       
      The accused is indicted on a charge of murdering Joshua Bui on 19 February 2008 and of murdering Jade Bui on that same date. Pursuant to s 132(1) of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986 the accused elected to be tried by judge alone in relation to those charges. 
       
      
    2 Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty to both charges. 
     
      
    3 The charges arise from the killing by the accused of her two children on 19 February 2008. Joshua was born in March 2003 and was therefore almost five at the time of his death. Jade was born in February 2005 and was almost three. Although the precise cause of their deaths could not be ascertained as a result of the post mortem, the most likely cause in each case was asphyxiation (i.e. suffocation). This was confirmed in histories given by the accused to psychiatrists who examined her. 
     
      
    4 There was little dispute about the facts. By consent the Crown case statement, medical reports from psychiatrists, statements from witnesses and a copy photograph were placed before the Court. 
     
      
    5 The basis for the accused’s plea of not guilty is mental illness under s 38 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. In other words, the accused relies upon mental illness in the McNaughten sense. The accused submits that the appropriate verdict is “not guilty of murder on the grounds of mental illness”. The Crown contends that this is a case to which s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 applies and that the accused is guilty of manslaughter in that at the time of the offences she was suffering substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind. Accordingly, the real issue litigated has been the mental condition of the accused at the time of the killing of her children. 
     
      
    6 Because of the agreement as to the facts, the trial lasted only three days. The oral evidence comprised that of the accused’s husband and relatives and friends of the accused. Three psychiatrists also gave evidence. Dr Allnutt and Dr Wilcox were called by the Crown and Dr Nielssen was called by the accused. The accused did not give evidence. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    7 Except as otherwise indicated, I find that the following facts have been established.  
     
      
    8 The accused was born in June 1978. She met her husband Thuy Bui in 1998 and they married in August of that year. Her parents did not approve of her husband and they had a quiet marriage before a Magistrate. They later had a formal wedding in 2001. At the time that the accused met her husband she was studying at the University of Western Sydney. After the marriage she ceased those studies and commenced fulltime employment. 
     
      
    9 During the first year of their marriage, they lived with her parents and then purchased their own home in Canley Vale. Subsequently, they sold that property and at the time of the death of the children they were living in rented accommodation at Canley Vale. 
     
      
    10 The accused had her first child, Joshua, in March 2003. Her recollection is that this was a normal pregnancy and that she was happy when Joshua was born. Joshua was a difficult baby and required a lot of attention. The accused felt that she received little support from her husband in this regard. 
     
      
    11 Her second child, Jade, was born in 2005. The accused found she could not work during this pregnancy. Once again the accused felt that her husband did not provide much support for her after Jade was born. 
     
      
    12 Thereafter, the accused remained at home looking after both children while her husband went to work. The accused said that she was happy being a mother but at times felt that she was not coping because of the demands of looking after two children and because she was receiving little assistance from her husband. She said that she told her husband about her difficulties, but he stated that she complained too much. 
     
      
    13 By early 2007, the relationship between the accused and her husband had deteriorated. The accused thought that he had lost interest in her. He was staying up late at night watching TV and used to sleep in a separate bed. A little later he started going out on his own at night and would not tell her where he was going. 
     
      
    14 In January/February 2008 the accused noticed that her husband began to go out more frequently. He would come back late and sometimes he did not have dinner. He was more irritable. The accused started to suspect that he was seeing another woman. At times she considered following him but with two small children she was unable to do so. 
     
      
    15 It was at about this time that the accused found it more difficult to cope. She noticed that her husband was not spending much time with the children. He continued to sleep in a different bed. She felt “miserable” with her mood fluctuating along with her energy. She noted that her mood fluctuated depending on her perception of her husband, i.e. when she felt that he was caring for her she noticed her energy levels improved, otherwise they became diminished. She started waking up in the morning feeling a lack of energy. She noticed that her appetite diminished and she lost some weight. There was a change in her sleep patterns and she would be awake at night. She cried more frequently and her motivation fluctuated. She had to force herself to do things. She felt sad and unable to enjoy things. Nevertheless, she was able to look after the children and attend to her housework. 
     
      
    16 The accused returned to work in the second half of 2007. She was working six days a week, eight hours a day, as a nail artist. The children at that stage had been put into childcare. The accused thought that she was coping at work, was able to concentrate adequately and that her interpersonal relationships at work were adequate. Her performance at work was apparently acceptable. 
     
      
    17 On 14 February 2008 the accused observed her husband to come home from work, take a shower and take flowers out of their old car and put them into the new car. Initially she thought the flowers were for her but then he left home with the new car. That night he came home late. She tried to talk to him that night but he would not respond. 
     
      
    18 Shortly thereafter the accused said that she found sea sand in her husband’s shoes and at the front door. She went to check his car and found that there was sand in both the front seats. She concluded that he had gone out with a woman to the beach that night. She did not confront him about this but said that she felt “very sad”. She did not talk to her family about her difficulties with her husband, but evidence from family members confirmed that in the months leading up to the death of the children, the accused was very subdued and quiet. 
     
      
    19 On the weekend before the death of the children, the accused obtained a voice-activated tape recorder from her father and placed it in her husband’s car. When she retrieved the tape recorder from the car, the accused believed she could hear her husband talking and laughing with another woman. This seems to have occurred on the evening of Sunday, 17 February 2008. 
     
      
    20 The accused said that she became upset and confronted her husband, who was lying on his bed. She accused him of being unfaithful to her. She was so upset that she broke some of their wedding photos. Her husband responded by telling her that their relationship was over and that he was going to see her parents and tell them. The accused told him to leave her parents out of it. 
     
      
    21 The other events on that Sunday night are difficult to determine since the accused gave slightly different versions to the psychiatrists who examined her. What is clear, however, is that at some point there was a physical confrontation between the accused and her husband, in the course of which she pushed him and he slapped her with some considerable force. A childcare worker, Ms Boechat, observed a cut on the accused’s cheek the following morning. 
     
      
    22 The accused did not sleep that night. She felt that her husband had abandoned her. She did not know what to do or how to get out of the problem. 
     
      
    23 On Monday, 18 February the accused took Jade to day care and Joshua to school. During the afternoon she contacted her brother-in-law and asked him to help her follow her husband that evening. She wanted to confront the girl and her husband together. Her brother-in-law agreed to help her. On the way home she stopped at the supermarket and bought some rat poison. 
     
      
    24 That evening her husband returned from work at 6pm and took a shower. While he was in the shower, the accused took her children and met with her brother-in-law who was waiting outside. When her husband drove off, they followed. After about ten minutes they lost sight of his vehicle. After unsuccessfully searching for the vehicle for some time, they returned home. 
     
      
    25 Because the accused did not give evidence, the only evidence which the Court has about her state of mind at this time comes from the histories which she gave to psychiatrists who examined her and from three letters which she left. 
     
      
    26 In point of time, the first version of events was given to Dr Nielssen in consultations which he had with the accused on 5 March and 26 June 2008. Dr Nielssen recorded the following in relation to the Monday and Tuesday: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Nguyen said that she was very upset and they slept in separate rooms that night. She said that the next morning she spoke to her husband again and told him that she did not want to end the relationship. She said that he replied that he was sorry for the children but had to leave as he said he did not want her anymore. She said she asked him how long the affair had been going on, to which he replied that she didn’t need to know. She said that when she asked him if he still loved her he did not answer and walked out of the room and left for work. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Nguyen said that her husband was “a very determined man” and after that conversation she was certain that he had made up his mind to leave. She said that after he went to work that day she thought “I don’t want this life” and said that she decided to commit suicide. She said “all I could think was he didn’t want me … I can’t go on without him because I saw a lot of families broken… I didn’t believe it would happen to me”. 
        
       
       
        
        When asked why she had to kill the children as well, she said she did not believe her husband loved the children and that she did not want to leave them behind without her. She confirmed that she made up the mixture found in the blender and said that she gave the children a mixture of the poison and medication to make them sleep. She said “I took their breath … I covered their nose … I told the children a bit of hurt and then over”. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Nguyen denied killing the children as a way of expressing her anger towards her husband and said that she did not believe he loved the children as much as she did. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Nguyen said that she took a combination of drugs in an attempt to commit suicide and said when that did not work she cut her arms and tried to hang herself. She said that she did not remember when her husband came home but understands he found her and called an ambulance. She said that her first memory was in the hospital.” 
        
       
      
    27 Dr Wilcox saw the accused on 23 February 2009. She recorded the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Later that day she decided to try and confront her husband in the presence of the woman she believed he was seeing and asked her brother-in-law to take her in his car so that she could try and follow her husband. She said that she wanted to talk to the lady. She was unsuccessful in her attempt to confront her husband and said that he knew that he was being followed and he got away but she did see him pick up a lady. 
        
       
       
        
        After following her husband she asked her brother-in-law to drop her off at home and when her husband returned she said that she told him that she forgave him and because of the sake of the children she begged him to stay. She said that he told her that he did not love her anymore and he asked her to leave and he said that he was sorry for the children and she again mentioned that he said he did not love her anymore. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Nguyen told me that she decided that night that she was going to die and at the time she believed that her husband did not love the children because he had chosen the other woman. I observed that at this stage in the interview she became quite visibly upset and teary. She said that she had thought of leaving her husband and taking the children but then the children would be without their father. 
        
       
       
        
        She said that when she made up her mind on the Monday night she decided that when she died that she would also have to take her children’s lives because she could not leave her children without a father. Her whole focus was on the fact that he was leaving. She told me that she felt scared that if she left her husband and had to look after the children on her own she would not be able to control her anger and could possibly harm her children and they would suffer and she decided that if she took their life she would stop them from ever having to suffer. She seemed to be unable to comprehend that her children would have still had a father when I pointed out to her that if she had died and had not taken her children with her it would have been the responsibility of her husband as the sole parent to care for the children. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Nguyen said that she divided the rat poison she had purchased the day before into three and mixed it up in a blender with sugar and water and gave Joshua some to drink. He fell asleep and she took some of the poison herself after he fell asleep. She recalled that it tasted terrible and said after she took the poison she lay between her two children and fell asleep. 
        
       
       
        
        Prior to taking the poison she said she wrote three notes; one was to her husband, one was to her mother and the third note was to the Police. She said she took the poison around 9 o’clock in the morning and her husband was not expected home until 6pm in the evening and she believed that she would be dead before he arrived home. 
        
       
       
        
        She said she became concerned that the poison may not work and told me that she covered her daughter Jade while she was lying with a pillow until she suffocated and then placed Jade in her bed. When Joshua woke up she covered his mouth with her hand until he could no longer breathe. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Nguyen said she did not feel anything when asked if she realised she was still alive and her children were deceased. She said she then took a blade from a haircutter and cut both wrists and inside both elbows. 
        
       
       
        
        She denied that her actions were in any way driven by a desire to punish her husband. She again told me that she believed that she could not live without him however she could not explain why she felt she could not live without him. She did not know whether it was because she loved him so much or that she felt that she did not have the coping skills to manage on her own. 
        
       
       
        
        She told me that she would now rather have her children and have no husband but at that time said she could not see that this would be a viable option. 
        
       
       
        
        While waiting for the cuts to have an effect she said she fell asleep and when she woke again and found she was still alive she said she tried to hang herself with some string that she placed over a bar above the door and when this did not work she decided to take whatever pills she could find in the house and this included the pain killer Panadol and some medication that her husband was taking at the time; she was not sure what medication she took.” 
        
       
      
    28 Dr Allnutt saw the accused on 22 and 29 July 2009. He recorded the following history: 
     
      
       
        
        “Returning home she found her husband back in the house; she put her children to bed and she climbed into bed with her husband; she hugged him and apologised, she asked him whether for the sake of the children they could start again, she told him that the children were lonely when he was not around; he said he was sorry for the children but their relationship was over; she felt hopeless, she asked him why he had said to her when they first met that he would love her forever; her husband did not answer; she knew he was crying and she put a tissue box beside him; she asked him if he was in love with the woman he was seeing and how long he had seen her for; he stated there was no need for her to know; he would not engage in conversation with her. 
        
       
       
        
        She sat for a while and then went back to bed with her children; at that time she thought it certain that he was going to leave; she felt helpless, she stated “I tried my best to solve the problem but he just never care”, “I felt that he chose that woman instead of my children”; she was unable to sleep, she was thinking “if he didn’t want me then we have to go”, she began to think about killing herself and the children; she did not want her children to live without a father; she realised that she and her husband would have to separate; she said that she had seen many families break up and it was the children who had suffered; at the time she believed the children were dependent on her; if her husband went with another lady then they would not have a father; she said at the time she would not accept his going to another woman; she could not accept a husband who had betrayed her; at the time she felt that life was worthless in general because the person she trusted had betrayed her; she thought her husband did not want them (she and her children) because when she had asked him whether or not they could stay together for the sake of the children he had said no. 
        
       
       
        
        The next morning she prepared the poison; she put it in a blender, mixed with sugar; she felt that the sugar might make it easier for the children to swallow it; she felt that life was “sad”; she was thinking “get out of this world”; about the children she was thinking “I didn’t want them to suffer, this world was lies and betrayal”, “I couldn’t think anything more”. 
        
       
       
        
        She gave Joshua the poison and told him “it is just a little bit of hurt and we are out of this world, mummy will be there”; Joshua refused to take it, she put him down to sleep. 
        
       
       
        
        Jade woke up and she put a pillow on Jade’s face, she was not sure how long for, all she was thinking was “just die”, “it is too painful to live”; Jade stopped breathing; she stated “I told her I’d be there for her”; she put jade back to bed. 
        
       
       
        
        Joshua woke up, she covered his nose with her hand and he stopped breathing; she told him “just a little bit of hurt and it be over”. 
        
       
       
        
        She put both of them in the bed and took the poison herself and then laid down beside them; she was thinking she was going to die; she waited and nothing happened; she woke up and took a blade and cut her wrists and waited and nothing happened; she cut herself again and nothing happened; she then tried to hang herself, she put a loop of green rope around the “door bar” from the clothes line; she hung herself but the door bar broke; she then looked for something to stab herself with; she was unable to find a pointy knife; she then took all the tablets she could find in the house and laid between the children, nothing happened; she then started vomiting; subsequently following that she closed all the doors and switched off the gas; she went back to lie between her children; she could not recall what happened after that. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        On the day prior to the alleged offence she had thoughts such as “there is no-one for me to lean on”; “the only thing I have is gone” meaning the “love of my husband”; she felt like her life was worthless; while she had thoughts of her children she thought “I can’t take their lives, they are still so innocent”. 
        
       
       
        
        On the day of the alleged offence when her husband said “No” when she requested that they start again; she thought “there is no hope”; she realised they would have to separate; she had in the past had the experience of other families separating with ongoing conflicts between the parents; she said she did not want her children to experience that; she also thought that one day she might “get crazy” and “put anger” on her children and in this sense “they might suffer”; she thought she needed to get out of this world, she thought the only way to do this was to die; she wanted to kill her children because she did not want them to suffer; she thought at the time “life is very cruel”; she thought even though she had tried her best to be a good person and a wife all she got was betrayal and lies; at the time she saw killing herself and the children as a way to escape from “a cruel life”; at the time she believed her children were going to have a “cruel life” because of “what I’ve been experienced”, she said that the minute her husband said “sorry for the children” and he had to get out “it makes me feel pain for the children and their loneliness”; she thought he would abandon the children because of what he had said; a few days prior he had been yelling at the children because he was going to be late which meant to her at the time that the children were not his first priority.” 
        
       
      
    29 On 19 February 2008 the accused’s husband arrived home from work at around 6.15pm. He noticed a trail of blood droplets on the kitchen floor leading into the master bedroom. Inside the master bedroom he saw the accused lying on the bed motionless. Lying on the bed to her right was the child Jade and to her left was the child Joshua. Both children were also motionless. All three were partially covered by a doona.  
     
      
    30 He immediately called 000 and then ran to seek help from a neighbour. While they were waiting for the ambulance the neighbour attempted CPR on the two children and he gave the accused mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The neighbour noted that the two children were very cold, blue around the face, and failed to respond to CPR. 
     
      
    31 Ambulance officers arrived shortly thereafter. They noted that both children showed no signs of life. The ambulance officers then turned their attention to the accused. They noted that she was conscious and breathing, but not responsive. They noted that the accused had lacerations to both wrists and both inner elbows. The accused was taken to Liverpool Hospital. Thereafter the accused has remained in custody under psychiatric supervision in case she tried to commit suicide. She has been diagnosed as suffering from a severe depression. 
     
      
    32 The police were called and a crime scene was established. Numerous items of interests were photographed and taken as exhibits. A photograph tendered at trial (exhibit F) shows a bloodstained towel and some green nylon rope.  
     
      
    33 Three handwritten letters were located in a top drawer of a bedside table by the side of the bed in the master bedroom. One letter was written in English as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “19/2/08 
        
       
       
        
        To whom it may concern 
        
       
       
        
        I Nguyen, Thi Truong. I am going and taking my kids with me. However, all my life is a drama. My husband created it and now he made me miserable. 
        
       
       
        
        If I and my kids are going the only thing I want from his share from being a wife for many years – is every cost of my funeral and my kids. This is my only wish. 
        
       
       
        
        However I want my parents and family in charge of the funeral. 
        
       
       
        
        Thankyou. I only want to go peacefully. 
        
       
       
        
        Thankyou again. 
        
       
       
        
        Thi Truong Nguyen.” 
        
       
      
    34 A second letter written in Vietnamese was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Dad and mum 
        
       
       
        
        This is the result of me not listening to you, I don’t want to die and leave my children lonely in this life but the reality is I do not want to bring them into this life and then have to take their lives away by my own hands, but dear parents I cannot live in this life. If I continue living perhaps until certain days I can not control myself and I have to pour everything to my two children and they are the ones who have to suffer. Please forgive me. Don’t be sad because of me lets treat this as a way to release me and my children. I know mum has suffered a lot. I’m sorry mummy, don’t think this is a big loss because I am a stubborn daughter. Just think this a life path. 
        
       
       
        
        Signed daughter of dad and mum

        Older sister of my younger brother and sister 
        
       
       
        
        Please bury my children and myself close to each other, do not cremate.” 
        
       
      
    35 A third letter, also written in Vietnamese was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Darling 
        
       
       
        
        You have taken me into this life today and you yourself have taken away my life. I only wish to have a lover who truly loves me, think of me and concern about me, understand me a little bit. But eventually it has never been fulfilled. Probably its my destiny, being husband and wife for a number of years [you have been so cruel to me] [you have treated me badly while I have sacrificed all just for you]. Whatever I have done was for you because of that, how frustrated I have been suffered! Probably, I might not control myself one day. This is the result of what is happening today because of your coolness to me. If you didn’t love me why did you live with me. I don’t want to take away my children’s lives and I also don’t want them to live lonely by themselves. Do you know that they have been sad and cried do you know why, because they are not close to their father who used to love them. Life without love (unable to be translated) I have to go away because I don’t want to witness the situation in which my husband betrayed me for living with another person. I take away my own life so I don’t want to witness the situation in which my children live lonely by themselves and the situation which my husband who is in love with another person. I have been given two wonderful children by God. I don’t want to take away their lives because I am the one who have brought them into this life. However what is this life. Living without love, to me life is just only selfishness and betrayal. Let my children and myself leave in peace. This is the last words of a person who in fact is a wife but not a wife. 
        
       
       
        
        Truong.” 
        
       
       
      (The words which have been bracketed represent alternative translations.) 
       
      
    36 In view of the evidence given by the accused’s husband at the trial, I have concluded that in the days leading up to the death of the children, he was seeing another woman. Accordingly, the accused’s suspicions in that regard were well founded and were not delusional. 
     
      
       
      Psychiatric Opinion 
       
      
    37 In his report of 25 July 2008 Dr Nielssen expressed the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “The diagnosis of major depression is made on the basis of Ms Nguyen’s account of the advent of severe depression with suicidal thoughts after her husband told her that he intended to end the marriage, the information in her sister’s statements suggesting that she had been depressed for at least a year prior to her arrest and her presentation during the subsequent interviews when she appeared severely depressed. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Nguyen did not report symptoms of depression prior to the news of her husband’s affairs. However, at the time of the recent interviews she had not recovered from depression to the extent that she was able to recognise that she had been depressed. Moreover, Ms Nguyen is from a particularly stoical cultural background in which depressed mood is often not acknowledged. Her cultural background may also be relevant to the way she responded to the loss of face associated with marital breakdown. 
        
       
       
        
        The history elicited was that she became severely depressed after the confirmation of her husband’s affair and his announcement that he intended to leave her and it is clear that she planned to end her life over at least two days. Her decision to kill her children was based on the belief arising from her state of severe depression that her husband did not love the children and that it would be better for them if they were also dead. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Nguyen did not have a psychotic illness in the sense that she had a delusional belief about the health of the children or about her own safety. However, depression itself is considered to be a psychotic illness because of the abnormal perception of events that accompanies severe depression often to the extent that suicide seems a rational course of action and also that a person’s dependants would also be better off dead. 
        
       
       
        
        Hence I believe that Ms Nguyen has the defence of mental illness open to her as she had a disease of the mind in the form of a severe form of depression of sudden onset, on the background of a longstanding state of depression of lesser severity. The illness gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of her perception that life was not worth living if her husband left her and that he did not love the children, and the belief that committing suicide was a rational course of action. In her severely depressed state she was unable to reason with any sense of composure about the likely consequences of her actions and did not recognise that her actions were morally wrong as in her depressed state she believed that what she was doing was in the best interests of the children. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion Ms Nguyen also has the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind open to her, as she had an underlying condition in the form of a depressive illness that became very severe in response to her belief that her marriage was over. Her severely depressed state affected her perception of events as she interpreted events from the perspective of a person who is severely depressed.” 
        
       
      
    38 In his evidence at trial Dr Nielssen said that the letters left by the accused did not lead him to change his opinion. He said it was not unusual in the case of severe depression for people to feel guilty and that such persons had a greatly amplified sense of having wronged people. The fact that the accused may have realised that her parents would regard what she was doing as wrong did not lead Dr Nielssen to alter his opinion. 
     
      
    39 He said that at the time of the death of the children, the accused was unable to appreciate that her actions were morally wrong because she genuinely believed that what she was doing was in the best interests of the children. Dr Nielssen explained that he had used the word “psychosis” in his report to mean the loss of contact with reality experienced by the accused and to explain her wrong belief that the right thing to do was to commit suicide and take her children with her. 
     
      
    40 Under cross-examination Dr Nielssen was prepared to agree that the depression experienced by the accused following the death of her children may have been different in quality to that which she experienced before but he did not accept that it was more severe. 
     
      
    41 Under cross-examination Dr Nielssen said that in his report he was using the term “psychosis” in its colloquial sense rather than as it is used in the various DSM categories. He was using the term “psychosis” to describe what he regarded as a “false state of awareness” in the accused. 
     
      
    42 Dr Nielssen set out the basis for his conclusion as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “But there is a disease of the mind, a defect of reasoning in the form of a person's perception of events and from that person's perception of events the person believes that their actions are the right thing to do in the circumstances. That is the reason I believe that the insanity defence is available to Miss Nguyen, notwithstanding any splitting hairs over the exact diagnosis.” (T.74.37) 
        
       
      
    43 In her report of 8 March 2009 Dr Wilcox expressed her opinion as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was no evidence that Ms Nguyen’s actions occurred due to the presence of a psychotic condition. She did not report the presence of either delusions or hallucinations. In view of the circumstances and the evidence of a degree of planning I considered whether her actions were driven by a desire to seek revenge on her husband for having an affair. In the note she wrote to her husband she blamed him for her actions by stating that it was a result of his cruelness to her. She told him that she did not want to take her children’s lives but did not want them to be fatherless. 
        
       
       
        
        Although revenge could be a motive and cannot be totally discarded, I believe that it is more probable that her actions occurred due to a combination of shame and despair and that she was suffering from an underlying depressive disorder that affected her judgment and capacity to think rationally. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe Ms Nguyen would have a defence of substantial impairment available because when she took the life of her two young children her capacity to control her actions was substantially impaired by an abnormality of the mind that arose out of an acute exacerbation of her underlying depressive disorder that occurred as a result of discovering that her husband had been having an extramarital affair and planned to leave her. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Nielssen came to the conclusion that Ms Nguyen also had a defence of mental illness open to her. I believe in order to consider the use of the mental illness defence one would have to accept that although Ms Nguyen was not psychotic and therefore had not lost contact with reality her depressive disorder at the time of the alleged offence was so severe that it affected her perception of her situation and her reasoning to such an extent that she believed her life was not worth living and that by taking her children’s lives she was saving them from further suffering. Whether she believed at the time that suicide was a rational act and that it was not an act of revenge and whether she had the capacity to recognise that her actions were morally wrong and were in the best interests of the children is I believe for the jury to decide.” 
        
       
      
    44 In her oral evidence, Dr Wilcox said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. That was something that I had some difficulty coming to terms with. I felt that overall, because she wasn't psychotic, that she did have the capacity to judge the difference between right and wrong.“ (T.7.19) 
        
       
       
      Dr Wilcox considered that the depression experienced by the accused after the death of her children was more severe and of a different quality and nature to that which she had experienced before their deaths. 
       
      
    45 On the issue of whether depression, even severe depression, was a psychosis Dr Wilcox said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. I don't agree with the use of that term psychotic there because, as I said earlier, there is a separate condition called psychotic depression and using that term there I think he is meaning that, like he says, their perception is affected. But the true meaning of the word psychotic is that the person has lost contact with reality, which means whereas people can still know the consequences of their actions, but where their perception is distorted by depression they see things are a lot worse and they see that the consequences are that people would be better off without them, but they still know what they are doing and they still haven't lost that concept of the difference between real and not real, which is what psychotic really means, whether they still have the capacity to understand reality.” (T.9.31) 
        
       
      
    46 Dr Allnutt expressed in his opinion in his letter of 17 August 2009 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Overall the evidence supports the conclusion that at the material time that the alleged offence occurred she was suffering “an underlying condition”, that being, a major depressive disorder; in addition to this, she could be regarded as suffering from a “disease of the mind”; depressive disorder would also be regarded with most psychiatrists in meeting the necessary legal criteria to be regarded as a “disease of the mind” and “underlying condition”. 
        
       
       
        
        Substantial Impairment 
        
       
       
        
        As a consequence of her depression, the Defendant had developed cognitive distortions, that is, because of her depressive perspective, she had an exaggerated and distorted view of her and her children’s circumstances, and catastrophized what their future might be if they were left alone with their father. I did not obtain adequate information to conclude that the distorted thoughts were of a severity that they would be regarded as delusional, that is, I do not believe that she developed a psychotic depression; but nonetheless it would be reasonable to be of the view that as a result of her cognitive distortions she manifested an “abnormality of mind”. 
        
       
       
        
        She believed (realistically) that her husband was intending to leave her and abandon her; she believed in an exaggerated sense that her husband did not have the interests of the children at heart, that if she killed herself her children would be without the support of her husband, that if she remained alive she could cause her children some emotional pain, that killing them would stop that suffering; inherent in this was irrational thinking (for example, needing to kill her children to avoid harming them in some way later) and exaggeration (that her children would suffer badly living with her husband in another relationship). 
        
       
       
        
        It is notable that she made multiple attempts to commit suicide using different methods and persisted with suicidal thoughts for a significant period of time after the alleged offence, which suggests relatively strong intent to commit suicide at the time. It is also notable that she has been consistent in explaining her motive as saving her children from suffering rather than “revenge” or “spite”; while revenge or anger likely formed part of her motive and emotional state at the material time, the evidence supports the view that a sort of “altruism” and despair were the predominant motive and emotions. 
        
       
       
        
        While she might have seen her and her children’s future in exaggerated and negative terms, I believe she maintained reasonable capacity to judge events surrounding the alleged offence; that is she understood that her relationship with her husband was likely over; that there was probably another woman involved; given the circumstances it would not have been unreasonable for her to hold the view that he was disinterested in the children; she understood the effects of poison; how to mix it and the consequences; thus while there would have been some mild impairment in her capacity to judge events, I would not conclude that this impairment was significant. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, killing her children was a considered act and not consistent with a loss of control; in my view, it was a controlled action driven by a desire to effect a particular outcome that she had considered over a period of time and I do not believe she was significantly impaired in her capacity to control her actions. 
        
       
       
        
        However it would be fair to be of the view that as a consequence of her distorted perception of events, believing (in an exaggerated sense) that her children would suffer if she was to kill herself, she was significantly impaired in her capacity to “judge right from wrong” due to her cognitive distortions and emotional distress she was experiencing at the material time; and on this basis she would have available to her a defence of substantial impairment. 
        
       
       
        
        Mental Illness Defence 
        
       
       
        
        Because this case rests on the issue of “wrongfulness” and because she has a “disease of the mind”, she is also eligible for consideration under  
        McNaughten’s 
         (mental illness defence). 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, it is unlikely that the Defendant lost her capacity to understand the nature and quality of her actions; she manifested capacity to understand the potential impact that poison would have on herself and her children; she maintained the temerity to mix the poison with sugar in order to be aware that the taste might deter the children from taking the poison; at the time she understood that the consequences of her children taking the poison was potential death to herself and her children. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence suggests that in the time leading up to the alleged offence she was depressed but functioning reasonably. After the offence by the time she was seen by psychiatrists it appears that her symptoms had worsened and she was manifesting more severe depressive symptoms that were difficult to treat ultimately requiring ECT (electric convulsive therapy). This suggests that her mental state was not as severe in the time preceding the alleged offence as it was after. In my view however it is likely that at the time of the alleged offence she became despairing about her predicament and that of her children and as a consequence while depressed and in a state of despair made the decision to take the lives of her children as well driven by an emotionally laden and distorted view of their predicament. 
        
       
       
        
        While her cognitive distortion (as described above) was an abnormal way of thinking about herself and her children, their environment or their future and resulted in “irrational” beliefs (because she saw things in depressive terms), her cognitive distortions were qualitatively different from delusional beliefs, in that they were based on reality (albeit that the reality was exaggerated), more amenable to reason, in keeping with social norms, based on understandable premises, and she would have maintained capacity for insight. 
        
       
       
        
        The court might conclude that in this case at the material time, an abnormal thinking pattern caused by a cognitive distortion derived from a depression (having regard to her emotional state) is sufficient to conclude a defect of reason rendering her disabled or incapacitated in her ability to reason with a degree of composure, the wrongness of her actions, if she was of the view at the time that this was a better thing and thus right for her children. 
        
       
       
        
        The court might also conclude that being amenable to reason, while she might have held the view that killing herself and her children was what she wanted to do and the right thing to do at that time, she still had capacity to think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people would make that act right or wrong and might not be regarded by the court as being disabled or incapacitated in her ability to reason with a degree of composure the wrongness of her actions. 
        
       
       
        
        The distinction between a) an “abnormality of mind” impairing in capacity to “judge right from wrong” versus b) a “defect of reason” causing a person not “to know the wrongfulness” is a very difficult determination to make, requiring the application of judicial experience and knowledge, or the determination of the jury having regard to the community’s sense on the issue and not easily resolved by the psychiatrist; however if pressed, my marginal preference would be a partial defence of substantial impairment.” 
        
       
      
    47 On the question of whether the accused’s level of depression was greater following the death of her children than before, Dr Allnutt said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. The impression that I gained, the impression that I got was that there was an escalation in her depression after the offence. The, the information she provided to me was that she was functioning despite her depression reasonably before, but if you, and a number of days after the offence when the Justice Health notes begin she was quite depressed, withdrawn, at times found in a foetal position and there was a significant exacerbation in my view. I think there was a difference in the depressed state before than after.” (T.54.27) 
        
       
      
    48 On the nature of her mental illness, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think that going to the mental illness defence in her case, I formulated her as suffering what we would term technically a cognitive distortion, not a delusion. That would be, it's, people who become depressed start perceiving their environment, themselves, their future, themselves in the environment in very negative terms and they have what we term generally depressogenic or depressive thoughts. For example, they might feel negative about themselves and as a consequence they have low self-esteem or they feel hopeless about their future. They see it in negative terms.  
         
         
        Now, when depression becomes extremely severe, people can perceive themselves, their environment and their future in such extremely negative terms that it's delusional and in those cases the individual would be diagnosed with a psychotic depression. 
         
         
        I did not conclude that with her. I thought she had a depression and I thought she saw things in negative terms but not to the extent that it was delusional. But that her thinking was distorted as far as her perception of herself and the environment and children in the environment was concerned and in that sense she had a cognitive distortion, which is a fairly common thinking defect in the sense it occurs in people with depression.  
        
       
       
        
        Now, there is a difference between a cognitive distortion and distorted thought, a cognitively distorted thought and a delusional thought. A cognitively distorted thought is generally based on a sense of one's reality, but the important thing is that it is amenable to reason. People who are depressed you can reason with. They are able to see that their thoughts are, and I use this word in inverted commas, irrational. In other words, they don't accord entirely with reality but they are able to see that they don't accord. So there is not a loss or a total loss of capacity to reason.  
        
       
       
        
        So if one applies the test for McNaughten, and again I must apologise to the court but I'm always afraid that I'm moving into areas that are more legal than psychiatric here. But if the term means, if the words used in the Act are incapacitated or disabled or unable, that is quite, to me it is quite, that goes to severity and unable to reason or incapacitated in reasoning. Unable means to me not amenable to reason. And in that sense I would say that she would not meet the test of McNaughten. 
        
       
       
        
        The other area where I think she would not, in this case, not meet the test is, going back to  
        Porter 
        , is being able to reason. If I could quote, ""To think rationally of reasons which to ordinary people would make the act right or wrong"". 
        
       
       
        
        A person with a cognitive distortion or depression is able to think rationally of ordinary reasons that would make, for her, ""that would make the act right or wrong"". Because they are amenable to reason. Whereas a person with a delusion, it is fixed, unshakeable, inflexible and it is incorrigible. 
         
         
        Now, I always struggle with the issue of where one draws the line and distinguishes between disease of the mind causing the person not to know the wrongfulness of their actions, versus an abnormality of mind due to an underlying condition impacting the person's capacity to judge right from wrong. To me, it is a spectrum. I think Dr Wilcox was getting at where do we draw the line. This is very much a legal issue, a legal test. But as I said in my report if I was pressed to fall on one side or the other I would go for substantial impairment because of those reasons I have just enunciated. 
        
       
       
        
        The other thing in this case is it appears to me that the circumstances that she found herself in after her husband finally rejected her, told her he was going to leave, triggered a strong emotional response, not necessarily, which then I think impacted on her reasoning process, but it wasn't, it was the circumstance rather than the depression. Although we cannot pull those things apart realistically, they were all connected.” (T.56.41 – 58.3) 
        
       
      
    49 When Dr Allnutt was asked to comment on the element of anger in the letter left by the accused for her husband, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        Yes. To me there are two messages in that. The one is, you know, look what you have done, it is because of you I'm doing this. The other one is, I don't want my children to grow up without a father. So there are two messages there. And that's, I think with all cases there is never one emotion, there are always multiple emotions and anger, resentment is underlying this. The question is, which is the strongest.  
         
         
        I considered that but what, what I found, going through the notes was she kept going back to not wanting the children to be left alone without a father. So the theme weighting the written word that was there, the theme of not wanting them to suffer, persisted.  
        
       
       
        
        Whether that persisted because she became depressed, I don't know. But in this case there are two messages, one is a blaming and the other one is the, the …” (T.59.31) 
        
       
      
    50 Under cross-examination the following answer was given by Dr Allnutt: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Irrespective of the test to be applied, did you not come to the view that at the time the accused took the lives of her children she did genuinely believe that what she was doing was in their best interests, based upon her accounts on balance?  
         
        A. In the context that I have espoused in my report on page 17, it is reasonable that she genuinely believed, in the same way a person who is driven by strong emotions genuinely believes they can get out of the car and express road rage or they can be incensed by what somebody has done where they feel justified. That's the sense I am getting at. If the court concludes that she has got a disease of the mind and she has a defect of reason, which I would put on the milder side of the scale, but her emotions affected her thinking processes and that's insanity, that's open to the court. But I would still say that where it fails is that irrespective of that she would have maintained capacity to think rationally of reasons which ordinary people would rate right or wrong. In other words, if you were able to sit her down and reason with her she would have been able to see why what she did didn't make sense.” (T.61.7) 
        
       
      
    51 Later in the cross-examination the following proposition was put to Dr Allnutt: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. It's not the case, is it, that the accused needed to lose all contact with reality before being unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of her actions?  
         
        A. I don't think one has to lose all contact with reality to be unable to, but I think one has to understand what we mean by reality. But I don't think she needs to have lost all contact with reality to be eligible for the mental illness defence. You see that in cases. Again, having said that, a lot of what I am saying is a legal determination and it is my psychiatric view, your Honour, here, but I don't think you need to lose all contact with reality to have a defect of reason so that you are unable to know the wrongfulness of the actions or as it is espoused in  
        Porter 
        .” (T.61.38) 
        
       
      
    52 And finally: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You agree that the consistency of the accounts that have been provided by the accused supports an inference that her predominant motive at the relevant time was altruistic?  
         
        A. Yes. I based that on the persistence of the information that she provided to psychiatrists over the weeks that she was depressed. This was a constant theme consistent with that, yes.” (T.62.8) 
         
        
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    53 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had an intention to kill Joshua Bui and that Joshua Bui died from the results of asphyxiation caused by the accused on 19 February 2008.  
     
      
    54 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that subject to the issues concerning mental responsibility, the culpability of the accused for the crime of murder has been established. 
     
      
    55 Similarly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had an intention to kill Jade Bui and that Jade Bui died as a result of asphyxiation caused by the accused on 19 February 2008 and that subject to the issue of mental responsibility, the culpability of the accused for the crime of murder has been established. 
     
      
    56 I note that, by implication, these matters were expressly conceded by counsel for the accused in his opening. 
     
      
    57 As previously indicated, the real issue before the Court is whether the accused was suffering from mental illness, as that term is understood in  
     
      
      s 38 of the  
      Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, 
       1990 when the attacks occurred or whether as the Crown contends, the accused was suffering from a substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind under s 23A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       at that time. 
       
      
    58 The onus borne by the accused on this issue is stated in The King v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 184 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, when that is proved, and the jury turn from the consideration of the question whether the things which constitute the crime were done to the question whether the man who did them was criminally responsible for his actions or was not, because of unsoundness of mind at the moment, it is necessary for the accused person to make out positively, upon a balance of probability, that he was not criminally responsible, and that he was not of such a mental condition at that time as to be criminally responsible. He has not got to remove all doubt from your minds. He, or rather his counsel has merely to make it appear to you as more probable on the whole that that was the state of his mind at the time he did the things charged, than otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    59 The classic statement of principle is contained in R v McNaughten (1843) 8 ER 718 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “To establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as to not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.” 
        
       
      
    60 There is no suggestion in this case that the accused did not know the nature and quality of the act that she was doing. She was well aware that she was taking the life of her children. Consequently, the issue which requires consideration is the second part of the McNaughten test, i.e. did the accused know that what she was doing was wrong? 
     
      
    61 In The King v Porter that test was postulated in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other head is of quite a different character, namely, that his disease or disorder or disturbance of mind was of such a character that he was unable to appreciate that the act he was doing was wrong. It is supposed that he knew he was killing, knew how he was killing and knew why he was killing, but that he was quite incapable of appreciating the wrongness of the act. … 
        
       
       
        
        We are dealing with one particular thing, the act of killing, the act of killing at a particular time a particular individual. We are not dealing with right or wrong in the abstract. The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. If you think that at the time when he administered the poison to the child he had such a mental disorder or disturbance or derangement that he was incapable of reasoning about the right or wrongness, according to ordinary standards, of the thing which he was doing, not that he reasoned wrongly, or that being a responsible person he had queer or unsound ideas, but that he was quite incapable of taking into account the considerations which go to make right or wrong, then you should find him not guilty upon the ground that he was insane at the time he committed the acts charged.” (p 108-190) 
        
       
      
    62 What that statement of principle makes clear is that the relevant time at which the accused’s state of mind is to be assessed is at the time when the children were killed. That is not to say, however, that her actions before and after cannot be considered to determine her state of mind at the relevant time. Because the accused did not give evidence, the only evidence as to what she was thinking at that time are the letters which she left and her statements to the psychiatrists following her incarceration. 
     
      
    63 The above statements of principle require that at the time of committing the act the accused was labouring under a defect of reason from a disease of the mind. The evidence on that issue is all one-way. The psychiatrists have concluded that at the time when she killed the children, the accused was suffering from a severe depression. The psychiatrists agree that such a condition clearly satisfied the requirement for the defect of reason being due to a disease of the mind. 
     
      
    64 The question before the Court is an unusual one. Usually the issue between the Crown and the defence is that the Crown is pressing for a conviction for murder while the defence is arguing for either a mental illness defence or a defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind. Whereas it is often necessary for a court to decide whether defences of mental illness per se or substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind have been made out, it is comparatively rare for the difference between those two defences to be as closely examined as in this case. 
     
      
    65 Some guidance on that question is provided by the decision of Kirby J in R v Jennings [2005] NSWSC 789. The issue in that case was the opposite to that which confronts the Court here. The Crown was seeking a verdict that the accused was not guilty of murder on the grounds of mental illness whereas the defence was seeking to make out the defence under s 23A Crimes Act, i.e. that the accused was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind. 
     
      
    66 His Honour sought to distinguish between the two defences as follows: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “25 The law, as you would expect, is fundamentally concerned with holding people accountable, that is, responsible, for their actions. It is recognised, however, that a person may not be responsible for what they do by reason of mental illness. However, there are degrees of mental illness. A person may be totally impaired at the time they commit a breach of the law, or their impairment may be less than total, although still substantial. 
        
       
       
        
        26 The defence of mental illness arises where the accused satisfies the Court, as a matter of probability, that, at the time of committing the act, he comes within what is known as the  
        McNaughten 
         rule 
          
        ((1843) 10 Cl and Fin 200 [8ER 718]). The  
        McNaughten 
         rule has two limbs. The accused must demonstrate either that he was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, that he did not know the nature and quality of his act or, alternatively, if he did know, then he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The first limb, in lay terms, requires that the accused did not know what he was doing, whereas the second deals with his appreciation of the morality of what he was doing, that is, whether it was right or wrong.  
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        28 Where, as here, the issue of  
        McNaughten 
         mental illness is raised, whether by the Crown or the accused, or, indeed, by the Judge, the onus rests upon the accused to prove that defence on the balance of probabilities ( 
        R v Ayoub 
         (1984) 2 NSWLR 511 at 515). The Court is then obliged to resolve that issue before addressing the availability of the partial defence of substantial impairment. 
        
       
       
        
        29 Turning, then, to the partial defence, were the Court to find that the impairment suffered by the accused through mental illness was not total, but was nonetheless substantial, the partial defence of substantial impairment by reason of abnormality of mind may then be available. What, then, are the elements of that defence? The accused must prove, again as a matter of probability, the following: 
         
         
        1. That, at the time he stabbed Giuseppe Vitale, his capacity to understand events, or judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or to control himself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition; and 
         
         
        2. That such impairment was so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        30 There will be an abnormality of mind, for the purposes of this defence, where an accused's capacity to understand events or judge whether his actions were right or wrong or control himself, deviates from what may be regarded as normal, given that there is variation in the different ways in which people function. However, the abnormality of mind must arise from an underlying mental or physiological condition. It is not enough if the accused's inability is merely transitory, although it does not have to be a permanent condition.” 
        
       
      
    67 In this case the medical evidence is divided. Dr Nielssen is firmly of the view that the accused has established the defence of mental illness. Dr Wilcox, while accepting that both defences are available to the accused, is of the opinion that the tribunal of fact should make the ultimate decision. Dr Allnutt is of the opinion that the question is difficult but on balance, he is of the opinion that the s 23A defence has been established but not the mental illness defence. 
     
      
    68 While I am mindful of the weight given by the psychiatrists to what they have been told by the accused since the death of her children, it seems to me that the best evidence of her state of mind at the relevant time comes from the letters which she wrote. 
     
      
    69 The letter to her parents indicates to me a keen awareness that other persons, in particular her parents, would not approve of the action which she proposed to take. The letter to her husband, while perpetuating the distorted view that by killing her children she was acting in their best interests, is replete with recriminations directed at her husband and in it she blames him for what she is about to do, i.e. kill the children. 
     
      
    70 The tone and content of those letters, while clearly indicating distorted or unsound ideas concerning what was best for the children, do not indicate that she was “quite incapable of taking into account the considerations which go to make right or wrong”. 
     
      
    71 In reaching that conclusion, I am assisted by the question posed by Dr Wilcox in the last paragraph of the quotation at [43]. In relation to the question posed by Dr Wilcox, I am not satisfied that the accused’s depressive disorder at the time of the killing of her children was so severe that she was incapable of reasoning about right or wrongness, according to ordinary standards of the thing which she was doing. Although she was somewhat equivocal in her written opinion, Dr Wilcox did conclude that the accused had the capacity to judge the difference between right and wrong [44]. 
     
      
    72 The opinion of Dr Allnutt that “A person with a cognitive distortion or depression is able to think rationally of ordinary reasons that would make, for her, “that would make the act right or wrong” because they are amenable to reason” accords with my impression of the accused as disclosed by her letters and what she told the psychiatrists. 
     
      
    73 As Dr Allnutt said “I always struggle with the issue of where one draws the line and distinguishes between disease of the mind causing the person not to know the wrongfulness of their actions, versus an abnormality of the mind due to an underlying condition impacting that person’s capacity to judge right from wrong. To me, it is a spectrum. I think Dr Wilcox was getting at where we draw the line. This is very much a legal issue, a legal test.” I agree with that analysis.  
     
      
    74 The accused has not satisfied me that the level of depression displayed by her after the death of the children represented the severity of the condition at the time she killed them. In that regard I accept the analysis of Drs Wilcox and Allnutt that the depression demonstrated by the accused in its extent and severity after the killing of the children, was greater than before. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to assess the accused’s level of depression at the time she killed the children by reference to what she displayed afterwards.  
     
      
    75 I am also not persuaded, on the balance of probabilities, that by viewing mental illness as a spectrum with degrees of mental illness, the extent of the accused’s mental illness at the time when she killed the children was of such a severity that she was unable to distinguish right from wrong. In that regard, the analysis of Drs Allnutt and Wilcox is to be preferred to that of Dr Nielssen. The letters which the accused left make it clear that, while her view of rightness and wrongness at the time she killed the children was distorted, she was still capable of distinguishing right from wrong and was still capable of being reasoned with and persuaded that her perception of rightness and wrongness was distorted. 
     
      
    76 The accused has not persuaded me, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time she killed her children she had such a mental disorder or diseased intelligence at that moment, that she was disabled from knowing that it was a wrong act to commit in the sense that ordinary reasonable men understand right and wrong.  
     
      
    77 The accused has persuaded me that at the time she killed her children her capacity to judge whether her actions were right or wrong was substantially impaired by an abnormality of the mind arising from an underlying condition and that this impairment was so substantial as to warrant her liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
     
      
    78 It follows that while I have been satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the accused has made out a defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind under s 23A of the Crimes Act, she has not satisfied me that she was suffering from a mental illness as that is understood in s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. 
     
      
       
      Verdict 
       
      
    79 In respect of the death of Joshua Bui on 19 February 2008 I find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    80 In respect of the death of Jade Bui on 19 February 2008 I find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

     Judgment 
      
    1 MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Studdert AJ in the Supreme Court sitting at East Maitland on 4 April 2008. Following a trial upon an indictment charging murder, the applicant was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. In the trial the applicant had sought that verdict on alternative bases which I can briefly refer to as excessive self defence and unlawful and dangerous act. For the purpose of sentence his Honour found that the latter was the basis of conviction for manslaughter to the exclusion of the former. That finding has not been challenged and it accorded with submissions by counsel then appearing for the applicant (who did not appear in the appeal). 
     
      
    3 His Honour assessed a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of five and half years with a balance term of two and half years. The non-parole period was reduced by six weeks to give credit for pre-sentence custody and the resultant sentence was imprisonment for a non-parole period of five years twenty weeks with the balance term of two and half years. 
     
      
    4 The facts found by his Honour were also not disputed. In summary, shortly after midnight on Sunday 12 March 2006 the victim, David Collins, then aged twenty seven years came to a service station to which there was attached a shop, as a passenger in a car which was driven by his sister. It was her purpose in coming there to purchase some cigarettes. The applicant and four friends, two male and two female, came to the service station for the same purpose. One of the male friends was Jai Moore. The applicant and his friends were among many young people who were attending a party being held in a house located near the service station. 
     
      
    5 Some exchange of words took place between Jai Moore and David Collins after which there was a foot chase in which Jai Moore headed in the direction of the house where the party was being held. The applicant and his other friends followed. One Wade Willmot was coming from the house and, according to Jai Moore, he sought his assistance. Willmot tackled David Collins and brought him to the ground and then commenced to kick and stomp on him. In due course Willmot pleaded guilty to the murder of David Collins. 
     
      
    6 While Willmot was holding onto a fence and stomping on the victim’s head, the applicant arrived and, while the victim remained on the ground, he joined Willmot in kicking him. His Honour did not find that the applicant’s actions included specifically stomping on the victim’s head but he found that joining in the attack constituted a crime which was extremely serious. 
     
      
    7 It can be mentioned that one other of the applicant’s friends was also indicted and stood trial but, as his Honour observed, he was acquitted as plainly the prosecution did not prove his participation in the attack. 
     
      
    8 His Honour recapitulated the evidence relating to the cause of death: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence was given at the trial by Dr Nadesan who had supervised at the post mortem examination. He described the extensive injuries that the deceased had suffered. Most of the many injuries were sustained to the face and the head. There were blood stains around the nose and the right side of the face, there were petechiae over the centre of the forehead and around the right eye, there were extensive contusions around the eyes and eyelids and extensive sub-conjunctival haemorrhages around the eyes and eyelids. There were contusions to the nose and the upper lip and Dr Nadesan described the facial injuries as being consistent with being caused by punches, kicks and stomping. There was a fracture of the hyoid bone and, in the doctor’s opinion, there had been substantial force applied to the chin and neck area associated with this fracture. The compression injury in this area was considered by Dr Nadesan to have been causative of death. There were contusions to the trunk, to the back of the left shoulder and to both arms. There was also an abrasion to the right knee. 
        
       
       
        
        On internal examination extensive and generalised contusion in the scalp area was observed as well as extensive leakage of blood all around the head. There was swelling in the brain covering and some subarachnoid haemorrhage. Clotted blood in the nasal cavity was observed and the lungs evidenced aspirated blood. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Nadesan opined that the chief mechanism causing death was mechanical asphyxia but this was aggravated by the effect of aspirated blood.” 
        
       
      
    9 The applicant was nine days short of his eighteenth birthday when the crime was committed. He had no prior convictions. His Honour was specifically alert to the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 being enlivened. The applicant had no history of drug abuse or other misconduct and he had lived in a stable family environment. After leaving school he had engaged in gainful employment and he had enlisted in the army and just completed an induction course when he was arrested and charged. Upon release to bail he obtained new employment and the employer spoke favourably of him and was willing to offer him further employment in the future. A psychological report assessed a high likelihood of response to rehabilitative strategies. To the extent that the applicant had been in custody between verdict and sentence that prediction appeared to being fulfilled. 
     
      
    10 His Honour ordered that the applicant serve his sentence as a juvenile offender until he attained the age of twenty one years.  
     
      
    11 The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal expressing that “his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the rehabilitation of the applicant, resulting in a sentence that was manifestly excessive.” 
     
      
    12 As that expression conveys, it is not contended that his Honour did not give weight to the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects but rather that the weight which he applied was insufficient. 
     
      
    13 In R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85, Spigelman CJ (Hidden J and myself concurring) which was a Crown appeal asserting inadequacy of sentence, the Chief Justice stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The use of terminology such as ‘sufficient weight’ highlights the difficulty for the Crown case. Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge. The circumstances in which matters of ‘weight’ will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined.” 
        
       
      
    14 That observation has been recently reiterated in Jones v R [2009] NSWCCA 169 per Johnson J (Young JA and Latham J concurring).  
     
      
    15 Studdert AJ found that the applicant was genuinely contrite and remorseful. He expressly cited the favourable conclusions of the psychologist, Dr Lennings. He made express reference to the applicant’s progress in custody. 
     
      
    16 In submissions on behalf of the applicant it was accepted that the weight to be given to youth diminishes as maturity is approached, but it was then said that the weight does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence. In support of this latter statement reference was made to R v Hearne [2001] 124 A Crim R 451 where at par 24 it was said in a judgment of the Court (Powell JA, Hulme and Dowd JJ): 
     
      
       
        
        “The second submission is supported by the passage we have quoted and by the fact that in none of the cases is it suggested that the weight to be given to the element of youth varies depending on the seriousness of the offence. ” 
        
       
      
    17 The second submission was earlier identified, (at par 23): 
     
      
       
        
        “Secondly, it was submitted that the youth factor was not to be diminished (merely) because of the seriousness of the crime, reliance being placed on the observations quoted in  
        P 
        , [1991] 53 A Crim R 112 that ‘in sentencing young people …the consideration of general deterrence is not as important as it would be in the case of sentencing an adult and considerations of rehabilitation should always be regarded as very important indeed’.” 
        
       
      
    18 It can first be observed that his Honour did not say that weight did vary according to the seriousness of the offence. Next, what was said in Hearne should not be understood as formulating some constant factor to be applied in every case without need for variation to reflect the nature of the crime and the circumstances of its commission. The flexibility required for the exercise of judicial discretion in sentencing would be unduly hamstrung by an approach such as is implicit in the submission of the applicant: cf Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at par 27. 
     
      
    19 His Honour was clearly alert to take into account the youthful status of this particular offender. Not only did he make the order for service as a juvenile until the age of twenty one, but in his remarks on sentence he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “In sentencing young offenders rehabilitation is generally of primary importance. In a case such as the present where the offender has conducted himself like an adult in committing a crime of violence, the need to protect the community requires that deterrence and retribution be given greater weight than might otherwise have been called for and, of course, in the present case, as previously observed, the offender was almost 18 years of age when he committed this crime: see  
        Lal v R 
         [2007] NSWSC 445 and in particular the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL at [33]; and see also  
        R v Bus 
         (unreported, CCA, 3 November 1995). 
        
       
      
    20 The principal thrust of the written and oral submissions by senior counsel on behalf of the applicant was directed to the contention that conduct of the applicant should not be classified as “adult behaviour”. His Honour referred to this in observing that “in a case such as the present where the offender has conducted himself like an adult in committing a crime of violence, the need to protect the community requires that deterrence and retribution be given greater weight than might otherwise have been called for ….”. This was a statement in conformity with well established authority and his Honour had cited the often quoted passage from R v Bus  Unreported NSWCCA 3 November 1995. 
     
      
    21 There are often indicators tending to classify behaviour such as the use of weapons, the level of violence and the propensity of an offender to repetitive criminality. In this instance there was no suggestion of the use of a weapon by the applicant and he was, as noted, without prior conviction. 
     
      
    22 It was submitted that the behaviour of the applicant should have been assessed by his Honour to have been spontaneous and juvenile. That submission ignored the unchallenged factual findings by the sentencing judge. Significant among these were that the applicant observed that the victim had his hands up “protecting his face” and his explanation for kicking him as he lay on the ground was that he thought the victim was going to “pull out a knife”, an explanation expressly rejected by the judge (Remarks On Sentence (ROS) pars 11 and 24). 
     
      
    23 Further, a witness saw the victim trying to get up and the applicant “kicked him then” (ROS par 17). His Honour expressed his satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant “personally kicked the deceased hard on a number of occasions” (ROS par 28). 
     
      
    24 It is true that his Honour also found that the applicant responded (after the conduct abovementioned) to an exhortation to stop (ROS par 27) but neither did he do anything effective to dissuade Willmot from completing the fatal attack. 
     
      
    25 No error in the finding that the behaviour of the applicant was “like an adult” has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    26 It is not a circumstance pointing to his Honour’s sentence being excessive to observe, as was put, that the applicant did not personally stomp on the victim’s head. His Honour found in his favour that he did not. If he had done so, I apprehend that his culpability would have been elevated somewhat. 
     
      
    27 Reference was made to the statistics of sentences for manslaughter collected by the Judicial Commission. In R v Forbes [2005] 160 A Crim R 1 Spigelman CJ observed that manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence, that a wide range of circumstances may constitute the crime and that matters of fact and degree arise in all categories on manslaughter. This observation was in conformity with long standing authority, for example, in R v Schelberger, unreported NSWCCA 2 June 1988 it was said that little assistance can be gained from considering the sentences passed for the offence (of manslaughter) in other cases where the circumstances can be so different. Importantly it is well established that a starting point for the consideration of an appropriate penalty and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of any offence of manslaughter is the circumstance that it involves the felonious taking of a human life: R v Blacklidge (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995). The removal of “felony” from statutory language does not undermine the stated principle. 
     
      
    28 The ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant is not made out. The sentence lay well within the range of the sound exercise of discretion by the learned sentencing judge. 
     
      
    29 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.30 HOEBEN J: I agree with Grove J.

      Offence and sentence 
       
      On 7 November 2006 the applicant was convicted following a trial before Boulton ADCJ and a jury. The indictment alleged: 
       
       
        
        “Between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2001 at Brisbane in the State of Queensland and Sydney in New South Wales with Michael John Stanbury, Edwin Miller, Zivco Stefanovski and others, conspired together amongst themselves to sell unregistered firearms to persons not authorised by licence or permit to possess the said firearms.” 
        
       
      
    3 The offence of conspiracy to sell firearms without authorisation is a common law offence, the maximum penalty for which is at large. On 21 February 2007 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 8 months. The sentence was to commence on 21 February 2007, with the non-parole period expiring on 22 October 2012 and the balance of term expiring on 22 October 2020. In passing that sentence, his Honour took into account that the applicant had already served 4 months in custody. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    4 The applicant and the two other principal conspirators, Miller and Stanbury, were residents of Queensland. In essence, handguns were purchased in Queensland and sold in New South Wales. 
     
      
    5 The genesis of the conspiracy was the purchase by Miller of a .38 calibre handgun from the applicant in the late 1990’s for $1000. Some time later Miller approached the applicant with a proposal to exploit a loophole in the Queensland legislative framework applying to handguns. 
     
      
    6 It seems that a pistol once deactivated (i.e. rendered permanently inoperable by a registered armourer) was of no further interest to Queensland Police once an armourer’s certificate to that effect was provided to them. For the conspiracy to work, a compliant armourer was required. 
     
      
    7 Miller recruited Stanbury, who was an armourer in financial need. Stanbury agreed to provide false deactivation certificates for $150 per pistol, subject to a further condition that the pistols had their serial numbers removed and were not sold in Queensland. The applicant and Miller agreed to those conditions. 
     
      
    8 In February 2000, pursuant to the conspiracy, the applicant purchased register books of certificates of acquisition and disposal of firearms. The applicant provided money to Miller to purchase a milling machine, which would be used to remove the serial numbers. The three conspirators used to meet at approximately fortnightly intervals, either at Miller’s residence or at that of the applicant. 
     
      
    9 The applicant and Stanbury completed the paperwork while Miller dismantled the guns one at a time and milled off the serial numbers. Sometimes the applicant shared that task with Miller. Miller devised ways of transporting the weapons to New South Wales and their storage there. 
     
      
    10 At an early stage in the conspiracy, the applicant accompanied Miller to Sydney with a number of weapons contained in an esky when negotiations were occurring with potential buyers. Miller and the applicant slept overnight at the applicant’s sister’s residence at Pyrmont. Some or all of the weapons were stored at that location. 
     
      
    11 The conspiracy proved to be financially lucrative. Stanbury was paid his $150 per weapon while the applicant and Miller shared the profits equally. These profits were considerable since some of the weapons sold for thousands of dollars each. 
     
      
    12 Stanbury carried out a genuine deactivation of three handguns. Each of the conspirators retained one of these deactivated pistols as an example that could be shown on inquiry in order to allay any suspicions which might be held by the authorities. 
     
      
    13 In implementing the conspiracy, the applicant purchased large quantities of pistols as part of his business through his dealer’s licence. He also attended gun shows. 
     
      
    14 Miller would visit gun shops in Brisbane and identify pistols which the applicant would later collect and pay for. There was evidence before the Court of 190 pistols being purchased from a Brisbane gun dealer between 20 April 2000 and 4 December 2000, 20 pistols purchased from another gun dealer between 11 March 2000 and 3 April 2001 and 182 pistols purchased from another gun dealer between 12 January 2000 and 3 October 2000. There were other purchases outside this timeframe but fewer in number. 
     
      
    15 At the applicant’s trial, the Crown tendered Exhibit NN, which comprised a list of handguns with serial numbers, make, calibre, including the details of the disposal notice, Stanbury’s acquisition notice and the deactivation number. Exhibit NN contained the details of 746 handguns. It is clear from that exhibit and his Honour so found, that more than 740 handguns were disposed of during the course of the conspiracy. 
     
      
    16 One of the advantages of the modus operandi used by the conspirators was that purchasers of pistols could, in advance, nominate a particular type of weapon to Miller. He would then find it in a gun shop and the applicant would later purchase it. The costs of such purchases were considerable and the applicant initially funded the conspiracy by putting up the money for such purchases. At one point Miller owed the applicant approximately $44,000 which had been spent on weapon purchases. 
     
      
    17 At the trial evidence was given against the applicant by Miller who had agreed to co-operate with the Crown and by the applicant’s former de facto partner. In addition, the Crown relied upon telephone intercepts and police surveillance. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    18 His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offence. He noted that evidence had been given that one of the pistols sold by the applicant had been used in an armed hold up at Chatswood in September 2003 and had been discharged by one of the offenders. His Honour found that the applicant well knew that these pistols were going to the criminal element since legitimate purchasers of pistols would do so from a gun shop for a significantly lower cost than that which was being charged by the applicant and his co-conspirators. 
     
      
    19 His Honour remarked that as a result of the sale of these weapons by the applicant, members of the public would be at risk for the next 30 years. In that context his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That must have been obvious to you all along. The behaviour was of course premeditated and carried into effect in organised fashion. There was this connection that I have mentioned with the criminal element in society. You were not impecunious. Your actions would seem to have been motivated by greed in complete disregard for the safety of the public. It would be hard to exaggerate the serious nature of your offence”. (ROS 8-9) 
        
       
      
    20 In relation to the applicant’s criminal history, his Honour noted that while the applicant had some prior convictions, they did not relate to serious matters. His Honour concluded that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour took into account that the applicant had been born on 19 April 1945 and was almost 62. His Honour accepted that the applicant was remorseful but commented that this was of relatively recent origin. 
     
      
    21 His Honour took into account the principle of parity. He placed the applicant’s position within the conspiracy at the same level as Miller. His Honour reached this conclusion because the applicant was a vital member of the conspiracy, that he had the “all important dealer’s licence”, was able to acquire the pistols and had the ability to issue false disposal certificates to Stanbury. His Honour took into account that the applicant had invented false sale records of supposedly deactivated weapons to cover their disappearance. His Honour also took into account that the applicant had provided the purchasing power for the acquisition of the weapons. 
     
      
    22 Although placing the applicant at the same level in the conspiracy as Miller, his Honour noted that Miller was sentenced on quite a different basis to the applicant. Because of his early plea of guilty and co-operation with the authorities, Miller received a 65 percent reduction in his sentence. It was also apparent that his Honour had substantially more information before him than did the judge who sentenced Miller. That judge was not fully aware of the part played by Miller in the conspiracy, nor was he aware of the number of weapons which had been placed into circulation as a result of the conspiracy.  
     
      
    23 His Honour noted that the charges, in respect of which Miller had been sentenced, were different. Miller had pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to sell firearms between 20 November and 8 December 2000, 29 October and 24 November 2000 and 29 January and 6 February 2001, such sales being to one individual. His Honour concluded that Miller had been sentenced on a different factual basis to that which was before him. The sentence imposed on Miller was imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. 
     
      
    24 When comparing Miller’s subjective case with that of the applicant, his Honour concluded that the applicant had a much stronger subjective case. The applicant had a history of heart problems, which would be exacerbated by his period in custody. The applicant’s family were in Queensland whereas his incarceration would be in New South Wales. There was evidence from a psychologist that the applicant was suffering severe depression. Finally, there was the applicant’s age with the unlikelihood of him re-offending and good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    25 As a result of those subjective matters and the fact that this was the applicant’s first period of imprisonment, his Honour found special circumstances. 
     
      
    26 Despite the differences between the applicant’s situation and that of Miller, his Honour concluded that it was appropriate to impose the same kind of sentence, i.e. a head sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 6 years, before adjustments were made for the applicant’s time in custody. 
     
      
       
      Appeal 
       
      
    27 Senior counsel for the applicant candidly disclosed to the Court that his purpose in raising these grounds of appeal was to persuade the Court that error had occurred in the sentencing process so that it was open to this Court to consider post sentence conduct on the part of the applicant. Senior counsel for the applicant said that if that point were reached, he would seek to persuade the Court that a significant discount should be applied to any re-sentencing by this Court because of that post sentence conduct of the applicant. He relied upon Douar v The Queen (2005) 159 A Crim R 154 as authority for that proposition. 
     
      
    28 For the reasons which follow, I am not satisfied that error has been established in the sentencing process and consequently that issue does not arise. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 1 – The learned sentencing judge erred by having additional regard to certain aggravating features namely (1) that the offence was committed without regard for public safety and (2) that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
       
      
    29 In relation to the first of those matters, the applicant relied upon what his Honour said in the passage quoted in [19] hereof and where later his Honour said “I have already referred to some of the other aggravating matters in that subsection which are in sub-paragraphs (i), (m), (n)”. His Honour was there referring to s 21A(2)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which nominates as an aggravating factor “the offence was committed without regard for public safety”. 
     
      
    30 The applicant submitted that the absence of regard for public safety was inherent in the offence itself and could not be legitimately taken into account as an additional aggravating factor. By doing so the sentencing judge had fallen into error by double counting that factor. Specifically, the applicant relied upon the prohibition in s 21A(2) that “the Court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” 
     
      
    31 That primary submission was expanded as follows. The applicant relied upon what Howie J said in Ward v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 545: 
     
      
       
        
        “29 In the present case it appears that the sentencing judge simply referred to the factor of aggravation contained in s 21A(2) almost automatically without any real consideration of what it meant or how it applied in the particular case before him. In some cases it will be unnecessary to explain why a particular aggravating feature is found to be present, but in cases where the aggravating factor is an element of the offence or may be thought to be an inherent characteristic of offences of the kind for which sentence is being passed the judge should explain why the factor is present in the particular case before the court.” 
        
       
      
    32 Reliance was also placed on what Basten JA said in Elyard v Regina  [2006] NSWCCA 43: 
     
      
       
        
        “11 Because, as noted above, elements of an offence are not irrelevant considerations in identifying an appropriate sentence, it will often be important for sentencing judges to identify with some clarity the way in which they have regard to particular factors. Use of the expression “aggravating factors”, without qualification, is likely to suggest that the matter has been relied upon as falling within the positive mandate of s 21A(2). …”. 
        
       
      
    33 It was submitted that his Honour had fallen into the error so described by merely referring to “a disregard for public safety” as an aggravating factor without further explanation. 
     
      
    34 The applicant also relied upon his Honour’s reference to the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(m), i.e. that the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts. The applicant submitted that his Honour could not properly take into account the number of pistols placed into circulation by the applicant’s conduct as involving a disregard for public safety when he had already taken that matter into account as an aggravating feature when referring to multiple victims or multiple criminal acts. To do so would once again involve double counting. 
     
      
    35 The answer to this submission is set out succinctly in the judgment of Simpson J in Regina v Yildiz (2006) 160 A Crim R 218: 
     
      
       
        
        “37 … By s 21A(2), the fact that an offence is part of a planned or organised criminal activity is a matter that a sentencing court is obliged to take into account as an aggravating feature. But, by the suffix to that subsection, the court is expressly enjoined against taking into account any aggravating feature if it is an element of the offence charged. That injunction has been extended to circumstances that are “an inherent characteristic” of the offence charged (see, for example,  
        Elyard v The Queen 
          
        [2006] NSWCCA 43; per Howie J). An example is the disregard for public safety implicit in dangerous driving offences. But this principle does not mean that the degree to which the “inherent characteristic” exists in relation to a particular offence may not, where it exceeds the norm, be taken into account as an aggravating factor. …” 
        
       
      
    36 Contrary to the applicant’s submission, his Honour did explain why it was that he considered disregard of public safety to be an aggravating factor. In the lead up to the passage quoted at [19] hereof his Honour made the point that weapons such as pistols, once placed in circulation, can continue to constitute a risk to police officers and members of the public for many years into the future. Such a risk was obvious. No further explanation was required of his Honour in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    37 In relation to the overlap between s 21A(2)(i) and (m), one only has to add to the consideration identified by his Honour, i.e. the longevity of the risk, the fact that in excess of 740 weapons were placed into circulation as a result of the applicant’s participation in the conspiracy. Those factors, i.e. the longevity of the risk and the number of weapons placed into circulation, overwhelmingly establish that the risk to the public brought about by this offence “exceeds the norm”. 
     
      
    38 This part of the first ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
    39 The applicant submitted that the concept of “agreement” was at the core of the offence of conspiracy. He submitted that inherent in the offence were notions of planning and organization. The applicant submitted that it was artificial, in the context of conspiracy offences, to take into account as an aggravating factor s 21A(2)(n) that “the offence was part of a planned or organized criminal activity”. The applicant submitted that having additional regard to the planning and organization of the conspiracy as an aggravating feature, involved the error of double counting in that these features were inherent characteristics of the offence.  
     
      
    40 This submission is also answered by the analysis of Simpson J in Yildiz. The evidence before his Honour went far beyond establishing that the offence was part of a planned or organized criminal activity. The scale and extent of the conspiracy greatly exceeded what one would regard as the normal level of planning associated with a criminal activity. The offence involved the acquisition of specific weapons, their modification, the preparation of false documents, the storage and transportation of weapons interstate, the identification of appropriate purchasers and the ultimate sale of specified weapons to these purchasers. Apart from the sophistication of these procedures, the sheer scale of the enterprise took it beyond the norm. 
     
      
    41 This part of the first ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 2 – The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    42 The applicant’s complaint seems to relate entirely to the head sentence of 14 years. The applicant submitted that in passing that sentence, his Honour had purported to base it upon the sentence imposed on the co-offender Miller. He submitted that in doing so, his Honour had erred because he had misunderstood how the sentence imposed on Miller had been calculated. Miller had in fact been sentenced for three offences and it was only when one accumulated the three sentences that a head sentence of 14 years was achieved. 
     
      
    43 I am not persuaded that his Honour did misunderstand the way in which Miller had been sentenced. On the contrary, his Honour was well aware that the period covered by the offence of which the applicant had been convicted was significantly longer than that covered by the offences of which Miller had been convicted but encompassed all of them. It was well open to his Honour to take into account the effect of the accumulation of Miller’s sentences when fixing the head sentence for the applicant in this case. As his Honour pointed out such an approach favoured the applicant in that his Honour had before him much more information as to the seriousness of the offending than was before the judge who sentenced Miller. 
     
      
    44 It is significant that no submission has been made on behalf of the applicant which challenges his Honour’s observation that it was “hard to exaggerate the seriousness of the offence”. There is nothing which was submitted to establish that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”. The sentencing judge correctly identified the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offence and appropriately took into account sentencing principles, in particular, general deterrence. 
     
      
    45 In the circumstances of this case there was nothing put to the Court which would in any way qualify the observation made by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348: 
     
      
       
        
        “66 Where it appears that there are elements within the community who refuse to accept that firearms offences must be regarded as serious, the objectives of general and personal deterrence are entitled to substantial weight in sentencing for such offences. The availability of such weapons poses a major threat to the community…. The community has determined that trade in such weapons on any other than a strictly regulated basis is to be regarded as a serious offence. That must be reflected in the sentence imposed.” 
        
       
      
    46 This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
    47 The orders which I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (ii) The appeal is dismissed. 
       
      
    48 RA HULME J: I agree with Hoeben J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was indicted on a charge of murder. Following a jury trial he was acquitted of murder and convicted of the alternative charge of manslaughter. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 8 years imprisonment with a balance of term of a further 5 years. 
     
      
    2 He appeals against his conviction. He originally advanced three grounds of appeal but before this Court advanced only two grounds which were as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Opinion evidence was wrongly admitted into evidence 
       
       
      2. Alternatively, the jury should have been discharged after the opinion evidence was admitted into evidence. 
       
       
      Relevant facts 
       
      
    3 The relevant facts are not complicated. 
     
      
    4 The appellant was living in a two storey apartment building in Dulwich Hill. His apartment was on the upper floor. He lived there alone, although his girlfriend, who had her own residence, spent a considerable amount of time there with him. 
     
      
    5 On the evening of 27 August 2004 his girlfriend was waiting for him at the apartment. He arrived home late, considerably inebriated and an argument developed between them. The appellant became aggressive and his girlfriend ran out of the apartment and went home. The appellant then left the apartment and went to a nearby hotel where he joined the deceased who had been there drinking since about 3.30 pm that afternoon. They were both regular patrons at the hotel and knew each other as drinking companions. 
     
      
    6 After a time the appellant and the deceased decided to go back to the appellant’s apartment and smoke marijuana. They left the hotel at about 9.05 pm. However, the appellant did not have a key to his apartment as he had left in great haste after the argument with his girlfriend. He called out to another resident of the building. He then, with the deceased, went up the stairs towards the appellant’s apartment. However, they were never going to be able to enter because the appellant did not have his key. 
     
      
    7 A neighbour who lived in a downstairs unit, LB, who was then 15 years of age, heard the sounds of a disagreement between the appellant and another person who, as it happens, was the deceased. It is apparent that blows were exchanged between them. LB said that she heard banging noises upstairs and later heard a louder noise which seemed to travel down the stairs to her unit door. She then heard banging noises outside her unit. 
     
      
    8 After an interval LB said she heard the appellant’s voice, which she was familiar with, swearing and shouting. She went to the front door of her unit where she heard bangs on the door. The door shook and she heard male voices yelling and swearing. After each bang against the door she heard the sound of a man moaning. She said this went on for 5 to 10 minutes and there was then silence. She opened the door to find the deceased slumped with his head at the bottom left hand corner of the door. He was bleeding from the mouth. She then observed the appellant from her balcony stumbling in the street. 
     
      
    9 At 9.21 pm LB telephoned triple O. She then heard the appellant outside her door saying words to the effect of “Are you alright buddy” and “I didn’t mean to”. The appellant then knocked on the door of another resident and asked her to call an ambulance. Police and ambulance officers arrived and administered first aid. The deceased was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
     
      
    10 A forensic pathologist, Dr Botterill, concluded that the cause of death was the breaking of the deceased’s C2 vertebra and the consequent bruising and other damage to his spinal cord which caused the deceased to stop breathing. The deceased also had a broken nose and other bruises of a relatively minor nature, some of which were consistent with a fight or a fall. He had a very high blood alcohol reading of 0.28 grams per millilitre. Professor Hilton, who was called to give evidence by the appellant agreed with Dr Botterill that the most likely cause of death was the damage to the spinal cord which caused the deceased to stop breathing. 
     
      
    11 At the time the appellant was highly intoxicated. His blood alcohol level was not measured but he was observed by police to be affected by alcohol, irrational and very emotional. He smelled strongly of alcohol and at 2.30 am was assessed by the police as still too intoxicated to be interviewed. He was not interviewed until 6.00 am. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s evidence 
       
      
    12 The appellant gave evidence. He said that when he and the deceased returned to his apartment he knocked on the door and called out to his girlfriend to let them in. He said that the deceased became very agitated and told him to “fucking hurry up”. He said he felt a blow to the back of his head, turned around and the deceased struck him in the mouth. They then swapped punches. He said he struck the deceased three times around the face and head, and told him to “fuck off”. He said the deceased started to go towards the stairs and he then heard a slipping noise after which everything went quiet. He said that he went down the stairs himself and saw the deceased lying outside apartment 3. He said that he panicked and started to pound on the door of that apartment. At the same time he was calling out “fuck, fuck”. He said the deceased was lying on the ground moaning. 
     
      
       
      The issue in the appeal 
       
      
    13 The resolution of this appeal turns upon the admissibility of a portion of LB’s evidence. It was not objected to and counsel for the appellant cross-examined LB in relation to it. When that cross-examination failed to elicit a response favourable to the appellant counsel applied to the trial judge for the jury to be discharged. That application was refused and the trial judge said that she would deal with the matter in her directions to the jury. It will be necessary to examine those directions. However, in order to understand the significance of LB’s evidence it is necessary to appreciate the course of the trial. 
     
      
       
      The opening of the Crown case 
       
      
    14 When opening the Crown case the Crown Prosecutor gave the jury an outline of the relevant facts. He said in relation to LB that she would give evidence that she 
     
      
       
        
        “saw the door shaking and heard repeated loud thumps at the unit she resided in at Dulwich Hill with her grandmother. She had been sitting at her computer emailing some friends and she heard noises and went to the door and she saw a shaking and she heard, as I say, repeated loud bangs and thumps upon the door between about 3 and 5 different times, and after each loud thump she heard a man groaning. While this was going on, [LB], I anticipate, will tell you that she heard another man’s voice, the voice of the accused, swearing and saying the word “fuck”, “fuck”, repeatedly. She knew the accused because he lived upstairs in the same block of units and she recognised his voice.”  
        
       
      
    15 The Crown Prosecutor said that after things had gone quiet LB, together with her grandmother, opened the door and found the deceased. 
     
      
       
      LB’s statement 
       
      
    16 LB made a statement to the police which had been provided to the appellant’s counsel. In that statement she gave an account of the events which was consistent with her evidence. However, she also said in the statement that “someone was being pushed against the door.” 
     
      
    17 Although LB’s statement was provided to counsel before the trial no issue was raised as to the admissibility of that portion of it. 
     
      
       
      LB’s evidence at the trial 
       
      
    18 In her evidence in chief LB was invited to describe in detail what she observed to happen to the door of her apartment and the sounds she heard at the relevant time. She confirmed her statement. The following exchange occurred. The portions which it was submitted should not have been admitted into evidence have been underlined: 
     
      
       
        
        “A: Well, the door shook for quite a while after it was – it seemed like someone was being pushed against the door because I heard two voices. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You heard two voices? 
         
        A: Yes, one was Shane’s voice and another was another man’s voice. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What were the voices saying when you heard them outside the door? 
         
        A: The voice  
        that was being pushed against the door 
        , I could hear more closely and it was moaning, like -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Moaning? 
         
        A: Moaning, like really soft moans. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Can you explain the sequence of sounds that you heard please, the sounds that you heard while you were standing at the door as best as you can recall, the sequence of sounds that you heard, the order and what you heard? 
         
        A: As the door was shaking I heard feet shuffling. After that I heard Shane’s – Shane screaming, and then I heard a soft moan as something was being pushed really loudly against the door four to five times. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When you heard the moan, how many times did you hear that? 
         
        A: I can’t recall. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Was it more than one or less? 
         
        A: Yes, more than one. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When did you hear bangs, and when did you hear moans? 
         
        A: First I heard the bangs, but as the object or  
        the person 
         was being pushed against the door, at that same moment, that same person was moaning, so with every bang the person was moaning. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Whilst that was happening did you hear Shane’s voice? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What was his voice saying? 
         
        A: I can’t recall what he was saying but I can just remember that he was swearing a lot and he was just shouting, like in anger. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Do you remember what swear word or words he used? 
         
        A: All I can remember is ‘fuck’, that’s all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did he say that once? 
         
        A: A lot of times. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: In relation to when you heard the banging sounds and the moaning sounds, when was it that you heard Shane swearing and saying those things? 
         
        A: I heard both voices at the same time as  
        the man was being pushed against the door 
         and moaning. I heard Shane’s voice at the same time swearing and shouting, so I heard two voices at the same time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: How long did all of that banging and those voices and sounds go on for? 
         
        A: Five to ten minutes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: During those five to ten minutes where were you? 
         
        A: I was standing behind the door, behind the door, just listening. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Now, you say that the door was shaking, is that right? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
      
    19 No objection was taken to this evidence. Counsel for the appellant cross-examined LB. That cross-examination included the following passages: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: You mentioned that as far as you were concerned there ws some form of banging and pushing,  
        somebody’s head was being pushed up against your door? 
         
        A:  
        Yes 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Now, you were actually on the other side of the door, isn’t it? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So, you didn’t see any of this happening? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So, when you heard these sort of noises  
        you just assumed that somebody was being pushed up against the door 
        ? 
         
        A:  
        Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And it quite easily could have been somebody banging on your door furiously? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You say that you heard banging? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You say that you heard some form of pushing? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: But you didn’t see any of that, that’s what you have said, you didn’t see any of that, did you? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You have said that Shane lived in the unit above you. 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: In that block of flats? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: (Exhibit A shown) If you could turn to photograph 7, it is a photograph of a view looking up the stairs towards the third landing. Now, when you have given evidence and you have said that Mr Partington lived upstairs, you can see he lived in unit 4 and you can see that in that photograph, can you? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And it is the furtherest unit away from – there are two doors, it looks as if there is a ‘5’ on one and the ‘4’ on the other? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: As far as you are concerned, Mr Partington lived in unit 4? 
         
        A: Yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q: In your evidence today you have said that you heard some banging on the door upstairs, yes? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did it sound as if it was coming from that area outside unit 4 upstairs? 
         
        A: Yes, it sounded more towards another landing strip, when you are going downstairs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Can I just ask you this question; once again you are actually in unit 3 behind a closed door and you are hearing the sounds, is that right. 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You say that you heard three or four bangs? 
         
        A: Three 
        
       
       
        
        Q: As far as you were concerned it came from outside of your unit but you think it was upstairs? 
         
        A: Yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And then you say that you heard a travel down, do you remember that in your evidence today? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And if you look at photographs 5 and 6, would you agree with me that photographs 5 and 6 depict the staircase from level 2 down to level 1 where your unit was? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When you heard the travel down did you think it was coming from the direction of the stairs? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You say that you also heard some form of sliding, was that also coming from that same area? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I object in as much as I think that the question and answer, although I will accept it is asked and given, my friend could perhaps put that in context. I am not sure that the sliding noise that was referred to as at the time that my friend is asking the witness about. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Let’s get the witness to answer that one. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: At what stage was this, what was it that you heard first of all? 
         
        A: I heard three loud bangs, noises above me, three times and then I heard an even louder noise which sounded like someone moving furniture, heavy furniture down the stairs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So, the noise was coming down the stairs? 
         
        A: Yes, it was coming down the stairs and then it went silent. 
        
       
       
        
        BETTS: Q: It went silent for a period of time, is that right? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Can I just ask you this about the time; were you looking at any clocks or watches as to the time? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So, it is an estimate. Then after a period of time you heard Shane’s voice? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Screaming and saying, “fuck, fuck, fuck”? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And then you heard four really loud bangs? 
         
        A: Against the door. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Yes? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And your door is wooden, is it not? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: The door frame is made of metal? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What do you think it was made from? 
         
        A; Not from metal. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What do you think it was made from? 
         
        A: I’m not sure, I don’t look at my door. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: It could be made from metal or not, you don’t know, I am talking about the wood frame? 
         
        A: Yes, the metal around it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: It is metal? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: I don’t mean to blind you with science, but the door to your unit 3 is made of wood? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did it have blue paint on the outside when you were living there on 27 August 2004? 
         
        A: Not blue paint, it was a more purply colour. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: A purple paint? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: It has, since 27 August 2004, changed its colour to blue? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What colour is it now? 
         
        A: It is the same colour. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You say that you heard four really loud bangs, is that right? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: The door shook? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And you heard soft moans? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q:  
        You said something about someone going up against the door 
        ? 
         
        A:  
        Yes 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Q:  
        About four or five times 
        ? 
         
        A:  
        Yes 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Once again, you were on the other side of the door and you didn’t see what was happening? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You heard, you say, two voices, is that right? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Isn’t it more accurate that you heard one person moaning and Shane’s voice? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So you then hear Shane shouting and you said it sounded angry, is that right? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Then you say that it went silent after that time? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Then you go and look out of your balcony and you see Mr Partington walking up the drive and turning to his left? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Later on you see him coming back and you say he said something, or you heard him come back and he said something to this person outside of your door? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Now, when you were hearing the bangs outside of the door, your grandmother was with you, wasn’t she? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: In fact, your grandmother was there when there was a sound of banging coming from upstairs, is that right? 
         
        A: She was not with me, she was in her bedroom. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: She came up pretty soon after that? 
         
        A: Yes, as soon as the door shook. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: I am suggesting she came out a little bit earlier when there was a noise on the staircase outside, do you understand what I am putting to you? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Your evidence is there was a banging upstairs and then there was a noise that could have come from coming down, travelling down, I am suggesting she came out of that stretch, out of her bedroom? 
         
        A: No, she was still sitting down listening to the noise. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Where was she sitting? 
         
        A: On her bed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And your grandmother was with you when those banging noises, that you have referred to in court today, were occurring at the door; is that right? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q:  
        And the noises that you say that somebody’s head was going up against the door 
        ? 
         
        A:  
        Yes 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When you heard Shane outside of your door saying, ‘fuck, fuck, fuck’, he was also shouting to get an ambulance, wasn’t he? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: I’m suggesting to you that he was pounding at your door, pounding at the door and shaking the door saying, ‘get an ambulance! Get an ambulance! Fuck, fuck’; do you understand what I’m putting to you? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: That’s what I’m saying was happening at your door. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Q: That is the question. Do you accept that? 
         
        A: No, I don’t. 
        
       
       
        
        BETTS: Q: But you didn’t see it? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You were on the other side of the door? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: With your grandmother? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You’re too frightened to open the door? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Because of the commotion that was going on outside? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You didn’t know what was happening? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And you were too frightened? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
      Application for discharge 
       
      
    20 Although as I have indicated no objection was taken to the evidence and LB was cross-examined counsel later reflected on the events which had occurred. On the following day defence counsel applied for the jury to be discharged. The ground advanced was expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yesterday [LB] gave evidence of assumptions and guesses about what had occurred outside unit 3. It is opinion evidence and is really not admissible. The evidence came out at such a rapid rate and I considered it could have been cured by cross-examination.” 
        
       
      
    21 The trial judge responded that it was difficult to discharge the jury on the basis of evidence to which no objection had been taken. Counsel drew attention to the evidence and said that it was the remark that there was a “push against the door” that she was objecting to. Her Honour responded that she did not understand the application. 
     
      
    22 Ultimately her Honour rejected the application and gave reasons. She concluded that the witness had given evidence of “her assumption” and her Honour said that she proposed “to tell the jury in due course that this was, as the cross-examination has revealed, purely an assumption on the part of LB and it is for them to determine precisely what did happen. In my view there is no basis for the discharge of the jury.” 
     
      
       
      The forensic evidence 
       
      
    23 Both the prosecution and the appellant called forensic evidence which analysed the injuries to the deceased and sought to relate them to the sequence of events which the appellant said had occurred. Dr Botterill who was called by the prosecution said that the scenario put to him by defence counsel was consistent with the injuries of the deceased but “not with the location of the rest of the body”. Dr Botterill continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “It doesn’t explain the extent of the other abrasions around the back of his head, it doesn’t explain the other injuries, but certainly if he were to be rotating and present that part to that area, and there was some way of his body not getting in the way and his neck were sufficiently flexed forward then, yes, it would be consistent. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And if he came off the steps and went straight into that corner and flexed his head and those, causing that fracture at the C2 as well, and causing the lacerations of the head, that would be possible wouldn’t it? 
         
        A: Yes, it’s possible. Again, my reservation is that I can’t see how the rest of the body can have still been there with the floor in place.” 
        
       
      
    24 Dr Botterill conceded that a slightly different scenario, which was put to him by defence counsel, could be consistent with the lacerations observed on the deceased. The suggested hypothesis was that the deceased fell down the stairs, starting turning and hit the door frame which caused a flexing of his neck, leading to the break of C2, followed by him hitting the wall. However, he did not believe the sequence of events was likely. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would be conceivable that if there were some intervening contact, other things were struck on the way down, that that might explain the multiple abrasions and lacerations that are there. But again, to find them only located over the back of the head and the front of the face would be extraordinary for a complex fall. It’s conceivable, as I said, that many of those injuries might be related to such contacts, but to not have them elsewhere on the body would be unusual.” 
        
       
      
    25 Mr Gibson, a biomechanical engineer, called by the appellant gave evidence that it was possible that the injuries that caused the death of the deceased were consistent with a fall down the stairs. He differed from Dr Botterill expressing the view that it would not necessarily be expected that there would be other bruising to the deceased from such a fall. He also said that he could not see how there would be enough force to cause the sort of flexion required to break the deceased’s neck at the appropriate point by banging his head into the top half of the door. When cross-examined he also agreed that there were possibilities other than a fall that could explain the injuries. 
     
      
    26 Professor Hilton, a forensic pathologist was called by the appellant. He agreed that it was possible that the deceased had fallen down the stairs and rotated so that his head came into contact with the door of the unit. He said that the lacerations to the back of the head of the deceased were consistent with the detail of the wall and the horizontal tiles. However, the professor suggested that the multiplicity of abrasions suggested that there was more than one contact. 
     
      
    27 It was ultimately accepted at the trial and during the appeal that the forensic evidence did not enable a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt as to the sequence of events which led to the deceased’s injuries and death. 
     
      
    28 Apart from the injuries which could be observed to the deceased there was evidence of blood stains on the door to LB’s apartment. That stain was on a lower part of the door and had the appearance of being smeared. It was the deceased’s blood but how it came to be on the door could not be determined. It was at a point proximate to where the deceased was found and there was also blood on the floor in this location. There was no other blood on the door or other evidence indicating that the deceased had either, by the actions of the appellant, or otherwise come into contact with the door. In the result the evidence of LB as to what she heard and saw and what she believed had happened was critical evidence in the Crown case. 
     
      
       
      The prosecutor’s address 
       
      
    29 In his final address to the jury the Crown prosecutor acknowledged that there was evidence which indicated that the deceased’s injuries could have occurred in a fall. He accepted that none of the experts were present when the relevant events occurred but emphasised that LB was. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[LB] was there. Sure she’s behind the door, but she was there. And that is a very important thing to bear in mind when you are considering the evidence. What’s its source? If it is [LB] you know it is someone who is listening intently, who was there, separated by whatever the width of the door and the short distance she was away from it was, to what was going on outside the door.” 
        
       
      
    30 Later, in his address the prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, she was behind the door, obviously she didn’t have x-ray vision, but she certainly heard things. She had other senses apart from sight and she clearly was of the impression that there was a punch-on outside the door and also that there was a person being pushed into the door. That’s what she said, that is her evidence to you. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        and you might think four or five loud bangs with a moan in between each bang is entirely consistent with assault, not with a tumble downstairs. Professor Hilton agreed that, yesterday, someone who fell downstairs wouldn’t keep bouncing four or five times against the door.” 
        
       
      
    31 The Crown Prosecutor continued and emphasised that “LB’s evidence was of great importance to the Crown case.” He said “I, throughout this trial, have been asking questions of witnesses, have done demonstrations, just asking questions of somebody’s head being banged against the door.” He emphasised that the Crown case was that the appellant had manhandled the deceased so that he came into contact with the door. 
     
      
    32 He said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Could somebody’s shoulder have bumped the door, could somebody’s knee have bumped the door or banged the door? Possibly. But you have seen the resulting injuries to the head of [the deceased] and you have heard the evidence of those at least being consistent, sure, with a fall is one theory, but with an assault against the door. It is extraordinary to imagine [LB] being wrong about those details. It would be extraordinary, that she has described very clearly and candidly to you these four or five really loud bangs against the door. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, I know that she said that she couldn’t say which part of the top half, but her impression was the head was being banged into the top half of the door. I know that in the demonstration, at least that I was hypothesising and putting to the pathologist, that the angle was toward a lower part so that the back of the head could in fact physically be brought into contact in such a way as to break the neck. Just bear in mind that there may have been other contacts with the door, also bear in mind that [LB] tells you that she was standing right at the door, 10 to 20 centimetres away. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
       
      The directions given by the trial judge 
       
      
    33 The trial judge dealt with the significance of the evidence of LB on more than one occasion. Early in her summing up she emphasised that the prosecution case was dependent on LB’s evidence. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I must tell you this, that the Crown case realistically is entirely dependent upon your accepting that what she (being LB) in fact heard was what she assumed it to be, namely, the accused assaulting the deceased, Mr Gaspardis, by pushing him against the door of her unit or assaulting him in some other very similar manner. Without that evidence the Crown simply cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was an act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased. Indeed the Crown couldn’t establish precisely what act it was that caused the death of the deceased, let alone the intention which accompanied that act. Therefore as a matter of law I must tell you that any finding of guilt against the accused is dependent upon you finding beyond reasonable doubt that what LB heard that evening was what she assumed it was, namely that what she heard was the accused assaulting Mr Gaspardis by pushing him against that door or assaulting him in some other very similar manner. The Crown case is dependent upon you making that finding beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    34 Her Honour told the jury that they were entitled to look at the other evidence in the case including the injuries to Mr Gaspardis. However, she again emphasised that the Crown case was dependent on the jury finding that what LB heard was what she assumed it to be. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But at the end of the day, in the light of the whole of the evidence in the case, I must tell you that the Crown case against the accused is dependent upon you making that finding beyond reasonable doubt that what she heard was what she said she assumed it to be, namely, I will say it once more, I will not say it again, the accused assaulting Mr Gaspardis by pushing him against the door or doing something very similar. Realistically it could only be pushing him against the door because that is precisely what she said she thought it was.” 
        
       
      
    35 Later, in her directions her Honour again emphasised the significance of LB’s evidence and the assumption she had made about what happened. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So that is the first matter relied upon by the Crown, the evidence of [LB]. And I have said to you earlier you need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what she assumed happened in that evidence to have happened did in fact happen. It is an essential plank of the Crown case that that is what happened, that it was the accused who was assaulting Mr Gaspardis by pushing him against the door or doing something else very similar against the door which [LB] heard that evening.” 
        
       
       
      Section 78 of the Evidence Act 1995 
       
      
    36 At the hearing of the appeal the respondent conceded that when LB said “somebody’s head was being pushed up against the door” she was expressing an opinion. Being an opinion s 76 of the Evidence Act would preclude its admission unless permitted by s 78 of the Evidence Act. Section 78 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion expressed by a person if:  
         
         
          
          (a) the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event, and 
           
          (b) evidence of the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person’s perception of the matter or event.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    37 It is apparent that LB made observations of the door and heard noises coming from the outside. Accordingly she could give evidence of her opinion about those events. However, s 78(b) provides that the evidence was only admissible if it was necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of LB’s perception of the events being those events which she saw and heard. I am satisfied that it was not.  
     
      
    38 As is apparent from some previous decisions of this Court s 78 has caused some difficulties. Section 78(a) requires little discussion. In most cases it will be readily apparent whether an opinion is based upon what the witness “saw, heard or otherwise perceived”. However the test in s 78(b) “that the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding” of the witness’s perception of the matter or events can cause difficulties. 
     
      
    39 In Guide Dog Owners and Friends Association v Guide Dog Association of New South Wales (1998) 154 ALR 527 Sackville J at 531 summarised the essential elements of s 78. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Section 78 is concerned only with the non-application of the opinion rule. If evidence cannot be characterised as opinion evidence, neither section 76 nor section 78 of the Act applies: All State Life Insurance Co v Australian & New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No 32) (1996) 64 FCR 73 at 75; Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (No 3) (1998) ATPR 41-612 (Federal Court, Finn J) at 40, 712-40, 713 (a case in which the exclusionary power in section 135 of the Act was exercised) 
         
         
        (2) Section 78 substantially alters the common law, by permitting lay opinion to be given by a person whose opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event. While lay opinion evidence was admissible in certain classes of cases under the common law (see Cross on Evidence (5th Australian edition, 1996) para 29090), section 78 expands the scope for such evidence: R v Panetta (CCA (NSW), 2 October 1997, unreported), at 4, per Hunt CJ at CL  
        
       
       
        
        (3) As foreshadowed by the Law Reform Commission, section 78 should be construed as requiring a rational basis for the opinion before it becomes admissible: R v Panetta, at 5. Such a requirement is imposed through sections 55 and 56 of the Evidence Act. 
         
         
        (4) Section 78 permits the opinion to be admitted without there being evidence of the primary facts upon which the opinion is based, although the absence of such evidence may affect the weight to be given to the opinion: R v Harvey (CCA (NSW), 11 December 1996, unreported) at 5, per Beazley J (another case in which the evidence was excluded on the ground that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect)” 
        
       
      
    40 In R v Leung & Wong (1999) NSWCCA 287; 47 NSWLR 405 Simpson J discussed s 78 in the context of an interpreter, who after listening to the voice of an accused person recorded on a listening device and comparing it with other recordings, gave evidence as to whether it was the accused’s voice on the first recording. Her Honour said that the evidence was not admissible. The witness’s opinion as to the identity of the speaker was not necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the witness’s perception of the voice on the tape (at [34]). Both Spigelman CJ and Sperling J expressly reserved their decision with respect to s 78. They were, as was Simpson J, satisfied that the evidence was admissible pursuant to s 79 of the Act. 
     
      
    41 In R v Van Dyke [2000] NSWCCA 67 this Court considered the admissibility of the evidence of a female witness who said of a male, accused of sexual assault, that he had “a look of wanting on his face” when he looked at girls. Smart AJ who delivered the judgment of the Court decided that the evidence was admissible. His reasons on the point were brief. His Honour said that a look of wanting is a matter of “impression and opinion” making it admissible. I accept that a “look of wanting” is a matter of opinion although, with respect, the fact that a witness holds an opinion does not of itself make it admissible. As it happened in that case the court determined that because of its prejudicial value the evidence should have been rejected pursuant to s 137 of the Act. 
     
      
    42 In R v Harvey (NSWCCA 11 December 1996) this Court decided that evidence from a prosecution witness that she observed an expression on an accused person’s face which she “described as a look of sexual gratification” was admissible. Beazley JA, with the agreement of Smart and James JJ, held that the evidence was admissible pursuant to s 78 because it “satisfies the express terms of s 78.” Her Honour did not elaborate on that statement. There was no discussion as to why the evidence was “necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding” of the witness’s perception of a particular matter or event. This may be because, as her Honour’s reasons suggest, the issue debated on appeal was whether the evidence could be given without evidence of the primary facts upon which the opinion is based. Her Honour said that that evidence was not necessary although again, with respect, the reasoning was not developed. It seems to me that there may be difficulties for a court in determining whether the evidence is “necessary” under s 78(b) unless there is evidence of what the person otherwise saw, heard or perceived. 
     
      
    43 In R v Whyte (2006) NSWCCA 75 the question was whether evidence from a complainant that she had told her mother “a man tried to rape me” was admissible. This Court was divided. Barr J took the view that it was admissible being the reporting of an event and not an opinion. Spigelman CJ held that it was admissible pursuant to s 78, Simpson J that it was not. Their Honours took a different view of the question raised by s 78(b) of the Act. Section 78(a) was satisfied - the opinion was based on what she saw and heard – the more difficult question being whether the opinion was “necessary” as required by s 78(b). 
     
      
    44 The Chief Justice said at [36]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I agree that this exception applies. An opinion of this character is obviously based on what the complainant perceived and, in my opinion, it was, in this case, necessary to obtain an adequate account of that perception. Putting aside the issue of whether it supports the particular of an intent to have penile intercourse, the evidence was necessary to give an “account of [the] perception” that the assault had a sexual purpose. That this perception was significant was indicated in the cross-examination directed to supporting the mother’s version.” 
        
       
      
    45 Simpson J said at [56] and [57]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown advanced an alternative proposition that the evidence was admissible as evidence of the complainant’s opinion. By s76, evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed. There are, however, as with the general prohibition on hearsay evidence, a number of exceptions to this general prohibition. By s78 the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion expressed by a person if the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event, and evidence of the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person’s perception of the matter or event. 
         
         
        The first condition is, in this case, met; if what the complainant said can be properly characterised as an opinion, then it was plainly an opinion or conclusion based upon what she saw, heard and otherwise perceived about the events in question; however, the second criterion is not met. Evidence of the complainant’s opinion is not necessary to obtain (or to give the jury) an adequate account or understanding of her perception of the matters and events in question. S78 does not operate to render the complainant’s statement admissible as opinion evidence.” 
        
       
      
    46 It is obvious that s 78 allows the admission of an opinion in limited circumstances. Not every opinion which a witness forms after being involved in an event is admissible. It will only be admissible if it is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of what the person perceived of the matter or event. If, for example, a witness observed an altercation between two persons and one of them threw a punch a witness could say that he was of the opinion that the punch was thrown with the intention of hitting another. An observer of a person raising their voice could say whether the voice was raised in anger. A witness could give evidence of their opinion of the speed of a motor vehicle or the age of a person. In each case assuming an accurate account of the event is relevant, the witness is able by expressing an opinion about what they observed, to provide an adequate account or understanding of the witness’ perception of the event. However, merely because a person who observed a matter or event forms an opinion about it does not make that opinion admissible. 
     
      
    47 In the present case LB both saw the door and heard noises outside of it. That is the event, or in fact the sequence of continuous events, which she both saw and heard. There was no difficulty in understanding her account of that event. However, she did not see, although obviously she heard, the sounds of the event which was happening on the other side of the door. Although she may have had an opinion, either speculative or an informed guess, as to what was happening outside the door she did not relevantly perceive that event. Her perception was confined to what she could see and hear on the inside. The door deprived her of any capacity to perceive what was happening on the outside. Evidence as to her opinion as to what may have been happening outside the door was not necessary to understand what she perceived from her position inside the room. She was able to give an account of her perception of the event - what she saw and heard - without proffering her opinion as to what she believed was taking place on the other side of the door. It follows that the portions of LB’s evidence identified in the appeal and which I have underlined in the extracts from the transcript should have been objected to and rejected. 
     
      
    48 The situation was exacerbated by the final address by the prosecutor and the directions given by the trial judge. The critical issue was whether the appellant had caused Mr Gaspardis’ death by hitting his head against the door. On that issue the forensic evidence was not determinative. Before the jury could convict the appellant of either murder or manslaughter they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was responsible for the injuries which broke the deceased’s neck. The issue was not as the trial judge suggested whether the jury were satisfied that LB’s opinion as to the events which she heard was correct. Rather than resolve the difficulty identified by defence counsel when she asked that the jury be discharged the trial judge’s earlier directions tended to confirm it. Although the final direction to which I have referred in [35] significantly minimised the problem, to my mind the damage had already been done. 
     
      
       
      Rule 4 
       
      
    49 The respondent submitted that as no objection was taken to the evidence rule 4 applied and leave should be refused. Although it is correct that there was no objection counsel, although belatedly, recognised the serious problem which had arisen and sought a discharge of the jury. To my mind the making of that application although delayed was sufficient to remove the need for leave to be granted in this Court.  
     
      
    50 However, even if I was of the opinion that leave was required I would grant it in the present case. As I have explained the events which occurred outside the door and, in particular, the appellant’s part in them became the critical issue in the trial. The opinion offered by LB was, as her Honour indicated, the critical element of the Crown case. Although counsel did not appreciate, at least initially, that her evidence should not have been admitted and sought to neutralise it in cross-examination, when that effort failed and, after calm reflection, an application for discharge was made. Because of the potential significance of the evidence, which was recognised by both judge and counsel the application should have been granted. The admission of LB’s opinion on such a critical issue compromised the trial. A new trial must be ordered. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    51 In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Appeal upheld and the conviction quashed. 
       
      2. Direct a new trial on the count of manslaughter. 
       
      
    52 GROVE J: In this appeal I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL.  
     
      
    53 The critical issue relates to evidence by LB, the fifteen year old girl who was inside her grandmother’s flat at its wooden entrance door while events were occurring on the other side. The Crown Prosecutor opened to the jury that, after hearing each of a number of loud bumps, she heard a man groaning, although her evidence was that in fact she heard moaning contemporaneously with the bumps. I do not think that anything turns on this discrepancy. 
     
      
    54 The specific evidence which was the focus of the belated application to discharge the jury by reason of the evidence of LB was identified as appearing at transcript 76 lines 14-15 (T137 l20). 
     
      
    55 In chief LB testified: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When did you hear bangs and when did you hear moans? 
        
       
       
        
        A. First I heard the bangs, but as the object or the person was being pushed against the door, at that same moment, that same person was moaning, so with every bang the person was moaning.” 
        
       
      
    56 Prior to this evidence the witness had also testified about the occurrence in giving these responses: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Could you describe, in as much detail as you can, what happened to your door and what other sounds you heard, if any, at that time? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, the door shook for quite a while after it was – it seemed like someone was being pushed against the door because I heard two voices.” (T75 lines 36-42) 
        
       
       
      And: 
       
       
        
        “Q. Can you explain the sequence of sounds that you heard please, the sounds that you heard while you were standing at the door as best as you can recall, the sequence of sounds that you heard, the order and what you heard? 
        
       
       
        
        A As the door was shaking I heard feet shuffling. After that I heard Shane’s – Shane screaming, and then I heard a soft moan as something was being pushed really loudly against the door four to five times.” (T75 Line 55 – T76 – Line 5) 
        
       
      
    57 Then subsequent to the testimony upon which particular focus was placed in the discharge application LB was returned to the subject: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In relation to when you heard the banging sounds and the moaning sounds, when was it that you heard Shane swearing and saying those things? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I heard both voices at the same time as the man was being pushed against the door and moaning. I heard Shane’s voice at the same time swearing and shouting, so I heard two voices at the same time.” (T76 – Lines 34-39) 
        
       
      
    58 It can be observed that, in her evidence in chief LB did not purport to identify a “head” being pushed against the door. This detail had potential significance in the light of medical evidence about the injury which led to death. However, the detail was introduced in questions asked by counsel appearing for the appellant at trial (who did not appear in the appeal) namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You have mentioned that as far as you were concerned there was some form of banging and pushing, somebody’s head was being pushed up against your door? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now, you were actually on the other side of the door, isn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So, you didn’t see any of this happening? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So, when you heard these sort of noises you just assumed that somebody was being pushed up against the door? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it quite easily could have been somebody banging on your door furiously? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say that you heard some form of pushing? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you didn’t see any of that, that’s what you have said, you didn’t see any of that, did you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No.” (T80 – Line 40 – T81 – Line 12) 
        
       
       
      And: 
       
       
        
        “Q. And the noises that you say that somebody’s head was going up against the door? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes.” (T86 – Lines 10-12) 
        
       
      
    59 LB confirmed several times, when asked, that she was on the other side of the door when these things happened and she did not see what she was describing. Obviously she was relying upon her auditory senses. 
     
      
    60 I would perceive the critical question to be whether s 78 of the Evidence Act 1995 is engaged. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “78  
        Exception: lay opinions 
        
       
       
        
        The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion expressed by a person if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) evidence of the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person’s perception of the matter or event.” 
        
       
      
    61 Evidence of what the witness heard was “a head” being pushed against the door would, in my view, express an opinion based upon what was heard and thus only be admissible if the requirements in s 78 (b) had been fulfilled. The reason for that view is that the particularity of identifying “a head” could only emerge from a process in which a conclusion is drawn which is a step in addition to simply recognizing what has been conveyed by auditory senses. To the extent of there being an issue of specifying a “head” pushing against the door I agree with McClellan CJ at CL that s 78 (b) would not be fulfilled. 
     
      
    62 I am less than persuaded that LB’s evidence in chief, in particular the passage relied upon in support of the application for discharge, was opinion evidence. In a broad sense, any statement describing what a person has “seen, heard or otherwise perceived” can be categorized as an opinion, Mental, including deductive, powers do not operate in isolation.  
     
      
    63 In seeking a definition of “opinion”, resort to dictionaries demonstrates that it is word of multiple meanings differing in accordance with context. No doubt this led to the comment on the original opinion rule by the authors of Cross on Evidence (Third Australian Edition) when introducing the topic: 
     
      
       
        
        “This chapter is concerned with a rule of evidence which, on first inspection, has an attractive simplicity: witnesses must state facts, not opinions. But appearances are deceptive. The rule has its origins in an ancient and outmoded verbal usage which itself contains the seeds of confusion.” (p 704) 
        
       
      
    64 I consider the ultimate issue must be on which side of a line of indefinite quality a particular statement lies. As I have said, I consider that it should be recognized that deductive or inferential processes occur in the mind even when the descriptor is speaking de visu et auditu. Without postulating the existence of such a line, it becomes arguable that there is an element of opinion in almost any statement. Obviously when a “bright line” cannot be drawn, there will be scope for debate as to on which side of the line particular circumstances fall but that does not provide a reason to deny the existence of a line. 
     
      
    65 Some aspects which pertain to my perception were discussed by Cox J, in helpful observations in The Queen v Perry (No 4) 1981 28 SASR 119 at 123: 
     
      
       
        
        “It must be accepted, I think, that the difference between a statement of fact and a statement of opinion is not easy to define. Wigmore, indeed, in his usual forthright way, considered that there was no such distinction to be drawn, and he treated what he called ‘this false verbal antithesis’ under the heading of Erroneous Theories ( 
        Evidence 
        , 3 
        rd 
         ed, vol VIII, par 1919). However, the contract between fact and opinion, imprecisely drawn or not, is well established in the law of evidence, and I do not think it is simply to be brushed aside on logical or epistemological grounds. ….Cross, 2 
        nd 
         Aust.ed. (1979) par 16.2, following a long English tradition, treats as an ‘opinion’ any inference from observed facts. A fact is something that a witness has ‘directly observed’. Wills on  
        Evidence 
         (3 
        rd 
         ed. (1938) 150) is to much the same effect. No doubt that distinction works well enough in most cases, but as a universal principle it has, I think, obvious shortcomings. Many simple and practically unchallengeable tests depend upon the drawing of inferences, but the layman as well as the expert treats their results as matters of fact for all that. To say that, merely because an inference is required, we are necessarily in the realm of opinion is, I think, arbitrary and unconvincing. It is unrealistic, for instance, to say that what is denoted by a – let us suppose, unquestionably accurate – speedometer or Geiger counter or hydrometer or radar receiver must be a matter of opinion, not fact. Given the proven accuracy of the instruments used, no one would think of consulting a thermometer and saying, ‘In my opinion, the temperature is now 30 degrees’, or of looking out the window at a weather vane and declaring, ‘In my opinion, the wind is blowing from the north’. Such simple, reliable inferences as those examples require are regarded by everyone as justifying legitimate statements of fact. They do not call for any significant degree of human judgment, and the risk of error is slight.” 
        
       
      
    66 For my part, I consider a statement that a moaning person was pushed against the other side of a door was no more than descriptive of an auditory perception by a witness and whatever deductive or inferential process may have passed through the mind they were essentially inherent and, accordingly, would not fit the concept of being “based upon” something which was heard or otherwise perceived in the conceptual sense legislated in s 78 and relevantly would not constitute “lay opinion”. 
     
      
    67 Nevertheless, I recognize that McClellan CJ at CL is of a contrary view and, in this case, the Crown Prosecutor at the hearing of the appeal expressly conceded that LB was “expressing an opinion”. In the light of that concession and the circumstance that, in any event, the affirmative response of LB specifying that the “head” struck the door (as introduced by the appellant’s counsel at the trial) being in my view an expression of opinion, I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL.  
     
      
    68 R A HULME J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of supplying methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 15 years. He also asked that 8 matters be taken into account on a Form 1.  
     
      
    2 The offence on the indictment related to the supply of 113 grams of methylamphetamine. The Form 1 matters were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) three offences of break enter and steal contrary to s 112(1)  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 (committed on 18 May 2005, 22 February 2006 and 9 March 2006). The maximum penalty for an offence under that section was imprisonment for 14 years; 
         
         
        (ii) one offence of (deemed) supply of 51.4 grams of methylamphetamine on 27 July 2007 contrary to s 25(1)/29  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
        1985; 
         
         
        (iii) two offences of possessing prescribed restricted substances contrary to s 16(1)  
        Poisons & Therapeutic Goods Act  
        1966; 
         
         
        (iv) possession of .02 grams of methylamphetamine contrary to s 10 of  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
        1985; and 
         
         
        (v) dealing in property suspected of being the proceeds of crime ($220 cash and two laptop computers) contrary to s 193C(1)  
        Crimes Act  
        1900. 
        
       
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years 2 months with an additional term of 2 years 4 months. The sentence was made partially concurrent with a sentence of 6 months imprisonment imposed by the Local Court for an offence of driving in a manner dangerous and a sentence of 12 months imprisonment which his Honour imposed for the breach of a s 12 bond. His Honour found special circumstances which reduced the non-parole period from the statutory relationship. The effective overall sentence was imprisonment for 6 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 8 months. 
     
      
    4 The facts found by his Honour were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As at June/July last year the offenders were in a relationship and lived at 14 Mahan Way, Minto, the home. The offenders’ crimes were detected during an authorised control operation that commenced around about 5 June last year. The offence of on-going supply relates to the supply of small quantities of methylamphetamine by the offender Cornell to an undercover officer at her home. The first of those occurred on 18 July last year when the undercover officer came to the home after speaking to the offender on the telephone. She opened the door to his knock, took $50 from him and shortly afterwards handed the undercover officer a small bag of orange paste weighing .3 of a gram and containing methylamphetamine. The undercover officer made his second visit to the home on 20 July. This visit had been arranged during a telephone conversation with the offender. On this occasion the offender Cornell again answered the door and sold him .6 grams of methylamphetamine in return for $100. The final visit, which occurred on 27 July occurred pursuant to arrangements made between the undercover officer and the offender Scheers over the phone. Again the offender Cornell sold the undercover officer .6 of a gram of methylamphetamine for $100. 
        
       
       
        
        On 27 July last year police officers executed a search warrant at the home. Shortly after they entered the home the offender Cornell went to the freezer and opened it. Inside the police saw a container with a blue lid that was emitting a strong odour. Subsequent analysis of the contents of that container revealed that it contained methylamphetamine, the total weight of the substance being 51.4 grams. There is no evidence as to the purity of the methylamphetamine in the mixture. This gives rise to one offence of supply on the Form 1 schedule for each offender. The police also found two notebook computers during the search. Those computers, with $220, give rise to another offence on the Form 1 schedule for each offender. In the lounge room police officers found a notebook recording the sale of drugs by the offenders between 20 June and 26 July last year. This book revealed that, in a hundred and ninety seven transactions during that period, the offenders sold a total of 113.07 grams of methylamphetamine for $12,880. The contents of that notebook in regard to the drug dealing is set out in the short statement of facts in each case. Those particulars are the same in exhibit A1 and A2. They reveal the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          On 20 June nineteen supplies of methylamphetamine had occurred with a total weight of 16.8 grams in return for $1,710. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          21 June, nineteen supplies of methylamphetamine with a total weight of 9.02 grams in return for $1,070. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          22 June seven supplies of methylamphetamine with a total weight of 4.6 grams in return for $430. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          7 July, thirty seven supplies involving a total weight of 15 grams in return for an amount of $1,790. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          9 July, twelve supplies of methylamphetamine weighing a total of 3.15 grams for $460. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          11 July 2007, thirteen supplies weighing a total of 7.5 grams in return for $1,010. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          12 July, nineteen supplies totalling 10.4 grams in return for $1,390. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          13 July, twelve supplies totalling 6.2 grams in return for $430. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          20 July, fourteen supplies weighing a total of 10.7 grams in return for $750. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          21 July, eleven supplies weighing a total of 5.15 grams in return for $670. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          25 July, eighteen supplies involving a total of 13.85 grams for $1,820; and 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          26 July, sixteen supplies involving 10.7 grams in return for $1,340. 
         
        
       
       
        
        These one hundred and ninety seven transactions plus the sale at their home of .65 of a gram of methylamphetamine to the undercover officer for $100 on 5 July give rise to the offence of supply in connection with each offender. 
        
       
       
        
        After the police entered the home the offender Scheers was not cooperative with the police. Contrary to their direction he went upstairs. Once upstairs he refused to drop a syringe that he was holding. After the police sprayed him with capsicum he went into the toilet. The police were forced to break into the toilet to gain access to him. Inside the toilet they found a syringe containing .02 grams of methylamphetamine, forty seven tablets containing Diazepam and eighteen tablets containing Oxazepam. His possession of the tablets and the methylamphetamine give rise to three offences on the From 1 schedule. 
        
       
       
        
        The other three offences on his Form 1 schedule were three offences of break enter and steal he committed on 18 May 2005 at Gymea, 22 February 2006 at Ingleburn and on 9 March 2006 at Macquarie Fields. He was detected in connection with each of these matters after DNA found at the scene had been matched to his DNA. In the main he stole electrical equipment during each of the offences. However during the Ingleburn offence he also stole a bike which the police found on 19 march 2006 in the possession of Scott Cornell, his partner’s son. It appears that this was the only property, the subject of these matters, that was in fact recovered.” 
        
       
      
    5 At the time of sentencing the applicant was within 12 days of his 34th birthday. He comes from a home where both parents abused liquor. They separated during his childhood. He has had only intermittent contact with his father. At the time of his arrest he was living in a relationship which had existed for approximately 4 years by the time he was sentenced. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was a poor learner and left high school during Year 8. He has worked for a short time in a factory and also as a labourer. He fell into criminal activity as the availability of work for him declined. The evidence before the sentencing judge was that the applicant had been on a disability pension for 5 years until the time of his arrest. 
     
      
    7 The applicant commenced abusing liquor in his mid teens although he managed to abstain following his release from prison on an earlier occasion. He began to abuse liquor again in the 12 months before his arrest on the present matter. The applicant also began using cannabis at the age of 15 which has continued. He has abused amphetamines and has used heroin. He has been on and off a methadone program. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and has been prescribed anti-psychotic medication on an intermittent basis. His use of illegal drugs has contributed to his psychiatric problems. 
     
      
    8 The applicant has a lengthy criminal history. His record commences in 1991 when he was about sixteen or seventeen years old with serious motor traffic offences and a break enter and steal offence. From 1991 until his arrest for the present offence the applicant has committed driving offences, break enter and steal offences as well as break and enter with intent offences. The applicant has also committed the offences of possession of prohibited drug, malicious damage, and stealing of a motor vehicle. He has been sentenced to several terms of imprisonment with the most lengthy being four years for the offence of aggravated break enter and steal and commit a serious indictable offence in 2003. 
     
      
    9 The sentencing judge recognised the applicant’s criminal history and concluded that it disentitled him to leniency which would otherwise be available to those who could demonstrate prior good character. 
     
      
    10 The present offence was the first occasion on which the applicant was sentenced for supplying drugs. However, the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant “has a well entrenched pattern of disobedience to the law.” At the time of the present offence the applicant was on bail and subject to a court attendance notice in respect of 3 separate groups of offences relating to various driving matters. 
     
      
    11 The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant’s criminal history, past relapses to drug use and his past attitude to drug use in the context of his mental health “leave the court with nothing other than pessimism as far as his prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending are concerned.” The sentencing judge was satisfied that it would be necessary for the applicant to spend his custodial term in protection. 
     
      
    12 The applicant raised two grounds of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: the sentence is manifestly excessive.  
       
       
      Ground 2: the sentencing judge erred by finding that the applicant “as a well-entrenched pattern of disobedience to the law” by reference to his criminal history. 
       
      
    13 The submission with respect to the second ground of appeal identified the fact that the expression “well entrenched pattern of disobedience to the law” are the words used by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No2) (1987) 164 CLR 465. It was submitted that the criminal history of the applicant, although it is significant, was not sufficiently serious to be described in the manner stated by the sentencing judge so as to justify a longer sentence on the basis identified in Veen (No 2) that retribution, deterrence and protection of the community have a greater role to play in the sentence. It was submitted that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant’s criminal history aggravated the offence since it demonstrated “a well-entrenched pattern of disobedience to the law.” 
     
      
    14 After careful consideration of the sentencing judge’s remarks I do not believe that the suggested error has occurred. The sentencing judge made no reference to Veen and did not suggest that he was using the applicant’s prior criminal history to “aggravate” the offence or to “justify a longer sentence” in the manner suggested. His Honour did, in my opinion, correctly identify that the applicant has a very lengthy criminal history which disentitles him to the leniency which might be afforded those with prior good character. His Honour also, correctly, identified that the criminal history of the applicant, which includes breaches of supervisory orders and continuing lapse into the use of prohibited drugs indicates that he had little prospect of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    15 The submission that the sentence is manifestly excessive was developed by reference to the Judicial Commission statistics for the relevant offence. It was submitted that the sentence imposed on the applicant was at the top of the range disclosed in the statistics placing it in the range of sentences which have been imposed for the more serious offence involving a commercial quantity of the relevant drug. The applicant emphasised that his Honour described the offence as “serious” and falling within the mid range which, it was submitted, could not justify a sentence at the top of the range. 
     
      
    16 This Court has on many occasions emphasised the care with which statistics must be used when considering whether an individual sentence is appropriate for the offence and the offender. They are of considerable assistance in helping sentencing judges to identify the range of sentences which have been imposed for similar offences. However, the longest sentence which has historically been imposed is not the maximum which can or should be imposed. 
     
      
    17 In the present case it was appropriate that his Honour describe the offence as serious and falling in the mid range of objective seriousness. The personal circumstances of the applicant, including the fact that he committed the offence when on conditional liberty, had the consequence that a sentence more significant than may have been imposed for similar offences without these features was required. It was also relevant that his Honour was required to sentence the applicant not only for the offence on the indictment but also for the series of offences, including multiple drug offences which were included on the Form 1. His Honour did recognise the applicant’s early guilty plea and allowed a discount of twenty-five percent. 
     
      
    18 I am not persuaded that his Honour erred or that the sentence imposed was excessive. 
     
      
    19 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
