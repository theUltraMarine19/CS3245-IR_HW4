The writ of 
 habeas corpus ad subjiciendum 
 (`the writ`) is a prerogative writ issued by the courts to ensure the protection of the individual citizen`s right to personal freedom. The right is one that is recognized by the common law and, in Singapore, is guaranteed by art 9 of our Constitution. The writ enables the courts to test the legality of any detention of a citizen and its importance is such that no detention in the land is immune from having its legality tested by it. The importance of the writ carries with it the possibility of abuse and, accordingly, a distinction has historically been drawn between the writ of habeas corpus being a writ that issues as of right and other writs that issue as of course. This appeal concerned and turned upon that distinction.
This appeal was from the refusal by GP Selvam JC to issue the writ against the respondents in respect of the detention of the appellant under s 30 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) (`the CLTPA`). The following facts appeared from the appellant`s affidavit in support of his application (`the appellant`s affidavit`). He joined the Prison Service in 1978 and served as a warder at various prisons, including Changi Prison from June or July 1985 until 2 December 1987. He was first arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (`the CNB`) on 11 April 1988 and his family was informed by a letter dated 19 April from the CNB that he had been arrested on suspicion of involvement in drug trafficking activities. His detention by the CNB was stated to be for the purpose of facilitating investigations. His family sought legal advice and representations were made on his behalf by his solicitors. The representations alleged that his superior officers had been envious of his car and had colluded with several inmates to frame him. He was subsequently released on 28 April and a letter from the CNB to his family on the same day stated that he had been released unconditionally.
After his release, the appellant and his representatives complained to various authorities that his salary had been deducted during the period of his detention and that his special bonus had been withdrawn. Shortly after, on 5 July 1988, the appellant was rearrested for heroin trafficking and he has been in detention ever since. The appellant was informed of the reasons for his detention by a letter from the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs which stated: 
 
I am to inform you that you have been detained under s 30 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act for your involvement in activities of a criminal nature, viz being a heroin trafficker operating at Changi Prison.
 
 
 
This letter was described incorrectly in the appellant`s affidavit as the detention order issued under s 30 of the CLTPA and it was so regarded by the appellant and his solicitors right up to the hearing in the court below.
Representations on behalf of the appellant were made in turn to the CNB, the Member of Parliament for his constituency and the Minister for Home Affairs. The representations repeated the earlier allegations of a frame-up. The Ministry of Home Affairs replied, informing the appellant`s family that the allegations had been investigated by the Criminal Investigation Department (`the CID`) and no frame-up had been found. The family was advised that representations should be made to the Criminal Law Advisory Committee (`the committee`) which would be examining the grounds for the appellant`s detention and making recommendations to the President. The appellant`s solicitors also wrote to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (`the CPIB`) repeating the allegations of a frame-up and asking them to carry out an independent investigation, but the CPIB declined to do so on the ground that the matter was not within their jurisdiction.
The committee met on 14 November 1988 and the appellant was legally represented at the hearing. The committee advised the confirmation of his detention and the President accepted this advice. The appellant was informed, somewhat belatedly, of this on 13 February 1989. His family continued to make representations on his behalf, on the same allegations, to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Home Affairs. The authorities replied, stating that his case would be considered at the committee`s review of his detention in May 1989. His family also wrote to the President again and the President`s office replied, stating that his allegations had already been investigated by the CID and found to be groundless. At the review in May 1989, the committee recommended the continued detention of the appellant.
The appellant`s family then hired private investigators to investigate the activities of former inmates of Changi Prison whom the appellant alleged had framed him. These were (1) Victor Peter Paul; (2) Balan s/o Vengdasalm; and (3) Raja. The appellant alleged that they were involved in drug trafficking activities in Changi Prison and had conspired with his superiors in order to avoid punishment for those activities. The private investigators` report dated 5 September 1990 showed: 
 
 
(1) Victor Peter Paul had told them that Balan s/o Vengdasalm had told him that he (Balan) had to pay the appellant $1,000 for the purchase of drugs; 
 
(2) Victor Peter Paul had no personal knowledge that the appellant was involved in drug trafficking; 
 
(3) after his release from prison, Victor Peter Paul was involved in drug trafficking at his place of work.
  
 
 
The report was sent by the appellant`s solicitors to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Ministry replied on 24 December 1990, stating that they had looked into the matter and had found that the appellant`s allegations could not be substantiated. On 5 April 1991, the appellant`s solicitors wrote to the committee, repeating essentially the same allegations of a frame-up. The secretary to the committee replied, informing the appellant`s solicitors that the representations would be considered at the next review of the appellant`s detention by the committee.
In addition to the allegations of a frame-up, the appellant`s affidavit also gave the following reasons why the writ ought to be issued: 
 
 
(1) he had been unconditionally released on 28 April 1988 after the CNB had conducted some investigations; 
 
(2) he had been denied a trial when other warders arrested for similar activities had been tried in open court; and 
 
(3) there was no ground for suspecting him since he did not own any assets and did not have expensive habits. Moreover, he was a pious and religious man.
  
 
 
At the hearing below, counsel for the respondents supplied counsel for the appellant with a copy of the detention order issued pursuant to s 30 of the CLTPA. No objection was taken either at the hearing below or before us as to the propriety of the order.
The learned judicial commissioner held that the above facts adduced by the appellant failed to show any probable cause that his detention was unlawful. In his view, the contention that the appellant was innocent was irrelevant as the guilt or innocence of a detainee was not the concern of a judge hearing the application for the writ. The judge`s concern was with the legality of the detention and, in the learned judicial commissioner`s view, the documents annexed to the appellant`s affidavit in aid of his application contained substantial evidence to show that he was being lawfully detained. The learned judicial commissioner also summarily rejected the contention that the detention was unlawful because the appellant ought to have been charged under the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal
Before we explain our reasons for dismissing the appeal as we did at the end of the hearing of the appeal, we will deal with a preliminary point regarding the availability of an appeal in applications involving detentions of this nature. In the court below, there was no attempt to determine if this application was in the nature of a civil application or a criminal proceeding. However, the need to make such a determination arises in a critical way on appeal: if the application is a criminal proceeding there is no appeal, whereas there is an appeal if the application is a civil proceeding.
The dichotomy arises from the existence of two different procedures for making an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Article 9 of the Constitution provides, where material: 
 
 
(1) No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law. 
 
(2) Where a complaint is made to the High Court or any Judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained, the Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the Court and release him.
  
 
 
The power to carry out the direction given by this article of the Constitution is expressly conferred by s 18(2)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (`the SCJA`). The article does not, however, set out the procedure to be followed when invoking this power of the High Court. As the learned judicial commissioner correctly observed, applications in civil matters are to comply with O 54 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (`the RSC`) while applications in criminal matters are to comply with s 327 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`). However, while there is no bar to an appeal from an application under O 54, s 335 of the CPC provides that there shall be no appeal from an order directing or refusing to direct the issue of the writ. If then this is a criminal matter, this court, whether sitting as the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal, would have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal as the appellate jurisdictions of the appellate courts as set out in ss 29 and 44 of the SCJA are subject to the provisions of any other written law regulating the terms and the conditions upon which appeals can be brought.
Was this application then a criminal or civil matter? The appellant treated this application as a civil matter in commencing it under O 54 of the RSC and the respondents made no objection. We think that this was correct. There is valuable guidance in this area from the decision of the English appellate courts which have had to wrestle with the phrase `criminal cause or matter` in s 18(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and its equivalent predecessor enactments. The leading authority is the House of Lords decision in 
 Amand v Home Secretary and Minister of Defence of Royal Netherlands Government 
 ,1 in which Viscount Simon LC opined, at p 156, that in determining if a matter is `criminal`: 
 
It is the nature and character of the proceeding in which habeas corpus is sought which provide the test. If the matter is one the direct outcome of which may be trial of the applicant and his possible punishment for an alleged offence by a court claiming jurisdiction to do so, the matter is criminal.
 
 
 
Lord Wright expressed his view as follows, at p 162: 
 
The principle which I deduce from the authorities I have cited and the other relevant authorities which I have considered, is that if the cause or matter is one which, if carried to its conclusion, might result in the conviction of the person charged and in a sentence of some punishment, such as imprisonment or fine, it is a `criminal cause or matter`. The person charged is thus put in jeopardy. Every order made in such a cause or matter by an English court, is an order in a criminal cause or matter, even though the order, taken by itself, is neutral in character and might equally have been made in a cause or matter which is not criminal. The order may not involve punishment by the law of this country, but if the effect of the order is to subject by means of the operation of English law the persons charged to the criminal jurisdiction of a foreign country, the order is, in the eyes of English law for the purposes being considered, an order in a criminal cause or matter ...
 
 
 
In the view of Lord Porter (see p 164): 
 
The proceeding ... must be a step in a criminal proceeding, but it need not itself of necessity end in a criminal trial or punishment. It is enough if it puts the person brought up before the magistrate in jeopardy of a criminal charge ...
 
 
 
We are of the view that the principles set down in 
 Amand v Home Secretary 
 1 should be applied in the present context of determining if an application for a writ of habeas corpus is civil or criminal in nature. Where, as in the present appeal, the allegedly unlawful detention is one under the CLTPA, the essential issue is whether such detention may lead to the trial and possible punishment of the detainee for an alleged offence.
Section 30 of the CLTPA provides: 
 
Whenever the Minister is satisfied with respect to any person, whether the person is at large or in custody, that the person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, the Minister may with the consent of the Public Prosecutor -
 
 
 
 
(a) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be detained in the interests of public safety, peace and good order, by order under his hand direct that the person be detained for any period not exceeding one year from the date of the order; or 
 
(b) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be subject to the supervision of the police, by order direct that the person be subject to the supervision of the police for any period not exceeding 3 years from the date of the order.
  
 
 
Detention under the section is therefore dependent upon the satisfaction of the Minister for Home Affairs: (1) that the detainee has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, and (2) that it is necessary that the person be detained in the interests of public safety, peace and good order. The detention is therefore not punitive in the sense of being for the purpose of punishing a past act of the detainee, but preventive in the larger interests of society. This fundamental distinction between detention and imprisonment is well expressed in the judgment of Ray CJ giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in 
Haradhan Saha v The State of West Bengal & Ors
 
[1974] AIR SC 2754
 at p 2160: 
 
The power of preventive detention is qualitatively different from punitive detention. The power of preventive detention is a precautionary power exercised in reasonable anticipation. It may or may not relate to an offence. It is not a parallel proceeding. It does not overlap with prosecution even if it relies on certain facts for which prosecution may be launched or may have been launched. An order of preventive detention may be made before or during prosecution. An order of preventive detention may be made with or without prosecution and in anticipation or after discharge or even acquittal. The pendency of prosecution is no bar to an order of preventive detention. An order of preventive detention is also not a bar to prosecution. ... In a prosecution an accused is sought to be punished for a past act. In preventive detention, the past act is merely the material for inference about the future course of probable conduct on the part of the detenu.
 
 
 
Similar remarks were made by Dua J in giving the judgment of the same court in 
 Borjahan Gorey v The State of West Bengal 
 3 where the learned judge stated, at pp 2257-2258: 
 
Judicial trial for punishing the accused for the commission of an offence as also preventive security proceedings in a criminal court against a person merely for keeping the peace or for good behaviour under Ch VIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, we may appropriately point out, is a jurisdiction distinct from that of detention under the Act, which has in view the object of preventing the detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial, inter alia, to the security of the state or maintenance of public order. The fields of these two jurisdictions are not co-extensive nor are they alternative. The jurisdiction under the Act may be invoked when the available evidence does not come up to the standard of judicial proof but is otherwise cogent enough to give rise to suspicion in the mind of the authority concerned that there is a reasonable likelihood of repetition of past conduct which would be prejudicial, inter alia, to the security of the state or the maintenance of public order or even when the witnesses may be frightened or scared of coming to a court and deposing about past acts on which the opinion of the authority concerned is based. This jurisdiction is sometimes called the jurisdiction of suspicion founded on past incidents and depending on subjective satisfaction. The jurisdiction for trial or for preventive proceedings under Ch VIII, Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be successfully invoked in such a situation. In other words, a case under the Code of Criminal Procedure, whether punitive or preventive, depends on the proof of objective facts which have already taken place whereas a case under the Act providing for preventive detention depends on the subjective satisfaction of the authorities concerned of the likelihood of the person to be detained to act in future in a manner similar to the one seen from his past acts.
 
 
 
We digress briefly to note that Dua J`s remarks on the validity of detention being dependent on the subjective satisfaction of the authorities would not apply to a detention under the CLTPA in view of the decision in 
 Chng Suan Tze v The Minister of Home Affairs 
 
 & Ors and other appeals 
 .4
The distinction between proceedings under the CPC and preventive detention shows that detention under the CLTPA does not put the detainee in jeopardy of possible trial and punishment for an alleged offence. It is in this narrow sense that the detention is not a criminal cause or matter. In procedural matters, the antifor all practical purposes is between civil and criminal matters: per Lord Sumner in 
 Clifford and O`Sullivan 
 5 at p 586. As the CPC regulates only criminal proceedings under the substantive criminal law (see 
 Mallal`s Criminal Procedure 
 (4th Ed) at p 3 and 
 Manohar and Chitaley on The Code of Criminal Procedure 
 (8th Ed) Vol 1 at p 197), an application for a writ of habeas corpus in respect of detention under s 30 of the CLTPA must be brought under the civil procedure of the Supreme Court and accordingly, the restriction on appeals contained in s 335 of the CPC does not apply.
We are reinforced in our conclusion by the past practice of the courts of Singapore that have dealt with habeas corpus applications arising out of cases of preventive detention by the executive under the civil procedure of the courts: see eg 
 Lee Mau Seng v Minister for Home Affairs, Singapore & Anor 
 ;6 
 Lau Lek Eng & Ors v Minister for Home Affairs, Singapore & Anor 
 ;7 
 Wee Toon Lip & Ors v Minister for Home Affairs, Singapore & Anor 
 ;8 and 
 Chng Suan Tze v Minister of Home Affairs 
 .4 We are aware that the Malaysian courts have reached a different view in 
 Munusamy v Subramaniam & Ors 
 9 and 
 Osman bin Mat Isa & Ors v Superintendent of Prison, Alor Star & Anor 
 ,10 sub nom 
 Zainab bte Othman v Superintendent of Prison, Pulau Jerejak, Penang 
 11 on appeal.
In 
 Munusamy 
 ,9 it was held that an application for a writ of habeas corpus had to be brought under the Criminal Procedure Code as the power conferred by the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 on the High Court to issue such writs was to be exercised in accordance with any written law or rules of court relating to the same, and the Criminal Procedure Code was a written law governing the issue of the writs. The nature of the detention that was challenged in that case does not appear from the report. We would respectfully disagree with the reasoning in that decision if it purports to justify a rule that all applications for a writ of habeas corpus must be brought under the Criminal Procedure Code, as the reasoning ignores the question whether the application for the writ is in respect of a detention to which the Criminal Procedure Code does or does not apply. That question, as we have said, depends on the true nature of the detention and, if the detention is civil, then the Criminal Procedure Code, being a code limited to criminal proceedings, does not apply.
 Osman bin Mat Isa 
 10 concerned a detention under s 4(1) of the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 which allows for detentions by executive order: 
 
If the Minister is satisfied with a view to preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public order it is necessary that the person should be detained, or that it is necessary for the suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence that the person should be detained ...
 
 
 
The learned judge in that case decided the question of the nature of the detention as one of impression and the Indian authorities cited above were not considered. On appeal, the view of the learned judge was approved by the Federal Court again as a matter of impression and without the citation of authority. We would respectfully disagree with the conclusions of those learned judges and hold that applications for writs of 
 habeas corpus ad subjiciendum 
 in Singapore in respect of preventive detentions by executive order should be made under the civil procedure of our courts.
 Writ as of right
We now turn to the substantive issue involved in this appeal. It has been established since Wilmot J gave his opinion to the House of Lords of the English Parliament in 1758 (see 
 Opinion on The Writ of Habea 
s 
 Corpus 
 (1758) Wilm 77, 97 ER 29) that a writ of habeas corpus only issues on probable cause shown by affidavit. The point was again reiterated in 
Ex p Corke
 
[1954] 2 All ER 440
 The reason for the need for probable cause was expressed in the following language by Wilmot J (at p 36): 
 
The reasons of guarding the writ in this manner, I take to be these: there are many kinds of private restraint that are lawful. There was a much greater number formerly. The Reformation opened the doors of religious prisons; and the abolition of military tenures unfettered an unhappy class of men, called villeins, who lived in a state of captivity under their masters.
 
 
 
There are many kinds of restraint that exist at this day; some in the nature of punishments. In domestic government, which takes in the case of husbands, fathers, guardians, and masters, the law authorizes restraints, in order to enforce a performance of those natural, moral, and civil duties, which wives, children, wards, and apprentices, owe to their superiors, in their several relative capacities. These domestic governments could not subsist without such authorities; and therefore all states have endeavoured most anxiously, some in a greater degree, and others in a less degree, to preserve the greatest reverence for them.
The wisdom of our ancestors would not suffer this kind of authorities to be broken in upon wantonly, upon mere suggestion, and without seeing some reason for an interposition; because they saw it would have encouraged disobedience and rebellion in private families; and, at all events, must have abated that awe and respect which act so materially in the support of those authorities. They may be abused: if they are, the law says, let it be shewn, and the party shall have relief; but if he cannot shew they are abused, he is entitled to none. The legal presumption is certainly in favour of these authorities; the law will not presume they are unduly or irregularly executed.
But if these writs were to have issued without any case made, they must have issued indiscriminately, in the cases of lawful restraints, as well as unlawful ones; which would have been levelling all distinction between them, and have been subjecting the authority of fathers, husbands, guardians, and masters, to be canvassed and questioned in the same manner, and upon the same suggestions, as the extravagant outrages of persons acting without any authority at all.
It would have been proceeding upon an inversion of the legal presumption, and would thereby have destroyed all that order, discipline, and subordination in private families, which lead men into a habit of obedience, and dispose them early to obey the laws of their country. ...
There are many other lawful restraints besides those arising under the authorities I have mentioned: All persons who are in custody upon civil process, or under special authorities, created by Act of Parliament, proceeding `civiliter`, and not `criminaliter`, against the persons who are the objects of them:- Persons who are bailed, paupers in hospitals or workhouses, madmen under commissions of lunacy, or confined by parish officers, under the Vagrant Act of 17 Geo II are all under a lawful confinement.
If all these persons were to have had these writs of habeas corpus of course, without shewing any cause or foundation for granting them, it would have been suffering this great remedial mandatory writ to have been used as an instrument of vexation and oppression; it would have become a weapon in the hands of madmen, and of dissolute, profligate and licentious people, to harass and disturb persons acting under the powers which the law had given them. One most frightful instance occurs: the case of a crew performing quarantine. If this writ were to issue of course, it might bring back pestilence and death along with it.
The check upon the writ, by requiring a probable cause to be shewn before it issues, is only saying, `shew you want redress, and you shall have it`: and if a person cannot disclose such a case himself, as to shew he is aggrieved when he tells his own story, and is not opposed or contradicted by any body; it is decisive against his being in such a condition as to want relief.
We are of the view that the reasons continue to remain valid today and are as applicable to a case of preventive detention as they were to the examples cited by Wilmot J.
An application for a writ of habeas corpus is, on the other hand, different from an application for mandamus, prohibition or certiorari under O 53 of the RSC in the sense that the court has no discretion to refuse the writ once probable cause is shown. In 
 R v Governor of Pentonville Prison & Anor, ex p Azam 
 sub nom 
 Azam v Secretary of State for the Home Department 
 ,13 Lord Denning MR stated at p 32: 
 
... If a man can make a prima facie case that he is not an illegal entrant, he is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus as of right: see 
 Greene v Home Secretary
 
[1942] AC 284
, 302 by Lord Wright. The court had no discretion to refuse it. Unlike certiorari or mandamus, a writ of habeas corpus is of right to every man who is unlawfully detained. If a prima facie case is shown that a man is unlawfully detained, it is for the one who detains him to make a return justifying it.
 
 
 
The same point was made in 
 Yeap Hock Seng v Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia 
 14 (at p 282). Any suggestion to the contrary in 
 Re Choo Jee Jeng 
 15 (at p 219) was clearly incorrect.
 The appellant`s affidavit
Before an examination of the facts disclosed by the appellant`s affidavit is embarked upon, it is necessary to have an overview of the relevant provisions of the CLTPA. Section 30, which has been set out above, provides that the Minister must be satisfied of two facts before he can, with the consent of the public prosecutor, order the detention of a person under the Act: the past association of the person with activities of a criminal nature, and that it is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order that he be detained. The order is to be reviewed by an advisory committee within 28 days and the committee reports to the President and makes such recommendations as it thinks fit: s 31(1). The President may then cancel or confirm the order (with or without variations): s 31(2). The detainee detained by the order of the Minister under s 30 may be detained for up to one year. Thereafter, his detention may be extended by the President for periods not exceeding one year at any one time.
The facts adduced by the appellant in his affidavit showed that all these provisions had been complied with. Further, no objection was made to the propor correctness of the detention order. It was clear from the facts adduced that the appellant`s assertions of innocence and of a frame-up had been fully examined by the CID. The private investigators` report had also been considered by the Ministry of Home Affairs. These facts, rather than showing probable cause in the appellant`s favour, indicated that the Minister, the President and the public prosecutor had some objective grounds for ordering the initial and continued detention of the appellant. Indeed, the facts adduced clearly undermined the application.
It was said that the bona fides of the detention was suspect because the appellant had been unconditionally released on 28 April 1988 after the CNB had conducted some investigations. We did not think that the point had any substance for it amounted to saying that an investigative body was bound by its preliminary view of a matter. This could not be correct. The CNB had not, in its letter of 28 April, stated that they had failed to find any evidence that the appellant was not involved in drug trafficking or given any particulars as to why he had been released.
Then it was said that it was not right that the appellant should be denied a trial when other warders arrested for drug trafficking had been charged in open court. This submission ignored the fundamental distinction between preventive detention and criminal proceedings which has been considered above. The authorities cited above show that it is no ground for complaint that a person is detained rather than charged in open court.
The appellant also relied on statements in his affidavit that he was a man of good character. The statements were mere assertions, however, and were not supported by any evidence. Accordingly, they were not of any assistance to his case.
It was for all the above reasons that we dismissed the appeal.
